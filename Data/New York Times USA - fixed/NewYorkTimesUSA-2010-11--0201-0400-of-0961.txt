HEADLINE: Bolstering Its Attack, China Assails Nobel Peace Prize as 'Card' of West

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Accelerating its assault on the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, China denounced the prize on Friday as a political tool of the West, and an official warned that countries acknowledging the honor would ''bear the consequences.''
A commentary in the principal party newspaper People's Daily suggested that Mr. Liu's award was a plot by the United States and other Western democracies that ''fear the rise of China'' and seek to subvert its political system. 
Vice Foreign Minister Cui Tiankai reinforced that critique, calling the prize a ''highly politicized event'' and telling foreign countries they had a stark choice between challenging China's judicial system and developing friendly relations with Beijing, The Associated Press reported.
China's Communist hierarchy has bitterly criticized the award since its announcement nearly a month ago, calling Mr. Liu a criminal and asserting that giving him the award demeans the prize.
Mr. Liu, an author and intellectual who issued a call for democratic reforms in China in late 2008, received an 11-year prison sentence this year for seeking to subvert Communist rule. His wife Liu Xia, under house arrest in Beijing, has invited scores of supporters to attend next month's Nobel ceremony, but few believe the government will allow them or her to attend.
The actions on Friday came on the heels of reports that China had pressured European nations in written demarches to boycott the Nobel ceremony next month in Oslo and to refrain from congratulating Mr. Liu on the award.
China's vigorous reaction to the award has been viewed by many outsiders as an effort to wield its newfound economic muscle to assert its political interests worldwide.
The commentary published Friday said the award was a Western plot modeled on the Nobel prizes awarded to two figures who ''spearheaded'' the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The peace prize was given in 1975 to Andrei Sakharov, the leading Soviet dissident at the time, and in 1990 to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Communist leader whose efforts to reform the Soviet political model helped bring about its collapse.
Those awards exposed the peace prize as ''a political card played by the United States and some European countries'' to weaken regimes that do not meet their standards, the article said.
''Now, it has nothing to do with peace, and even runs in the opposite direction,'' it said. ''It is openly subversive under the name of the people.''
The article argued that the only two Nobel peace prize recipients linked to China -- Mr. Liu and the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan religious leader -- seek to undermine the country's established order.
''Awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo once again reflects the strong attempts of Western countries to intervene in the political process in China,'' the commentary stated. ''It is a well-planned event, premeditated and long organized by Western countries, and is part of a series of actions by the U.S., its allies and companies to undermine China.''
The article was signed Guo Shu, but it was not clear whether that was the real name of the author or, as if often the case, a pseudonym for a work written by a party committee.
In China's second attack on the prize on Friday, Mr. Cui, the vice foreign minister, issued a veiled threat to countries that recognize the award.
''What image do they want to leave for the ordinary Chinese people?'' he asked reporters, according to The A.P. ''The choice is out there, and it will be their own judgment to make their choice.
''If they make a wrong choice, they have to bear the consequences.'' He did not elaborate on the consequences.
The A.P. also reported Friday that a number of European nations had acknowledged receiving China's appeal to boycott the Nobel ceremony in Oslo next month, but those nations nevertheless plan to send their diplomats.

HEADLINE: Hard Times, Sometimes Unvarnished

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
Just as the newly unemployed look back in wonder and dismay at the money they used to squander on shopping sprees and restaurants, viewers in a recession may regret the time wasted on ''Jon & Kate Plus 8'' or ''Keeping Up With the Kardashians.''
What was everyone thinking? 
Those reality characters had little to complain about, except perhaps too many children or too much money -- it's extraordinary in retrospect how much attention was lavished on so little. In the current economy, reality shows like ''Downsized'' on WE TV and ''The Fairy Jobmother'' on Lifetime are trying to redress the balance by focusing on people who have lost their jobs, not just their minds and their manners.
It's a natural progression. Sitcoms like ''Outsourced'' and ''Raising Hope'' have already adjusted to the bad economy by moving to the land of foreclosures, low wages and high unemployment. Reality shows, of course, traffic in fantasy, not truth, and are far less realistic. Still, a few shows have already made the transition.
CBS found a hit with ''Undercover Boss,'' a reality show that disguises business owners and executives as entry-level employees in their own companies, including Hooters and Frontier Airlines; stripped of their jets, limousines and personal assistants, bosses discover just how hard -- and badly paid -- blue-collar labor really is. At the episodes' conclusions, the bosses reveal their true identities and reward the good, simple employees who helped them when they were down-and-out nobodies.
That show focuses on real workers at the companies, but its appeal is that of ancient mythology and folk tales, feeding the all-too-common yearning of humble folk who believe that if only the boss, the sultan or the czar knew how bad things really were, he would step in and fix it.
That show's success doesn't mean reality fans are ready for real life.
''The Fairy Jobmother'' on Lifetime steers clear of too much realism. It's a variation on a proven formula: as on ABC's ''Supernanny,'' a brisk British expert swoops in to help a family in crisis -- but instead of a nanny, she's an employment expert named Hayley Taylor. Ms. Taylor, a hairdresser turned consultant, starred in a hit British reality series of the same title. American producers brought her to do the same in the United States. In the premiere last month Ms. Taylor announced with a bracing British accent, ''It's time to get America back to work.''
And that alone could be problematic -- with so many American consultants out of work, Lifetime imported a foreigner to do the job of helping Americans find jobs. If nothing else, it could drive Arizona to pass an immigration law banning foreign celebrities like Ms. Taylor and Piers Morgan.
The down-on-their-luck families change each episode, but Ms. Taylor's methods don't vary much -- she's part marriage counselor, part life coach, and basically instructs her clients to pull up their socks.
Some of the stories are touching, but the formula is set and stagy. The viewer has no doubt that the episode will end with a job offer and floods of thankful tears.
''Downsized,'' which begins on Saturday on WE TV, is different. It's an eight-episode series that focuses on an Arizona couple, Laura and Todd Bruce, who were each married before and have seven children between them, most of them teenagers. The show has marketed the Bruces as a bear-economy ''Brady Bunch,'' but their story is the kind that shows up on the nightly news more than on family-hour sitcoms.
When they first married, Laura and Todd greased the transition into a blended family with money -- clothes, computers, dinners out and big, fancy houses. The real-estate bubble burst, the economy collapsed, and Todd's construction business was wiped out. Laura's income as a teacher is so small that she says she feels as if she were doing ''volunteer work.'' Their two properties were foreclosed, their credit cards went bust, and now they can barely make the rent.
The children are quite stoic about the sudden reversal of fortune, but the burden is spread unequally. Todd's daughter Heather, 17, receives money and even a new car from her mother, whom she sees on weekends, whereas Laura's daughter Bailey, also 17, works part time and can't afford to go to the prom. As the parents struggle to avoid eviction, the children pitch in, selling prized possessions and rooting through Dumpsters for returnable cans and bottles.
There is no fairy jobmother rushing to the rescue: when Todd and Laura visit a financial adviser, he is brutally frank, ordering them to get rid of all luxuries, including cable television and premium coffee.
The series is filmed with a documentary-style simplicity that is very different from souped-up and stylized reality shows like ''Jersey Shore'' or ''The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.'' This narrative unfolds with an unvarnished candor that is closer to what the Loud family displayed in ''An American Family,'' the landmark 1973 PBS series.
It's impossible not to root for the Bruce family. But it's just as hard not to dread the series's success. Reality shows by their nature denature their stars; America watched slack-jawed as Jon and Kate Gosselin, the seemingly down-to-earth parents on ''Jon & Kate Plus 8'' turned into narcissistic freaks.
Todd and Laura have serious money trouble, and their children have more than their fair share of stress, but fame, at least the kind meted out by reality television, would be far more destructive.

HEADLINE: Exporting Our Way to Stability

BYLINE: By BARACK OBAMA. 
Barack Obama is the president of the United States.

 BODY:
AS the United States recovers from this recession, the biggest mistake we could make would be to rebuild our economy on the same pile of debt or the paper profits of financial speculation. We need to rebuild on a new, stronger foundation for economic growth. And part of that foundation involves doing what Americans have always done best: discovering, creating and building products that are sold all over the world.
We want to be known not just for what we consume, but for what we produce. And the more we export abroad, the more jobs we create in America. In fact, every $1 billion we export supports more than 5,000 jobs at home. 
It is for this reason that I set a goal of doubling America's exports in the next five years. To do that, we need to find new customers in new markets for American-made goods. And some of the fastest-growing markets in the world are in Asia, where I'm traveling this week.
It is hard to overstate the importance of Asia to our economic future. Asia is home to three of the world's five largest economies, as well as a rapidly expanding middle class with rising incomes. My trip will therefore take me to four Asian democracies -- India, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan -- each of which is an important partner for the United States. I will also participate in two summit meetings -- the Group of 20 industrialized nations and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation -- that will focus on economic growth.
During my first visit to India, I will be joined by hundreds of American business leaders and their Indian counterparts to announce concrete progress toward our export goal -- billions of dollars in contracts that will support tens of thousands of American jobs. We will also explore ways to reduce barriers to United States exports and increase access to the Indian market.
Indonesia is a member of the G-20. Next year, it will assume the chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- a group whose members make up a market of more than 600 million people that is increasingly integrating into a free trade area, and to which the United States exports $80 billion in goods and services each year. My administration has deepened our engagement with Asean, and for the first eight months of 2010, exports of American goods to Indonesia increased by 47 percent from the same period in 2009. This is momentum that we will build on as we pursue a new comprehensive partnership between the United States and Indonesia.
In South Korea, President Lee Myung-bak and I will work to complete a trade pact that could be worth tens of billions of dollars in increased exports and thousands of jobs for American workers. Other nations like Canada and members of the European Union are pursuing trade pacts with South Korea, and American businesses are losing opportunities to sell their products in this growing market. We used to be the top exporter to South Korea; now we are in fourth place and have seen our share of Korea's imports drop in half over the last decade.
But any agreement must come with the right terms. That's why we'll be looking to resolve outstanding issues on behalf of American exporters -- including American automakers and workers. If we can, we'll be able to complete an agreement that supports jobs and prosperity in America.
South Korea is also the host of the G-20 economic forum, the organization that we have made the focal point for international economic cooperation. Last year, the nations of the G-20 worked together to halt the spread of the worst economic crisis since the 1930s. This year, our top priority is achieving strong, sustainable and balanced growth. This will require cooperation and responsibility from all nations -- those with emerging economies and those with advanced economies; those running a deficit and those running a surplus.
Finally, at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Japan, I will continue seeking new markets in Asia for American exports. We want to expand our trade relationships in the region, including through the Trans-Pacific Partnership, to make sure that we're not ceding markets, exports and the jobs they support to other nations. We will also lay the groundwork for hosting the 2011 APEC meeting in Hawaii, the first such gathering on American soil since 1993.
The great challenge of our time is to make sure that America is ready to compete for the jobs and industries of the future. It can be tempting, in times of economic difficulty, to turn inward, away from trade and commerce with other nations. But in our interconnected world, that is not a path to growth, and that is not a path to jobs. We cannot be shut out of these markets. Our government, together with American businesses and workers, must take steps to promote and sell our goods and services abroad -- particularly in Asia. That's how we'll create jobs, prosperity and an economy that's built on a stronger foundation.

HEADLINE: Pending Home Sales Dropped 1.8% In September

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of people who signed contracts to buy homes fell in September after two months of gains.
The National Association of Realtors said on Friday that its index of sales agreements for previously occupied homes dropped 1.8 percent in September, to a reading of 80.9. Contract signings fell in every region of the country except the West. 
In a second report, the Federal Reserve said that consumer borrowing increased in September for the first time since January even though the category that includes credit cards dropped for a record 25th consecutive month. Consumer credit increased at an annual rate of $2.1 billion in September, the Fed said, after having fallen at a rate of $4.9 billion in August. It was only the second increase in the last 20 months.
For September, revolving credit, the category that includes credit cards, fell for a record 25th consecutive month, dropping by an annual rate of $8.3 billion, or 12.1 percent.
The category that includes student loans and auto loans rose by $10.4 billion, or an annual rate of 7.9 percent.
The $2.1 billion rise in overall borrowing pushed consumer debt to a seasonally adjusted $2.4 trillion in September, down 2.9 percent from where consumer credit stood a year ago.
The results on the home sales highlighted the continuing problems facing the industry as it struggles to mount a sustained recovery from the recession. Many economists had expected a 3 percent increase. The index offers an early measurement of sales activity. There is usually a one- to two-month lag between a sales contract and a completed deal.
A reading of 100 indicates the average level of sales activity in 2001, when the index started. The reading was above the 100 threshold from March 2003 through April 2007 and then sank as the country fell into recession.
By region, the pending home sales index slipped 1.7 percent in the Northeast in September compared with August and was down 28.3 percent from September 2009.
In the Midwest, the index fell 5.7 percent from the previous month and was down 33 percent from a year ago.
In the South, the index fell 3.5 percent from a month earlier and is 19.1 percent below the year-ago level.
Only the West saw an increase in pending home sales in September, a rise of 3.5 percent from August. But even with the increase, pending sales were 24.7 percent lower than September 2009.

HEADLINE: Economic Boom for TV Stations

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
It wasn't just your imagination: there really was an uptick in political ads this year.
''Last month, American TV viewers were exposed to almost 1.48 millionpolitical ads, up from the 1.41 million political ads aired in October2008,'' the last major election year, The Nielsen Company reportedon Friday. 
Nielsen called it ''the largest political ad output on record in whatis traditionally known as the busiest month of the year for politicalmessaging.'' The ad exposures reflect the high number of competitiveraces across the country and expenditures by outside groups,particularly on the Republican side.
As The New York Times reported earlier this week, some viewers wereturned off by the constant noise of attack ads. Where was that noisethe loudest? Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, where competitive races for governor and the Senate spurred a huge amount of campaign adspending. Nielsen found that more than 23 percent of all paid ads onlocal stations in October were ''placed by a political candidate oroutside political group.'' On local newscasts, that percentage was muchhigher.
In Cleveland, the most-saturated market overall, political ads wereplayed 29,689 times, according to Nielsen.
There were two other markets, Portland, Ore., and Sacramento,Calif., where the percentage of political ads on local stationstopped 20 percent. In another 74 local markets, more than 10 percentof all television ads in October were political ads.
Nielsen's market-by-market data is available on its Web site.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Many Single Mothers Have a Live-In Partner, Census Bureau Finds

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
More than a quarter of the unmarried women who gave birth in a recent year were living with a partner, according to a Census Bureau report that for the first time measured the percentage of unmarried mothers who were not living alone.
''Everybody tends to think of single mothers as being alone with their child, and we wanted to look at whether that was true,'' said Jane Dye, the demographer who wrote the report, ''Fertility of American Women: 2008.'' ''We found that 28 percent of these women were living with an unmarried partner, whether opposite sex or same sex.'' 
While cohabitation has increased enormously over the last generation, the catchall category of ''single mother'' has often blurred the difference between those living alone and those living with a partner.
But recently, the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey, one of the sources for the fertility report, added a question on cohabitation to make it possible to measure how many new mothers were actually on their own.
Cohabitation is now widely used as a transitional stop en route to marriage. According to a National Center for Health Statistics study released in February, about half of cohabiting couples marry within three years, and about two-thirds within five.
Pamela J. Smock, director of the Population Studies Center at the University of Michigan, said many people delayed marriage until they had achieved a basic level of economic security.
''Economic situations really matter for people getting married,'' she said. ''Many people say they will not get married unless they can have a wedding and a savings account, but they might have a child in a cohabiting relationship. That's become almost a mainstream way of starting a family, with less stigmatization than even 10 years ago.''
Andrew Cherlin, a demographer at Johns Hopkins University, and Ms. Smock said they were surprised that the number of mothers living with a partner was not higher, since previous estimates had put it at around half of unmarried mothers.
''Cohabitation until recently was invisible in government reports,'' Mr. Cherlin said. ''It's data we need. If we're concerned about stable environments for children, we have to know whether we should be focusing our efforts on helping cohabiting couples keep their relationship together, or whether we're talking about unmarried teen mothers who are on their own.''
According to the Census Bureau report, released Thursday, unmarried women made up 1.5 million of the 4 million women ages 15 to 44 who gave birth between June 2007 and June 2008.
The report also found that the proportion of mothers of newborns who were in the labor force had increased to 61 percent in 2008, from 57 percent in 2006. Similar studies have shown that the percentage of working mothers with newborns rose to a peak of 59 percent in 1998 and then declined, but that it has lately been rising close to peak levels.
Nationwide, the report found, 6 percent of mothers with newborns were unemployed but looking for work in 2008, down from 6.9 percent in two years earlier.
''With the recession, it seems like new mothers are pitching in and working when they otherwise might not,'' Ms. Dye said.
The report also looked at the effects of women's increasing educational attainment on their childbearing. Women who continued their education into their 20s experienced lower fertility levels at younger ages but higher fertility at older ages, once they completed their education.
According to the fertility report, which is published every two years, 18 percent of all women ages 40 to 44 in 2008 were childless, down from 20 percent in 2006 but still far higher than the 10 percent in that age group who were childless in 1976.
By the time women reached their 40s, the report found, they had averaged 1.9 births, a substantial decline from the 3.1 births such women averaged in 1976, when the Census Bureau began collecting fertility data.
Nationally, one in four mothers who recently gave birth lived in poverty in 2008. About 20 percent of the women who gave birth during the year were foreign-born, the report found.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 15, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Saturday about a Census Bureau report that for the first time measured the percentage of unmarried mothers who were not living alone misstated, in some copies, the name of a university in Baltimore where Andrew Cherlin is a demographer. He is at Johns Hopkins, not John Hopkins.

HEADLINE: China Blusters On

 BODY:
There's apparently no limit to China's arrogance, not to mention its tone-deafness. According to The Times's Michael Wines, China this week formally asked European nations to boycott the Oslo ceremony where the Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded -- in absentia -- to the imprisoned Chinese democracy activist, Liu Xiaobo. 
All governments should make it a point next month to send representatives.
The Chinese government is hungry for clout and respect. But bullying its own people and other governments (recently halting shipments of rare earth minerals to Japan in a territorial dispute) are unacceptable and won't produce either. China first tried to bully the Nobel committee, warning that the award could harm relations with Norway, where the committee is based. The committee, rightly, was not intimidated.
China had dispiriting success, however, with the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. In a meeting this week with President Hu Jintao of China, Mr. Ban shamefully failed to raise Mr. Liu's unjustified imprisonment and China's poor human rights record.
French officials said the issue of human rights did come up when President Nicolas Sarkozy of France met Mr. Hu later in the week in Paris. It was unclear whether Mr. Liu's case was addressed. When President Obama and other world leaders meet with Mr. Hu in Seoul next week during the meeting of the Group of 20 leading economies, they must press for Mr. Liu's release.
The result of enabling Beijing was on full display Friday. China's ruling Communist Party denounced the Peace Prize as a ''political card played by the United States and some European countries'' that, it said, ''fear the rise of China'' and seek to subvert its system. Cui Tiankai, a vice foreign minister and G-20 negotiator, warned that countries attending the award ceremony would ''have to bear the consequences.''
Mr. Liu, a 54-year-old scholar, writer, poet and social commentator, is the first Chinese to win the Nobel Peace Prize. His courage and his peacemaking credentials are beyond reproach. During the 1989 pro-democracy protest in Tiananmen Square, he staged a hunger strike, then negotiated a peaceful retreat of student demonstrators as thousands of soldiers stood by with rifles drawn.
Since then, he has refused to be silenced despite being repeatedly detained. His current 11-year jail sentence on spurious subversion charges is punishment for helping write Charter 08, an Internet manifesto calling for democratic reforms and an end to the Communist Party's monopoly on power.
China's blustering is one more reminder of how out of touch Beijing's autocrats really are. And of why China needs more freedom.

HEADLINE: Panel Offers Ways to Raise Cash to Cope With Climate

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS -- After grappling with a fundamental deadlock between rich and poor nations over climate change, a high-level United Nations panel on Friday proposed a smorgasbord of ways to raise $100 billion annually to help developing countries cope with global warming.
The standoff over who should pay the bill for environmental degradation has bedeviled efforts to forge an international agreement to address climate change. The panel did not fully answer the question, but said potential revenue sources included raising up to $10 billion from some manner of tax on airline flights and international shipping, $10 billion from a tax on financial transactions and $10 billion taken from the fuel subsidies provided by some developed nations. 
The solutions face considerable hurdles, not least the United States' resistance to putting a market price on carbon emissions, a cornerstone of the panel's report.
''We have narrowed down the different options,'' Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg of Norway, co-chairman of the panel, said in an interview. ''We have not made a blueprint where we solve all issues related to climate financing.''
International leaders agreed at the contentious meeting in Copenhagen in December that the developed world would come up with $100 billion a year by 2020 to help alleviate the affects of climate change in the developing world. But there was little consensus on where the money would come from, particularly during an economic crisis.
The attitude of the developing nations was that the industrialized world caused the pollution, so the richer states should cut a check for reparations and another check to help pursue clean development. The richer nations balked at the prospect.
Some of those differences remain in the report: the developing world thinks the financing should come in the form of public aid, whereas the developed world wants to rely heavily on private investment, for example. The differences were indeed on display during the release of the report.
''As Africans, we've contributed virtually nothing to the environmental mess our planet is in,'' said Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia, the other co-chairman, addressing a news conference by video link from his country. ''The prospects for sanity and justice do not appear good, but I refuse to give up.''
Among other things, the money would be needed to improve irrigation and other agriculture methods affected by changing climate, to bolster coastlines threatened by rising seas or to preserve forests that help absorb greenhouse gases.
Mr. Stoltenberg said that he did not expect the panel's recommendations to be endorsed wholesale at the climate change talks next month in Mexico, but that they should help move the process forward and perhaps lay the foundation for an international fund for potential revenues.
Environmental advocates endorsed the findings as a sign that the deadlock over financing could be resolved, if not immediately. ''It shows that you can raise the money,'' said Steve Howard, the founder of the Climate Group, an organization pushing for a climate change agreement. ''It shows that climate finances are firmly on the table.''
The 21-member United Nations panel included Lawrence H. Summers, the White House's departing national economics adviser; the billionaire financier George Soros; Ernesto Cordero Arroyo, the finance minister of Mexico; and Christine Lagarde, the French economic minister.
Both the panel leaders and the advocates say the next challenge will be generating the political will to follow suggestions like levies on international transportation that airlines and shipping companies of richer nations would have to pay
But not every nation has to agree on every suggestion, Mr. Stoltenberg said, and advocates praised the panel for at least producing ideas. ''They have laid out a menu,'' said David Waskow, a senior adviser on climate change for Oxfam. ''What governments and political leaders need to do now is to take items off that menu and create a meal.''

HEADLINE: HSBC Says Recovery in Emerging Markets Is Weakening

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- HSBC, Europe's biggest bank by market capitalization, said Friday that its earnings rose in the third quarter but warned that the economic recovery in emerging markets was losing some steam. 
The chief executive, Michael Geoghegan, said there were likely to be ''some bumps in the road ahead'' in developing countries, especially in China. HSBC generates most of its earnings growth in Asia.
''Our latest data from emerging markets points to a slowdown in the rate of recovery,'' he said in a statement. But the bank added that it still expected growth in the region to outpace that of the developed world for the foreseeable future.
HSBC said pretax profit in the third quarter was ''well ahead'' of the period a year earlier, as money it set aside to cover bad loans reached its lowest quarterly level since early 2007. Its lending business in the United States accounted for the biggest share of improvements, it said. Business in October was ''in line with third-quarter trends,'' HSBC said. HSBC does not give detailed earnings figures for the quarter.
Royal Bank of Scotland also reported lower provisions for bad loans in the third quarter. The bank, which is majority-owned by the British government since a bailout, narrowed its loss to $:1.15 billion, or $1.86 billion, in the third quarter, from $:1.8 billion in the same period a year ago.
Loan impairments fell 40 percent, to $:1.95 billion, as the quality of loans, especially in the retail and commercial banking division, improved. Record low interest rates set by the Bank of England and an economic recovery allowed more clients to stick to their loan payments.
Stephen Hester, the chief executive, has been reducing costs and selling assets to return the bank to profit and repay the government aid.
The bank said it was ''well positioned'' to meet any new regulatory requirements for capital.
Ian Gordon, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas in London, said Royal Bank of Scotland's figures were a ''mixed bag,'' offering some ''good news on impairments'' but ''very weak revenues'' at its investment banking operation.
Revenue at the bank's securities unit dropped 20 percent, to $:1.55 billion. The investment banking unit of HSBC also reported a drop in trading. HSBC said performance of the business was ''robust although trading activity was lower.''
Mr. Geoghegan, who is to be succeeded later this year by the investment banking executive Stuart Gulliver, gave a positive outlook for the rest of the year, saying that ''the global economy is in better shape than many expected a year ago.'' But he also said that ''while fears of a double dip in the West may be overplayed, the passage from downturn to upturn is clearly taking longer than previous cycles.''

HEADLINE: Debunking the Myths of the Midterm

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER. 
Megan Thee-Brenan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Every election develops its own mythology, usually before the official results are even certified, and this week's was no different. And like all mythology, the narrative that is being woven around the midterm elections by Bulfinches from both parties is a blend of history, facts and, yes, myths.
Before it hardens into accepted fact, some of the new conventional wisdom might benefit from one more spin on the potter's wheel:
Return to the Republican Fold 
Haberdashers who sell those ties with the little elephants on them may not want to order more just yet. There is no denying the powerful wave that swept Republicans back into power in the House, won them seats in the Senate and helped them rout Democrats in statehouses around the country. But even as they were electing Republicans in huge numbers, a majority of voters said they had an unfavorable view of the Republican Party. In fact, there was little difference in how voters viewed the two parties: 53 percent said they had an unfavorable opinion of the Democratic Party, and 52 percent said they had an unfavorable opinion of the Republican Party.
The Sweeping Mandate
Both political parties would do well to beware the mythological creature that often surfaces immediately after Election Day: the Mandate.
To hear many Republicans tell it, the huge surge that won them control of the House was a clear referendum: an anti-Obama, anti-health care law, anti-government spending mandate.
''The statement made by the American people this week was a repudiation of Washington; a repudiation of Big Government; a repudiation of politicians who refuse to listen to the American people,'' Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio wrote Thursday in a letter asking his fellow House Republicans to make him the next speaker. ''The people have been clear: the job-killing spending binge in Washington must end, and Congress must change.''
Often such sweeping mandates do not turn out to be so sweeping. It was only 24 months ago, after all, that Democrats divined a very different mandate in the election that made Barack Obama president and strengthened their majorities in Congress. ''This is a mandate,'' Gov. Bill Richardson, a New Mexico Democrat, said at the time. ''So the issues of health care reform, energy independence, rebuilding the economy, getting out of Iraq -- I think he's going to have the American people significantly behind him.''
Even as recently as May 2009, Time magazine felt confident enough to put a G.O.P. elephant on its cover with the headline ''Endangered Species.''
But American voters rarely speak with an unambiguous voice. Consider the question of so-called Big Government, which, if exit polls are to be believed, voters have contradictory feelings about. A majority agreed that the government was doing too many things that are better left to businesses and individuals. But voters were fairly evenly divided on what many Republicans made Exhibit A in their case that the Obama administration had overreached: the new health care law. The exit polls found that 47 percent of voters said Congress should leave the law as it is or expand it, and that 48 percent said Congress should repeal it. Not exactly a ringing mandate for repeal.
Voters were also divided on questions of taxing and spending. When people were asked what the highest priority of the next Congress should be, 37 percent said ''spending to create jobs,'' which was only slightly behind the 39 percent who said ''reducing the budget deficit.'' And only four in 10 voters said they wanted Congress to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for everyone, including families who earn more than a quarter of a million dollars a year, as the Republicans want to do.
Ultimately, said Curtis Gans, the director of the Center for the Study of the American Electorate at American University, the mandate in this election may have been essentially the same as the one in the election that sent President Obama to the White House. ''The mandate,'' Mr. Gans said in an interview, ''was go in a different direction and make it a better country.''
The Lost Youth Vote
Have the Democrats lost the young?
Two years ago, the Obama campaign galvanized young voters, and they turned out and helped elect Democrats around the country. This year, voters under 30 were the only age group in which a majority voted for the Democrats, but relatively few of them bothered to show up on Tuesday. But that does not mean young voters are forever lost. Young voters are among the most transient and tend to sit out midterm elections. This year was no different.
Young voters did make up a decidedly smaller portion of the electorate this year: 11 percent, down from 18 percent in 2008, when many turned out for the presidential election. But their turnout this year was not much different from their turnout in the last midterm elections, in 2006, when 12 percent of the voters were under 30.
A Disaster for the President
Mr. Obama himself called the big Republican gains a ''shellacking.'' The Republican gain of at least 60 seats in the House was the biggest for any party since President Harry S. Truman was in office. And a majority of those who voted Tuesday said that they disapproved of the way Mr. Obama was handling the job, and that his policies would hurt the country in the long run.
Still, there were a few faint silver linings for Mr. Obama, as the 2012 presidential election begins.
For one thing, he does not seem to own the economic downturn -- yet. When voters were asked who was most to blame for the current economic problems, 35 percent said Wall Street bankers, 29 percent said President George W. Bush and 23 percent said Mr. Obama.
And despite what politicians, political analysts and pundits have been saying for weeks, if not months, most of the voters themselves claimed that the election was not a referendum on the president. A minority of the voters -- 37 percent -- said that expressing opposition to Mr. Obama was a factor in their vote, but an equal number said that the president was not a factor in their votes at all. Nearly a quarter said they voted the way they did in part to express support for the president.
The Pundits Have a Clue
The Polish philosopher Leszek Kolakowski, below, in what he called the law of the infinite cornucopia, stated that there was never a shortage of arguments to support any doctrine one wanted to believe in for whatever reasons. This law is well known, if not by name, in political spin rooms and on talk shows, and is likely to continue to get quite a workout. Of course, a strong argument could also be made that nothing like that will happen at all.

The Tea Party, with rallies like the one below in October, in Pasadena, Calif., drew widespread support for a different view of Mr. Obama. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY DAMON WINTER/THE NEW YORK TIMES

HEADLINE: Banks Brace for Long, Costly Fights Over Mortgage Mess

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ
8:14 p.m. Updated Even as investors put aside their worries on Friday about the effect of the foreclosure mess on bank stocks, new signs emerged of what is likely to be a long and expensive legal battle for the financial services industry over mortgages gone bad.
Citigroupdisclosed in a regulatory filing that it was being sued by several investors, including Charles Schwab and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, in an effort to force Citigroup to buy back soured mortgages that the investors contended did not conform to proper underwriting standards. 
Meanwhile, Wells Fargosaid in a filing that it ''cannot estimate the possible loss or range of loss'' from these cases, and Bank of Americasaid in a filing that investors holding $375 billion worth of mortgage securities had filed similar suits.
In a separate announcement, however, Bank of America said a lawsuit brought by the Maine State Retirement System and other investors was dismissed on Thursday by a federal court in California, reducing that $375 billion figure to $54 billion. But that news came after the S.E.C. filing had already been prepared.
The dismissal is a significant victory for Bank of America and underscores the legal challenges in trying to force banks to buy back defaulted mortgages.
''The court's ruling demonstrates the strict legal hurdles plaintiffs face in bringing these sorts of claims,'' said Brian E. Pastuszenski, counsel for Bank of America's Countrywide unit.
Still, Bank of America faces a different effort by other investors, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Pimco, the giant money management firm, to force it to buy back a portion of roughly $47 billion in mortgages they hold. Neither the $375 billion nor the $54 billion figure reflects this push, because those investors have yet to sue.
On Thursday, Bank of America's lawyers sent a strongly worded letter to the lawyer leading the $47 billion effort, rejecting her claims as ''utterly baseless.'' The bank contends the any loss of value stemmed from the economic downturn rather than an underlying problem with how the mortgages were sold to investors or have been serviced.
Bank of America and other large institutions like JPMorgan Chase and GMAC Mortgage have been criticized for pursuing foreclosures without the proper paperwork or with signatures by so-called robo-signers.
But on Wall Street, the worry is that efforts to force the banks to buy back defaulted mortgages could actually be a longer and more expensive fight for the industry. Some analysts estimate the eventual cost could total tens of billions of dollars, and that worry pushed down shares of the big banks sharply last month.
Indeed, Bank of America's chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, has signaled that the threat of forced buybacks will not be resolved quickly - or cheaply.
''It's loan by loan, and we have the resources to deploy in that kind of review,'' he said last month, during a conference call to discuss the bank's financial results for the third quarter. ''We'd love never to talk about this again and put it behind us, but the right answer is to fight for it.''
Despite the disclosures, bank stocks rallied for the second day in a row. Bank of America shares closed up 23 cents, at $12.36, while Citigroup rose 16 cents, to $4.49, and Wells Fargo jumped $1.76, to $29.22.

HEADLINE: Tone-Deaf In D.C.

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
It would be easy to misread the results of Tuesday's elections, and it looks as if the leaders of both parties are doing exactly that.
Neither the Democrats nor the Republicans are offering voters the kind of change that they seem so desperately to want. We're getting mind-numbing chatter about balanced budgets and smaller government and whether Mitch McConnell and his gang can chase President Obama out of the White House in 2012.
What voters want is leadership that will help them through an economic nightmare and fix a country that has been pitched into a state of sharp decline. They long for leaders with a clear and compelling vision of a better America and a road map for getting there. That leadership has long been AWOL. The hope in the tumultuous elections of 2008 was that it would come from Mr. Obama and the Democrats, but that hope, after just two years, is on life support. 
Tuesday's outcome was the result of voters, still hungry for change, who either switched in anger from the Democrats to the Republicans or, out of a deep sense of disappointment, stayed home.
It was hardly a mandate for the G.O.P.'s way of doing things. Nearly 15 million Americans are out of work. The public does not want the next two years to be a bitter period of endless Congressional investigations of the Obama administration; more tax cuts and other giveaways to the very wealthy; and attacks on programs like Social Security, Medicare and unemployment insurance that offer at least a measure of economic security for ordinary people.
It would also be a mistake for the Democrats, a terminally timid party, to cave in to their opponents and start embracing a G.O.P. agenda that would only worsen the prospects of ordinary working Americans and the poor.
The Democrats are in disarray because it's a party that lacks a spine. The Republicans, conversely, fight like wild people whether they're in the majority or not. What neither party is doing is offering a bold, coherent plan to get the nation's economy in good shape and create jobs, to bring our young men and women home from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, to rebuild the education system in a way that will prepare the next generation for the great challenges of the 21st century, and to reinvigorate the can-do spirit of America in a way that makes people believe that they are working together toward grand and constructive goals.
Great challenges demand great leaders. Marian Anderson once said, ''Leadership should be born out of the understanding of the needs of those who would be affected by it.''
Americans right now are riddled with fears and anxieties of many kinds. They are worried about the economic well-being of their families, the cost of securing a decent education for their children, their prospects for a comfortable retirement, the continuing threat of terrorism, and the debilitating effects of endless warfare. They worry that America's best days may be in the past.
Neither party talked about the wars during the campaign because neither party has anything satisfactory to say about them. And there was hardly any talk about education. We know that a quality education is more important now than ever, but we are firing teachers by the scores of thousands, not because they are incompetent, but because state and local budgets have hemorrhaged.
Our leaders in Washington seem entirely out of touch with the needs, the hopes, the fears and the anxieties of the millions of Americans who are out of work, who are struggling with their mortgages or home foreclosures, who are skimping on needed medication in order to keep food on the table, and who lie awake at night worrying about what the morning will bring. No one even dares mention the poor.
What this election tells me is that real leadership will have to come from elsewhere, from outside of Washington, perhaps from elected officials in statehouses or municipal buildings that are closer to the people, from foundations and grass-roots organizations, from the labor movement and houses of worship and community centers.
The civil rights pioneers did not wait for presidential or Congressional leadership, nor did the leaders of the women's movement. They plunged ahead with their crucial work against the longest odds and in the face of seemingly implacable hostility. Leaders of the labor movement braved guns, bombs, imprisonment and heaven knows what else to bring fair wages and dignity to working people.
America's can-do spirit can be revived, and with it a brighter vision of a fairer, more inclusive, and more humane society. But not if we wait on Washington to do it. The loudest message from Tuesday's election is that the people themselves need to do much more.
My column on Tuesday incorrectly described the situation of the small group of Americans earning $50 million or more annually. Their incomes declined by 7.7 percent between 2008 and 2009; they did not quintuple. The incorrect information came from a report based on flawed Social Security Administration data. An inspector general is investigating after two individuals filed false W-2 forms that led to the skewed data.

HEADLINE: Economic Lessons in France, India and America

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''It's Morning in India'' (column, Oct. 31), Thomas L. Friedman says the French students who protested their government's decision to raise the pension retirement age from 60 to 62 fail to understand the ''hypercompetitive and economically integrated world'' we live in. 
Of course, these students should, as Mr. Friedman suggests, be pressuring their government for the education and economic reforms that would create good jobs, but this is not an either-or choice. Maintaining the social safety net, which is really what those riots were about, doesn't equal economic ruin for the country.
No country can survive a recession as deep as this one without some sacrifice and real change. The anger and rage that people feel, here and abroad, are directly related to the fact that the sacrifices are not shared.
The knee-jerk reaction of governments is to swing the fiscal ax at health, education and other social welfare programs the minute the going gets tough, the very moment that these programs are even more vital. By contrast, the institutions that, by neglect or design, seem to be thriving are not asked to tighten their belts.
So pardon the common people if they do not want to keep a stiff upper lip while their government picks away at the only economic security most people have -- their pensions.
A. T. Cleary Forest Hills, Queens, Oct. 31, 2010
To the Editor:
As an Indian-American, I would be the first one to admit that it does feel like ''Morning in India.'' But the question I am repeatedly confronted with by my Indian peers is: Why is America constantly changing the rules -- relating to individual freedoms post-9/11 and concerning free markets post-Great Recession -- in the middle of the game?
The character of a country, like that of an individual, is defined during times of adversity, and we need to live up to our core values now more than ever. One can only hope that President Obama will reiterate our commitment to these principles on this trip to India.
Jack Nargundkar Germantown, Md., Oct. 31, 2010
To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman says business executives in India worry that Americans are losing spirit, optimism and self-confidence. Their worries are well founded, but the reasons have nothing to do with the ''Tea Party's politics.''
The loss in spirit reflects the American business community's frustration with an administration that is disdainful of the private sector, creates uncertainty and dampens entrepreneurial daring.
The American Dream is not dead. It's waiting for a more hospitable climate. Then it will grow and flourish.

HEADLINE: Year's Bank Failures Pass 2009

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Regulators shut down banks in Maryland and California on Friday, bringing the 2010 total to 141, topping the 140 shuttered last year. It is the most closings in a year since the savings-and-loan crisis two decades ago. 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation took over K Bank, based in Randallstown, Md., with $538.3 million in assets; it also closed the Western Commercial Bank in Woodland Hills, Calif., with $98.6 million in assets.
M&T Bank, based in Buffalo, N.Y., agreed to assume the deposits and $410.8 million of the assets of K Bank. The First California Bank, based in Westlake Village, Calif., is acquiring the assets and deposits of Western Commercial.
In addition, the F.D.I.C. and M&T Bank agreed to share losses on $289 million of K Bank's loans and other assets. The F.D.I.C. and First California Bank are sharing losses on $83.9 million of Western Commercial's assets.
The failure of K Bank is expected to cost the deposit insurance fund $198.4 million; that of Western Commercial Bank is expected to cost $25.2 million.
The banks that have failed this year are smaller, on average, than those seized in 2009. That has meant the deposit insurance fund has suffered a milder loss, which has reached around $21 billion so far this year, compared with $36 billion in 2009.
The wave of closings points to the lingering power of the recession more than a year after its official end.
The 2009 total of bank failures had been the highest annual toll since 1992, at the height of the savings and loan crisis. Twenty-five banks failed in 2008, the year the financial crisis struck with force; only three failed in 2007.
The number of banks on the F.D.I.C.'s confidential ''problem'' list jumped to 829 in the second quarter, from 775 three months earlier.

HEADLINE: Indian Contingency Against Pakistan Worries U.S.

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN and MARK LANDLER; Lydia Polgreen reported from New Delhi, and Mark Landler from Washington. David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- Senior American military commanders have sought to press India to formally disavow an obscure military doctrine that they contend is fueling tensions between India and Pakistan and hindering the American war effort in Afghanistan.
But with President Obama arriving in India on Saturday for a closely watched three-day visit, administration officials said they did not expect him to broach the subject of the doctrine, known informally as Cold Start. At the most, these officials predicted, Mr. Obama will quietly encourage India's leaders to do what they can to cool tensions between these nuclear-armed neighbors.
That would be a victory for India, which denies the very existence of Cold Start, a plan to deploy new ground forces that could strike inside Pakistan quickly in the event of a conflict. India has argued strenuously that the United States, if it wants a wide-ranging partnership of leading democracies, has to stop viewing it through the lens of Pakistan and the Afghanistan war.
It is also a victory for those in the administration who agree that the United States and India should focus on broader concerns, including commercial ties, military sales, climate change and regional security. However vital the Afghan war effort, officials said, it has lost out in the internal debate to priorities like American jobs and the rising role of China. 
''There are people in the administration who want us to engage India positively,'' said an administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal deliberations. ''They don't care about Afghanistan. Then there are people, like Petraeus, who have wars to fight.''
Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top commander in Afghanistan, is among those who have warned internally about the dangers of Cold Start, according to American and Indian officials. Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Richard C. Holbrooke, the special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, share these fears.
The strategy calls for India to create fast-moving battle groups that could deliver a contained but sharp retaliatory ground strike inside Pakistan within three days of suffering a terrorist attack by militants based in Pakistan, yet not do enough damage to set off a nuclear confrontation.
Pakistani officials have repeatedly stressed to the United States that worries about Cold Start are at the root of their refusal to redeploy forces away from the border with India so that they can fight Islamic militants in the frontier region near Afghanistan. That point was made most recently during a visit to Washington last month by Pakistan's army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani.
The administration raised the issue of Cold Start last November when India's prime minister, Manmohan Singh, visited Washington, Indian and American officials said. Indian officials told the United States that the strategy was not a government or military policy, and that India had no plans to attack Pakistan. Therefore, they added, it should have no place on Mr. Obama's agenda in India.
For at least the president's first stop, in the commercial capital, Mumbai, it almost certainly will not. With a huge delegation of more than 200 business executives trailing Mr. Obama, the emphasis will be on how the United States and India can expand economic ties in a way that benefits both countries.
The two countries are expected to sign a $5.8 billion deal to supply Boeing C-17 transport planes to the Indian military, one of several lucrative multiyear agreements to supply India with military hardware. The United States is eager to strengthen military ties with India, partly to make it a counterweight to China, which is flexing its muscles militarily and economically.
''President Obama intends this trip to be -- and intends our policy to be -- a full embrace of India's rise,'' Thomas E. Donilon, the national security adviser, said to reporters on Air Force One en route to India.
For Mr. Obama, politically wounded by the midterm elections and high unemployment at home, such deals are also important to bolster his argument that the relationship between the United States and India can create American jobs rather than simply siphoning them away.
''There is a lot of money to be made there,'' said Daniel S. Markey, a senior fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''The big question is whether we have the ability to forge a defense and trade relationship with India that is symbiotic.''
For all the talk of shared interests, India still lies at the nexus of America's greatest foreign policy crisis. Its archrival, Pakistan, is a crucial but deeply troubled American ally in the war in Afghanistan. The United States has struggled to find a way to mediate between them.
Some administration officials have argued that addressing Cold Start, developed in the aftermath of a failed attempt to mobilize troops in response to an attack on the Indian Parliament by Pakistani militants, could help break the logjam that has impeded talks between the countries.
But India has mostly declined to discuss the topic. ''We don't know what Cold Start is,'' said India's defense secretary, Pradeep Kumar, in an interview on Thursday. ''Our prime minister has said that Pakistan has nothing to fear. Pakistan can move its troops from the eastern border.''
Indian officials and some analysts say Cold Start has taken on a nearly mythical status in the minds of Pakistani leaders, whom they suspect of inflating it as an excuse to avoid engaging militants on their own turf.
''The Pakistanis will use everything they can to delay or drag out doing a serious reorientation of their military,'' said Stephen P. Cohen, an expert on South Asia at the Brookings Institution.
India's response to terrorist attacks has been slow-footed. After Pakistani militants attacked Parliament in 2001, India's ponderous strike forces, most of them based in the center of the country, took weeks to reach the border. By then Western diplomats had swooped in, and Pakistan made conciliatory statements, deflating Indian hopes of striking a punitive blow.
The military began devising a plan to respond to future attacks. The response would have to be swift to avoid the traffic jam of international diplomacy, but also carefully calibrated -- shallow enough to be punitive and embarrassing, but not an existential threat that would provoke nuclear retaliation.
For now, there are no signs that Cold Start is more than a theory, and analysts say there is no significant shift of new troops or equipment to the border.
But American military officials and diplomats worry that even the existence of the strategy in any form could encourage Pakistan to make rapid improvements in its nuclear arsenal.
When Pakistani military officials are asked to justify the huge investment in upgrading that arsenal, some respond that because Pakistan has no conventional means to deter Cold Start, nuclear weapons are its only option.
Still, many analysts are skeptical that Cold Start could be the key for the Obama administration to promote talks between India and Pakistan, which have been stalled since Pakistani militants attacked Mumbai in 2008.
''They are grasping at straws because they have a predicament in the Afghan theater that they cannot fix without Pakistan's help,'' said Ashley J. Tellis, a former diplomat and South Asia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ''They are looking at India to do something to placate the Pakistanis.''

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Defends Action in Face of Foreign Criticism

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
JEKYLL ISLAND, Ga. -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, on Friday defended the central bank's decision to inject $600 billion into the American economy, in the face of objections from European and Asian officials about the weakening of the dollar that is likely to result from the action.
''The best fundamentals for the dollar will come when the economy is growing strongly,'' Mr. Bernanke told students at Jacksonville University in Florida. ''That is where the fundamentals come from. We are aware the dollar plays a special role in the global economy.'' 
In commenting on the dollar, Mr. Bernanke was making an unusual departure from custom. By tradition, the dollar is the purview of the Treasury secretary and monetary policy is the domain of the Fed chairman, and neither official steps on the other's turf.
But the Fed's announcement on Wednesday that it would resume a strategy of buying Treasury securities to lower long-term interest rates has generated unease around the world.
As Mr. Bernanke spoke, the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, arrived in Kyoto, Japan, for a meeting of finance ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, where American complaints about the undervaluation of the Chinese currency will probably be countered with accusations that the Fed is engaging in an exchange-rate move of its own.
''What the U.S. accuses China of doing, the U.S.A. is doing by different means,'' the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, said of the Fed's new decision. Earlier, the Brazilian finance minister, Guido Mantega, who has warned of a global currency war, predicted that the Fed's move would be ineffective, saying, ''Throwing money out of a helicopter doesn't do any good.''
Mr. Bernanke has defended the Fed's decision to pump $600 billion into the banking system as a modest but necessary step to support the American recovery, and he told the students: ''A strong U.S. economy is critical not just for Americans but for a global recovery.''
The chairman also addressed critics who were worried that the Fed's move could touch off uncontrollable inflation, even though the current rate is well below the Fed's unofficial goal of about 2 percent.
''We are absolutely committed to keeping inflation low and stable,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''We have the tools to unwind and tighten policy at the appropriate time, when that time comes.''
The chairman spoke in Jacksonville before traveling here for a conference on Fed history, attended by many presidents of Fed regional banks, along with a legion of Fed veterans and top economists.
Though they would not grant interviews, their public comments at the conference suggested an acute awareness of the potential drawbacks of the decision. ''We are still rewriting the narrative, and gaining an understanding, of what happened in the Great Depression and why,'' said Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. ''No doubt it will be at least 50 years before we understand very well what happened in 2008 and 2009 and whether the Federal Reserve undertook the right policies or the wrong policies.''
Or as Sandra Pianalto, president of the Cleveland Fed, put it: ''History has an ability to administer a dose of humility.''
Mr. Bernanke and his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, whose 18-year tenure coincided with a period of economic calm that ended soon after Mr. Bernanke succeeded him, are scheduled to speak Saturday at the conference, organized by the Atlanta Fed and Rutgers University.
Leading scholars of the Fed voiced skepticism about the latest step, which even Fed officials acknowledge will have only modest effects on employment and growth.
''Learning is slow when you need it most,'' said Charles W. Calomiris, an economist at Columbia Business School who presented research on the Fed's policy mistakes from its founding until 1951, most notably during the Depression. ''Volatile times make learning and accountability much harder, because views that might be false are harder to discredit.''
Mr. Calomiris said he would ''make a strong case'' against additional purchases of government debt, and added: ''When we need central banks to act the wisest, they often act the least wise.''
In interviews here, other economists expressed ambivalence about the Fed's latest step.
''They're setting the stage for an outbreak of real serious inflation one to two years from now, at which point they will have no choice but to sell securities and raise interest rates, which will reduce the value of their assets and consequently their earnings,'' said William F. Ford, a former president of the Atlanta Fed.
The Fed transferred $47.4 billion, a record sum, to the Treasury last year, but it could conceivably record a loss if interest rates were to rise quickly and reduce the value of the securities on the central bank's books.
Others said the Fed was doing its best at a time of few good options.
Anil K. Kashyap, an economist in the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago, gave a more favorable interpretation, predicting that the Fed would be praised for lowering interest rates, making emergency loans and ultimately pumping trillions of dollars into the economy.
''It's already well understood that things could have gotten much worse in 2008 if the Fed hadn't gone to the mat, and I think Ben will be viewed as a hero,'' he said. ''I think history will treat the Fed pretty well.''

HEADLINE: Hiring is on rise, But jobless rate Remains at 9.6%

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL; Christine Hauser and Peter Baker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Good, but not good enough.
As President Obama said himself, that was the message in Friday's Labor Department report, which showed that the United States economy added 151,000 jobs in October.
The gain was certainly a welcome change after four months of job losses, and was better than what economists had expected. Still, it was not nearly strong enough to make a dent in unemployment. Nearly 15 million people are still out of work, and the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high at 9.6 percent.
The jobless rate has not fallen substantially this year, largely because employers have barely added enough workers to absorb the people just entering the labor force. And even if the economy suddenly expands and starts adding 208,000 jobs a month -- as it did in its best year this decade -- it would still take 12 years to close the gap between the growing number of American workers and the total available jobs, according to the Brookings Institution's Hamilton Project. 
The latest numbers underscore the challenges that lie ahead for Washington with a newly divided government and calls by Republican leadership to discredit Mr. Obama's economic policies. Economists themselves cannot agree about what kinds of policy measures would rescue the job market. Even if a magic-bullet jobs program existed, however, it seems unlikely that a gridlocked Congress could cooperate long enough to put it in place.
Moreover, the policy measures that remain -- in particular, the Federal Reserve's decision this week to pump more money into the economy -- seem to be upsetting the rest of world. One effect of the Fed's actions is to drive the dollar lower against other currencies, making American products more competitive and perhaps laying the groundwork for asset bubbles elsewhere. The lead-up to the Group of 20 summit meeting in Seoul, South Korea, next week has been dominated by criticisms of the Fed's announcement and battle cries over ''currency wars,'' prompting the Fed chairman to defend the action on Friday.
Given all this, President Obama has tried to recast his Asia trip as a jobs mission.
''The primary purpose is to take a bunch of U.S. companies and open up markets so that we can sell in Asia, in some of the fastest-growing markets in the world, and we can create jobs here in the United States of America,'' Mr. Obama told his cabinet Thursday.
On Friday he tried to highlight bright spots in the jobs report, calling it ''encouraging.'' Still he acknowledged, ''The fact is, an encouraging jobs report doesn't make a difference if you're still one of the millions of people who are looking for work.''
He reached out to Republicans who have just won control of the House and picked up six seats in the Senate, pledging to work together on job growth. ''I am open to any idea, any proposal, any way we can get the economy growing faster so that people who need work can find it faster,'' he said, ticking off initiatives like more infrastructure spending and tax breaks for businesses.
While Washington is deciding how to respond to problems in the job market, businesses say uncertainty about measures like the expiring Bush tax cuts can discourage hiring.
''When we don't have a clue what two of our largest budget items are, taxes and health care, we've got to keep all the money we possibly have,'' said Patricia Felder, an owner of Felder's Collision Parts, a small company in Baton Rouge, La., that sells automotive parts.
''We may need it for taxes since we have no idea what we're looking at next year,'' Ms. Felder said. ''And we may need it to provide the same level of health care for employees that they got used to having.''
In the absence of Congressional action, the extensions in unemployment benefits are also scheduled to expire soon, cutting off two million Americans in December alone, according to the National Employment Law Project. With little prospect of finding a job in the near future, many of the nation's long-term unemployed have become increasingly desperate.
''I hope that Congress can become human and forget about being Democrats or Republicans and just be human beings to see what it's like for us,'' said Annette Tornberg, 50, of Sacramento. She was laid off from her job at a printing company in 2009 and has been unable to find work despite sending out more than a thousand resumes, she said. ''We're human beings, and all we want is for you to help us out.''
Of course, the ideal salve for the nation's unemployed would be gainful employment, not jobless benefits. And there are some glimmers of hope.
Private companies have been expanding their payrolls throughout the year. For several months, however, job growth in the private sector had been overshadowed by cuts in temporary Census jobs and layoffs by state and local governments. Then in October, governments cut just 8,000 jobs, after eliminating 148,000 positions in September. And private companies added 159,000 jobs last month, after a gain of 107,000 in September.
On many levels, the October report was much better than expected.
Economists had forecast a net gain of 60,000 jobs, less than half the increase posted on Friday. The government also revised upward the numbers for August and September, showing 110,000 fewer jobs lost. In total, the American economy has added 860,000 positions this calendar year, indicating the picture is not quite as bleak as it appeared before the midterm elections.
There were a few other positive notes. Hourly wages were slightly higher last month. A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who are working part time because they cannot find full-time jobs and people who have given up seeking work, eased to 17 percent from 17.1 percent in September.
John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics, said the data pointed to a pickup in growth in the fourth quarter. ''The notion that the economy might be double dipping can now be safely tossed out,'' he said.
Among the industries with the biggest gains last month were education and health services, which added 53,000 jobs; retail, which added 28,000; and temporary help services, which expanded by 34,900 jobs. Another positive sign was a lengthening private-sector workweek, which rose by one-tenth of an hour, to 34.3 hours. Like the hiring of temporary workers, an expanding workweek is a potential harbinger of more permanent hiring.
Longer hours and slightly higher hourly wages may help propel consumer spending, which could in turn lead retailers to hire more workers.
''For the fourth quarter, things may not be quite blockbuster, but it does look like we're picking up a little momentum as we're going into the holiday season,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight. ''That's certainly good news.''

HEADLINE: Learning to Love Foreclosures?

 BODY:
In the most recent mortgage mess, the Obama administration has -- oddly and disturbingly -- been arguing that foreclosures are, in effect, good for the economy and should proceed apace as banks get their snarled paperwork in order. 
Phyllis Caldwell, chief of the Treasury Department's Homeownership Preservation Office, recently told a Congressional panel that the administration was making progress on preventing foreclosures -- a claim disputed by some panelists. She also said that ''an important part of assuring long-term stability in the market is to enable properties to be resold to families who can afford to purchase them.''
The trouble with her statements, which echo those of other officials, is that they gloss over the question of whether families who were foreclosed upon were given a fair shot at keeping their homes.
Some Americans, no matter what, cannot afford to keep their house. But mass foreclosures are a huge drain on the economy, crushing home values for everyone. In September, 347,420 homeowners received a foreclosure notice, up nearly 3 percent from the previous month, according to data from RealtyTrac, a marketer of foreclosed properties. Before resorting to foreclosures, banks need to make a much more serious, transparent and timely effort to work out new loan terms.
We assume the White House's stance is an attempt to keep the markets calm in the face of ongoing revelations of chaos in the foreclosure process. That would make sense if the White House had a more aggressive policy to prevent foreclosures. But in a year and a half, its signature antiforeclosure effort has permanently modified fewer than 500,000 loans. That's far short of the need -- 4.2 million loans are now in or near foreclosure.
It comes down to this: banks are paid incentives to modify mortgages so owners can hold on to their homes, but other incentives can trump timely modifications or make foreclosures look like a better financial deal for the banks. Dragging out a delinquency, for example, can allow banks to postpone acknowledging losses, while a foreclosure sale allows them to collect late fees and other charges applied to delinquent loans.
It doesn't take a big leap of logic to conclude that homes are being lost that could be saved, but for the banks' reluctance to rework bad loans. The Obama administration needs to do more.

HATE
A Romance
By Tristan Garcia
Translated by Marion Duvert and Lorin Stein
273 pp. Faber & Faber. Paper, $14
You know those delicate debut novels, the ones that take place in coastal Maine, in which, if the author is searching for any truth at all, it's only for a small, particular one? Well, ''Hate: A Romance,'' Tristan Garcia's first effort, is not among them. It's frenetic and French, for a reader who knows Deleuze from Derrida, who will chuckle when Garcia refers to the ''domestic troubles'' of Althusser. (That's a joke, by the way, but you may need Wikipedia to figure it out. I did.)
Despite its cultured Gallic sensibilities, ''Hate,'' as translated by Marion Duvert and Lorin Stein, is surprisingly taut and readable. Garcia, a trained philosopher, has managed to write -- in fewer than 300 pages, no less -- the kind of social novel his American counterparts too often avoid in favor of solipsistic musings. 
He certainly doesn't write what he knows: born in 1981, Garcia was a toddler when the Marais became the epicenter of gay life in Paris. But through his narrator, the journalist Elizabeth Lavallois, he credibly describes (at least to this outsider) that world as AIDS encroaches.
The plot is a neat trajectory of three lives -- too neat at times. On the left is William Miller, an awkward kid from Amiens who becomes the darling of Paris's clubland as he seeks ever greater fame. His lover is Dominique Rossi, or Doum, an elegant Corsican who dabbles in journalism and befriends Liz, who in turn introduces him to Will. At the same time, Liz begins an affair with Jean-Michel Leibowitz, a hawkish Jewish intellectual.
Garcia gives Liz a staccato, culturally omniscient voice. She recalls the '80s as a ''wasteland except when it came to TV, free-market economics and Western homosexuality,'' and summarizes AIDS with quintessential French cynicism: ''People died, people protested, people protected themselves, people gave money.'' If Tony Kushner's ''Angels in America'' became a classic for the compassion with which it treated victims of AIDS, ''Hate'' is noteworthy for its cool analysis of both the disease and la condition humaine.
Both Doum and Will have H.I.V., and it leads to an irreparable rift between them. While some on the left dismiss the disease initially as a ''protofascist creation of the hospital state,'' Doum presciently founds an advocacy organization, Stand, that endows him with mainstream respectability.
Will celebrates the virus as a mark of outre status: ''AIDS belonged to us queers, it was our treasure,'' he announces. He blithely advocates unprotected sex in books that have chapter titles like ''AIDS Saves, Condoms Kill.'' The American press (but of course) calls him ''the new Michel Foucault.''
Drug-addled and increasingly unstable, Will veers into self-caricature, joking to Liz that Jews invented AIDS. But his loathing is primarily reserved for Dominique, whom he mocks as an outdated leader trying to remake the gay community in the vanilla image of straight society. Doum's effort to distribute condoms is branded as sedition. ''Prevention = Repression,'' reads the T-shirt of a clueless Will acolyte.
A trained philosopher, Garcia is fluent in the currents of thought that have animated recent French history, and he has the dexterity to be flippant and morbid within a single paragraph. But he has more digging to do in the human heart. The novel is hermetic in its singular occupation with the disastrous relationship between Doum and Will and the corollary romance between Liz and the married Leibowitz. Though all four have plausibly prominent roles in French culture, at times it appears as if no other figures of consequence exist, with secondary characters strutting too quickly across the stage.
Garcia's fullest character is the tragic Will, whom Liz describes in his final days as a ''cracked jar of T4 cells.'' She claims from the beginning that her project is to rehabilitate the troubled party boy turned philosopher, to show that his irresponsible behaviors were caused by a glimpse of some deep, unsettling truth. It was that truth, perhaps, that made him embrace AIDS. For as he tells her, ''There's no condom against death.''

Holland Cotter
When Thelma Golden came to the STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM as chief curator in 2000, she promised to bring contemporary art from Africa and the international African diaspora with her. She has honored that vow many times since, and does so again with the solo exhibition of work by LYNETTE YIADOM-BOAKYE, ''Any Number of Preoccupations,'' that opens Thursday. Born in London in 1977, and of Ghanaian descent, Ms. Yiadom-Boakye made her New York debut in the museum's 2008 group show ''Flow'' with a set of striking fictional portrait paintings, part of a series that began in 2003 and continues. Most of her portrait subjects are black. Whether as single figures or pairs, they appear against solid-color backgrounds and project a theatrical dynamism, as if they were characters in narratives we can only guess at. Ms. Yiadom-Boakye has taken as her historical models two of art's greatest visual dramatists, Goya and Manet and, being a writer too, she has added stories to the paintings. 
She will share the Studio Museum space with MARK BRADFORD, who also made his first big splash in a group show there, ''Freestyle'' in 2001. He will be showing a new body of works on paper based on the letters of the alphabet, though the really big news is the arrival of a much-praised traveling retrospective of his work at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston on Nov. 19. This survey, though, is the closest his work will come to New York for now.Both shows through March 13, 144 West 125th Street; (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org; $7.
Theater
Charles Isherwood
Perhaps Marxists, those fiery-hearted believers in economic equality who you don't really run into much anymore, are ready to stage a comeback, bedbug style. (Lest hackles be raised, that was not meant as a swipe at hardened communists, or, for that matter, at bedbugs.) ''After the Revolution,'' a new play by AMY HERZOG making its New York debut at Playwrights Horizons, tells the story of a young and proud Marxist, a law school grad and a third-generation liberal, who uncovers uncomfortable secrets about the family patriarch.
Set in the 1990s, amid discoveries that blacklisted members of the Communist Party had in fact been Soviet spies, the play features an enticing cast, all holdovers from the premiere production last summer at the Williamstown Theater Festival that received enthusiastic reviews. The great Lois Smith plays the widow of the possibly now disgraced patriarch; Peter Friedman is her son; Mare Winningham his wife. Katharine Powell plays the young central character, and Carolyn Cantor directs. Opens Wednesday (through Nov. 28), Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, playwrightshorizons.org; $55.
Film
Stephen Holden
In ''White Material,'' the newest work by the French filmmaker CLAIRE DENIS, Isabelle Huppert plays Maria Vial, the owner of a coffee plantation she runs with her ex-husband in an unidentified African country gripped by civil unrest. Headstrong and defiant, Maria refuses to be driven away despite urgent warnings for white residents to leave immediately. Maria is in some ways a stand-in for Ms. Denis, who grew up in West Africa, the daughter of a French colonial administrator. Many of her films, beginning with ''Chocolat,'' examine the relationship of outsiders (whether white settlers in Africa or African immigrants in Paris) to the societies in which they live.
A sneak preview of ''White Material'' at the IFC Center, on Sunday at 6:30 p.m., with Ms. Denis and Ms. Huppert present, will be followed, from Wednesday to Nov. 18, by an 18-film retrospective of Ms. Denis's work that includes all of her fiction features, two of her documentaries, a portrait of the filmmaker and three films on which she worked before becoming a director. They include her masterpiece, ''Beau Travail,'' an indelible miragelike study of French Foreign Legion troops stationed in Djibouti, whose training rituals suggest a military ballet, and ''The Intruder,'' whose protagonist, a brooding loner, travels from Switzerland to Tahiti in search of a son he sired there decades earlier.
The retrospective's title, NO FEAR: THE FILMS OF CLAIRE DENIS, evokes the spirit of a director with the heart of an explorer.323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 924-7771, ifccenter.com.
Television
Neil Genzlinger
Generally, fans of factual-ish television like to see something definitive on the introductory screen. ''Based on actual events,'' for instance. The lead-in for Tuesday's episode of ''LOST TAPES'' on Animal Planet is a bit more wiggly. ''This story is inspired by the possibility that hidden creatures exist,'' it says.
The episode, ''Reptilian'' (10 p.m.), is the third-season finale of this over-the-top show, and it's not good news for New Yorkers: apparently there are -- or there is the possibility that there could be -- murderous, snakelike humanoids in the city's abandoned subway tunnels. ''Lost Tapes,'' a sort of docu-mocku-horror-nature show, mixes documentary-style talking heads (like the paranormal investigator Rosemary Ellen Guiley) and miscellaneous animal-kingdom factoids with grainily filmed fictional tales showing how beasts of legend and rumor might create havoc.
Previous episodes have given us a ''devil monkey'' in West Virginia and the swimmer-devouring Oklahoma Octopus, along with more familiar horrors like the yeti and the Jersey Devil. Tuesday night we learn of two New York police officers who ventured -- or possibly could have -- into the subway tunnels to investigate the disappearances of young people lured to underground parties. The officers, alas, didn't survive their encounter with the reptilians that live down there, but their videotapes did.
Back above ground, Tracy Morgan of ''30 Rock'' performed a stand-up comedy show in September at the Apollo Theater with cameras rolling. Those tapes too survived, and on Saturday at 10 p.m. on HBO gives us the result: ''TRACY MORGAN: BLACK AND BLUE.''
Dance
Jack Anderson
Back in 1970 in Rochester, a feisty little dance troupe was born. Its prospects were uncertain -- which can usually be said of fledgling groups -- yet its ambitions were great, and its spirits were high. To proclaim its willpower, it called itself Bottom of the Bucket, but ... Dance Theater. Now, 40 years later, and renamed GARTH FAGAN DANCE, after its director-choreographer, it's one of the leading modern-dance companies, and Mr. Fagan has gone on to choreograph ''The Lion King'' on Broadway and be in great demand as a guest choreographer for many groups.
His company is celebrating its 40th anniversary at the Joyce Theater with a large repertory that includes two premieres, both highlighting the group's quirkiness. A choreographic collagist, Mr. Fagan likes to juxtapose disparate types of movement, so that sharp allegros may without warning be followed by dreamy adagios. Or he'll isolate separate body parts and make them appear to move in counterpoint. Such contrasts will abound in Mr. Fagan's premiere ''Thanks 40,'' a celebration of the company's four decades. ''Hylozoic,'' the second premiere, marks the choreographic debut of Norwood Pennewell, a longtime company member, who has peppered a basically lyrical piece with moments of wit that express the underlying optimism so important to this troupe. Tuesday through next Sunday, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea; (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $19-$59.

DAVID AMRAM has wandered through the past 60 years of American music, giving himself permission to pass through genre neighborhoods like almost nobody else. He wrote the original soundtrack music to the feature films ''The Manchurian Candidate'' and ''Splendor in the Grass,'' as well as for Robert Frank's short film ''Pull My Daisy,'' with Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and Mr. Amram as actors. He has collaborated with Leonard Bernstein, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Charles Mingus, Tito Puente, James Galway, Hannibal Marvin Peterson, Mary Lou Williams, Langston Hughes, Pete Seeger and Willie Nelson. (Go to a Willie Nelson gig in the New York area, and Mr. Amram may show up onstage unannounced, playing flute or recorder.)
Naturally an 80th-birthday concert for a composer of many interests would be musically broad, but the one at Symphony Space on Thursday night will be Amram-esque. It will include a New York premiere of his ''Symphonic Variations on a Song by Woody Guthrie,'' performed in memory of Odetta, by the Queens College Orchestra; sections of ''Splendor in the Grass'' and ''The Manchurian Candidate,'' by the Brooklyn Conservatory Jazz Ensemble; a Latin jazz symphonic piece called ''En Memoria de Chano Pozo,'' including the Cuban conguero Candido Camero; and much else. 7:30 p.m. Thursday, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street; (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $35-$75.

Yale University's School of Music has lately taken to sending ensembles to New York, and though the university may have any number of motives, audiences see it as part of a spirited battle of the bands: Yale's musicians versus those of the Juilliard School, the Manhattan School of Music and the Mannes College the New School for Music. Yale, which typically offers unusual programs, with an emphasis on new music, has made some impressive showings.
This week a group of guitarists from the university play works by some of the school's better-known composers. Benjamin Verdery, the inventive, idiosyncratic player who directs Yale's guitar department, opens the program with the world premieres of a solo guitar work by Ezra Laderman and a piece for electric guitar and tape by Jack Vees. He then cedes the stage to his students for solo and ensemble works by Martin Bresnick, Ingram Marshall, Aaron Jay Kernis, David Lang, Samuel Adams and Kathryn Alexander, as well as his own ''Give,'' for eight guitars. 8 p.m. Tuesday, Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org.; $15-$25.
Early music fanciers have a lot to choose from this week, including an inviting collaboration by two superb New York groups, the WESTERN WIND vocal ensemble and PARTHENIA, a consort of viols. They are joining forces to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Michael East's ''Third Book of Madrigals.'' 8 p.m. Thursday, Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights; (212) 866-0468, parthenia.org; $25.

HIGHLIGHT: Jerry A. Coyne is a professor of ecology and evolution at the University of Chicago. His latest book is ''Why Evolution Is True,'' and he blogs at whyevolutionistrue.com.

 BODY:
WHAT TECHNOLOGY WANTS
By Kevin Kelly
406 pp. Viking. $28
The thesis of Kevin Kelly's bold new book begins with its title. How can technology -- an inanimate collection of human inventions -- want anything? According to Kelly, a professional tech-watcher and former editor of Wired magazine, it's because technology is like a living organism, animated by the same evolutionary forces that resulted, over eons, in the human brain. Moreover, for Kelly, the whole process has been progressive and predictable: the eventual appearance of the BlackBerry was immanent in the Big Bang. 
In ''What Technology Wants,'' Kelly provides an engaging journey through the history of ''the technium,'' a term he uses to describe the ''global, massively interconnected system of technology vibrating around us,'' extending ''beyond shiny hardware to include culture, art, social institutions and intellectual creations of all types.'' We learn, for instance, that our hunter-gatherer ancestors, despite their technological limitations, may have worked as little as three to four hours a day. Since then, the technium has grown exponentially: while colonial American households boasted fewer than 100 objects, Kelly's own home contains, by his reckoning, more than 10,000. As Kelly is a gadget-phile by trade (and an affluent American to boot), this index probably inflates the current predominance of technology and its products, but a thoroughly mundane statistic makes the same point: a typical supermarket now offers more than 48,000 different items.
Despite the juxtaposition of cheerfully relaxed hunter-gatherers and their harried and BlackBerryed descendants, Kelly argues convincingly that this expansion of technology is beneficial. Technology creates choice -- compare the supermarket's shelves with the pantry of a colonial farm -- and therefore enhances our potential for self-realization. No longer tied to the land, we can become, in principle, what we want to become.
So far, so good. Kelly's exploration of the factors underlying these trends, however, is more controversial. He sees evolution -- both biological and technological -- as an inexorable and predictable process; if life were to begin again on Earth, he argues, we'd see not only the re-evolution of humans, but humans who would invent pretty much the same stuff. To support his claims, Kelly describes parallel inventions on different isolated continents (the blowgun and the abacus, for example), and the presence of near-simultaneous inventions in modern times (the light bulb was invented at least two dozen times).
While there's something to this, that something is probably not an inexorable law of nature. Innovation requires standing on the shoulders of giants, and inventions often build on one another: you can't have light bulbs without electricity. Also, the technological landscape is presumably exploited by brains wired in similar ways. And Kelly conveniently omits those inventions that were historical singletons: the wheel is about as good as inventions get, but it didn't appear in the New World or Australia until brought by Eurasians. If you combine the idea that in hindsight everything seems inevitable with Kelly's claim that what's inevitable in technology are not specific inventions but their ''conceptual essence,'' then you have an airtight theory of such mind-blowing generality that it can't be disproved.
Kelly is strangely keen to tie his theory of technological development to biological evolution. I am not sure why; perhaps he thinks his progressive view of technology is more credible if it's seen as an extension of the established scientific vision of evolution. But his take on biological evolution is one that, while beloved of creationists, is completely rejected by scientists: he sees it as teleological, driven by external forces to achieve certain goals.
Sadly, evolution doesn't work this way. In fact, the distinguishing feature of evolution is the complete absence of ''laws'' or ''forces'' that push it in a single direction. As Stephen Jay Gould tirelessly argued, evolutionary change is a highly contingent process, critically dependent on environmental uncertainties and random mutations. According to Gould, you would not be reading this article were it not for an entirely serendipitous event 65 million years ago: the meteorite impact that eliminated the dinosaurs and allowed mammals, previously marginalized by their reptilian mega-cousins, to take off evolutionarily, a process that eventually yielded our own species. True, evolution shows some trends -- species are on average more complex now than at the beginning of life -- but does that mean that there is a consistent evolutionary impulse toward complexity, with natural selection always favoring the more complex over the less? Not at all. After all, that increase in complexity is a default trend: because the first organism was simple, any change must have resulted in greater complexity. A large proportion of all life on the planet (albeit a slice of life we tend to overlook) is microbial, and has accordingly remained simple. And some species, like fleas and tapeworms, evolved greater simplicity, losing important structures and organs.
The extent to which biological evolution is repeatable remains a scientific controversy. Gould thought it wasn't, but others argue that determinism trumps contingency. Interestingly, many of the latter camp's arguments resemble Kelly's, invoking, for instance, the independent, or ''convergent,'' evolution of dog-like mammals in the Northern Hemisphere (wolves) and Southern Hemisphere (thylacines). But biology also has plenty of one-offs like the wheel, including bones, feathers -- and the human brain. If self-aware intelligence like ours is such an asset, how come it evolved only once? Ultimately, since we have but one realization of evolution on our planet, the only inevitability in this debate is our inability to resolve it.
Actually, Kelly sees another force as helping to propel technology. When interviewed while he was researching this book, Kelly, who describes himself as a devout Christian, declared that technology ''is actually a divine phenomenon that is a reflection of God.'' And the last chapter of ''What Technology Wants'' is steeped in this bizarre neo-mystical progressivism. ''If there is a God,'' Kelly writes, ''the arc of the technium is aimed right at him.'' For Kelly, our artifacts, too, reflect the divine: ''We can see more of God in a cellphone than in a tree frog.'' (Were I religious I'd argue the opposite: no human technology can make a new frog from the raw material of flies, something that frogs do regularly.)
Finally, with its emphasis on God and inexorable ''laws'' of evolution, Kelly's book lacks a hard-nosed analysis of the other factors driving technology. Where is the economics? Where is the discussion of marketing? And where is the psychology? Like the theory of memes, in which bits of culture are said to have their own self-propagating autonomy, Kelly's view of a purposeful technology neglects the quirks of human psychology that actually propel its change.
Because Kelly's theory lacks a solid foundation, his predictions and prescriptions for technology are inevitably somewhat of a letdown. We learn, for instance, that our products will get ''faster, cheaper, better,'' but we hardly need either biology or sophisticated theory to tell us that. Nor, according to Kelly, need we worry too much about overpopulation, pollution or the depletion of fossil fuels: Kelly assures us that technology will deal with those problems just, I suppose, as biological evolution helped the dinosaurs deal with that meteorite. Indeed, Kelly sees it as our moral duty to promulgate technology, since it increases the choices of our fellow humans. Standing in its way is futile: Kelly gives many instances of ultimately failed attempts to ban technologies like the crossbow (the assault rifle of its time), printing and silk-spinning.
Perhaps I've been too hard on Kelly. But if the analogy between biology and technology fails, so too does his Theory of Everything. So forget that theory, for the book still offers a sharp-eyed study of our abiding need for cars, computers and gadgets. And if you're drawn to books arguing that life is getting better and better, Kelly's case is persuasive. Just don't think that it's all driven by biological and celestial laws.

HEADLINE: Regrets? How Much Time Do You Have?

BYLINE: By Erika

 BODY:
Last month, City Room asked readers to reveal any financial decisions of recent years that they would like to undo. Many commenters went beyond those parameters to describe regrets of life, love and career, and we highlighted our favorites in another post. But then that post generated a whole new set of observations, which were featured this past week.
Here are some of our favorites:
I regret letting my boyfriend move in, because he won't move out! Erika 
I regret getting an archaeology degree. Now I'm working as a secretary, a pretty much dead-end, brain-atrophying job for me. I should have gotten a degree in something useful. But I chose what I loved. And now I can't even do that. SP
I regret: Not eating more chocolate. Not drinking more Champagne. Not spending more time in Paris. Noah Vale
I regret not focusing on getting into a good undergrad college. I think my life would be different now. Robert
Only one regret: I walked away from my wife after 22 years. Now it's too late to return. I have only my own stupidity to blame for such a dumb mistake. Master Blaster
I regret the child I could have had if I said yes when I had the chance. phillyguy
I tell people that I can count the regrets in my life on one hand, so few are they. Here goes:
1. That I didn't leave my first wife after she had an affair six months after our wedding -- I wasted eight good years on a dead end.
2. That I quit a job when I was at the top of my game and would have made millions had I stayed.
3. That I left an expatriate assignment in Switzerland to take a job in the United States (which I later quit -- see No. 2).
4. That I never had children (though as I get older and wiser, this falls down the list if not off).
5. That I didn't take full advantage of my Ivy League education while I was there.
Tom from UWS
I regret marrying a man because I got pregnant, even though I don't regret the two children we had. They are the best things that could have ever happened to me! i obregon
I regret having let my soulmate slip away from me due to my mistakes, and the death of my best friend though I had no control over that. Now everything in life is second best. Ralph
I regret not moving out of NY State when i was young Bob
I regret the lack of self-assurance and confidence in being alone that led me to waste my 20s (and all the physical perkiness and lack of wrinkles that come with those years!) on emotionally abusive relationships and ''friends'' who turned out to be capricious gossips in the end.
Trying to build new circles of friends (not to mention finding people to date) from practically zero is much, much tougher when you're in your 30s.
Also: I really regret not having asked that one cute guy to get a drink with me after that movie where he and I were two of a tiny number of people who laughed throughout the entire thing. That would have been a fun night, and might have changed some things (see above). Kate
I regret that my reproductive plans are of any interest to anyone other than my husband. We don't want kids, mind your own business! Yes, you, too, Mom and Dad! Alex D.
I regret turning down Harvard for undergraduate and Yale for graduate. Hey, O.K., I know, it could be a lot worse. maura
Selling that black Les Paul Custom. What was I thinking? dave walsh
I regret constantly living for tomorrow, now that my tomorrows are far fewer and my yesterdays are far greater. GMS
I regret not having waken up sooner to a man whose child I bore out of love and who was incapable of loving anyone other than himself. I'd like to think I have his lovely daughter as the ultimate ''consolation'' prize and he's never known the joy I have today. GwenS
I regret not making up to my mother. She passed away in a hospital waiting for me. Ann
I regret wasting time on the self-pitying process of having regrets. We choose what we choose for a reason. The belief that things could have been better had we followed another path is often illusory, and always pointless. Love the people in your life, and strive to be better with and to each other. dyinglikeflies
I regret not dancing with my father at my wedding reception. It was a very nontraditional wedding and he is very shy -- I was afraid he'd feel put on the spot. But now I deeply regret it. CN
I regret not having been born very rich. That way, when I lost all my money, I would still have plenty left. judy, nyc
When I was a fat young man, I never even talked to a very fat young woman who had a crush on me from grade school to our senior year. I hurt that young lady, now a middle-aged woman, very much, but I hurt myself far, far more.
A relationship with her then could have given me emotional strength for the rest of my life. In college, I did not have the life experience and emotional strength to avail myself of the opportunities presented to me -- which I would have had if I had had a relationship with that young woman in high school.
In college, I regressed from neurotic to nearly psychotic -- borderline personality disorder. Since college, I have not achieved the life and work success of my Ivy League classmates.
After graduation, I worked in a low-level state civil service job, saw a psychiatrist once a week after work, and took Thorazine for six years.
Seven years after therapy ended, I became a Morgan Stanley stockbroker and worked there for 11 years through June 30, 2001. A year before I left Morgan Stanley, I began a relationship with a woman that lasted about five years, 30 years after I could have had a relationship with the young woman who had had a crush on me decades before. BigGuy
I regret that I didn't learn to forgive earlier in life. Living free is so much better. Lisa
I have few years-long regrets: not taking advantage of my college education is one of them. I regret permitting my mother, who I do love, to govern how I felt about myself for so long. I also once did something very risky and stupid for money that I regret. Beyond that, not too many. Sarah A
I regret not having had the courage to love more, and having been too pragmatic to ''live in the moment.'' At 45, I'm trying to make up for all that youthful folly. Freya
I regret living in Jacksonville, Fla., for six years. Lazy D
I regret the first and third kids, but not the second and fourth. andy
I regret I didn't pay more attention to my wonderful son before he was shot and killed at age 22. I regret I did not FIGHT to make his father pay appropriate child support. We suffered, my credit suffered because I couldn't pay all of my bills. I regret all the ''what ifs'' of losing my child. What if I had listened to him, turned the car around and gave him a drink instead? Vogle
I regret my second marriage. To quote Waylon Jennings: ''If I'd killed him when I met him, I'd be out of jail by now.'' Mary
I regret moving out West (so hastily).
I regret not having moved to Europe (for at least a little while).
I regret not seeing so many things coming. Where was I looking???
I regret not seizing every opportunity I have been presented with.
I regret my pettiness.
I regret being too nice.
I regret being too mean.
I regret being angry.
I regret fretting over things I cannot control and not focusing on those that I can.
I regret not having done this exercise on my own; it's quite cathartic.
I regret having regrets. Bill
I have no real regrets. Oh, there are things I sometimes wish I had done differently, but then I realize that those different paths may have caused me to not meet my wife and have our two children. Lex
I regret flaunting the good things I had. When you have something good, protect it, because sooner or later someone will get jealous and try to take it or ruin it.
I regret not shopping around more thoroughly for graduate schools.
I regret not studying philosophy, psychology and economics as an undergrad. Searching for the truth is important to everyday life; it's not fluff.

If the American political process had any integrity, winning candidates would grab the microphone on election night and say, ''Hey, all you haters out there, guess what? I so totally won! Now I'm the boss of you. This is going to be awesome.''
Some also-rans, meanwhile, would look mournfully out at the crowd and say: ''Wow, this is so much more humiliating than I thought it would be. Well, I guess while I'm up here I should say a few thanks-for-nothings: The get-out-the-vote team? Heckuva job, fellas. Same goes for whoever sent me to the debate in that Captain America costume. Big shout-out to the finance committee, though. They're over at the cash bar. Those guys know how to party.'' 
Instead, at the New York State Democratic Party gathering on Tuesday, most of the politicians on the podium followed the established script, leaving the vast numbers of people who bothered to vote -- just kidding, I mean the vast numbers who turned on the evening news -- with very little reason to care what was said.
Senator Charles E. Schumer began by expressing his gratitude. ''Thank you,'' he said, ''first and foremost to the voters of New York, at whose pleasure I serve.'' It was a commendable note of humility, somewhat undercut by the setting: the six state flags set against a wall-size Stars and Stripes, the cheering crowds, the swooning campaign workers, the delegation of Sikhs snaking through the cluster of Hasidic men holding cellphone cameras aloft.
Mr. Schumer flashed a thumbs-up sign in that tight-fisted, unexpressive way that only elected officials seem to do. He mentioned every corner of the state. And then he touched on every point on his platform -- even going so far as to suggest that this economy of ours could use some improving. Maybe when you run for office it's like what your mother used to tell you about crossing your eyes: do it enough and you get stuck that way.
What purpose are election-night speeches meant to serve? To whom should they be addressed? Until last Sunday, when he died at the age of 82, Theodore C. Sorensen would have been the man to ask: He wrote John F. Kennedy's most soaring words. But on the night that he was elected president, Kennedy kept it simple. After quoting telegrams he'd received from the White House, he thanked those who had supported him, acknowledged the hard road ahead and committed himself to the job. All told, his own words -- said to be extemporaneous -- came to a paragraph.
On Tuesday, Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, talking as fast as you've ever heard a politician speak, went on for six and a half minutes.
Taking the stage alone, dressed all in black, she ran through what seemed like every crowd-pleasing issue she could think of: the value of ''made in America''; the pressures on small businesses; the idea that Washington is broken; the heroism of military families; the urgency of ''a bright future for all.'' It was like political Mad Libs: fill in the blanks to generate cheers -- at the break-neck pace of an Aaron Sorkin character, or one of those fine-print announcers at the end of pharmaceutical commercials. Why was she still running so fast? Didn't anyone tell her she had already won?
Far from that victory party at the Hilton New York ballroom, Carl P. Paladino was the only candidate brave enough to stray from the unadventurous script. And by stray, I mean threaten his opponent with a beat-down.
''I have a message for Andrew Cuomo, the next governor of New York,'' Mr. Paladino said, brandishing a bright orange bat. ''You can grab this handle and bring the people with you to Albany,'' he offered, raising the bat to his shoulder, ''or you can leave it untouched and run the risk of having it wielded against you.''
Those lines have been much quoted, by commentators so thrown by the unfamiliar whiff of candor that they characterized the Republican candidate's message as a veiled threat. There is nothing veiled about ''I'm coming after you with a baseball bat.'' Mr. Paladino gets points for candor. For anger maintenance, not so much.
But after all it was Andrew M. Cuomo's night. From the minute he took the podium, he seemed a different man from the one on the campaign trail. He radiated generosity, seriousness of purpose, self-confidence without hubris. In ringing cadences, he spoke of a state united in optimism and opportunity.
''Yes, we are upstate and downstate, but we are one state, because we are New York,'' he said. ''Yes, we are black and we are white and we are brown, but we are one state because we are New York.'' Rich and poor. Gay and straight.
''And that's what this day proves,'' he continued. ''The people of the state listened to their better angels. The people of this state today say you're not going to divide us. You're not going to separate us. You can try it someplace else but you're not going to sell that in New York.''
It was the last thing anyone had the right to expect at that hour, in that setting, after an election that drew about 40 percent of registered voters; it was a genuinely stirring address.
There is something to be said for Mr. Paladino's refusal to hide his hurt feelings -- and for whatever sporting goods store stocks those day-glow baseball bats. But as for me, next time I get the chance, I'm voting for Mr. Cuomo's speechwriter.

HEADLINE: A Mixed Forecast

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to the housing market, predictions are perilous business. A market that looked as if it was verging on a renaissance one month could, depending on the factors that go into analyzing it, look pretty lousy the next.
This has certainly been the case in New York City of late. The local rollercoaster comes amid dark news on the national housing market; and there are indications that the New York market may not be as resilient to the country's economic woes in 2011 as it was in 2010. 
For example, if you take a look at Manhattan data for October, from an analysis by StreetEasy.com, the number of newly signed contracts represented about the same number as in October 2007, a year before the housing crash, during a period considered a relatively healthy benchmark for the market. Any sign of normalcy is said to be good news these days.
The city's biggest brokerages are reporting that their agents have been busy, and October is traditionally a strong month on the real estate calendar, which flew into chaos in 2008, 2009 and parts of 2010.
Also, August was a slow month for contracts signed -- another factor more typical of the precrash days. And because of the lag time between signings and closings -- typically about 60 days -- that slowness resulted in data showing sluggish sales in October: another sign of normalcy.
Still, even with the higher volume of signed contracts in October -- which would then be expected to show strong sales in December -- average asking prices this October were down by 11 percent compared with October 2007, and the units selling were smaller, with deeper price cuts, according to Sofia Song, the vice president for research of StreetEasy.com.
''It's a different climate,'' Ms. Song said.
Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, who analyzes market data for Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that despite the bursts of ''happy housing news'' in 2010, driven in part by the federal tax credit that spurred home-buying early in the year, he expected the 2011 New York market to be weaker.
Mortgage interest rates are starting to creep back up from record lows; unemployment is still stubbornly high; and banks remain extremely strict on lending.
There are also uncertainties that could stall buying for the rest of 2010 and into 2011, and perhaps the biggest is whether Wall Street bonuses will be fat, slim, or somewhere in between. There have been mixed reports. Some have recently indicated that bonuses may fall far short of last year's, which were ample enough to help spur buying in early 2010.
''If the bonuses are big as we go into 2011,'' said Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of the Corcoran Group, ''we'll have the wind behind us. If the bonuses are down, the wind is at our face and it's a tougher climb.''
There are also other question marks, including how the election will affect the market, particularly whether Congress will stop increases in capital gains and estate taxes, two key rates that heavily influence buying and selling decisions.
In 2011 the long-term capital gains tax is due to increase to 20 percent from 15 percent, and estates of $1 million or more would be taxable at top rates of 55 percent. But with the Republicans winning the majority in the House, lawmakers could step in to stop those changes, Mr. Miller said.
While acknowledging that the near future is a great unknown, city brokerages are clinging to a few factors that they say show the New York market will continue to fare better in 2011 than the national housing market.
Several brokerages pointed to an increase in foreign investment in New York real estate in recent months. A few also said that there had been a recent increase in sales of high-end properties -- those listed for $10 million and above -- the kinds of deals that for the most part had been rare since the crash.
The volume of transactions and the prices of properties in the luxury niche are still well below those before the crash, but sales at the high end can promote consumer confidence, brokers say, because of the message they send: people who can choose where to park their cash are spending money on real estate.
''We were not seeing those deals,'' said Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens. ''But the activity is returning.''
Some brokerages say that there are built-in protections from a meaningful housing dip in New York, among them the city's comparatively low housing inventory. Markets elsewhere are still flooded with inventory, particularly from new developments, but the city's unsold housing supply has returned to typically low levels, which means that one key to market health -- the relationship of supply to demand -- isn't out of kilter.
Dorothy Herman, the president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, said she disagreed with predictions of a weaker 2011, saying she believed the market would very likely be no better or no worse than 2010, but would ''move sideways.''
Even so, as Ms. Liebman said: ''There is still no place in the market for overpriced property. Buyers are still very cautious about their willingness to purchase; financing has not eased up; and co-op boards are tougher than ever.''

To the Editor:
Re ''How Immigrants Create More Jobs'' (Economic View, Oct. 31): 
If shoes and televisions and batteries and apple juice were found only in museums, I might be able to accept Tyler Cowen's assertion in the column that ''more workers have probably been displaced by machines'' than by any economic conditions outside our borders.
Immigration's effect on the job market is not the issue here. But low-cost foreign competition and offshoring have taken many jobs from our country. Recent articles on China's dominance in the market for rare earth metals, for example, show how low wages and lax environmental regulation virtually destroyed our own production of these important metals.

HEADLINE: Goldikova Sets Record With 3rd Straight Title

BYLINE: By JIM SQUIRES

 BODY:
Jim Squires is the breeder of the 2001 Kentucky Derby winner, Monarchos, and the author of ''Horse of a Different Color'' and ''Headless Horsemen.''
Having somehow -- miraculously, I suspect -- made a living for two decades breeding thoroughbred horses, no horse racing event has been more important to me than the Breeders' Cup, which along with the Kentucky Derby each year constitutes the sport's lone escape route from obscurity.
Once again this year under the twin spires of Churchill Downs horse racing will attempt to put to its best foot forward, actually the four feet and pricked ears of the giant charismatic mare Zenyatta. Her peerless quest for an undefeated 20-race career and a second victory over the world's top male horses in the Breeders' Cup Classic is precisely the kind of attention-getting drama the sport needs to prolong its survival. 
Breeding, owning, training, riding or even being around a horse that gets to the Breeders' Cup or the Kentucky Derby is the goal of everybody in the industry. It is what makes our world go around. Only at these two events will a global television audience see tens of thousands of live human beings seemingly having a great time as they do at European soccer matches, N.F.L. games and Nascar races. And as a result of this experience, we hope some new players will show up at our next yearling sale and become what the industry needs most desperately - a new owner.
Of all American industries, none is still trapped more deeply in the Great American Recession than breeders of thoroughbred horses. Doubters or disputers of this claim must come up with better evidence than the degree of failure of which we can boast at the last three yearling auctions. Each of three sales - the Fasig-Tipton auctions at Timonium, Md., and Lexington, and the giant Keeneland September, an industry bellwether -- all produced ''spin'' headlines suggesting that a bottom had been reached and things were looking up. These were on increases in gross and average from their pathetic 2009 predecessors, though neither measure was ever an accurate barometer of industry health.
But the facts are these: Of 1,813 horses offered in the two Fasig-Tipton sales during October, less than 1 percent sold profitably or at break-even rate. More alarming are the results of the greatest and most important sale, the 14-day session of September Keeneland. Independent studies of the results show that fewer than 600 of 4,857 horses cataloged either broke even or turned a profit. And the overwhelming majority of those were sold early in the first five days.
During the last half of the sale, when 2,500 yearlings were cataloged, I counted fewer than 150 in the profitable column. A far more sophisticated assessment by the breeder Rob Whiteley, which included historical data, concluded that in 2008, thoroughbred breeders were selling one yearling for break-even or profit and four at a loss, and this year they have sold at a 1 in 6 ratio.
Any way they are spun, the 2010 sales have been simply another chapter in a long-running disaster story. At best, the business is 10 percent profitable for breeders. Any cataloged horse later withdrawn or bought back is unlikely ever to produce a return. The overwhelming majority inevitably must be put in training for 2-year-old under tack sales or racing, both of which require more investment and carry higher risk of reward.
The ''good'' news that foal crops are decreasing yearly as real breeders go broke and speculators flee is offset by the blatant sale lesson that demand for horses is shrinking even faster than production. Although various segments of the thoroughbred business frequently operate as if they have no relationship with the other, there is no denying that the future of the breeding industry and its Breeders' Cup showcase depends on the sport's ability to right itself and attract new participants into a game where the odds of an owner making money are even worse than those for breeders. Experts estimate profitability for a racehorse owner at 8 percent or less.
So what beside the chance of owning a Zenyatta can attract them? Fair treatment, honest dealings, a level, drug-free playing field, some form of industry leadership - and a great experience at the track.
But consider this. It can be argued there is no better place to race or watch racing than magnificent Keeneland Race Course in Lexington, where on the last day of its October meeting, 12,000 people showed up in wonderful autumn weather for a modest program featuring two stakes races - a crowd larger than Belmont could attract for a multiple Grade I card earlier in the month and of a magnitude existing only in the dreams of most racetrack owners.
One of my luncheon companions that day was the enthusiastic owner of a horse headed for the Breeders' Cup that earlier that morning he had watched work on the Keeneland track. He is precisely the kind of the owner for which the sport thirsts -- a prosperous individual willing and able to invest in a business with an 8 percent chance of return. In recent years, one of the best trainers in the business and a bloodstock agent I know have spent literally hundreds of thousands of his dollars on horses at Keeneland and other sales.
But this owner was almost a no-show that day, having been blocked at the front door of the lovely clubhouse by the dress code police. Although he wore the appropriate coat and necktie -- lack of which is a well-known barrier to admission -- the problem was his pants. To the dress cop, his pants resembled the dreaded denim, a fabric worn by every horseman who ever lived - but not in the Keeneland clubhouse.
To gain admission, this big-time owner was required to exchange his ''denim-looking'' trousers for some cotton khakis that Keeneland provides as part of a uniform for its workers. The offending pants from which he was required to part were actually a pair of French designer britches for which he had recently paid $500 in Paris. ''Some kind of new weave,'' he said.
''I almost turned around and went home,'' he said, heading for the window with a wad of cash in his cotton khakis. ''Now I am wondering why I didn't.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: If They Can Make It Here

BYLINE: By MONICA KHEMSUROV

 BODY:
RICH BRILLIANT WILLING
When Theo Richardson, Charles Brill and Alex Williams, three baby-faced graduates of the Rhode Island School of Design, first appeared in 2007 with a floor lamp inspired by graphs and pick-up sticks, they were filled with energy and youthful bravado: they christened themselves Rich Brilliant Willing. Exhaustive self-promoters and occasional party crashers, they seemed ready to storm the offices of Cappellini or Moroso, demanding a shot at the big time. But if the big time has finally arrived for these 20-somethings, who introduced four products with four different companies in the past year, it's because they've earned it. By financing their own studio projects, they've been able to develop a colorful mix-and-match aesthetic that is both industrial and playful, one that has caught the eye of brands like SCP and Artecnica -- a rare feat for young American furniture designers. ''We've learned to know the difference between what will be a feather in your cap and what will actually help you build a business,'' says Williams (center). The group's Bright Side Lights for Artecnica, a cast-glass pendant inspired by old telephone-pole insulators and Mason jars, also happens to be its most mature effort to date. 
Says Richardson (right), ''We've started to develop our own voice.'' Sittings editor: Andreas Kokkino.
ROANNE ADAMS
The graphic designer Roanne Adams is something of a patron saint for emerging New York fashion designers. From the office she shares with the Web site Refinery29, she has spent the past four years helping to establish a handful of promising young labels, offering them full-service branding and art direction on a shoestring while balancing her books with corporate clients like Rachael Ray. Adams has developed Fashion Week presentations for Timo Weiland and Abigail Lorick (for whom she transformed a Midtown loft into what looked like a post-apocalyptic garden party) and designed Bodkin's memorable origami invitation, which contained an air plant. And last year, she helped the jewelry designer Monique Pean win a CFDA award by creating a brand book with a 25,000-year-old mammoth bone inlaid in its cover. Adams, who cites Guy Bourdin and Paul Rand as influences, admits that she's often hired to help companies ''communicate their hip, downtown cachet.'' Still, ''we're not the edgiest firm, nor is that what we're going for. I try to boil clients' ideas down to an essential thought or image -- I'd rather simplify than knowingly design something trendy.''
LEON RANSMEIER
When Salman Rushdie and Andre Balazs convened at the Standard Hotel in Manhattan one evening last May to host a party, the guest of honor wasn't a celebrity but rather a $3 plastic pen. Not just any pen, though: it's a 98 percent biodegradable one, with nontoxic ink inside sleek matte-black housing, and it's the first product from the new eco-chic brand DBA. Indeed, under the creative direction of Leon Ransmeier, a 31-year-old New York native, even the most mundane objects, from dish racks to humidifiers to writing instruments, become wildly covetable. Whether for DBA or his own studio, Ransmeier's goal is to make intuitive products whose forms advertise their function, like the space heater with a simple built-in handle and cord spool, or the desk -- now produced by Wright 21 in Chicago -- that indulges obsessive pile-makers with open paper trays instead of drawers. ''For me, reductionism just makes it easy for people to use products in the best way possible,'' says Ransmeier, who lives in a spartan one-room apartment downtown and collects doorstops from Modernist landmarks. Although his breakthrough product was a light shade for the design company Droog, his sensibility is more Japanese than Dutch. ''I'm not interested in conceptual one-liners,'' he says. ''I want there to be a very clear reason behind everything I do.''
JONAS DAMON
Though he's been a fixture in the New York design world since 2001, when he returned from London to start his own studio, Jonas Damon has yet to experience that breakout moment. He's spent most of his career behind the scenes, first helping Tom Dixon transform Habitat and now as the creative director of the industrial design mega-firm Frog Design. ''Being a design star was never my goal,'' he admits. But as Damon's repertory of charmingly approachable products continues to swell, thanks in part to his collaboration with the local manufacturer Areaware, so has his reputation. First up was an L.E.D. alarm clock composed of four rearrangable black cubes, each displaying a single red digit, that was inspired by 1980s supercomputers. Then came a perforated vacuum-tube radio with a Dieter Rams vibe and a wooden iPad holder in the shape of a retro TV. By channeling his fascination with bygone design eras, Damon hopes to evoke a shared nostalgia, and judging from his pending deals with the lighting company Roll & Hill and the design shop Matter, he's succeeding. Quite a switch from the gadgets he designs at his day job. ''Frog is on the cutting edge of technology,'' he says. ''The things we make here are all five years ahead of us, so in my spare time I enjoy looking in the other direction.''
COMMONWEALTH
Upon graduating from Columbia's architecture school in 2005, David Boira and Zoe Coombes, the huband-and-wife founders of Commonwealth, set up shop in a small warehouse in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with a CNC milling machine. But it was in the name of art rather than commerce: the couple invited friends to collaborate with them and displayed the results in their studio gallery. And then came the economic crisis. ''I don't want to chalk all cultural change up to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers,'' Coombes says, ''but art is often the first thing to go.'' She and Boira soon realized they'd been more interested in making furniture all along. Yet given their infatuation with technology and their love of the tactile, Boira explains, ''the question became, How do we use robots and CNC mills to make furniture that's voluptuous rather than cold and geometric?'' The answer is found in their L.E.D. Truncheon lamps, designed for Matter's in-house line, a warm wooden object created with a complex industrial milling process. By the end of the year they'll bring out a collection of wooden pieces that have a soft, almost quilted effect, and they're currently exploring the possibility of making an amorphous bookshelf with Ductal, an ultra-light concrete. ''We do pretty weird work, at the heart of it,'' Coombes says. ''But we want to make forms that have a presence.''
RAFAEL DE CARDENAS
If the interior designer Rafael de Cardenas has become the go-to guy for New York's young and adventurous set, it certainly helps that he grew up in the city and runs with a downtown crowd. But it's his penchant for pushing ideas one step past the expected -- like the dazzling graphics he created for Ohwow's alternative art spaces and the Nike Stadium store, or the fuchsia foyer he did for the makeup artist Jeanine Lobell -- that has attracted clients like Parker Posey and Jessica Stam. ''If they're not artists and designers themselves, my clients all like to be surrounded by art, and feel they can take more risks,'' says de Cardenas, who set up his studio, Architecture at Large, in 2006. ''I'm assuming they aren't hiring me because they want something boring and traditional.'' That said, de Cardenas, a U.C.L.A. architecture grad and former men's-wear designer for Calvin Klein, loves to mine the past for inspiration, drawing from sources as seemingly unconnected as the Viennese architect Adolf Loos and Barbara D'Arcy, who created the display rooms at Bloomingdale's in the 1960s and 1970s. When it comes to the mismatched patterns and reflective surfaces of his colorful interiors, there's a Surrealist strain as well. ''My spaces are meant to have a sense of otherworldliness that makes you feel disoriented,'' de Cardenas says. ''They put you in a different place.''

HEADLINE: Some Venti Tunes To Go With That Latte

BYLINE: By DANA JENNINGS

 BODY:
TIMOTHY JONES would blush at the notion, but he's one of the quiet shapers of American culture.
Mr. Jones and his team of shrewd ears are responsible for the music heard daily in each of the some 11,100 Starbucks coffee shops in the United States and Canada, and for the CDs the stores sell. Most Starbucks are open 18 hours a day, and about 60 songs are played every four hours, so that means the home of the venti Caramel Frappuccino and Pumpkin Spice Latte is laying nearly three million musical spins on its customers each day.
When asked about his musical aesthetic in a recent conversation with Dana Jennings, Mr. Jones said: ''The coffeehouse seems to beckon to singer-songwriters, Chicago blues, Ella and Miles, soul, the blues and reggae. When selecting music, we use a coffeehouse filter.'' 
Neko Case, Fleet Foxes, Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings and Madeleine Peyroux -- you know, singers heard on the CD players of the hipper Volvo wagons -- are among more recent acts that have passed the coffeehouse test. ''The musical garden is so alive right now,'' Mr. Jones said. ''The music is there. The artists are there.''
Mr. Jones, who's 62, was a music man before he was a coffee man. He ran a record store -- his big sellers were bands like the Smiths, Echo and the Bunnymen and XTC -- called Urban Renewal Records in Seattle until 1987, when he went to work for the Starbucks across the street at Pike Place Market. There were only seven Starbucks back then.
Though selling coffee Mr. Jones was still smitten with music. And in 1995 he was the prime mover behind the first Starbucks compilation CD, ''Blue Note Blend,'' a jazz disc that included Dexter Gordon, Sarah Vaughan and Cannonball Adderley.
These days most of the coffee shops have an in-house player that can hold up to 15,000 songs. The player is refreshed by an 18-hour default program every four weeks that focuses mostly on newer music and titles on sale at the stores. Managers have the latitude, though, to pick and choose from among a dozen genres -- jazz, Cuban, soul, Chicago blues, reggae and pop crooners -- to match the moods of their customers. ''We do have a store in Laguna Beach, Calif., that often plays reggae music 24/7,'' Mr. Jones said. ''That's the vibe that store wishes to create.''
Weekends are made for fresh coffee and fresh music, so we asked Mr. Jones, who is sensitive to both the time of day and to the passing of the seasons when he picks Starbucks music, to choose 10 songs for a Sunday morning -- songs to be sipped and savored in the chill and brilliant heart of fall.
''When you make a mixtape of songs, you're passing along how they move you, how they excite you,'' Mr. Jones wrote in an e-mail. ''This is music I had to share with you on a Sunday -- a time of reflection. It's the first day of the week. You should have gotten some rest, you can think about doing something different, starting over, making a plan.''
'ALMOST LIKE BEING IN LOVE' (1952 VERSION), LESTER YOUNG & OSCAR PETERSON ''I was in Italy, traveling with my family, and we were having breakfast -- and all of a sudden I realized the music overhead was enthralling. There was a swinging happiness in the air. It was turned way up, and I was just so taken by its power. I asked the guy who it was, and he shouted back, 'It's Lester Young!' ''
'Bye Bye Blackbird' -- Miles Davis ''Everybody knows 'Kind of Blue' is the album, and this isn't from that album, but what I love about this song is you can almost hear the lyrics when Miles plays.''
'BUMPIN' ON SUNSET' -- WES MONTGOMERY ''This is the canvas on which you can paint whatever: What can I do? What have I done? Sunday is a day of rest, but it's also a day to move. This song just hands you the paintbrush.''
'LIMBO JAZZ' -- COLEMAN HAWKINS AND DUKE ELLINGTON ''This song is family. We're all together in the room, the people I love. It beckons us to talk with each other, maybe even dance.''
'A FINE ROMANCE' -- ELLA FITZGERALD ''This is Ella, the songstress you can never get enough of on a Sunday -- or any day, for that matter. Her voice is so warm, so casual. It's like listening to a letter from home as she reaches into your soul.''
'SUMMER WIND' -- FRANK SINATRA ''Frank sets the bar for all singers. You can't listen to 'Summer Wind' without turning the pages within oneself.''
'IS THIS LOVE' -- BOB MARLEY AND THE WAILERS ''Marley owns reggae, is reggae. This beat on a Sunday is irresistible. For this moment there is no oppression to fight. There's only Marley's love of life.''
'KILLING THE BLUES' -- ROBERT PLANT AND ALISON KRAUSS '' 'Raising Sand' is one of my favorite albums. This song is about the blues, but it's when you're kicking the blues, getting on the other side of them.''
'WHITE WINTER HYMNAL' -- FLEET FOXES ''I can't stop listening to this record. I pass this song along because it's simply lost during rush hour. Give it a two-lane highway on a Sunday afternoon, and you will hear an ancient forest hymn.''
'FOR EMMA' -- BON IVER ''This is the starkest part of what your Sunday could be. This is you against all odds, you in search of others, in search of inspiration -- it becomes fuel for the soul.''
'PAPER WINGS' -- GILLIAN WELCH ''How does a gal from Brentwood, Calif., get me thinking 'Grapes of Wrath'? There's so much vulnerability in this song, and we all need to feel vulnerable at times.

HEADLINE: The D.I.Y. Foreign-Aid Revolution

 BODY:
It was a pleasure to read Nicholas D. Kristof's article on ''do it yourself'' foreign assistance. The efforts of private American citizens to advance human-development causes at the community level are exceptional stories that are frequently untold. 
From the perspective of an organization that supports Americans to volunteer in the Muslim world, I'd like to add two things. First, this kind of service doesn't just affect day-to-day challenges in education, rights and health. Through the creation of substantive people-to-people partnerships, we can change communities' impressions of America, as well as our own views of the ''other.'' Second, you don't have to be a ''full-time hero'' to make a difference.
There are opportunities to volunteer on a short-term basis to build a house, teach a class and change a life as one of America's unofficial ambassadors. The first step is to realize that we can create change, and the next step is to find the right opportunity to do it. Thank you for helping to raise awareness.
BENJAMIN ORBACH Director, America's Unofficial Ambassadors New York
What is missing from official and citizen-led development efforts today is a connection to a larger vision of development, a premise and a strategy that can aggregate and align ''little'' interventions with larger development results, much as we saw reflected in the East Asian miracle and Latin America's resurgence and in what we see today in Africa's Rural Futures program, the latter a wider vision and premise put forward by the New Partnership for Africa's Development (Nepad).
OWEN CYLKE Director, World Wide Fund for Nature Macroeconomics Programme Office Washington
I wholeheartedly agree with Kristof's central argument that ''passionate individuals with great ideas'' can work to ''chip away at global challenges.'' Kristof is right to state that ''women in particular [are] finding creative ways to help the world's most vulnerable people, many of them also women.''
Kristof mentions Ela Bhatt, who founded SEWA in India, and then goes on to focus the rest of the article solely on Americans who give up financial security and comfort in order to work in the global south. I have no doubt that experiencing lice, lack of dating opportunities and failed relationships as results of working toward global justice are some significant hardships. However, women (and men) in the global south experience threatened and actual detention, loss of livelihood -- including confiscation of land -- physical, sexual and emotional abuse and other significant human-rights abuses because of their advocacy and work for social change in their communities and countries. Ignoring these portraits of incredible social-justice work skews the reader's view, imparting an idea that social change begins with a well-meaning outsider.

HEADLINE: The Cost of a Vote Goes Up

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
The votes are in; the money has been counted. We can start assessing the damage to American democracy caused by the Supreme Court's decision to allow corporations, unions and their lobby groups a free hand to deploy their money to elect the candidates of their choice. Already one thing seems certain: Votes are getting more expensive.
In the midterm elections four years ago, candidates and their friends spent a little over $2.8 billion, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, to garner some 86 million votes. The cost was about $33 per voter. Data from this week's election is still coming in. But it seems that total spending will hit $4 billion, which would make this year's voters about $10 more expensive. 
Records are being broken. Two years ago, the Republican Sandy Treadwell spent $84 per voter trying to unseat Kirsten Gillibrand, then the representative from New York's 20th District. That is likely to be eclipsed by the bill for the Tea Partier Sharron Angle and her supporters, who seem to have spent $87 per voter in a losing bid to unseat Senator Harry Reid, who spent some $74 for his voters.
Supporters of free-market elections argue that there is nothing untoward about this money: ads bought by candidates and their friends are meant to inform voters, so they can choose well. If the best-financed candidates often win, the argument goes, it's because money flocks to the best candidates. And the moneyed can lose: the Republican wrestling mogul Linda McMahon spent $42 million and still lost her bid for a Senate seat from Connecticut.
But as we contemplate this rush of money, which shows signs only of increasing, it is worth pausing to remember an era not too long ago when modern ethical niceties did not stand in the way of the purchase of power. In 19th-century New York, newspapers quoted the price of votes. In 1880, The Elizabethtown Post quoted a vote in Ulster County at $25. In 1885, The Elmira Daily Advertiser quoted votes from $10 to $27.
''When a good man for a good purpose buys the vote of a fellow man, the voter -- being a principal and a sovereign -- is free to do as he chooses; the act is right,'' thundered the minister Thomas K. Beecher in The Watkins Express in Schuyler County, N.Y., on Nov. 13, 1879. The practice died only when the secret ballot introduced in 1890 made it possible for voters to deceive their paymasters. So political parties took to paying sympathizers of the opposition to stay home instead.
Paying voters directly is probably more efficient than spending on TV ads. Campaign spending today wastes money on people who would have voted for a candidate for free. A study of House elections by the economist Steven Levitt concluded that a candidate would have to increase spending by the equivalent of some $170,000 in today's dollars to boost her share of the vote by one-third of a percent.
Efficiency aside, the flood of money could erode the integrity of America's democracy. Surely Americans would never want their system to be as corrupt as, say, Thailand's, in which vote buying is commonplace. Researchers studying the 1996 general election found that one-third of Thai heads of household had been offered money for their votes. The average price was 678 baht -- about $27 at the time.
Of course, there are differences between buying a vote and paying for a TV ad. Politicians who pay for votes will feel less constrained by policy commitments. Voters who take their cash are less likely to keep an eye on the quality of governance. But that is not the only way that money can harm democracy.
In a statement about the Supreme Court's decision to allow unrestricted private financing of elections, Transparency International pointed out that it ''increases the likelihood that politicians will accept campaign funding from corporations in exchange for policy favors and that candidates will feel indebted to corporations that engage in large independent spending in their favor or against their opponents.''
American campaign strategists use attack ads rather than cash. But their purpose is often the same: to get voters to ignore their self-interest.
Today, Transparency International puts the United States in 22nd place in terms of how corrupt its institutions are perceived to be. That is still 56 places ahead of Thailand. But the United States is slipping down the rungs. Last year it was in 19th place. This is what happens when you put a price on political power.

HEADLINE: Chasing Pirates: Inside Microsoft's War Room

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE

 BODY:
AS the sun rose over the mountains circling Los Reyes, a town in the Mexican state of Michoacan, one morning in March 2009, a caravan of more than 300 heavily armed law enforcement agents set out on a raid.
All but the lead vehicle turned off their headlights to evade lookouts, called ''falcons,'' who work for La Familia Michoacana, the brutal Mexican cartel that controls the drug trade. This time, the police weren't hunting for a secret stash of drugs, guns or money. Instead, they looked to crack down on La Familia's growing counterfeit software ring.
The police reached the house undetected, barreled in and found rooms crammed with about 50 machines used to copy CDs and make counterfeit versions of software like Microsoft Office and Xbox video games. They arrested three men on the spot, who were later released while the authorities investigate the case. ''The entire operation was very complicated and risky,'' says a person close to the investigation, who demanded anonymity out of fear for his life. 
The raid added to a body of evidence confirming La Familia's expansion into counterfeit software as a low-risk, high-profit complement to drugs, bribery and kidnapping. The group even stamps the disks it produces with ''FMM,'' which stands for Familia Morelia Michoacana, right alongside the original brand of various software makers.
The cartel distributes the software through thousands of kiosks, markets and stores in the region and demands that sales workers meet weekly quotas, this person says, describing the operation as a ''form of extortion'' on locals.
The arrival of organized criminal syndicates to the software piracy scene has escalated worries at companies like Microsoft, Symantec and Adobe. Groups in China, South America and Eastern Europe appear to have supply chains and sales networks rivaling those of legitimate businesses, says David Finn, Microsoft's anti-piracy chief. Sometimes they sell exact copies of products, but often peddle tainted software that opens the door to other electronic crime.
''As long as intellectual property is the lifeblood of this company, we have to go protect it,'' Mr. Finn says.
Microsoft has adopted a hard-line stance against counterfeiting. It has set up a sophisticated anti-piracy operation that dwarfs those of other software makers; the staff includes dozens of former government intelligence agents from the United States, Europe and Asia, who use a host of ''CSI''-like forensic technology tools for finding and convicting criminals.
But the hunt for pirates carries with it a cost to Microsoft's reputation.
The company's profit from Windows and Office remains the envy of the technology industry, and critics contend that Microsoft simply charges too much for them. In countries like India, where Microsoft encourages local police officers to conduct raids, the company can come off as a bully willing to go after its own business partners if they occasionally peddle counterfeit software to people who struggle to afford the real thing.
''It is better for the Indian government to focus on educating its children rather than making sure royalties go back to Microsoft,'' says Eben Moglen, a law professor at Columbia Law School and a leading advocate of free software.
Mr. Finn argues that Microsoft has no choice but to be aggressive in its fight, saying its immense network of resellers and partners can't make a living in areas flush with counterfeit software. He says consumers and businesses are being coaxed into buying counterfeit products that either don't work or do serious harm by clearing the way for various types of electronic fraud.
And, crucially, the counterfeit software cuts into Microsoft's potential profit. A software industry trade group estimated the value of unlicensed software for all companies at $51.4 billion last year.
The most vociferous critics of Microsoft and the overall proprietary software industry describe the anti-piracy crusade as a sophisticated dog-and-pony show. They say the software makers tolerate a certain level of piracy because they would rather have people use their products -- even if counterfeit -- than pick up lower-cost alternatives. At the same time, the critics say, the software companies conduct periodic raids to remind customers and partners that playing by the rules makes sense.
''It has always been in Microsoft's interests for software to be available at two different prices -- expensive for the people that can afford it and inexpensive for those that can't,'' Mr. Moglen says. ''At the end of the day, if you're a monopolist, you have to tolerate a large number of copies you don't get paid for just to keep everyone hooked.''
Microsoft has demonstrated a rare ability to elicit the cooperation of law enforcement officials to go after software counterfeiters and to secure convictions -- not only in India and Mexico, but also in China, Brazil, Colombia, Belize and Russia. Countries like Malaysia, Chile and Peru have set up intellectual-property protection squads that rely on Microsoft's training and expertise to deal with software cases.
As Mr. Moglen sees it, these efforts underscore a certain level of desperation on the part of American companies and the economy of ideas on which they have come to rely. ''This is the postindustrial United States,'' he says. ''We will make other governments around the world go around enforcing rights primarily held by Americans. This is a very important part of American thinking around how the country will make its living in the 21st century.''
MICROSOFT'S pursuit of software counterfeiters begins in Dublin, at one of the company's 10 crime labs.
Donal Keating, a physicist who leads Microsoft's forensics work, has turned the lab into an anti-piracy playpen full of microscopes and other equipment used to analyze software disks. Flat-screen monitors show data about counterfeit sales, and evidence bags almost overflow with nearly flawless Windows and Office fakes. Mr. Keating serves as the CD manufacturing whiz on what amounts to Microsoft's version of the A-Team, clad in business-casual attire.
The undercover operative of this group is Peter Anaman, a lawyer who was born in Ghana and educated in England; he taught hand-to-hand combat to soldiers during a stint in the French army and then taught himself how to write software. Mr. Anaman has applied his software skills and training to explore a shift in piracy from groups that make CDs to those that offer downloads online.
Through three online personas -- two female and one male -- Mr. Anaman chats with and sometimes befriends hackers in Russia and Eastern Europe who use stolen credit card numbers to set up hundreds of Web sites and offer products from Microsoft, Adobe and Symantec. ''It is part of gathering human intelligence and tracking relationships,'' Mr. Anaman says.
Through an artificial intelligence system, Microsoft scans the Web for suspicious, popular links and then sends takedown requests to Web service providers, providing evidence of questionable activity. ''The Web sites look professional,'' he says. ''And some of them even offer customer support through call centers in India.''
The counterfeiters, however, have automated systems that replace links that Microsoft deep-sixes. So the company has turned up the dial on its link-removal machine.
''We used to remove 10,000 links a month,'' Mr. Anaman says. ''Now, we're removing 800,000 links a month.''
He describes the groups behind these sites as ''part of the dark Web,'' saying they have links to huge spam, virus and fraud networks. Microsoft's tests of software on some popular sites have shown that 35 percent of the counterfeit software contained harmful code.
Anthony Delaney, who started at Microsoft 25 years ago -- driving a forklift to move boxes of its products for shipment -- has worked his way up to become its piracy data guru.
On one of the flat screens, Mr. Delaney brings up a world map that lets users zoom into a city just as they would if hunting for directions online. But instead of highlighting landmarks and popular stores, the map illuminates Microsoft's retail partners. Hover a mouse over a shop in San Francisco, for example, and you can see how much software it sells, how often Office is sold in tandem with Windows, the failure rate for authentication codes and how many cease-and-desist letters have gone to suspicious sellers in the area.
According to the map, the area within a 50-mile radius of New York City accounted for more than 200 ''actions'' last year, including 165 cease-and-desist warning letters to companies suspected of selling pirated software.
''We can see that only 5 percent of your sales have Office attached to Windows,'' Mr. Delaney says. ''If that's below the average for the area, we may go have a chat or conduct a test purchase.''
This rather eclectic bunch is joined by about 75 other people, including former agents of the I.R.S., F.B.I., Secret Service and Interpol, and former prosecutors -- all of whom work under Mr. Finn.
A former assistant United States attorney in New York, Mr. Finn directs this squad from a Paris office. He says Microsoft spends ''north of $10 million'' a year on its intelligence-gathering operations and an estimated $200 million on developing anti-piracy technology.
Mr. Finn talks at length about Microsoft's need to refine the industry's equivalent of fingerprinting, DNA testing and ballistics through CD and download forensics that can prove a software fake came from a particular factory or person. And his eyes widen as he thinks about advancing this technology to the point that Microsoft can emphasize the piracy issue directly to customers.
''Imagine the day when a consumer finds a link that says, 'Click here if you would like a forensic examination of your disk,' '' Mr. Finn says. ''You put the disk in, the computer reads it and suddenly you see a map of everywhere that counterfeit has been seen all over the world. If people see it in a graphic and visual way, I think they are more likely to help.''
THE software thieves monitored by Microsoft come in various shapes and sizes.
College students, grandmothers and others have been found selling cheap, copied versions of software like Windows, Office, Adobe's Photoshop and Symantec's security software on eBay and other shopping Web sites.
And people unwilling to pay for discounted software, meanwhile, can find free versions of popular products online that offer downloads to all manner of copyrighted material.
Microsoft's investigators, however, spend much of their time examining how large-scale counterfeiters produce copies at factories and then distribute their wares around the globe.
The biggest counterfeit software bust in history occurred in July 2007 in southern China. The Public Security Bureau there and the F.B.I. found a warehouse where workers assembled disks, authentication materials and manuals and prepared them for shipping. All told, investigators found $2 billion worth of counterfeit Microsoft software, including 19 versions of products in 11 languages. Software produced by this syndicate turned up in 36 countries on six continents.
As one means of trying to tell the genuine article from a fake, Microsoft embeds about an inch of a special type of thread in each ''certificate of authenticity'' sticker found on boxes of software and computers. The investigators spotted dozens of spools of counterfeit thread -- 81 miles worth -- at the Chinese warehouse.
Microsoft has found that operations of this scale tend to include all the trappings of legitimate businesses. Workers spend years building up contacts at software resellers around the globe, offering them discounted versions of software. Then they take the orders and send them off via shipping services, Mr. Keating says.
Many Microsoft products make users enter an activation code to register the software and have it work properly. The syndicates trade in stolen versions of these codes as well, and sometimes set up their own online authentication systems to give people the feeling they have a legitimate product. Groups in Russia and Eastern Europe, with various cybercrime operations in play, now use money gained from credit card fraud schemes to buy activation codes.
About a decade ago, only a few companies had the expertise or the $10 million needed to buy machines that could press CDs and DVDs. Today, someone can spend about $100,000 to buy second-hand pressing gear, says Patrick Corbett, the managing director at a CD plant owned by Arvato Digital Services, which produces Microsoft's retail software in Europe.
''Just five years ago, there were five sites in China that supplied the whole country,'' Mr. Corbett says. ''Now these machines are commonplace.''
A prized object in the factory is the stamper, the master copy of a software product that takes great precision to produce. From a single stamper, Arvato can make tens of thousands of copies on large, rapid-fire presses.
Crucially for Mr. Keating, each press leaves distinct identifying markers on the disks. He spends much of his time running CDs through a glowing, briefcase-size machine -- and needs about six minutes to scan a disk and find patterns. Then he compares those markings against a database he has built of CD pressing machines worldwide.
This system allows Microsoft to follow the spread of CDs from factories like the ones in China. The company conducts test purchases of software -- online and in stores -- and receives copies from some of the 300,000 people who have complained about running into counterfeits over the last four years.
Microsoft keeps tight controls over its partners that produce CDs. But counterfeiters get around these measures by stealing stampers and presses, presenting factories with fake paperwork from Microsoft or printing in a factory when it isn't doing official business -- a practice known in the industry as producing ''cabbage.''
To make life harder for the counterfeiters, Microsoft plants messages in the security thread that goes into the authenticity stickers, plays tricks with lettering on its boxes and embosses a holographic film into a layer of lacquer on the CDs.
To the untrained eye, the counterfeit software in Microsoft's labs appears to be exact replicas, right down to the boxes. Chinese counterfeiters mimic the built-in hologram simply by placing a holographic sticker across the entire surface of a CD; then they use other machines to erase some of the unique identifiers found at microscopic levels.
Such tactics have pushed Microsoft to create a new type of digital fingerprinting technology that scans a disk's software code for special defects. The same techniques allow Microsoft to find malicious code that may have been injected in its products.
THE grand question surrounding Microsoft's anti-piracy razzle-dazzle is whether it's worth the cost.
The piracy problems tend to run highest in regions where there is less money to pay for Microsoft's products. Backers of free software like the Linux operating system take aim at these areas, and Microsoft also faces growing competition from Google, which gives away its Office rival to consumers and sells a business version at prices far below what Microsoft typically receives.
''We love Microsoft's heavy-handedness,'' says Jim Zemlin, the executive director of the Linux Foundation, a nonprofit organization. ''We want 100 percent of the people using Windows to pay for it, because in those places where you have a lot of pirated use of Windows, we don't have any cost advantage.''
Microsoft's critics portray its behavior as reactionary, saying the company is trying to protect old business models as new devices and services arrive.
''If people are going to steal something, we sure as hell want them to steal our stuff,'' says Michael Simon, the chief executive of LogMeIn, a company whose software is used in smartphones and tablets. ''When you have a saturated market like Microsoft and have no growth in these devices, then it might be different.''
The anti-piracy tactics employed by Microsoft rub many people in the software industry the wrong way as well.
The Business Software Alliance, which is financed in part by Microsoft and conducts audits and investigations on its behalf, spends about $50 million a year going after counterfeiters and offers rewards to people who report the use of pirated software in their companies. The alliance also finances the oft-cited annual study performed by the research firm IDC that comes up with a dollar amount tied to piracy losses.
Robert J. Scott, a lawyer at Scott & Scott in Dallas, contends like many others that the alliance's figure is too high and that the group draws imprecise conclusions about the purchases that people would have made if they weren't pirating software.
''I don't put much stock in those reports,'' says Mr. Scott, who advises businesses being audited by the alliance and other software companies.
The alliance defends its numbers, and Mr. Finn at Microsoft says the group's figures are accurate. He plays down the central accusation that Microsoft would face less of a piracy threat if it just lowered prices. ''We have seen no connection between piracy rates and price,'' he says, citing the company's own pricing experiments. ''I think it's a canard.''
Meanwhile, Microsoft-sponsored raids and customer audits sometimes have a public relations fallout.
Two years ago in India, Microsoft hired Anup Kumar, a 10-year veteran of the Central Bureau of Investigation, in part to teach the company how to push software piracy cases through the local bureaucracy. When raids followed, many local software sellers chided the government in the local press, saying it bowed to Microsoft's will.
And, last month, Microsoft altered its policies in Russia after a spate of incidents in which local security services seized computers of advocacy groups and opposition newspapers, using the pursuit of stolen software as justification. Microsoft said it would provide a blanket software license for advocacy groups and media outlets, and offer legal aid to such groups caught up in software inquiries.
The protection of intellectual property has become a high-stakes political game where countries that do Microsoft's bidding expect some kind of return on their effort, according to Joseph Menn, author of ''Fatal System Error: The Hunt for the New Crime Lords Who Are Bringing Down the Internet.''
''It's part of the geopolitical process,'' he said, ''and Microsoft has a level of clout that a lot of other folks don't in Washington and in other countries.''
Mr. Finn argues that Microsoft's anti-piracy efforts and training of law enforcement are a benefit to countries that want to build out their tech sectors and show they value intellectual property.
''Intellectual property is a critical engine of economic growth,'' Mr. Finn says. ''That's not just for large companies, but also for small businesses and entire countries. We work with governments that are realizing this is in their best interests.''

HEADLINE: Project Waterfront

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA

 BODY:
STANDING on the roof of the Edge, a luxury waterfront condominium project under construction in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, you can't help but be taken in by the grand sweep of the Manhattan skyline.
But what Jeffrey E. Levine, the developer whose company is building the Edge, sees when he looks to the north are vast swaths of undeveloped land stretching along the Brooklyn and Queens waterfront.
''It is a great opportunity to buy land and warehouse it for development,'' said Mr. Levine, the president of Levine Builders, which operates Douglaston Development, builder of the Edge.
Many other major developers, real estate lawyers and city officials are thinking along similar lines. Even with new construction slowed by a troubled financing environment, the groundwork is being laid for the next great phase of waterfront development in the city. 
The Bloomberg administration recently unveiled a draft of a comprehensive waterfront plan, known as Vision 2020, that includes more than 500 prospective projects costing tens of millions of dollars. These range from efforts to increase access to the water for kayakers and canoeists, to measures to protect against rising sea levels resulting from climate change.
''Vision 2020 is a blueprint for the next 10 years and beyond that will change the way New Yorkers live for generations to come,'' Amanda Burden, the director of the Department of City Planning, said in October at a public hearing on the report's recommendations. She said that the goal was for the water to become the ''sixth borough.''
''The water should become a part of our everyday lives,'' Ms. Burden declared.
After years of aggressive rezoning and more than a decade of environmental cleanup, sizable tracts of land along nearly 600 miles of waterfront in all five boroughs are positioned for development. And despite persistent uncertainty in the real estate market, the dozen or more large-scale residential projects that are soon to begin construction, are under way or were recently completed across the city will provide the foundation for that next phase of building.
That being said, even with the groundwork laid out more clearly than at any time in recent years, a casual reading of the history of development in the city reminds us that the grand plans of today have a way of falling apart if public support, municipal needs and private profit cannot be made to converge.
Borough by Borough
The dozens of large-scale plans by private developers are being matched by equally ambitious city projects. A snapshot of a few projects gives a sense of the scope of what could come.
In Manhattan, where waterfront land is scarce and commands premium prices, construction could begin soon on one of the last large parcels of the Hudson waterfront, in the West 50s, pending approval by the City Council. On the East Side, from South Street Seaport to Harlem -- already the site of a new recreational pier -- the city is betting that its investment of more than $150 million in new piers, parks and greenways will have the same impact that Hudson River Park had on residential and commercial property values on the West Side.
In Brooklyn, developers have put forth ambitious plans for construction near established waterfront neighborhoods in Williamsburg and Greenpoint, including a $1.4 billion plan to turn the former Domino Sugar factory into residential housing with about 2,200 units.
In Queens, the city is planning the largest project of below-market-rate, or affordable, housing to be built in three decades, around 5,000 apartments, on the barren stretch known as Hunters Point. The infrastructure is being put in place to support the new community; developers have submitted bids; the city is expected to pick a winner by the end of the year and to begin construction by spring.
In the Bronx, the city has rezoned large sections of the waterfront to encourage residential development, including the lower part of the Grand Concourse and Hunts Point. The plan would create a greenway along the Bronx River from Hunts Point to Westchester County.
And on Staten Island, the old Navy Homeport, a 35-acre decommissioned base, would be developed into a largely residential neighborhood, with the city investing $33 million in road improvements.
Because one of the traditional hurdles to waterfront development has been lack of public transportation, the city is planning a pilot program that would expand water taxi service along the East River, similar to the service on the Hudson between Manhattan and New Jersey.
The Groundwork
The pace of building will generally correspond with broader economic conditions; even so, several projects are already moving ahead, while developers of other parcels are securing approvals and permits so that they can move quickly when the time is right.
''In the past, when we have faced budgetary constraints, we chose to defer large infrastructure projects,'' said Seth W. Pinsky, the president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation.
''This time we have been able to keep all of our major projects moving forward, and we expect to have shovels in the ground on many of these headline projects within a matter of months.''
By laying the groundwork now, Mr. Pinsky said, ''everything is in place so that when the climate turns, private developers will be able to ride the cycle up from the beginning rather than rush to meet it at the end.''
The result, over the next decade, could be a market larger by tens of thousands of rental apartments and condos -- both affordable housing and luxury homes.
Of course, grand visions have fallen short in the past -- or taken much longer than predicted. Both city officials and developers say using the current lull in the market wisely is critical to waterfront development.
For the more than 250 people who packed into a meeting room in the West Village last month to hear the city's Vision 2020 presentation, the environmental impact of any planned projects was of most concern. Some also expressed the sentiment that the city was too generous with developers.
Although the final draft of the plan is not due until the end of the year, city officials say that their goal is to work with developers in order to get them to pay for public improvements, often through specific provisions written into the zoning regulations.
''This administration's philosophy has long been to seed investments with public money in order to leverage investments by the private sector,'' Mr. Pinsky said.
That can mean developers' spending millions on parks, schools, piers and bulkheads -- costs that play a role in how they price their properties. In this economic climate, some developers are balking at the city's demands.
The Scale of Things
In New York, waterfront parcels tend to be large, underused industrial sites, making it easier for developers to create more ambitious projects than in developed parts of town.
For instance, the Edge, on the East River around North Sixth Street, is the one of the largest condominium projects in Brooklyn. It includes a 30-story tower with 360 luxury units, a 15-story tower with 205 residences and lower-rise buildings with 360 below-market-rate units. Mr. Levine plans one more building on the site but is waiting for the economic forecast to improve before breaking ground.
Similarly, T. F. Cornerstone has been working on an outsize condo/rental development in Long Island City, Queens. In addition to a 498-unit rental building and a 184-unit luxury condo that have been built, four planned rental buildings would add more than 2,600 apartments to the neighborhood and test people's willingness to pay for stunning views in a neighborhood with few services that is still defining itself.
''I think in nearly all instances, the type of development and scale of that development on water's edge is different than what happens inland,'' said Jon McMillan, the director of planning at T. F. Cornerstone. On the waterfront, he said, ''you have kind of a clean slate.''
One of the more ambitious undertakings in Manhattan is the Riverside Center complex being built by the Extell Development Corporation. The project, between 59th and 61st Streets along the Hudson River, recently won a key approval from the City Planning Commission despite complaints that its five residential buildings -- with nearly 3,000 housing units on eight acres -- would overcrowd schools, become an enclave for the wealthy, and skimp on retail space.
Gary Barnett, the president of Extell, said that the ''quantum leap'' in demands being put on developers could even now stifle new construction.
''The question is whether some of these projects will ever get going,'' he said. ''Is it financially feasible because of all the requirements put on them?''
He ran through the list of the things he has been asked to do in order to build Riverside Center: pay for part of a new school; use an expensive architectural plan preferred by the city; mitigate environmental problems at a nearby Con-Edison plant; set aside 35 percent of the land as open space; meet retail requirements; and create 500,000 square feet of affordable housing.
''All of this costs money,'' Mr. Barnett said. ''All of these projects -- and I don't say mine are exempt -- are in danger.''
Like many of the major waterfront projects, the Extell development has been in the works for years.
Mr. McMillan, who was the director of planning for Battery Park City from 1985 to 1997, said it had really been only in recent years that Battery Park City had established a firm neighborhood identity of its own, even though it was conceived in 1968.
Similarly, projects like the one he is working on in Long Island City will take years to come into shape, but the foundations being built today are critical to the kind of neighborhood that will develop.
''We are essentially building a community here,'' Mr. McMillan said. ''When you are starting a new neighborhood, you really do have to start with rental housing to get things started,'' in part because ''young renters are often willing to make do without essential neighborhood services.''
In fact, many of the buildings in the pipeline today are likely to be rentals as opposed to condominiums, because they are a safer bet financially. Landlords can always lower rents until the economy improves, then raise those rents and still make money, whereas developers who sell condos at a loss cannot recoup it.
The economy may be driving some of the changes in the types of projects likely to be built along the waterfront, but large tracts on the outskirts of established neighborhoods allow for greater freedom in design.
''In Battery Park City,'' Mr. McMillan said, ''we were going for that 'Ye Olde New York' look, paying special attention to historical precedence.'' He noted that that meant a lot of brick.
''Now, I think people are less interested in creating a kind of prewar aesthetic.''
The city is encouraging higher-rise development right on the water, perhaps reshaping the skyline in Brooklyn and Queens. Advances in glass technology allow developers to be more creative in design as they build communities where none existed before. ''The water's edge is a chance to do something different,'' Mr. McMillan said.
Public and Private
The city is dictating that most of the new waterfront projects have a below-market-rate component, usually starting at about 20 percent.
But even with those units, the demand for affordable housing is still overwhelming. The Bloomberg administration hopes that the huge housing project at Hunters Point, on an empty finger of land jutting out from southwest Queens, will help ease the crunch.
When it is complete, it will rival Co-op City in the Bronx as the largest affordable housing complex in the city.
Nearly a dozen developers have submitted bids to build apartments for the first phase of the project; the winning bid is to be chosen by the end of the year and construction to begin as early as 2011.
''The waterfront in the city is so extensive,'' said Mr. Pinsky of the economic development corporation, ''that we really have the opportunity to do everything.''

HEADLINE: CR-Z Finds Tuner Love At SEMA

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS -- Honda once owned the aftermarket tuner market, but about a decade ago, the Japanese automaker started bringing out more mild-mannered models that intentionally turned away from the high-performance crowd. Now, it appears Honda wants at least part of that market back, and a collection of radically tweaked CR-Z hybrids on display at this year's SEMA Show is meant to do just that.
''Green means go'' is a theme that is prominently espoused at the Honda stand. ''We've reached out to the import tuner community and asked them to push the CR-Z's limits,'' said Chris Martin, a Honda spokesman. 
The most outrageous of the 12 concepts was the Honda CR-Z from Bisimoto Engineering of Ontario, Calif., which claims to have wrung 533 horsepower out of the tiny 1.5-liter engine that comes with the car from the Honda factory.
''There's more to come,'' said the company's founder, Bisi Ezerioha. ''Honda only gave us the car in August.''
Mr. Ezerioha said the only limitation he placed on his juicing up of the powertrain was to ''retain its eco-friendly properties.'' To that end, he claimed, his creation ''gets slightly better than the advertised fuel economy'' of a stock CR-Z, which is 31 miles per gallon in the city and 37 on the highway.
''It still run on unleaded,'' he added.
Mr. Ezerioha wouldn't give away all his tuning secrets, but said he had radically reworked the exhaust system to reduce power-robbing back pressure, reconfigured the intake and exhaust manifolds, added a Kinsler fuel injection system, substituted higher compression ratio pistons, and -- besides a long list of other improvements -- added a Turbonetics turbocharger, blow-off and a massive intercooler.
''The intercooler might have been a bit of overkill,'' he said. He also copped to winding the turbo up to about 20 pounds of boost. ''But we could go higher.''
Mr. Ezerioha said he intended to bring out a line of CR-Z go-fast accessories for the public to purchase. American Honda is also planning to offer CR-Z performance parts.
Honda Performance Development, a high-performance in-house arm of American Honda, also unveiled two concepts it had produced: the CR-Z Hybrid R Concept and the HPD CR-Z Racer. Besides some performance modifications, including turbocharging, to the 1.5-liter engine, the concepts have a new type of battery pack that uses a nickel-magnesium-cobalt composition, instead of the stock nickel-metal-hydride version. A result is boosting the stock power output from 122 horsepower to 200 horsepower (and 175 pound-feet of torque).
Around this week's sprawling SEMA Show, which occupies nearly a million square feet of exhibition space at the Las Vegas Convention Center, it appeared the CR-Z was the object of loving attention from a number of customizers.
''The combination of greener practicality with style and fun makes this vehicle a perfect fit for young, environmentally conscious buyers,'' said Bruce Smith, American Honda's vice president of parts operations, ''especially those looking to further personalize their cars.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Church Van? It's With the Band

BYLINE: By RICHARD S. CHANG

 BODY:
ONE drizzly afternoon last month, J. Roddy Walston and the Business, a gritty four-piece rock 'n' roll outfit from Baltimore, were congregated around their tour van after performing three songs in the WNYC studios in SoHo.
They were talking about a previous visit to the city, which had coincided with an installation by a British artist, Luke Jerram. Mr. Jerram had placed 60 upright pianos throughout the five boroughs, and in a publicity stunt the band attempted to play all of the 33 pianos in Manhattan. They spent 12 hours -- the instruments were available from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. -- driving from Battery Park to Harlem, and fell short by two pianos.
''You know the end of 'Crocodile Dundee,' how everyone's cheering him on?'' said Mr. Walston, who is mostly dark hair and beard above the neck and denim below it. He was wearing black boots.
''There were construction workers with the paper in their hand, coming to us shouting, 'It's you!''' he said. An article on their planned exploits had appeared in The Daily News that morning. ''It was a really positive, really cool thing. And the van was very much a part of it.'' 
The van -- a big white Ford Econoline Club Wagon -- has been a big part of their lives for 10 years. Mr. Walston bought it from a church for $4,000 and never bothered to remove the lettering. So it transports the four young musicians -- they have been described as ''AC/DC fronted by Jerry Lee Lewis,'' but you could also add ''look like Lynyrd Skynyrd'' -- across the country, while bearing the identification of its previous owner: the Hampton Cove Christian Academy of Huntsville, Ala.
This incongruity is not lost on the band, but they also recognize another, more practical incentive for keeping the Club Wagon -- essentially a passenger-hauling version of the Econoline delivery van -- as is.
''The van is really good camouflage,'' Mr. Walston explained.
In the band's early days, he said, they kept their equipment in the van, parked on the streets of Baltimore. ''Everyone knows you don't leave so much as a candy wrapper visible in your car,'' Mr. Walston said. But for six months, no one touched the equipment.
''People are not going to mess with a church van,'' he reasoned.
On this visit, in October, the band was in New York for a show in Brooklyn, at the Music Hall of Williamsburg. (They will make a return performance there, opening for Deer Tick, on Wednesday.) They were in the middle of a tour to support their latest album, called ''J. Roddy Walston and the Business,'' their first on a label. The tour started in Louisville, Ky., and wound west through the Rocky Mountains and into California before turning back east.
''The last four years, we've put on almost 160,000 miles,'' Mr. Walston said, adding that the group didn't travel that much last year because it was recording the album in Los Angeles. Otherwise, the band typically plays 130 to 150 dates a year, he said.
''I feel like we get a vision of America that other people don't, one that only other traveling bands have,'' he said. ''We don't just play New York or what the industry calls 'A' markets.' We play, you know, 'F' markets as well.''
At that moment, Brooklyn beckoned. They were scheduled for a sound check, so the band piled into the van. Mr. Walston jumped behind the wheel, programmed the Music Hall's address into a portable GPS unit suctioned to the windshield, and they were off.
The other members of the band -- the Business end, so to speak -- are Billy Gordon on guitar, Steve Colmus on drums and Logan Davis, who joined only in May, on bass. Mr. Walston plays piano, often raucously, on many of their songs, and he sings (hence the Jerry Lee Lewis reference).
While the band has been on the road since September, much of what was inside the van predates the tour. ''There's stuff in here from four years ago,'' Mr. Walston said. It was a claim easily verified by scent.
''We call it the diaper,'' Mr. Walston said of the van, continuing, ''it smells like a diaper.'' He added a colorful description of what it was full of.
A cursory inspection of the van revealed parking receipts, candy wrappers, plastic flowers and a container half-full of Beer Nuts strewn throughout. The floor was not visible. CDs without cases were stuffed in the center console. The driver's side mirror was broken.
''The van has been chugging along,'' Mr. Walston said. ''Right now we don't have defrost or any sort of air-conditioning in the front, which is amazing.'' The climate control stopped working while crossing the desert on the way out of California. ''So there's air-conditioning in the back, but not in the front,'' he said.
''When we were in Seattle,'' he continued, ''we had just gone through the Rockies for the first time with the van. It was amazing and scary. We got there, and the guy there said, 'Oh, yeah, your brakes are completely locked up.''' They replaced the brakes in Portland, Ore.
The band enjoyed Portland, Mr. Walston said, and playing the Troubadour in Los Angeles. They also played with the band Cracker, an indie darling from the 1990s, at a bar near the Joshua Tree National Park.
''If you think of a middle-of-the-desert biker bar, that's what this place was,'' Mr. Walston explained. ''It's a rowdy roadhouse. In fact, after that night I was either severely dehydrated or had a concussion -- I went to the doctor because I couldn't stand up straight.''
Reared in Cleveland, Tenn., Mr. Walston grew up listening to gospel music. His grandmother played the piano. ''I grew up in a pretty typical Southern situation,'' he said. ''The town I'm from, I heard once, has the most churches per capita in the nation or something like that.'' (True or not, a Google Maps search verified that Cleveland is definitely in the running.)
''One of the good parts of that is they're all very musical churches,'' he continued. ''So you almost have to be a good musician to relate -- at least you have to be able to sing.''
Mr. Walston played in bands through high school. He started writing songs on his own when he was 19 and moved the band to Baltimore a few years later. His girlfriend -- they've since gotten married -- was studying opera at the Peabody Institute, a division of Johns Hopkins University. The city was also inexpensive and centrally located on the coast. ''That was part of the selling point for sure,'' he said.
The original lineup disbanded soon after the move. New members came and went until the current configuration, which Mr. Walston says is pretty solid. ''Steve and Billy have been in the band for four years,'' he said. The previous bassist, whom Mr. Davis replaced, had been with the band for six years.
They've been on the road for nearly the entire time. ''Steve likens it to the space shuttle,'' Mr. Walston said. ''We have this pod that is the van. The language is different. I often don't know what day of the week it is. Sometimes we're not even sure what town we're going to. That's your world.''
J. Roddy Walston and the Business arrived at the Music Hall on time for the sound check. There was a time when the band shoved all of its equipment into the van, including Mr. Walston's piano, a Yamaha upright that he customized for the rigors of travel. But the recent record deal has afforded them, of all things, a trailer -- albeit a small one.
While the additional space inside the van has increased the comfort level, the trailer has made parking more difficult. As Mr. Davis negotiated another illegal spot -- they had received a go-ahead from the club -- a large gold bus emerged down the street like a stately cruise liner. And there in automotive form was the difference between an opening act and the headliner, Shooter Jennings.
Nonetheless, the members of J. Roddy Walston and the Business said they couldn't imagine giving up the van, even if great success soon followed.
''It's been with us forever,'' Mr. Walston said.
Mr. Jennings, son of the country legend Waylon Jennings, took over the stage setup, and that pushed back the sound check for J. Roddy Walston and the Business. The band decided to go for dinner. After a quick debate, their manager decided on a fried chicken joint that had received great reviews.
But first they needed to find parking for the van.

HEADLINE: Hard Times

BYLINE: By MARILYN STASIO

 BODY:
The economic recession that never seems to end for working-class Americans is making itself felt in the crime fiction of authors whose regional roots run deep. Dennis Lehane, not the cheeriest of writers in the best of times, seems downright depressed about the way things are going in New England. In MOONLIGHT MILE (Morrow/HarperCollins, $26.99), he brings back Patrick Kenzie, the private detective from Dorchester, Mass., whose anti-establishment attitude and ''class rage'' fueled the violence of his earliest novels, to paint a bleak picture of nice towns coming apart at the seams.
Driving around Auburn, Me., with a high school coach, Patrick gains perspective on how a former athlete might lose his mind to methamphetamines and wind up killing a woman. According to the coach, the big crack in the town's foundation is the double-digit unemployment rate. But that's just the beginning. ''The stuff our fathers took for granted as long as you worked hard, the great safety net and the fair wage and the gold watch at the end of it all? That's all gone around here,'' he tells Patrick, who says it's gone in Boston too. ''Gone all over,'' the coach reckons. 
Even Patrick, who is now married to his gunslinger partner, Angie Gennaro, and mindful of his fatherly duties to their little girl, feels the financial pinch. Angling for full-time employment, he takes on demeaning assignments for a big Boston security firm, but throws a bone to his conscience by chasing a runaway teenager who has never forgiven him for snatching her from the loving couple who kidnapped her when she was 4 years old and returning her to her wildly neglectful mother. At 16, Amanda McCready appears to be more intelligent, mature and well adjusted than the adults who are still fighting over her, but the ethical issues of the case weigh heavily on Patrick.
After indulging his hero in a Jesuitical analysis of his moral actions, Lehane lets him cleanse his soul through unusual acts of extreme violence. After all these years, you'd think he'd have outgrown his old habits. But once the plot goes ballistic, he and Bubba, the thug with the ''deranged cherub's face'' who backs him up on these wild adventures, do battle with a cartoon gallery of Russian gangsters who appear to have been airlifted from a video game. Times may be bad, but you can't blame the economy for this one.
Reggie Nadelson has a real feel for the sources of life in the New York neighborhoods she celebrates in her vibrant mysteries featuring Artie Cohen, a Russian-born detective who knows the city with the intimacy of a lover. Nadelson sends Artie to Harlem in BLOOD COUNT (Walker, $26), initially to feel the pulse of the district on the night Barack Obama is elected president, and later to help a friend cope with the suspicious death of an old Russian woman at the Louis Armstrong Apartments in Sugar Hill.
This grand old building, perpetually besieged by opportunistic developers, is more than an attractive murder setting. It's also a stage where the elderly residents can regale Artie with wonderful accounts of legends like Ella Fitzgerald and Billy Strayhorn. Even the stories that lack a pivotal function in the plot, like the reverential one about Paul Robeson, contribute to the broader message: that some neighborhoods can always find hope in a dream.
Every game has its rules, including the deadly one that Jeffery Deaver plays in EDGE (Simon & Schuster, $26.99). The challenge is to figure out what the rules are in this brain-teaser of a thriller, which pits two ruthless professionals against each other in a murderous contest over the lives of a Washington, D.C., police detective and his family. The taciturn narrator, known only as Corte, is the designated ''shepherd,'' secretly dispatched by the government to protect ''an armed, drinking cop with a hero complex'' from the ''lifter'' whose grim specialty is extracting information through torture.
Although these well-matched adversaries are both highly disciplined and equally heartless, Corte is at a disadvantage: he has no way of knowing which member of the cop's household is the actual target. In the dark about the rules, this dedicated player of competitive board games tries every combination, applying game theory to adapt his strategies whenever the assassin shows his hand. Following the moves of Deaver's ingenious plot is hard enough. The real trick is keeping up with his brilliant mind, which honors no rules but its own.
There's a deliciously playful quality to the mysteries Andrea Camilleri writes about a lusty Sicilian police detective named Salvo Montalbano. In THE TRACK OF SAND (Penguin, paper, $14), Inspector Montalbano is far from amused -- indeed, he's quite horrified -- when a savagely beaten horse dies on the beach outside his home. But once he opens an investigation into this extraordinary event and its possible connection to illegal races rumored to be operating in the area, he turns up plenty of material for broad satire. Taking aim at the idle rich, Camilleri skewers their rude manners, their affected airs and their ostentatious amusements -- like the dinner after a charity race at which Montalbano is lured into a barn and hilariously seduced by an aristocratic horse owner. In such society, it pays to be pragmatic. ''You are under arrest,'' Montalbano informs a suspect (speaking through Stephen Sartarelli's jaunty translation), ''and I should warn you that whatever you say in your defense, nobody will believe you.''

BYLINE: By KENNETH CHANG. 
Kenneth Chang reports on science for The Times.

 BODY:
MATH is not an easy subject. For many, the corollary conclusion is that learning math is unavoidably unpleasant.
Test results support that view.
The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, commonly known as Timss, compares students by nation and asks them how much they like math. Over all, in countries where more students say they like the subject, the worse their skills.
By these measures, math education in the United States is improving. The percentage of eighth graders who possessed a ''high positive affect'' toward math dropped to 41 percent in 2007 from 52 percent in 1995, and Timss scores rose modestly. 
That does not mean students who hate math get the highest scores -- math lovers do. But it suggests that aiming to make the subject more likable to a wider swath of students risks diluting the curriculum and dismissing the effort needed to excel.
Mathematics is, in itself, an exercise in the abstract -- twiddling funny squiggles on paper, really, which is fairly pointless except to mathematicians. It's when math is applied to the universe that the mental game becomes something useful. Budgets can be balanced, bridges designed and laws of physics deduced. So good math education is in society's best interest.
Effective teaching of math has two parts. One is imparting the particulars of symbol twiddling. The other is explaining how to use the symbol twiddling to solve a problem. Go too far in the first direction and students tend to tune out; emphasize practical applications but shortchange the symbol twiddling, and students get a better sense of how math relates to the real world but can't solve a problem.
Algebra is often a turning point. Until then, math is largely the manipulation of numbers: multiplication tables, long division, fractions of pizzas. Algebra is where the abstract notion of a variable x is introduced, signifying some unknown quantity that is to be uncovered.
For college-bound students, understanding algebra is critical: the College Board added algebra II to the SAT in 2005. Algebra now accounts for up to 40 percent of its math section and more than half of the ACTs.
''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Algebra Word Problems,'' a new addition to the cottage industry of books to help struggling math learners, is written clearly and covers the expected topics. But it also falls into the common trap of ridiculous word problems:
A tank contains 20 gallons of antifreeze solution. When it is full, it contains 15 percent antifreeze. How many gallons must be replaced by an 80 percent antifreeze solution to get 20 gallons of a 70 percent solution?
Why would a student years away from a driver's license care about antifreeze? Who the heck is calculating antifreeze concentration? No wonder so many people slog through word problems to conclude math has no bearing on their lives. (The answer: a little less than 17 gallons.)
Danica McKellar, better known as Winnie Cooper, Kevin's love interest on the TV series ''The Wonder Years,'' retains the rigor yet takes a friendlier approach (she substitutes the word ''Happyland'' for algebra in the first chapter) in her latest best seller, ''Hot X: Algebra Exposed!''
Aimed at teenage girls, ''Hot X'' is a cross between a math class and a slumber party, and a perky, self-affirming slumber party at that: interspersed among the math are anecdotes about boys and testimonials about struggles and triumphs with math.
Beginning with the cover, which looks more like Cosmopolitan magazine than a math book, Ms. McKellar exhorts her readers to be smart and confident. (''I'm here to tell you that giving up on ourselves because of our own stereotypes and limited imagination is a far more destructive force than any change or obstacle 'out there.' '')
Those parts sometimes come across like public service announcements, but Ms. McKellar knows her math.
After ''The Wonder Years,'' she majored in math at the University of California, Los Angeles, and even helped prove, along with a professor and fellow undergraduate, an original theorem now known as the Chayes-McKellar-Winn Theorem. ''Hot X'' follows her other pre-algebra books, ''Math Doesn't Suck'' and ''Kiss My Math,'' which took a similarly irreverent tone. There are no antifreeze problems here. Ms. Mc-Kellar employs chocolate syrup instead to explain the concept.
Even for someone who is not a teenage girl (me), it's a fun read. But the underlying pedagogy is traditional. She covers greatest common factors and least common multiples. She presents the FOIL (an acronym for first, outer, inner, last) procedure of multiplying binomials, the same as I learned about 30 years ago.
To Ms. McKellar, the deficiency of math teaching is not the curriculum, but the presentation. ''Hot X,'' she says, ''is math repackaged, totally.''
The next giant hurdle is calculus and its befuddling premise of adding up an infinite number of infinitesimally small numbers. A mash-up of rigorous calculus and pop culture can be found in ''The Manga Guide to Calculus,'' which, as its title indicates, presents calculus through Japanese-style animation. The book, by Hiroyuki Kojima, an associate professor of economics at Teikyo University in Tokyo, is part of a series of comics exploring subjects like physics, statistics and molecular biology.
The framing story is of a newspaper bureau chief who gives her cub reporter calculus lessons to give more depth to her reporting. Certainly more journalists with a working knowledge of calculus would not be a bad thing, and manga lovers might find enough entertainment to carry them through the arduous lessons. The characters start spouting dialogue that sounds like textbooks, and the narrative periodically grinds to a halt for a lesson. The first chapter, for example, ends with three artless pages on how to calculate a derivative.
I skipped over the math to the next comic panels -- and then the plot petered out, too.
I found myself wishing that Ms. McKellar, who makes math relevant without dumbing it down, would cover the rest of the high school math curriculum -- and that someone would do the equivalent for boys.

HEADLINE: Dealer's Choice

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY JACK WARD

 BODY:
In Switzerland, a sans-serif, politely modern, supersleek, always tidy, adamantly neutral country, where everything uniformly ticktocks, lock-step, you might begin to think each new building and interior were designed by the same architect. Switzerland even has a typeface -- Helvetica -- named after it (the country is also known as Confoederatio Helvetica), in which no letter steps out of line. But an eBay purchase led me to Zurich, where I found the serif, the dingbat and the curvy character, all in one: Arthur Rooks. 
I bought a primitive spindle-back farm chair for peanuts, which Rooks, the invisible seller at the other end of my eBay transaction, claimed was hand-carved, 150 years old and straight from the ferme in Belfort, France, about an hour and a half across the border from Zurich. I PayPal-ed it, pronto, and Rooks shipped it to me meticulously cushioned and perfectly crated, in a matter of days, as if I'd just bought slippers at Zappos. It was exactly as described, and got me wondering, Who is this guy? With that stout, German-sounding name, I pictured a hardy hiker in lederhosen, surrounded by Alpine shipping-room elves. I discovered that Rooks also runs a home furnishings Web site, quintessentia.com, where you will find a treasure trove of seriously good stuff. He sells Bauhaus, Arts & Crafts, early Swiss Modernist and much better midcentury modern than you can find in New York.
But Arthur Rooks is no rosy-cheeked yodeler. Rather, he is a tall African-American from Jackson, Miss. ''The Rooks name is actually English, and we're all from Jackson, Tennessee, where there's white Rookses and black Rookses, all related,'' he said. This Rooks, now a Zurcher for 18 years, graduated from Northwestern in 1990 with a degree in theater and industrial engineering. He moved to Zurich first for love and then stayed, with stints in Glasgow to get his M.B.A. in strategic management at the University of Strathclyde
. But instead of a finance career, he began to buy and sell antiques while working in a Zurich gallery, and designed apartments for friends. His own apartment is in the city's red-light district, next door to Rothaus, a brothel that was converted in 2006 to a hotel. He co-founded his virtual store six years ago, and he says it has become one of the largest online-only vintage modernist dealers to the United States market. His customers include the New York dealer Alan Moss and Hedi Slimane. Eighty percent of Quintessentia's traffic is with clients in the United States, and by Rooks's count, he has made more than 10,000 sales, increasingly to design professionals.
Every Saturday, as the sun rises over the Alps at the horizon, Rooks laces up his custom Nikes (he owns 18 pairs) and sets off in a scruffy parka to prowl the famous Zurich flea markets. Nothing about this guy blends in, including the fluorescent high-tops, and vendors spot him coming blocks away. They keep their distance as he circulates once through the market, scanning each stand quickly on the first pass, stopping only to wobble a Thonet chair, heft a copper pitcher, search the back of a miniature portrait for provenance or play with a rolling toy cow or Japanese theater mask.
Reconnaissance done, he wolfs down a croissant and kaffee, and on his second go the vendors call out his name, ''AH-tou-ah! AH-tou-ah!'' in the Zurcher accent, and Rooks begins to engage, rolling with ease between singsong Schweizerdeutsch and English. What Rooks does not see is that after his first pass, many dealers discreetly second-guess, and set aside items to redisplay when they see him coming for Round 2.
He presses the flesh and squeezes the price, pays cash, and stockpiles his haggled-over purchases at a drop-off point, pausing with his cellphone a dozen times to direct a colleague, Manfred Schelbert, to pick up the goods. As Rooks continues to call in his purchases, Schelbert piles the merchandise into his peppy, navy blue Opel Astra (an increasing rarity in a city that discourages private car ownership and favors Mobility, the Swiss equivalent of Zipcar) to haul off to the Quintessentia studio.
The dealer and decorator remembers his youth as being ''between two worlds'': the homes of his wealthy classmates from an exclusive school in Jackson -- all ''chintz, fluff, whatnots and high-end antiques'' -- and the influence of his ''Grandmama,'' who worked the 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. shift as a nurse's assistant and took him every Saturday to garage sales. ''She wouldn't let you out of the house unless your pants were pressed, with a crease,'' Rooks recalled. Her people in the Delta, he continued, lived in ''shotgun houses on stilts, people who made do with very little, took care of how they lived, who had a sense of style and houses just as pretty and just as well taken care of as the fancy ones in Jackson.'' These extremes inform his work in Zurich today. Rooks's aesthetic, while influenced by all that Swiss tidiness, is also boldly colorful, richly layered, a live-in embodiment of his antiques-picking sensibilities, and more out there than you might imagine you'd find in Helvetica. A line of furniture that he is designing includes folding screens with walnut frames that are meticulously built by Zurich artisans and feature translucent, ''gilt plastic'' diffusers from 1950s ceiling lights. ''What makes me different from a lot of dealers is my past,'' he said. ''I'm in love with beautiful design, but I'm also not ashamed to pick something out of the trash, things that stir an emotion in me.''
Rooks's weekend itinerary continues with stops at pretty much every local outlet of the Heilsarmee, the Swiss Salvation Army, where his ability to find the wheat among the chaff is even more impressive. In Wollerau on Zurichsee (Lake Zurich), there's an early, spotless Philippe Starck-designed side chair for about $25. ''But we'll negotiate,'' the volunteer clerk says, eliciting not one smirk from Rooks, who knows a deal when he sniffs one and feigns a lack of interest.
On Monday morning, in the Quintessentia studio in an attic above four stories of Latin dance schools, the floor joists jumping to syncopated salsa, Rooks and his team clean, number, photograph, describe, price and post the weekend's haul. The morning work is punctuated by hissy fits from the espresso and milk steamer, as Rooks caffeinates his staff, serving coffee in antique demitasse cups swiped from his product inventory. You can hear the M.B.A. kick in when Rooks gets down to brass tacks and starts talking about ''new economy models,'' hoping to differentiate himself from the small antiques shop where ''a transaction requires a lot of bother.'' When needed, Rooks and his staff are quick to answer questions by telephone, e-mail or Skype video. By means of a network of as many as 100 other dealers in Europe, Rooks provides a search service. The Quintessentia site posts plenty of information about each piece and generates precise worldwide shipping costs and timetables, upfront. Swiss efficiency, perhaps. His ambition, he says, is no less than ''to be the Amazon of European vintage and antique home furnishings.''
Working six hours ahead of Eastern time, the team breaks for a Thai carryout lunch as the Thonet chair, copper pitcher, portrait miniature, toy cow and Japanese theater mask are all posted for sale on quintessentia.com, just in time for sunrise in New York.

HEADLINE: New Mangini Embraces Old One

BYLINE: By GREG BISHOP

 BODY:
BEREA, Ohio -- Perhaps Eric Mangini reached his lowest point in January. He was eating too much, sleeping too little and wrestling with a chewing tobacco habit. His job as the Cleveland Browns' coach was fraught with uncertainty.
He faced a daily barrage of criticism. His weight climbed to an embarrassing level, and he kept thinking that his father had died of a heart attack at 56. Even his old nickname, Mangenius, resurfaced to mock him.
''I'm telling you, it was as miserable as could be,'' Mangini said. ''It was like being on the treadmill, Level 15, every single day. So I decided, I'm going to change this.''
The new Eric Mangini will now take center stage in an N.F.L. version of ''This Is Your Life.'' On Sunday, his Browns host New England, with whom he won three Super Bowls as an assistant; a week later, they host the Jets, who fired him after the 2008 season. 
Since January, everything has changed. Mangini, 39, weighs less than he did as a college senior at Wesleyan. With an overhauled roster, the Browns practice in a remodeled facility, for a reconfigured front office, for a man who lost all job titles except coach. Mangini remains meticulous and thorough, obsessive even, but seems, if not gentler, then more relaxed.
Mangini returned to his core principles, just coaching, as the same guy, he insisted, but more firm in his beliefs. His Jets tenure provided a painful lesson in what happened when he deviated.
He ignored his instincts when quarterback Brett Favre went on the trading block in August 2008. Favre was the kind of player Mangini wanted to avoid. He was a hired gun, a quick fix.
The Jets' executives desperately wanted Favre. They assured Mangini that regardless of the outcome, his job was safe. So Mangini helped seal the trade, researching hunting in New Jersey, even giving his third son the middle name Brett.
Favre led the Jets to an 8-3 start but hurt his arm and tossed multiple interceptions as the team stumbled from contention. Mangini failed to disclose the injury properly, which later prompted a $25,000 fine.
The night the regular season ended, Mangini watched television on his couch, preparing for exit interviews, compiling an off-season checklist. General Manager Mike Tannenbaum called at 11:40 p.m., charged with the unpleasant task of firing one of his best friends.
Mangini kept returning to one thought: he had compromised, sold out.
''I get that someone had to pay,'' Mangini said. ''And it was me.''
After a week of unemployment, Mangini, to the shock of N.F.L. insiders, landed with the Browns. It made a cute story: disgraced coach receives second chance with the organization that once employed him as a ball boy.
After that first start with Cleveland, Mangini eventually followed Bill Belichick to New England, where he witnessed a Patriots dynasty built on character and his beloved core characteristics. From Belichick, he borrowed the stiff, paranoid manner that defined his time with the Jets.
He required players to take copious notes, and they still remember the rustling of notebooks opening as meetings started. (Tight end Dustin Keller said he scribbled more in one week than in half a semester at Purdue.)
Now, they choose their words carefully in regard to Mangini. On one hand, they described his brilliant football acumen, which produced two winning seasons in three years. On the other, they said that Mangini created an atmosphere of fear throughout the organization, that he ruled with the heaviest of hands, that he humiliated players and assistants. Draconian, one played called it.
''He was tough,'' Keller said. ''But if you ask, everyone would agree he's by far the smartest coach any of us have been around. It was almost psychotic how much he knew.''
The Jets made Mangini the youngest coach in the N.F.L. in 2006, hiring him two days before he turned 35. Immediately, the jokes started: the Jets were the only team that needed a sandbox; he and Tannenbaum were the only N.F.L. executives who got birthday balloons.
Mangini described the experience as nerve-racking. He had conducted only one previous news conference. He had never drawn up a practice schedule or run an entire team. Looking back, his time with the Jets reminded him of parenting, in that he parroted his mentors (Belichick and Bill Parcells) and did not sufficiently speak in his own voice.
In his first season, Mangini made the playoffs and a cameo on ''The Sopranos'' (Artie Bucco: ''Hey, Tone. You know who's in tonight? Mangenius.'') Yet there he was last January, in Walt Disney World with his family on the weekend of the conference championships. The Jets played in the first game. Favre played in the second.
''That was the perfect ending to last year,'' Mangini said. ''How could it end any other way? That was my personal 'Hard Knocks.' ''
One afternoon last month, Mangini played tour guide at the Browns' headquarters here. When he arrived in January 2009, he found dried banana peels on the floor, broken equipment, chairs stained with sweat, dark lighting and concrete walls. It felt like a prison. Mangini changed all that, conducting his first training camp amid construction.
His image problems followed him to Cleveland, magnified when he fined players for not paying for water bottles in hotel rooms, or when he sent his rookies on a 10-hour bus ride to Connecticut for his football camp. Players grumbled, and it seemed that instead of being humbled by his termination, Mangini had failed to change, that he was Belichick without the pedigree. But to Mangini, these incidents spoke instead to a lack of organizational respect.
''This place was a disaster,'' said Rob Ryan, Mangini's defensive coordinator, adding, ''Vince Lombardi wasn't going to come in here and win.''
Cleveland closed the 2009 season with four victories. But when the Browns hiredMike Holmgren as their president, he stripped Mangini of all front-office responsibility. Mangini did not prepare for their initial conversation. He believed, more firmly than ever, in his philosophy, the work accomplished.
Mangini's touch is evident throughout the headquarters, in the lockers randomly assigned and the quotations lining the walls and the messages players pass on their way to practice (be on time, pay attention, work hard). This is the Mangini way.
Now, Mangini said, he hears more of his own voice.
''I'm going to do things the way that I feel they should be done,'' he continued. ''I'm going to rely on those experiences, but I'm going to be who I am, no exceptions.''
The core remains, but Mangini is significantly lighter in weight and in approach. He said that his first year here ''wasn't even in the same stratosphere of hard.''
He added, ''But compared to what they were used to, it was ridiculously hard.''
Longtime confidants like his offensive coordinator, Brian Daboll, say the gap between Mangini's private and public personas is closing. He seems more comfortable in meetings, less dry, more himself.
''He's been more of the Eric I've known since 2000 in front of the group,'' Daboll said. ''Tells funny stories. Doesn't rule with as hard an iron fist. He's got a little bit more trust, and a little bit more experience, too.''
The Browns' record, 2-5, remains dismal, and Mangini's job is as tenuous as ever. He and Holmgren are schooled in two of the most successful coaching philosophies in league history, but Bill Walsh's and Belichick's are diametrically opposed.
Holmgren can empathize with Mangini. His lost his front-office duties in Seattle, and shortly after, in the 2005 season, the Seahawks advanced to their first Super Bowl. Mangini said Holmgren gave him advice on everything, including practice schedules and parenting. But that has not diminished Holmgren's wish to return to coaching.
For all the changes -- better roster, improved facility, four losses by an average of 5.5 points -- football is zero sum. Mangini insisted it would be hypocritical to look toward the future and ask his players to focus on the next game, but victories more than progress will ultimately decide his fate.
Sometimes, Mangini worries about becoming like the ''cleaner'' character from the movie ''Pulp Fiction,'' fixing the salary cap and jettisoning problem players and instilling those core characteristics -- for someone else to coach the team he built. For now, the new Eric Mangini moves forward, his future uncertain, his approach a life preserver in another season filled with turbulence.

HEADLINE: Our Banana Republic

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
In my reporting, I regularly travel to banana republics notorious for their inequality. In some of these plutocracies, the richest 1 percent of the population gobbles up 20 percent of the national pie.
But guess what? You no longer need to travel to distant and dangerous countries to observe such rapacious inequality. We now have it right here at home -- and in the aftermath of Tuesday's election, it may get worse.
The richest 1 percent of Americans now take home almost 24 percent of income, up from almost 9 percent in 1976. As Timothy Noah of Slate noted in an excellent series on inequality, the United States now arguably has a more unequal distribution of wealth than traditional banana republics like Nicaragua, Venezuela and Guyana. 
C.E.O.'s of the largest American companies earned an average of 42 times as much as the average worker in 1980, but 531 times as much in 2001. Perhaps the most astounding statistic is this: From 1980 to 2005, more than four-fifths of the total increase in American incomes went to the richest 1 percent.
That's the backdrop for one of the first big postelection fights in Washington -- how far to extend the Bush tax cuts to the most affluent 2 percent of Americans. Both parties agree on extending tax cuts on the first $250,000 of incomes, even for billionaires. Republicans would also cut taxes above that.
The richest 0.1 percent of taxpayers would get a tax cut of $61,000 from President Obama. They would get $370,000 from Republicans, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. And that provides only a modest economic stimulus, because the rich are less likely to spend their tax savings.
At a time of 9.6 percent unemployment, wouldn't it make more sense to finance a jobs program? For example, the money could be used to avoid laying off teachers and undermining American schools.
Likewise, an obvious priority in the worst economic downturn in 70 years should be to extend unemployment insurance benefits, some of which will be curtailed soon unless Congress renews them. Or there's the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which helps train and support workers who have lost their jobs because of foreign trade. It will no longer apply to service workers after Jan. 1, unless Congress intervenes.
So we face a choice. Is our economic priority the jobless, or is it zillionaires?
And if Republicans are worried about long-term budget deficits, a reasonable concern, why are they insistent on two steps that nonpartisan economists say would worsen the deficits by more than $800 billion over a decade -- cutting taxes for the most opulent, and repealing health care reform? What other programs would they cut to make up the lost $800 billion in revenue?
In weighing these issues, let's remember that backdrop of America's rising inequality.
In the past, many of us acquiesced in discomfiting levels of inequality because we perceived a tradeoff between equity and economic growth. But there's evidence that the levels of inequality we've now reached may actually suppress growth. A drop of inequality lubricates economic growth, but too much may gum it up.
Robert H. Frank of Cornell University, Adam Seth Levine of Vanderbilt University, and Oege Dijk of the European University Institute recently wrote a fascinating paper suggesting that inequality leads to more financial distress. They looked at census data for the 50 states and the 100 most populous counties in America, and found that places where inequality increased the most also endured the greatest surges in bankruptcies.
Here's their explanation: When inequality rises, the richest rake in their winnings and buy even bigger mansions and fancier cars. Those a notch below then try to catch up, and end up depleting their savings or taking on more debt, making a financial crisis more likely.
Another consequence the scholars found: Rising inequality also led to more divorces, presumably a byproduct of the strains of financial distress. Maybe I'm overly sentimental or romantic, but that pierces me. It's a reminder that inequality isn't just an economic issue but also a question of human dignity and happiness.
Mounting evidence suggests that losing a job or a home can rock our identity and savage our self-esteem. Forced moves wrench families from their schools and support networks.
In short, inequality leaves people on the lower rungs feeling like hamsters on a wheel spinning ever faster, without hope or escape.
Economic polarization also shatters our sense of national union and common purpose, fostering political polarization as well.
So in this postelection landscape, let's not aggravate income gaps that already would make a Latin American caudillo proud. To me, we've reached a banana republic point where our inequality has become both economically unhealthy and morally repugnant.

HEADLINE: How Portable Is Your Life?

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI. 
E-mail: thesearch@nytimes.com

 BODY:
MOVING can be one of the most stressful events in life, although it can also be a great adventure. The option may seem especially tempting today, as some regions have much brighter job prospects than others amid the overall employment slump.
Indeed.com, a job search engine, compiles a list of the most and least competitive job markets. Out of 50 metropolitan areas, the ones with the fewest unemployed people per job posting are Washington; San Jose, Calif.; Baltimore; New York; and Boston. The areas with the worst job prospects are Miami; Los Angeles and Riverside, Calif.; Detroit; and Las Vegas. 
But unemployed people in Miami can't always just pack their bags for Washington. Even if they are willing and eager to move for a job, many are unable to do so -- especially if they are homeowners.
Relocation is down across the country because people simply can't sell their homes, and employers are often unwilling to pick up the cost of a loss on a home, or even the moving expenses, said John A. Challenger, chief executive of Challenger Gray & Christmas, the outplacement firm.
In fact, the housing crisis has kept unemployment higher than it needs to be because it has curtailed the migration that helps keep the American economy strong, he said. People are also less trusting of companies today, he said -- they are leery of taking a big step like moving when they are unsure how secure their new job will be.
As a result, he added, employers in certain industries are having a surprisingly hard time finding workers -- for example, in the technology and engineering fields.
In past eras, when men tended to be the sole breadwinners, it was much easier for a family to pick up stakes and relocate. Now a spouse's or a partner's job, and job prospects, make the moving equation much more complex. And, as always, there is the decision of whether to leave friends and relatives behind, and whether to wrench the children out of school and disrupt their social ties.
Mr. Challenger is seeing more people staying where they are -- and commuting very long distances. Some companies are mitigating this burden by allowing more telecommuting, he said.
More people are ''living like a congressman,'' said Richard Florida, director of the Martin Prosperity Institute at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management and author of ''The Great Reset: How New Ways of Living and Working Drive Post-Crash Prosperity.''
That means they are renting their living quarters during the week for their jobs and traveling home on weekends. Or, he said, they are commuting daily between two metropolitan areas -- say, from Detroit to Chicago, or from Pittsburgh to Boston.
These kinds of commutes, in addition to being expensive, must be taking a psychological toll on families, he observed. ''Being away from your family support structure,'' he said, ''has got to be very difficult.''
It stands to reason that single people and renters, whose roots are not yet so deep, find it much easier to relocate for a job. People in their early 20s are three to five times more likely to move than a mid-career person, Professor Florida said.
''For a young person out of college looking for that first job,'' he said, ''it makes a lot of sense to move to a big city that has lots of options and a vibrant labor market.''
Quality of life -- in the form of great restaurants and night life, museums, diversity and street energy -- is also important to people who are seeking to move. Fortunately, he said, cities with those attributes tend to be places that also provide a lot of economic opportunity.
For those who can make the leap, it might make sense to move to a city first and then look for a job, rather than trying to apply for a job from afar. Because of budget constraints, many employers will not even pay to bring out-of-town candidates in for interviews, said Alison Doyle, a job search specialist for About.com, which is owned by The New York Times Company.
Although video interviewing of out-of-town applicants is on the rise, local applicants still have an edge, she said. So if you have a savings cushion and can temporarily bunk with a family member or friend in your desired area, you may be better off.
BUT first, do your research. Find out if your target city has the kind of jobs for which you are qualified. You don't want to move somewhere with a low jobless rate and then find that you don't have the skills and experience that companies there are seeking, Ms. Doyle said.
Sites like SimplyHired, Indeed and LinkedIn can be very useful for this kind of research, she said.
Moving to a new city is a momentous decision. Eventually, after the housing crisis clears, more people can make that decision based on their own personal preferences -- and the gears of the economy can run more smoothly as more people move into jobs that are right for them.

HEADLINE: Of Airlines and Aerobatics

 BODY:
MY parents were economists who worked to improve conditions in the developing world. We lived in Latin America and Africa before settling in the United States. These circumstances exposed me to travel and different cultures, creating in me a passion for aviation and adventure.
My parents sent me to school in England, where I studied economic theory at the London School of Economics. I was heading for a career in economics before being attracted to aviation. While at graduate school, I used my savings to get my pilot's license and soon developed a love of competitive aerobatics. 
My first job after graduation was working at Miami International Airport as the assistant to Dick Judy, the aviation director. He was an exceptional boss who instilled in me the importance of independent thinking, of developing the talents of those around me and of always striving to improve.
In 1989, I joined British Airways, managing several different administrative areas for the company in North America. Within several years, I had reached a ceiling for someone with no experience managing a mainstream part of the business.
But to gain that experience, I needed to take a step back within the company, and a substantial pay cut. I decided to take the risk and took the job of country manager for British Airways in the Czech Republic. It seemed a terrifying decision at the time, but it worked out well. Business in the region turned around quickly for the airline, and I was rewarded with a promotion: running the larger Latin America and Caribbean divisions.
A senior executive at the company questioned my temperament to manage large groups of employees in a unionized environment. Proving him wrong became an important personal objective. I left British Airways to become president of Worldwide Flight Services, a company that provides services like cleaning and refueling planes and loading bags. It's one of the less glamorous areas of aviation and one of the toughest.
In 2001 I joined Sabena, the Belgian airline, as part of a team charged with turning the business around. The company was not doing well financially, and we were in the process of restructuring it when the Sept. 11 attacks occurred. Sabena could not withstand the travel recession that followed and closed its doors within a couple of months. Not all risks have rewards.
In 2002, I joined Hawaiian Airlines. Three months later, we filed for bankruptcy and began restructuring. We made money during the bankruptcy, allowing us to pay back our creditors and leaving us in good shape for the future. Since then, the company has done well and we are now expanding into Asia.
I've been able to live my dream of having a stimulating job in the industry that marries my love of aviation with my interest in travel. Everything I've learned has been because of mistakes I've made. You can't be in aviation if you don't have a certain appetite for risk and a love of competition. We live in a world where people are dissuaded from taking career risks, but where many talented people forgo great opportunities by being too conservative.
In my free time, I fly a Giles G-202, a carbon-fiber aerobatic airplane. It's capable of the full range of extraordinary aerobatic maneuvers that have been developed in the last 30 years. My wife and family won't fly with me when I'm doing acrobatics. Until this past summer, I could say that I'd never made any of my passengers ill. Then my nephew Trevor unceremoniously spoiled my perfect record -- and the inside of my airplane.

HEADLINE: Rural Suburb With a Flinty Past

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
BRANCHVILLE, a hilly corner of Ridgefield in Fairfield County about 50 miles from Midtown Manhattan, gets its name from a railroad junction of the late 1800s. Its air was once smoky from mills that churned out glue and varnish. Its land was scarred by miners in search of granite, quartz and mica.
And before there were Interstates, its main thoroughfare, Route 7, was first choice for road trips to Vermont, drawing a continuous stream of vehicles.
Amazing how rustic a former industrial zone can feel after enough time has elapsed. Not that there isn't commuter traffic, but these days few traces of Branchville's gritty past persist. Factories are long shuttered; water has filled the quarries. And those railroad tracks, which ferried freight for decades, have evolved into a popular and well-worn footpath. 
The land it traverses is part of the 26 percent conserved as open space in Ridgefield. Judy Wilson, who moved into a house a few doors away from the path just this year, has been struck by the presence of ''all this beautiful nature,'' she said, describing the sounds produced by a nearby stream as she accompanies her daughter and son to the bus stop for school on weekdays.
A Connecticut native, Ms. Wilson and her family moved to Branchville from tiny East Hampton, in the state's rural eastern half, because her husband, Tom, felt he needed a shorter commute to his display-case manufacturing business in New Jersey.
Wanting something they could have a hand in customizing, in an area without much new construction, the Wilsons found a raised ranch that a previous owner had lost to a bank, though after he had gutted it down to the two-by-fours.
For $350,000, the couple got the shell of a house. They have since added drywall, electrical systems and kitchen appliances, in an A-to-Z renovation costing about what they paid for the property. Their new patio even has a fireplace, a perfect spot from which to savor nature.
''Things aren't displaced too much here,'' Ms. Wilson said. ''It's not all McMansions and whatnot.''
To help preserve the semirural character of the area, zoning in most cases prohibits lot sizes under an acre. And the zoning's effectiveness has been enhanced by the relative scarcity of sewer lines and similar infrastructure, said Betty Brosius, Ridgefield's planning director.
''Branchville has remained as is for many years,'' she said.
The landscape can sometimes feel untamed; in certain areas, roads make such sharp hairpin turns that larger trucks are warned to stay away. But the remoteness is more a perception than a reality, said Patricia Sesto, an environmental affairs official for the adjacent town of Wilton who moved here 12 years ago from populous Fairfield.
The shopping options are solid, said Ms. Sesto, a mother of two, having found Branchville more of a ''suburban-rural'' kind of place than pastoral Redding next door. ''When you need to go on a Benadryl run at night,'' she added, ''you think, 'How far am I willing to go to get it?' ''
The four-bedroom ranch that the Sestos bought in 1998 cost them $365,000; Ms. Sesto estimated its current worth as double that amount.
WHAT YOU'LL FIND
Branchville does not have formally established borders; it is generally defined as the 2.25-square-mile valley, population about 3,500, fanned out around the Metro-North Railroad station, and including slices of Wilton and Redding.
A clearer distinction in a socioeconomic sense, according to residents, is that Branchville was historically the blue-collar side of Ridgefield (although the two are technically on the same side of the Metro-North tracks).
Many residents are of Italian heritage, their ancestors having been recruited to work in the Gilbert and Bennett wire factory in Georgetown, a hamlet less than a mile away. In fact, 21 percent of the population claimed Italian ancestry in the last census, versus 16 percent in the state as a whole.
Joe Ancona runs a grocery store that his grandfather, a Sicilian immigrant, started 90 years ago. He says he likes knowing the names of his customers, who flock to buy sourdough bread baked on-site. But he's not opposed to enlarging the community.
Mr. Ancona, a commercial landlord who used to work as an architect, spoke enthusiastically about a proposal to be unveiled this month by regional planners for rezoning the area around the train station, and building a wastewater treatment plant, to allow for a denser concentration of homes and perhaps more multifamily dwellings. Ms. Brosius, the planning director, said Ridgefield would not take a position on the plan until it was unveiled before her commission.
But Mr. Ancona said it would be troubling if development foes instinctively fought the plan as they have other ones over the years to widen Route 7, which might have alleviated today's traffic problems. ''The reality is, everything is growing,'' he said, ''and you can only hold back the water so long.''
WHAT YOU'LL PAY
In late October there were 41 homes for sale, for an average price of $990,000. Twelve were listed for $1 million or more, nine for under $500,000 -- lower than some Fairfield County house hunters might have expected.
At the low end was a three-bedroom ranch on Mallory Hill Road, one of the area's several mid-20th-century subdivisions, at $285,000. The most expensive, at $5.3 million, was a 2009 mansion with nearly 12,000 square feet of space on Nod Hill Road, the site of most of Branchville's teardowns.
Prices appear to have held up fairly well over the course of the recession. In 2007, during the boom, 59 homes sold, for an average of $994,000, with deals ranging from $330,000 to $4.1 million, according to data compiled by Rob Gutman, a broker with Keller Williams Realty, from the Greater Fairfield County Consolidated Multiple Listing Service.
In 2009, only 28 homes sold, but the average price was $980,000, with deals from $300,000 to $2.3 million. Mr. Gutman cautions against reading too much into the data. Prices in Ridgefield are off 15 percent in the same time frame, he said.
Larger homes sold in Branchville last year, he said, ''which means that the price per square foot actually dropped.''
WHAT TO DO
Business is good at Little Pub, a year-old restaurant that sells a ''Route 102 Burger'' with provolone, onions and hot peppers ($9.95).
Another popular option is the Whistle Stop Muffin Company, in the wood-paneled former station building at the Metro-North stop. It sells an oatmeal-based ''breakfast cookie'' reminiscent of a discus. Its parking lot is the weekend home of a farmers' market through the late fall. On a recent visit, there was a Maine man selling lobsters at $6.95 a pound.
The area's most noteworthy attraction is probably Weir Farm National Historic Site, a large park once home to the American Impressionist painter J. Alden Weir, many of whose works were inspired by the area's natural beauty. The few miles of hiking trails that cross the grounds can be used free by anyone.
THE SCHOOLS
A dwindling population in the 1980s caused the Branchville Elementary School to close for 12 years, though it appears to have roared back since reopening in 1995. On state exams last year, 100 percent of its fourth-graders met standards in math, 96 percent in reading and 96 percent in writing.
East Ridge Middle School, one of two in Ridgefield, has about 750 students in Grades 6, 7 and 8. On state exams last year, 98 percent of eighth-graders met standards in math, 98 percent in reading, 98 percent in writing and 96 percent in science.
Ridgefield High School, which has an enrollment of 1,752, offers 17 advanced-placement courses, including physics, studio art and environmental science. SAT averages last year were 585 in math, 569 in reading and 580 in writing, versus 510, 505 and 510 statewide.
Deborah Low, the school superintendent, said more than 90 percent of graduates went on to four-year colleges.
THE COMMUTE
Branchville's train stop is on the Danbury spur of the New Haven line. Each weekday morning from 5:52 to 8:15, five trains run to Grand Central Terminal. Some require a transfer in South Norwalk. The trip ranges from 92 to 103 minutes. Monthly passes cost $308, slightly less online.
Parking in the 161 spaces has until recently been first come first served, but this summer the town passed rules requiring permits for most spots. The cost will be $250 a year, and a wait list is expected, says Laurie Scholl, the town employee who handles parking.
THE HISTORY
Though Branchville's mining past has largely been forgotten, there are reminders, like the grooved rock face around a pool at a bend in Branchville Road. The spot was most likely quarried for granite, said Brent Colley, a former resident inspired to research the topic by the well-crafted stone walls around his home, near a different quarry.

HEADLINE: Slick on Slick

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS McCOLLAM. 
Douglas McCollam, a contributing editor for the Columbia Journalism Review and The American Lawyer, lives in New Orleans.

 BODY:
It was a little past 9 on a scorching July morning in South Texas, and Tony Buzbee was gunning down the Gulf Freeway outside Houston in his cherry red Ferrari 612 Scaglietti (license plate BUZB 8) on his way to a court hearing in Galveston. Buzbee's right hand was occupied with one of his ever-present La Gloria Cubana cigars, while his left stayed in intermittent contact with the wheel as he recounted how he destroyed an insurance company's expert witness in a recent deposition. So total was the demolition, in Buzbee's telling, that the witness retired on the spot from any future trial work. ''I basically made him admit that his entire compensation model was'' fouled up, Buzbee said with undisguised relish, as well as the blunt profanity that is a hallmark of his conversations. 
I was having a little trouble focusing on the story as I stole glances at the speedometer and wondered if it would be bad form at this late juncture to reach for my neglected seat belt. But I noticed that Buzbee wasn't wearing his, either, and decided to place my faith in the driver and Italian engineering. After all, it didn't seem as if Buzbee was showing off. Just the opposite -- it felt as if he were holding back for my sake. He wanted to go faster.
Buzbee, 42, is a former Marine who made his reputation as one of the most successful trial lawyers in Texas (and thus the country) while practicing in Galveston, but he doesn't get down to the island town much anymore. For years his office was in a restored warehouse near the docks, but in September 2008, Hurricane Ike made landfall on the east end of Galveston Island, pushing as much as 20 feet of water into downtown. Buzbee's offices were heavily damaged, and he relocated most of his staff to sleek new quarters on the 73rd floor of Houston's JPMorgan Chase Tower, the tallest building in Texas.
It was Ike that was bringing Buzbee back to Galveston this morning. He was part of a team of lawyers that represented thousands of homeowners whose houses were damaged in the storm, and a few days earlier the group settled a block of the biggest claims with the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association for $189 million. Buzbee wanted to show up in court to make sure the judge signed off on the deal and to meet with other lawyers to negotiate his cut of an $11.5 million case-management fee. ''The guys know I did most of the heavy lifting,'' Buzbee said as we drove. He planned to ask for $7.5 million, ''but I'll take 5,'' he added with a broad smile. (He ended up with 4.) In all, between his share of the fee and his percentage of his clients' recovery, Buzbee estimated he would make around $20 million on Hurricane Ike litigation against an outlay of about $750,000 in expenses. ''People always say trial lawyers are such liberals,'' Buzbee said to me later, ''but I'm a big believer in capitalism.''
Make no mistake, Buzbee is an entrepreneur of a certain kind. As do most trial lawyers, he spends money to pry evidence of wrongdoing out of corporations that he can then leverage for a maximum return on investment. When I asked him what his product was, he thought for a moment before responding, ''Fairness.'' However you react to his answer, lawyers like Buzbee need a big wrong to make their business model a success, which is why his current project revolves around the offshore explosion aboard BP's Deepwater Horizon, which killed 11 people aboard the floating rig and released an estimated 200 million gallons of crude into the Gulf of Mexico.
But the business environment has grown tougher for independent operators like Buzbee. Trial lawyers are held in low esteem by the public, and more to the point, the judicial and political systems have increasingly pushed to rationalize the mass-torts circus, by consolidating litigation and, in the case of the BP spill, urging the creation of a company-financed compensation fund for victims. What this means is that trial lawyers can spend as much time jockeying for position among their rivals as they do attacking corporate wrongdoers.
When I met up with Buzbee in July, he was already girding for the fight on all fronts. As we drove around Galveston he pointed out some of the scenes of his previous legal battles, none more significant than the small community of Texas City, on Galveston Bay, where in 2005 an explosion at a refinery owned by BP killed 15 people, injured 170 and spawned thousands of damage claims. Buzbee sued BP on behalf of 179 clients, and in all, the company paid out $2.1 billion on claims from that explosion. For Buzbee, a high point came when he became one of two lawyers allowed to take the deposition of John Manzoni, the senior BP executive overseeing the Texas City plant. The brutal dismantling culminated when Buzbee asked Manzoni, who was trying to defend BP's record, to read aloud from a safety survey of the plant that, as fate would have it, was completed on the very day of the explosion: ''If this facility was an aircraft carrier, we would be at the bottom of the ocean.'' Buzbee's cases settled a few weeks later. He put his personal take from the litigation at close to $100 million.
In the five years since the Texas City explosion, Buzbee has brought claims on behalf of thousands of clients against BP over a series of accidents and emissions from the Texas City plant. ''It feels like I've been dealing with BP for so long, I know the supervisors, the rank and file,'' Buzbee told me. His battles with BP have left him with a considerable fortune and antipathy for the company. ''I truly hate BP,'' Buzbee told me. ''There is some deep problem inside that company.''
So when Buzbee received word of the April 20 blowout of BP's Macondo well in the gulf, it didn't take him long to formulate his objective: ''To nail their scalp to the wall, and for me to be the guy holding it there.''
These days, Buzbee has a lot of competition for the honor of making BP suffer. Unlike their professional cousins in the defense bar, trial lawyers tend to be loners. They are often poor boys made good, smart scrappers who went to second- or third-tier law schools and thus possess a keen antenna for slights visited upon them by their white-shoe brethren in the corporate bar as well as a highly developed capacity for nursing a grudge. That's certainly true of Buzbee, who contemptuously refers to corporate-defense lawyers as the ''bow-tie brigade'' and doesn't have much better to say about many of his fellow trial lawyers. ''I'm at war,'' he wrote me in August. ''This is my mission. As a Marine I won't fail.'' For those who know Buzbee, this is a familiar stance. ''When Tony tries a case, he opens a flamethrower right away,'' Richard Melancon, a former partner, says. ''A flamethrower attached to a bulldozer.'' Of course, to be in a position to scorch the enemy, you first have to navigate past your own lines.
Buzbee was among the first to file a case relating to the disaster, but in the six months since the explosion, hundreds of lawsuits have been filed against BP, Transocean, Halliburton and other companies involved with the doomed well. There are suits brought by some of the 126 people who were onboard the Deepwater Horizon when it exploded, as well as by their families and dependents. There are personal-injury claims brought by cleanup workers, first responders and others who say they were hurt from exposure to the spilled crude or to Corexit, the chemical used by BP to disperse the oil. There are cases brought by people who suffered economic harm from the spill. This diverse group includes commercial fishermen, shrimpers and oystermen; hotel and resort owners along the coast where there were cancellations; restaurants and other businesses that saw customer traffic dry up; and property owners who have seen their holdings devalued. Most of the plaintiffs live, naturally, along the Gulf Coast, but suits have been brought from places as far away as California, Kentucky and Illinois, and new ones are being filed all the time.
In June, BP sized up this onslaught of litigation as well as its sagging stock price and, under pressure from the Obama administration, struck an unprecedented deal to create a $20 billion trust fund to compensate those damaged by the spill. The fund was intended to speed up the process of compensating victims, and BP, at the administration's urging, hired Kenneth Feinberg, the veteran mediation specialist, to oversee the claims process. Since taking over in late August, Feinberg, who also administered the compensation fund for the victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and oversaw the executive-compensation system for bailed-out banks, has paid out more than $1.5 billion to parties injured by the spill. But those initial payments -- mostly short-term emergency relief to fishermen, shrimpers and small-business owners -- represent only a fraction of BP's total liability. The oil giant has spent billions more on environmental cleanup. It pledged $100 million to compensate offshore workers idled by the deep-water drilling moratorium imposed by the Obama administration and $500 million to monitor the spill's impact upon the Gulf Coast in coming years. BP has spent millions to finance ad campaigns for state tourism offices and the seafood industry -- and, of course, many millions more on an ad blitz to mend the company's own tattered image.
By the end of October, BP estimated that it had spent more than $12 billion in connection with the disaster. The company's total liabilities from the spill, including fines, cleanup costs and litigation, have been estimated to be somewhere between $30 billion and $60 billion. By comparison, the Valdez spill in Alaska cost Exxon a total of about $4.3 billion. In short, BP is facing the most expensive corporate environmental catastrophe in history.
The BP disaster comes at a pivotal juncture for the American trial bar. In many respects its power and influence hit its zenith in the late 1990s, when a coalition suing the tobacco industry on behalf of 46 states reached a landmark $206 billion settlement in a case that both fundamentally altered the public's perception of cigarette smoking and made billionaires out of several of the lawyers involved. That settlement led to predictions, both dire and hopeful, that the trial bar would use its newfound financial clout to go after a host of other industries, transforming the face of American capitalism.
There were other victories, but a change in how the average person viewed trial lawyers never came to pass. Instead, the past decade has seen a steady diminishment in the trial bar's influence in American life. In the courts, a series of rulings has limited the size of punitive-damage awards, the trial bar's most potent weapon when going after corporations. In Congress and state legislatures, the tort-reform movement, spearheaded by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, has scored a string of legislative victories, capping damage awards and limiting the scope of class-action litigation. But nowhere has the trial bar's defeat been more decisive than in the court of public opinion, perhaps best personified by the story of Stella Liebeck, the 79-year-old New Mexico grandmother who successfully sued McDonald's for $2.9 million in 1994 after she was badly burned by a cup of their coffee (the award was later reduced to $640,000). The McDonald's Coffee Lady entered the public's consciousness as a potent symbol of the tort system run amok and marked a turning point in efforts by industry to thwart its chief adversaries. In the last decade, groups like the American Tort Reform Association have waged an effective campaign against the evils of ''jackpot justice,'' ''runaway juries'' and ''judicial hellholes.'' So successful were these efforts in shaping public opinion that the Association of Trial Lawyers of America determined in 2006 that the term ''trial lawyer'' had become so toxic that it had to be jettisoned and voted to change its name to the American Association for Justice.
Given that history, the BP spill offers the trial bar a chance to burnish its image with the public and recapture the narrative from its corporate enemies, all while making a fortune in fees. The contest pits sympathetic gulf fishermen, oiled critters and hard-working rig workers against BP, one of the largest oil companies in the world, with a demonstrably lousy safety record and a lingering patina from its British colonial past. When BP's nebbishy former chief executive Tony Hayward acted as the corporate frontman in the months following the spill, traversing the Gulf Coast and committing one plummy-accented gaffe after another, the trial bar could hardly believe its luck.
Enter into this scene Kenneth Feinberg. Normally the appearance of $20 billion in settlement money within months of a disaster would cause the trial bar to rejoice. But soon after his appointment was announced, Feinberg began making a provocative suggestion: maybe trial lawyers weren't going to be necessary at all. ''That shrimper should come right into this fund, doesn't need a lawyer, doesn't have to pay a lawyer 40 percent of what he receives,'' Feinberg said on NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' one of several similar statements he made early in his tenure. (Lawyers whose clients get compensation from the fund typically take a smaller cut than they would on a full-fledged court case.) Though Feinberg later tempered his views, the damage to his relations with the trial bar was done. In Feinberg, many trial lawyers saw a man who was doing BP's bidding, someone who was not only trying to shortchange their clients but also to take money from their pockets and rob them of their moment of glory. While that may seem of no concern to either Feinberg or BP, in truth both need at least some cooperation from the trial bar to encourage those harmed by the spill to seek compensation from the fund rather than swamping the courts with lawsuits, which, after all, is what the fund was created to avoid.
As the term implies, a key to influence in a mass tort is achieving mass. From the moment a cataclysm like BP's Deepwater Horizon blowout occurs, a trial lawyer is on the clock. How much power he can wield in the expanding litigation is often determined, or at least influenced, by how many clients he has and how quickly he gets to court.
While lawyers can be sanctioned for directly soliciting clients for representation on a specific case, they have, naturally, devised various ways to work around that prohibition -- television ads are one. But with some notable exceptions, high-end trial lawyers like Buzbee shy away from late-night, basic-cable inducements. A more-nuanced approach is to mount their own investigations into the cause of a given accident. This is perfectly legitimate, as long as the lawyer doesn't directly solicit the people he interviews. Of course, if the person interviewed gets it into his head to hire that smart lawyer who knew so much about the incident, well, so much the better. In the weeks following the BP disaster, Buzbee's investigator was able to interview and take statements from about 60 people who were aboard the Deepwater Horizon when it exploded. The investigation gave Buzbee an early look at key witnesses months or even years before they might testify in depositions or at trial, though he did make several of his clients available to government investigators. He also allowed rig workers to use a private jet, one of three that he owns, to attend the funerals of their co-workers.
Another tactic to attract potential clients is the informational seminar. Within weeks after the BP spill began, trial lawyers were crisscrossing the gulf states, meeting with seafood and tourism associations and appearing at town hall-style get-togethers, concerts and other gatherings, where they could make presentations to victims of the spill. At one memorable four-hour event for Vietnamese fishermen in Louisiana, Robin Greenwald, a lawyer from the Manhattan firm of Weitz & Luxenberg, flew in to give a talk on the spill (translated onstage into Vietnamese), and her assistant serenaded the crowd with a version of Woody Guthrie's ''This Land Is Your Land'' that incorporated lyrics about the struggles of gulf fishermen.
As it became apparent over the summer that the oil from the ongoing spill was drifting toward the white-sand beaches of the Florida Panhandle, Buzbee and other lawyers shifted their attention to the multibillion-dollar hotel-resort market centered along the state's Gulf Coast. Buzbee made multiple trips to meet with resort and restaurant owners and establish contact with local lawyers who could serve as referral counsel. He also brought potential clients to Houston on his private plane. Moving into a different market ''is kind of like being a Marine,'' Buzbee told me. ''You establish a beachhead. Then get your communications and logistics working properly.''
At one point Buzbee thought he had stolen a march on his Florida rivals by locking up representation of the powerful Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association, whose 10,000 members make up the largest block of hotel and resort owners in the state. Buzbee is close to Keith Overton, the group's chairman, but in an unexpected twist (at least to Buzbee), the board voted to hire a consortium of firms led by Perry Weitz, a prominent Manhattan trial lawyer (with whom Robin Greenwald works), and Levin Papantonio, a Florida firm. ''I thought the fix was in, but it turned out they had it in better,'' a chagrined Buzbee says.
Despite the setback, Buzbee remained determined to capture a piece of the lucrative Florida market. I caught up with him in mid-July at a La Quinta Inn just outside Panama City to watch him make a presentation to a gathering of potential clients, most of them Indian-Americans who owned chain hotels in the state's Panhandle region. A strong smell of curry wafted into the conference room from a lavish buffet in the lobby, while Buzbee sat fiddling with his PowerPoint presentation and sniping at one of his associates over small typos and mistakes. Buzbee, it turns out, is a stickler for grammar.
Buzbee was introduced to the group by J. L. Evans, who is what is known as a public insurance adjuster, a job description with which I was not familiar. Buzbee hadn't been either until adjusters began contacting him after Hurricane Ike. Sometimes called storm chasers, public adjusters are licensed by states and operate as consultants, helping property owners file claims with their insurance carriers and usually getting a percentage of the proceeds. Unlike lawyers, they are not prohibited from directly soliciting clients. The adjuster can recommend a lawyer to his clients, if they need one, and a lawyer can likewise recommend an adjuster to his clients who want help filing their insurance claims.
Evans's practice took off after Hurricane Opal in 1995, and his home range is the Florida Panhandle, but he goes where the storms go. After Ike hit Galveston, Evans traveled to Texas and eventually began working with Buzbee. Recounting stories of Buzbee's prowess in handling an insurance- company witness, Evans repeatedly dug his finger into my chest and exclaimed in a loud voice, ''He got Buzzzed!'' Buzbee also teamed with a Florida lawyer who was a past president of the local chamber of commerce, a common practice in which a local lawyer receives a split of the fee for recommending the out-of-town tort lawyer to his clients.
Before the lights went down, Buzbee reminded everyone to fill in the sign-up sheets being circulated around the room, so they could get in touch with him later with any questions. On a table at the front of the room was a stack of retainer agreements for those who decided to hire Buzbee on the spot. The purpose of the meeting, Buzbee told the group, was to discuss why they needed a lawyer to help them fight BP and why, if they chose to get a lawyer, they should consider him for the job. As the PowerPoint slides clicked through, Buzbee paused to make his key arguments. To make their claims, the hotel owners would have to calculate what revenue they lost as a result of the spill. Buzbee advised them not to base this calculation on revenue earned during the recession years of 2008 and 2009 but rather to project what they would have made in light of an economic recovery. ''Only you know your business,'' Buzbee told the crowd. ''No one knows your business as well as you.''
Buzbee assured the hotel owners that, if hired, his economic experts would sit with them to work out what their projected revenue would have been but for the spill, not just in the next few quarters but also over the next few years. ''We all are fighting a perception problem, whether or not oil has ever touched the beach,'' he said, cautioning that dealing with BP's agents was just like dealing with an insurance company after a car accident. ''What do you think the adjustment firm's goal is?'' Buzbee asked. ''You think their goal is to pay you as much as possible?'' Heads shook around the room. ''They would not be BP's third-party administrator if they were paying the claims the way they should be paid. End of story. That's the facts.''
Buzbee made sure to note that his firm had won the largest single verdict against BP in the history of the company. (He did not, however, mention that a federal judge reduced that $100 million jury award to less than $500,000 earlier this year, finding that the punitive damages were not warranted.) For good measure, Buzbee got in a dig at Feinberg, who would soon take over the BP claims process. BP's $20 billion fund might be unprecedented, Buzbee told the worried businessmen, but in his view Feinberg was nothing more than a glorified mediator. His job was to get a settlement done, not to make sure claimants were made whole. ''He wants a deal, and the more people he can peel out of the litigation process and resolve in the claims process, the better it is for Ken Feinberg,'' Buzbee said. BP and Feinberg, Buzbee told the crowd, ''will talk about every weakness you have with your claim. You need somebody there who can talk about every strength of your claim. At the end of the day, that's why you need a lawyer.'' And, of course, Tony Buzbee stood ready to do that job. ''There's no law firm in the country who's done the work we've already done on this case,'' Buzbee said. ''There's just not.'' He paused and added, ''I've been dealing with these guys for many, many years.''
Buzbee and his fellow trial lawyers weren't the only ones who spent the summer in the gulf region holding meetings with spill victims. In small communities like Houma, La., Biloxi, Miss., and Bayou La Batre, Ala., Kenneth Feinberg appeared at packed town-hall meetings to introduce himself -- the $20 billion man! -- to Gulf Coast residents who were eager to take his measure. The reception was not always warm. The hostility was not entirely Feinberg's fault. Anyone perceived to be stepping into BP's shoes was bound to absorb the anger directed at the company and, to put it delicately, in Southern pickup-truck country, a lawyer from Washington with a heavy Boston accent (oystah hah-vah-stahs) was burdened with the same outsider status that plagued Tony Hayward during his stint as BP's front man.
But, as Feinberg acknowledges, many of his wounds were self-inflicted. Onstage, his professorial persona sometimes came across as didactic and even hectoring. He would often stake out a position in a meeting only to reverse it a few days or weeks later. Before taking over the claims process, Feinberg loudly criticized BP for its foot-dragging and repeatedly promised restive crowds that on his watch it would take just 48 hours to pay emergency claims by individuals and just seven days for business claims. Instead, for many the process dragged out for weeks or longer while their cash ran out. ''His whole operation was about as badly rolled out as the Edsel,'' says Scott Bickford, a New Orleans trial lawyer. As Feinberg repeatedly said, he ''overpromised and underdelivered.'' In mid-September, the Justice Department gave Feinberg a public kick in the shins, and he responded by rapidly speeding up payments to spill victims.
Yet despite the volleys of criticism directed at Feinberg by trial lawyers, public officials and disgruntled claimants, the fact remains that by the end of October he had doled out more than $1.5 billion in emergency payments to distressed workers and businesses in the gulf region. That stands in stark contrast to the experience of the victims of the last major oil spill to foul U.S. waters. In 1989, after the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince William Sound, thousands of Alaska residents discovered to their dismay that, under the antiquated provisions of maritime law, they had no right to recover any damages at all against Exxon even though their livelihoods were decimated by the spill. Many of those who did have standing to sue wound up in a protracted legal battle that would not reach its conclusion until 2008, when the Supreme Court finally ended it. ''By that time, a third of my clients were dead,'' says Elizabeth Cabraser, a San Francisco trial lawyer, who worked on the Valdez case and is also a leader in the trial bar's effort against BP.
After the Valdez disaster, Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act, which greatly expanded eligibility for damage claims from offshore spills like the Valdez or the Deepwater Horizon. It also required that the party deemed responsible by the government compensate victims. Given the fact that the law has been on the books for 20 years, you might assume that setting up a compensation fund for victims of the BP spill would be a straightforward matter. It has not been. In fact, a good deal of the delay in getting Feinberg installed to run the fund was caused by intense bickering among trial lawyers, BP and the government over how exactly the fund should operate -- disagreements that persist to this day. And while those disagreements are varied, the main source is clear: Feinberg's principal objective is to keep people out of the courts, to bypass the tort system that the trial bar has labored so hard to construct over the past four decades. Feinberg likes to boast that under his stewardship 97 percent of claimants to the 9/11 compensation fund never filed suit. Though he acknowledges that the circumstances of the oil spill are quite different, he says that he would like to achieve a similar result with the BP fund. ''Don't underestimate the existential nature of finality,'' he told me. ''Here is a check; let's close the chapter on this so we can move on. It's almost cruel when the uncertainty of the present continues on into the future.''
It is precisely that ''existential finality'' that has the trial bar worried. The Feinberg fund represents an alternative model for the resolution of big disasters, one that moves trial lawyers from center stage to a spot in the chorus. Over the last few decades the trial bar has built what amounts to a private-enterprise regulatory machine, compiling an impressive string of victories over -- or at least a series of large settlements from -- the most powerful corporations in the world. Some call them parasites and label their style of litigation the ''American disease.'' Others see them as the last truly effective check on corporate power left in the U.S. system. With the Feinberg model comes the prospect of their further diminishment, a blueprint for a future without big-time trial lawyers. And they are not willing to accept that future without a fight.
Does the settlement fund represent a superior alternative to trial-lawyer-financed litigation? For some claimants, undoubtedly it does. Since increasing his efforts in September, Feinberg has proved generous to workers and other small claimants seeking compensation for lost wages. But for others, principally business owners, the fund has so far been a bust. John Nelson, president of Bon Secour Fisheries, a seafood processor and supplier on the Alabama coast, neatly sums up the difference. He says that while his workers have been compensated by the fund for lost wages, his company has received only about 10 percent of its claimed losses. ''I think everybody is prepared to pursue litigation, but we'd much rather not have to,'' says Nelson, who has retained a lawyer (not Buzbee). Jo Bonner, a Republican congressman whose Alabama district encompasses the state's Gulf Coast, says Nelson's experience is a common one among his constituents. ''I know a lot of money has been paid out, but many, many, many haven't been paid, have been denied or gotten only partial payment and no explanation why,'' Bonner says.
Feinberg says he is working hard to get people compensation. ''I want to discourage claimants from litigating, and it's the claimant I'm thinking about here,'' Feinberg says, arguing that his standards for documenting losses are far more liberal than those that people are likely to encounter in court. ''I want to see these people made whole, and quickly, and not after years of litigation,'' Feinberg says. But while Feinberg casts himself as a neutral arbiter seeking to get victims just compensation, the fact that he is paid by BP has inevitably led to a perception among many spill victims that he is BP's guy. Trial lawyers frequently note that Feinberg, despite repeated promises to do so, has been slow to reveal details surrounding his compensation and that the initial criteria he set up for paying claims was in many ways more onerous than required under the Oil Pollution Act. (In October, Bloomberg reported that Feinberg's firm was being paid $850,000 a month by BP.) ''This fund is being publicized as some kind of magnanimous gesture, when in fact BP is only doing what is obligated to do by law,'' says Anthony Tarricone, a Boston-based trial lawyer and recent past president of the American Association for Justice. Trial lawyers also argue that there is a social cost to using an administrative fund like Feinberg's in lieu of litigation. ''BP does not want to see a trial, they want to quietly sweep this thing under the rug,'' Stuart Smith, a lawyer in Louisiana, says. ''But I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure a jury finds out what happened.''
So far most of the skirmishing between Feinberg and the trial bar has been behind the scenes, but that may change. On Nov. 23, the initial emergency phase of the compensation-fund payout comes to an end. During this phase, claimants have been able to get up to six months' compensation with comparatively little documentation and without having to give up their rights to sue BP. That will not be the case in the next phase, during which claimants will have to sign releases agreeing not to sue BP, and possibly all other potential defendants, to get their final payment. Trial lawyers have pushed back against the idea of these releases, arguing that no such requirement appears in the law. ''If Ken only offers them partial compensation -- which, trust me, he will -- then trying to get them to sign away all their rights for a reduced number is outrageous,'' says Perry Weitz, who has served as a lead negotiator with Feinberg on some of the trial bar's issues.
In the last month Feinberg moved to address some of the trial bar's concerns. He loosened the so-called proximity requirement, which made it difficult for hotel and restaurant owners not in the immediate zone of the spill to claim damages, and agreed to reverse his stance against making payments to claimants while they negotiate a final settlement. Feinberg also suggests that some in the trial bar might be surprised by the size of the final offers he will be making. ''If you want people to waive their right to sue, you better be pretty generous so that they will assume the risk of being better off with a lump-sum payment now.'' Of course, Feinberg notes, participation in his fund remains purely voluntary: ''If you think you can get a better deal in court, then by all means, go litigate.'' That certainly remains on option for some, like Keith Overton, who is also the chief operating officer of TradeWinds Island Resorts, which Buzbee represents. ''Unless Feinberg changes his position on losses occurring further out than two years from now, I don't think he's going to offer a fair long-term settlement,'' says Overton, who also says he is unwilling to sign away the rights of his business to sue and leave money on the table.
Determining just where Overton and other potential litigants would have to go to bring their cases against BP if they chose not to settle with Feinberg was the question that drew an elite contingent of the American trial bar into courtroom No. 3 on the sixth floor of the James A. McClure federal building in Boise, Idaho, at a little after 9 a.m. on Thursday, July 29. Crowded into that remote outpost of the federal judiciary was a veritable loya jirga of the nation's top trial lawyers. From California came Elizabeth Cabraser, the pixieish San Franciscan who is helping to lead the legal assault against Toyota for sudden-acceleration problems with its vehicles. Seated nearby was Perry Weitz, Manhattan's king of asbestos litigation. At a table up front, Russ Herman and Daniel Becnel, two old bulls from Louisiana who helped fight the tobacco wars in the 1990s. Behind them, W. Mark Lanier the boyish-looking Texas tort lawyer and Baptist Sunday-school teacher whose pride of place was from scoring the first big verdict against Merck in the Vioxx litigation. Lounging against a far wall in a tailor-made light blue pinstripe suit, brown shoes and no socks was Buzbee, and seated next to him was his friend Mikal Watts, whose bald pate and bulldog countenance belie the Texas lawyer's genial disposition. Watts, by his count, accumulated 40,000 clients interested in suing BP in the months after the blowout.
The federal judiciary agreed in May to consider consolidating the flood of cases around the country related to the oil spill before a single judge in one court, a proceeding known as multidistrict litigation, or MDL, which was created in the late 1960s and took off in the 1970s and 1980s when mass litigation related to things like asbestos and breast implants threatened to overwhelm the federal courts. Over the last two decades it has become an arena of law unto itself, with a cadre of lawyers who specialize in handling big MDL cases and get rich doing so. Though designed to increase efficiency by consolidating pretrial discovery from multiple cases into a single proceeding, some trial lawyers feel that the MDL process has become just another layer of sclerotic bureaucracy in the judiciary, one that uproots and centralizes litigation before the first case is even tried.
The panel of judges that decides where and how to consolidate cases operates as a kind of a roving litigation carnival that opens in a different town every other month. In theory the panel is supposed to assign the MDL by following such criteria as the capacity of a judge to handle the caseload and the locations of evidence, witnesses, plaintiffs and defendants. In practice, the MDL panel has discretion to select a venue and often confounds the expectations of the parties.
In the case of the BP spill, 23 lawyers were allowed to make presentations to the panel, suggesting judicial districts in various states where they believed the BP cases should be sent. In a proceeding that resembled a kind of legal speed dating, each lawyer had two or three minutes to speak. They would hustle to make their pitches before a red light signaled it was time for the next lawyer to rush up for a turn at the lectern. For reasons that remained opaque, some lawyers were parceled out more time than others, and their presentations varied accordingly. Russ Herman, arguing for his home district in New Orleans, was given a comparatively magisterial three minutes, and his argument incorporated the Mississippi River flood of 1927, the Roman jurist Cicero and a quote from Shakespeare's ''Measure for Measure.''
Lanier carried the ball for a group of Texas trial lawyers and made a rather elaborate six-minute presentation that lauded Houston's ''deep bench'' of federal judges. Several lawyers, including Cabraser, made compromise suggestions, like having the cases heard in New Orleans but importing a judge from an outside jurisdiction to avoid perceived conflicts of interest among the Louisiana judges.
For trial lawyers the choice of venue is, as you might expect, a pocketbook issue. The judge overseeing the MDL customarily exercises a lot of sway and forms a steering committee of trial lawyers to help the court coordinate the workload. There is no sure path to serving on such a committee, but having a lot of cases helps, as does having a good reputation with the judge and a solid track record handling mass torts. Money is a factor, too, as committee members are expected to put up cash to finance costs like the hiring of experts, the collection of evidence, document management and other expensive items involved in mounting complex litigation. Committee members might have to spend up to a million dollars each or more.
But of course, a spot on the steering committee can be extremely lucrative. Members of the committee are in a position to receive a percentage of the fees earned by all the lawyers involved in the litigation as compensation for their work organizing the documents, depositions and other trial materials developed for the ''common benefit'' of all the cases. In litigation the size of the BP disaster, that could mean millions of dollars in additional fees for every lawyer on the committee, which is why so much high-priced legal talent was willing to trek out to Boise for the sake of two-minute sales pitch. It is also why, despite all the bro-hugs and back slaps around the courtroom before the hearing, competition among and within the various factions was intense.
Buzbee has played a central role in some MDL litigation, notably on behalf of hurricane victims housed in substandard FEMA trailers, but he is not really a mass-tort lawyer and, unlike many of the trial lawyers in Boise, not a political animal. Profane, flamboyant and flagrantly aggressive, he's something of a throwback to an earlier generation of trial lawyers, whose favorite place in the world was on their feet in court wearing out of some corporate malefactor. MDL cases, by contrast, with their endless confabs, committee work and procedural wrangling, are not well suited for a man with Buzbee's pugnacious temperament. In fact, corralling dangerous legal agents like Tony Buzbee, who might otherwise wrest control of some tidy corner of the legal system and bend it to their will, is one thing that MDL proceedings are designed to accomplish.
Buzbee also had some practical concerns. Though it is not all that unusual for a besieged defendant like BP to set up a big compensation fund for victims, it usually comes only in the form of a settlement following years of intense litigation. With the gulf oil spill, BP flipped the script. The $20 billion fund is sufficiently large to exert a gravitational force, giving lawyers some pause in considering just how valuable the MDL litigation may end up being. As Buzbee put it, with characteristic bluntness: ''Now you've got a $20 billion fund. So a guy that goes and collects 20,000 clients can take them through the fund, make a mint and tell the committee: 'You aren't getting a penny of my money. I don't care how many depositions you took, I never filed suit.' ''
On Aug. 10, the Boise MDL panel decided to send most of the BP cases to Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans. Buzbee had been rooting for Houston, but despite this, and despite his inborn aversion to working nicely with people, he immediately began strategizing to gain a seat on the steering committee. In all, more than 100 lawyers applied for 15 spots. Buzbee was at a disadvantage, not having any experience before Judge Barbier or a long track record in MDL cases.
Buzbee's near-term focus was the possibility of getting his personal-injury cases out of federal court and to state court back in Texas. So he decided to approach Steve Herman and James Roy, the two Louisiana trial lawyers tapped by Judge Barbier to serve as liaison counsel for the plaintiffs, with the idea that they support a motion to allow him to take one of his cases back to Texas and try it as a ''bellwether.'' Buzbee was sure that he could move quickly to uncover loads of damaging information and, with the right judge and jury, stun BP, Transocean, Halliburton and the other defendants with a whopping verdict. This, he argued, would benefit the rest of the cases back in the MDL by speeding up the whole process, Buzbee style.
This gambit was vintage Buzbee. I was reminded of something he said to me weeks earlier. We were sitting in the basement of his sprawling home outside Houston, in a kind of man cave with a bar and a liquor cabinet that played the theme music of ''Monday Night Football'' when its doors were opened. Buzbee told me that what he really wanted was to be the lawyer to depose senior BP corporate officers, reprising his performance in the Texas City litigation. Buzbee's main fear about the MDL, he told me, was not so much losing out on the committee money (though he was interested in that as well), but being kept on the sidelines during the biggest litigation in the country's history. ''What's that line in the movie 'Patton,' '' Buzbee said. ''You don't want to have to tell your grandkids that you spent the war shoveling crap in Louisiana.''
In late August, Buzbee flew to New Orleans with a pair of Texas lawyers to meet with Herman and Roy in a private dinning room at the elegant Windsor Court Hotel. He said he had high hopes going in but was circumspect coming out. The Louisiana lawyers seemed hostile to his strategy and had some concerns about his fellow Texas lawyers trying to lure clients away from Louisiana lawyers (a common complaint by the Louisiana trial bar). Despite his resources and history litigating against BP, Buzbee became increasingly doubtful about his chances of making the steering committee. Herman pointed out, not unreasonably, that it was tough for Buzbee to argue for a spot on the steering committee when his objective was to get out of the MDL process and back in state court as soon as he could.
At the initial organizational hearing for the MDL in September before Judge Barbier, Buzbee kept a low profile as a group of lawyers with personal-injury cases argued that it would be unfair to make the families of the dead and the injured wait on the slow-moving MDL process before going to trial. Barbier was notably cool to the idea of trying the death and injury cases before liability for the oil spill had been determined and denied the group's motion. (Sensing the defeat, Buzbee, who represents 18 of the injured rig workers, had asked the group not to include his name with their motion.)
Barbier has set the first big trial in the case for February 2012, which is when he is expected to apportion liability among the defendants involved with the blowout. In October, Barbier made his selections for the 15-person plaintiffs' steering committee. Buzbee was not among them, though his friend Mikal Watts made it. None of the lawyers chosen to serve have much history suing BP.
Though his prospects for playing a leading role in the BP litigation were diminished by his failure to make it on to the steering committee, Buzbee remained enthusiastic about his cases and was busy gearing up for pending settlement negotiations on injury claims for those clients who were aboard the Deepwater Horizon. BP and the other defendants will very likely be eager to settle with these sympathetic plaintiffs and get them out of the MDL litigation. When I talked to Buzbee in mid-October, he sounded almost giddy at the prospect of once again extracting a sizeable settlement from the oil giant. Then, in late October, he got the news that he had been named to one of the MDL's many subcommittees -- one that would give him a role managing discovery, raising Buzbee's hopes that he might yet get a crack at deposing top corporate executives in the case. He still travels to Florida regularly to meet with potential hotel and resort clients and recently flew a group of Vietnamese restaurant owners from Louisiana to Washington to meet with Senator Mary Landrieu and complain about Kenneth Feinberg. He says he now has 55 people who do nothing but work on spill cases. ''I'm going to have to be dealt with at some point,'' he told me. ''Whatever happens, I promise you at some point they are going to have to deal with me.''

BYLINE: By DAN LEVIN.

 BODY:
IN her ballroom dance class, Li Wanrong has learned to tango and cha-cha. At lunch one day, she tried a strange mix of flavors -- pepperoni pizza, the spicy sausage and oozing cheese nearly burning her tongue. Then there was that Friday night before going clubbing for the first time when new friends gave her a makeover, and she looked in the mirror to see an American girl smiling back wearing a little black dress, red lipstick and fierce eyeliner.
''I say 'wow' a lot,'' says Ms. Li, a freshman at Drew University, a small liberal arts school in Madison, N.J.
Against her parents' wishes, she studied for and took the SAT in Hong Kong, a three-hour bus ride from her home in southern China. She told them she was going there to do some shopping. Her parents eventually came around, persuaded by her determination and a $12,000 scholarship that would take some of the sting out of the $40,000 tuition at Drew, which her high school teacher had recommended. 
Describing her whirlwind transformation to college kid sometimes leaves Ms. Li at a loss for words. And sometimes the cultural distance seems too much, especially when facing dining options in the cafeteria. ''Sometimes I feel when I go back to China I'll never eat a hamburger ever again,'' she says, laughing.
Ms. Li is part of a record wave of Chinese high school graduates enrolling in American colleges, joining the fabric of campus life as roommates and study partners and contributing to the global perspectives to which colleges are so eager to expose their students.
''China is going to matter greatly to all students in the 21st century,'' says Robert Weisbuch, president of Drew, which has increased its international enrollment by 60 percent in the last five years. ''We feel it is important to provide the opportunity for American and Chinese students to learn from one another.''
While China's students have long filled American graduate schools, its undergraduates now represent the fastest-growing group of international students. In 2008-9, more than 26,000 were studying in the United States, up from about 8,000 eight years earlier, according to the Institute of International Education.
Students are ending up not just at nationally known universities, but also at regional colleges, state schools and even community colleges that recruit overseas. Most of these students pay full freight (international students are not eligible for government financial aid) -- a benefit for campuses where the economic downturn has gutted endowments or state financing.
The boom parallels China's emergence as the world's largest economy after the United States. China is home to a growing number of middle-class parents who have saved for years to get their only child into a top school, hoping for an advantage in a competitive job market made more so by a surge in college graduates. Since the 1990s, China has doubled its number of higher education institutions. More than 60 percent of high school graduates now attend a university, up from 20 percent in the 1980s. But this surge has left millions of diploma-wielding young people unable to find white-collar work in a country still heavily reliant on low-paying manufacturing.
''The Chinese are going to invest in anything that gives them an edge, and having a U.S. degree certainly gives them that edge back home,'' says Peggy Blumenthal, a vice president at the Institute of International Education. American colleges offer the chance to gain fluency in English, develop real-world skills, and land a coveted position with a multinational corporation or government agency.
Ding Yinghan grew up in a modest apartment with his mother, a marketing executive, and his father, a civil servant in Beijing's work safety administration whose own mother is illiterate. A child of the ''new China,'' he is fully aware that his generation has opportunities unavailable to any before.
His parents pushed him to study hard -- and study abroad -- because they have little faith in the Chinese education system. Sipping tea in their living room one sweltering August afternoon, Mr. Ding's mother, Meng Suyan, reflects on the Chinese classroom. ''In the U.S. they focus on creative-thinking skills, while in China they only focus on theory,'' she says. ''So what university students learn here doesn't prepare them for the real world.''
Says Mr. Ding: ''Chinese values require me to be a good listener, and Western values require me to be a good speaker.''
A bespectacled whiz kid, Mr. Ding was accepted early admission to Hamilton College in upstate New York following a yearlong exchange program at a North Carolina public high school. Now a junior, he is on a full scholarship, No. 1 in his class and spending this year at Dartmouth on a dual-degree engineering program. He also founded the bridge club at Hamilton, ran the Ping-Pong team, wrote for the student newspaper and tutored in chemistry, physics and economics for $8.50 an hour.
His first tutoring job was freshman year, when his advanced calculus professor asked him to help classmates struggling with the material. Over textbooks and calculators, Mr. Ding used the opportunity to practice his English and find commonalities with people who had never met someone from China.
At Hamilton, he is surrounded by wealth -- some students, he says, fly to Manhattan on weekends in helicopters, party with Champagne instead of beer, and smoke $100 cigars. It's a new experience for a man who gets his hair cut a few times a year because the $15 is a lot of money for his parents, who fret that they cannot afford to provide him with health insurance in the United States. But sending their child to live across the world is a worthy sacrifice, says his father, Ding Dapeng. ''In China 25 years ago it was rare to even go to university, so for Yinghan to study in the U.S. is a real miracle.''
''Today the world is so small,'' he says. ''Only by broadening his knowledge with an international background can Yinghan really become a global citizen.''
THE cultural exchange perhaps manifests itself most in the intimacy of the shared dorm room.
When Mariapaola La Barbera learned last summer that her roommate at Drew would come from China, her mother was thrilled. ''She said, 'They're smart people, so you'll learn from her and be focused.' ''
She shares a room with Li Wanrong. The two have tacked funky tie-dye tapestries and a poster of the Eiffel Tower to the walls; Ms. Li is planning to study Spanish while perfecting her English, and has taped the words ''hola'' and ''muy bien'' next to her laptop.
''Wanrong is very brave,'' Ms. La Barbera says. ''I give her a lot of credit for moving across the world and being so focused.'' Still, Ms. La Barbera, who knew no one from China, says: ''It's different. I'm not going to lie.''
They have different groups of friends but are friendly. The roommates have taught each other words in Mandarin and Italian, discussed the political differences between the United States and China, and had impromptu lessons on American slang.
Ms. Li's teachers in China had told her that American parents kick their children out of the house when they turn 18. Ms. La Barbera, who goes home to Staten Island every weekend, has corrected this misconception.
''She's like a window,'' Ms. Li says. ''I can watch her and see what Americans are like.''
As a freshman at Central Michigan University, Qi Fan realized that even Americans come from different cultures. His roommates -- one black, one white -- spoke to him in different accents and had social circles that largely matched their own skin color. Sometimes they would grab him out of bed and drag him to parties where beer pong was played all night.
Mr. Qi had learned of Central Michigan from a Chinese friend who went there, and it was talked up by a company in China that recruits students. Originally he had considered Britain or Germany, but his parents decided there was little point in paying for college in ''second-tier'' countries, and they would send him to the United States ''no matter what, because it's the super power.''
But the American myth faded once he settled in. He disliked a campus culture that ''was all about drinking,'' and wanted a high-profile school closer to New York's finance world. In his sophomore year, Mr. Qi transferred to the University at Albany, of the State University of New York. He says he is happy there, makes trips to New York City in the car he just bought, and avoids any drinking culture by living with other Chinese off campus.
Partying is an American college rite of passage, but socializing in China is usually conducted around the table, where close friends cook, eat and play games together. The fun in standing around a dark room filled with strangers, speakers blaring, is often lost in translation.
Frances Liu, a Yale sophomore from the bustling city of Tianjin, remembers one night freshman year when friends started smoking marijuana. And then offered her the joint. ''They were like, 'Frances, come on,' '' she says, rolling her eyes. She declined, but the pressure to fit in meant plenty of late nights. ''I don't want to be in a bar drunk and grinding with someone I've never met and will never see again,'' Ms. Liu says. ''I've tried that. I went to parties every single weekend freshman year and realized it's not for me.''
Ms. Liu found refuge in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, the towering cube of translucent marble at Yale that holds thousands of the world's most precious written originals. Last summer she worked there as a page, bringing requested items to researchers. But more satisfying than the $12 an hour was discovering treasures like the original manuscript of Edith Wharton's ''Age of Innocence'' in the stacks and leafing through illuminated parchment from the ninth century. The experience has given her a deep appreciation for the West's values of transparency and access to information. ''In China, I'm used to secrecy, so being 18 and able to touch history with my bare fingers really impressed me,'' she says.
After a year, Ms. Liu believes she is less of the quiet-Asian-nerd stereotype that she had felt followed her through Yale's Gothic hallways. Now she wears makeup, raises her hand in class, and has a different perspective than her friends in China, according to whom ''I'm contaminated by American culture and not Chinese anymore.''
That harsh assessment is heard by many Chinese undergraduates, which they say is hard to ignore. It was in a freshman literature seminar class at Yale called ''Experiences of Being Foreign'' that Xu Luyi began to tackle the ''pulling force westernizing me rapidly and driving me away from my own background.''
''Somehow I was stuck in this middle zone and unable to identify with either side,'' says Ms. Xu, a sophomore from Shanghai. She was the only international student in the class. Rather than ignore her ''otherness,'' she dived into the course's exploration of identity construction and confusion, and embraced the assigned readings, by immigrants and exiles. For an assignment that required that students go somewhere that would make them feel foreign, she went to Bible study.
Where she ended up feeling most at home was in her dorm. The women in her hall would meet for tea and cookies every few weeks to discuss college life and address girl ''drama.'' This ''women's table,'' Ms. Liu says, ''was a great bonding experience and also a good chance to meditate on our experiences.''
Perhaps most unsettling to Chinese students is the robust activist culture on campus, where young Americans find their voices on issues like war, civil rights and immigration. In China, protests are illegal and vocal dissent forbidden, and on sensitive topics like Tibet and Taiwan a majority are in lockstep with their government. It can be especially painful hearing Westerners condemn China after growing up steeped in propaganda blaming the West for the suffering before Communism.
Shen Xinchao, a Rutgers junior from Shanghai, chose to attend college in the United States because ''here you can argue with professors, which is not encouraged in China,'' and choose a major rather than test into one. ''In China, your path is almost set when you get into college on the first day,'' he says.
But American college life presented obstacles. As a freshman, he found his campus lonely and alienating. First, he spent a semester living in a dorm lounge because Rutgers had run out of rooms for freshmen. Then he was paired with a roommate who challenged him over his homeland's human rights record. ''He thought China was just a very tyrannical Communist country that has no freedom, and that is not what life is really like there,'' says Mr. Shen, who has moved off campus to live with Chinese friends. ''Americans are friendly, but I just can't establish a deep relationship because our cultural differences are too deep.''
Some Chinese students have turned activist themselves to rebut criticism of homeland policies. Following China's crackdown on Tibet before the Beijing Olympics in summer 2008, furious groups of Chinese students confronted protesters who were trying to disrupt the torch relay in the United States. And on rare occasions, Chinese students have harassed pro-Tibet activists on campus, and sought to dissuade universities from inviting the Dalai Lama to speak on their campus.
But for the most part, raised on only whispers about the student troublemakers at Tiananmen Square, Chinese students steer clear of sit-ins, demonstrations and petitions.
''In China, we definitely don't see people marching in the streets, so it's a bit disturbing to see the masses rallying,'' says Li Yidan, a freshman at Yale, wearing a preppy white sweater at an off-campus cafe. ''People did that in 1989, and it ended in bloodshed.''
TO help students make the cultural leap -- as well as to internationalize their institutions -- colleges and universities are building programs that begin in China and end, hopefully, on an American campus.
Teachers College of Columbia University has started a program for high school seniors (in China, much of the last year is spent reviewing for a college entrance exam, though curriculum varies). This year, the program's first, 28 students spent six months at the University of International Relations in Beijing; 19 were found qualified to finish off the year at Columbia. The program preps students to apply as freshmen, with a focus on English instruction, cultural immersion and counseling, including study for the Test of English as a Foreign Language and SAT, and a tour of campuses in the Northeast. (Total cost: about $45,000, including room and board.)
Another new program, U.S.-Sino Pathway, aims to transition high school students into one of six participating colleges. Northeastern University devised the curriculum, a year of for-credit courses taken at Kaplan Inc. branches in China and at a summer bridge session at Northeastern's Boston campus or the University of Vermont. Kaplan handles administration, English-language instruction in China and recruitment of students. (Total cost: about $26,000 to $28,000, including room and board in the United States.)
Collaborations with for-profit education companies are beginning to gain traction as American institutions seek to tap their in-country resources. Kaplan has branches in eight Chinese cities; INTO University Partnerships, a British company with roots in China, similarly works with the University of South Florida and Oregon State. Kaplan, which has been criticized for overly aggressive recruiting in the United States, says it does not use a commission model or work with ''agents'' in China. Many Chinese hire agents to navigate the American admissions and visa maze. The industry has mushroomed, as has its reputation for unscrupulousness, like falsifying transcripts and making bloated promises.
The goal of U.S.-Sino Pathway, says Philomena Mantella, senior vice president for enrollment management at Northeastern, is to help Chinese families make informed choices and to increase readiness for the American experience. ''Finally,'' she says, ''we saw this through a global competitive lens. British and Australian institutions were ahead of us, and we saw an opportunity to offer a strong pathway to American universities.''
Students who complete the program's China portion apply as sophomore transfers to a consortium college -- the others are Baylor University, Marist College, Stevens Institute of Technology and the University of Utah. Of the 171 students who started in China, 138 were ultimately accepted into a degree program. Nine of those who didn't meet standards chose to work on their English in another Northeastern program, American Classroom, at its adult-education college on campus (a dozen of the successful matriculants ended up in its degree programs as well).
The University of Vermont joined the consortium to increase its international population, which was less than 1 percent of its undergraduates.
During Vermont's first bridge session, last summer, 29 new Chinese undergraduates absorbed American culture by hanging out with a crowd of aging hippies at a reggae concert. They went to the Ben & Jerry's factory and met with the co-founder Jerry Greenfield to discuss entrepreneurship and social justice. They also got face time with elected officials, including Vermont's governor and Burlington's mayor, for a lesson on democracy. Among course electives: ''History of Rock & Roll,'' for a hearing of Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan and the Doors.
Yuan Xiecheng, who grew up amid the neon-lit skyscrapers and karaoke emporiums of Shanghai, was eager to study abroad. He had planned to go to a Canadian university until he attended a presentation by the chief executive officer of Kaplan China, Zhou Yong. When Mr. Zhou announced that students would not have to take the SAT or TOEFL or attend the final year of high school, Mr. Yuan leaped at the opportunity. He attended an international high school, and says he was 20 course credits short of graduation. Instead, he took the final exam given to secure a Chinese diploma, and enrolled in the pathway program. He is now a sophomore at Vermont.
Zhao Siwei took the same route. ''This program is super easy to enter, and it was really easy to come here to the U.S.,'' says Ms. Zhao, who hopes to major in film and TV at Vermont. ''I love it here,'' she concludes. She expresses amazement, though, at her program peers' English: ''They can't talk. They can't communicate with American people.''
Language is one of Chinese students' biggest challenges. Mr. Yuan wishes he had had more exposure to the vernacular. His for-credit classes at Kaplan included calculus, chemistry and American studies, taught by instructors approved by Northeastern. But only half were Westerners, he says, and none American. His teachers in grammar, reading and listening comprehension were Chinese, he says, and ''some of their English was not good enough.''
Once in Vermont, Mr. Yuan worried when people smiled and asked ''What's up?'' ''It was really awkward,'' he says, ''because I wouldn't know how to respond and while I was thinking of an answer they would just walk away.''
Still, his English is strong enough that he joined the debate team, with its fast-clip speech and thinking. At weekly meetings he has argued about indigenous land rights and vote buying. Presenting an opinion in under seven minutes, as he did at his first competition, at Binghamton University, has helped him write college papers succinctly, he says, and question the world around him. ''It's about challenging the status quo and thinking of better solutions in a way I never thought about in China.''
ZHOU KEHUI had an unusual adjustment to Brigham Young University. Growing up in officially atheist China, she knew little about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, with which the university is affiliated. Mormonism is not a state-sanctioned religion, and proselytizing by its members is illegal.
Ms. Zhou chose Brigham Young on the recommendation of a friend of her father's, who had gone there. Its business school also ranks highly. Her parents thought the university's honor code, with its rules of conduct, would keep her safe and focused. Initially, however, the curfew and code, which includes a ban on short skirts and drinking tea, left her shellshocked.
''It was really hard for me to accept the rules in the beginning,'' says Ms. Zhou, a junior majoring in accounting. ''I mean, where I'm from, in Fujian province, drinking tea every day is what we do.''
But few American universities offer the comfort zone she found here. Though there are only 77 Chinese undergraduates at Brigham Young, with so many Mormons doing their two years of missionary work in Taiwan and Hong Kong, finding someone fluent in her language was easy. ''A lot of times I'd be walking on campus when some white dude would just come up to me and start speaking Chinese,'' Ms. Zhou says. That warmth and common experience -- not to mention several meetings with church missionaries -- went a long way toward convincing her B.Y.U. was the right match.
A few months after arriving, Ms. Zhou was baptized, which, she says, provided a support network. That Mormonism is considered subversive at home, or that her parents were unhappy with her conversion, gave her little pause. After all, she says, saving her soul was as logical as deciding to go to college in the United States. ''It wasn't a hard choice to make,'' she says. ''It's probably the best decision I've ever made in my life.''

HEADLINE: Working (and Living) The Company Way

BYLINE: By NANCY F. KOEHN

 BODY:
SEEN through the wide arc of history, ours is an edgy, mistrusting moment. Since the financial crisis two years ago, Americans have shown persistent skepticism about large corporations. According to a Pew Research Centerreport earlier this year, for example, only 25 percent of those surveyed say big business has a positive impact on how things are going in the country.
A new book, ''The Company Town: The Industrial Edens and Satanic Mills That Shaped the American Economy'' (Basic Books, $26.95), by Hardy Green, is not likely to restore our flagging faith in big business. 
Mr. Green, a former associate editor at BusinessWeek with a Ph.D. in history, has written a sprawling account of the rise and fall of company towns across the last 180 years of industrialization. The book leaves readers with a few flashes of encouragement but more moments of heavy-heartedness about the history of American capitalism. Mr. Green sets out two very different models of company towns. One is the utopian ideal, ''backed by companies that promise to share their bounty with workers and their families,'' and characterized by ample benefits for workers. At the other extreme is what Mr. Green calls ''exploitationville,'' a company-created town that operates on the logic that ''business exists to make a profit, not to coddle employees.''
Mr. Green sprints -- at times breathlessly -- through all kinds of company towns, mostly past but some present. He draws his research from a range of historical and current sources. (It includes a quotation from me. Disclaimer: I do not know Mr. Green.) He uses these accounts, in tandem with a clean, engaging voice, to tell story upon story.
The early chapters deal with the development of several utopian company towns, whose creators planned them in part by envisioning what they would not be. For example, the merchant Francis Cabot Lowell, who founded Lowell, Mass., in the 1820s to house his textile company, had visited Manchester, England, in 1811. He was struck by its filth and degradation, what he called the ''great corruption of the highest and lowest classes.''
Determined to avoid this outcome, he and his partners recruited young, unmarried women from Massachusetts farms as factory workers, housed them in supervised boardinghouses, provided them with pianos and libraries, and required them to attend church services.
Although on two occasions in the 1830s the mill women organized to protest wage cuts, outside observers found the town and its workers' lot superior to that of counterparts in Europe.
The chocolate king Milton Hershey began building his factory and model town almost a century later, in 1903. Like Mr. Lowell, he wanted to avoid what he saw as the ill effects of industrial cities. Mr. Hershey oversaw generous worker benefits like medical coverage and a retirement plan. He also acted as a kind of moral policeman, keeping a constant -- at times, oppressive -- eye on citizens' behavior. In 1937, members of the young Congress of Industrial Organization staged a sit-down strike at the company plant in protest of union recognition policies by management. The unrest ended four days later, when strikers were forcibly evicted.
The vision of an industrial utopia had been compromised. As Mr. Green writes, ''the town was becoming a more mature -- and more complicated -- place to live.'' Still, more than a century after its founding, the town has to a large extent remained a community built on chocolate -- and home to Hershey Foods. It also houses the Milton Hershey School for underprivileged children and Hersheypark, the huge amusement complex.
In its middle chapters, the book describes company towns that looked much more like ''exploitationvilles'' than cities on the hill. Many of these were coal-mining communities, like Lynch, Ky., built in the early 20th century by the U.S. Coal & Coke Company, a subsidiary of U.S. Steel. In coal town after coal town, the daily life of workers was ''unremittingly grim,'' plagued by dangerous working conditions, low wages, poor housing, filth, poverty and worker indebtedness to the company store, Mr. Green says.
Some companies in the oil, meatpacking and textile industries also built communities designed to minimize costs at the expense of workers, he writes. His accounts of these towns, and of management attempts to stamp out worker demands, are sobering. All too often, this is how market capitalism shakes out for employees and others with little power. But by laying out the history of such exploitation side by side with alternative models, Mr. Green lets us view the main tensions of American business.
When business needs unskilled workers from a labor market with enough supply, he argues, ''executives have cared less about progressive relations with communities and employees.'' By contrast, he says, managers have leaned toward utopian policies when labor has been scarce and profit margins high.
IN the final chapters, Mr. Green briefly examines modern-day company towns and corporate campuses like the Googleplex in Mountain View, Calif. Google provides its workers a host of services, including meals, massages and ''sleep pods.''
''All of this may sound idyllic,'' Mr. Green writes, ''until you realize that workers need never go home -- or stop working.''
For all its detail, the book leaves some questions unanswered. How, for example, do individual managers and workers experience life in these two very different kinds of environments? And what systemic factors, including attitudes outside these company towns, keep a given regime in place?
In spite of the book's shortcomings, Mr. Green has amassed a collection of important, well-told stories about the contradictions, inequities and possibilities of American capitalism.

HEADLINE: PLENTY OF WORK FOR THE LAME DUCK: And Other Urgent Business

 BODY:
Taxes are not the only heavy lifting for Congressional leaders in the lame duck session. Before they can go home for the holidays -- to celebrate or lick their wounds -- there is a lot more of the people's work left to do. 
If lawmakers do not extend federal unemployment benefits, two million workers will be dropped just in December. It is hard to imagine that Congress could deny help to out-of-work Americans. Except that is exactly what happened this summer when federal benefits lapsed for 51 days, cutting off 2.5 million people. Senate Republicans and a few Democrats insisted that reducing the deficit was more important. That did not stop many of the same senators from preserving tax loopholes for certain wealthy money managers.
Deficits matter, but not more than a recovery (benefits are a powerful stimulus) or the economic survival of millions of Americans. Short-term extensions breed uncertainty and anxiety, which are also bad for the economy. The best thing this lame duck Congress can do is extend the benefits for 12 months, with the expectation that things will be better by the end of next year.
The right choice is just as clear when it comes to fixing the Medicare payment formula. If lawmakers fail to act, payments to doctors for tests, procedures and office visits will drop by 23 percent on Dec. 1. Many doctors will decide they cannot afford to treat Medicare patients.
This is a long-standing problem that would be too costly (on budget projections) to fix permanently, so Congress has repeatedly approved temporary fixes. We don't like budgetary flimflam. In this case the alternative would be disastrous. Congress should delay the cuts through the end of 2011, and commit to work in the interim to find a permanent solution.
This could be the last chance, for several years, to end the military's ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy and allow gay and lesbian soldiers to serve their country openly.
The House has voted to repeal, pending a Pentagon review that will soon be released. The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, was reluctant to move during his bitter re-election fight. He now needs to push hard and rally a few Republican senators. Those who were on the fence should search their consciences and listen to top military leaders who say this discriminatory policy drives out talented, highly trained service members.
The Senate needs to ratify the New Start treaty, the first arms control agreement with Russia in a decade. It modestly reduces both sides' deployed weapons and will guarantee continued insight into Russia's arsenal. The Foreign Relations Committee approved New Start on a bipartisan vote. Republicans have been delaying final passage, and chances will be worse next year.
Failure to ratify would harm relations with Moscow, deprive the United States of vital information about Russia's actions, and undermine American credibility as it tries to contain Iran's nuclear ambitions.
We know Washington is already focused on the next Congress and the bloody fights to come. But Americans need this Congress to finish its work.

HEADLINE: He Saw Trouble Coming. Now He Sees It Going.

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
ARE we finally coming out of the woods, economically speaking?
Two data points from last week seemed to indicate an upswing ahead. October's employment figures rose more than economists had expected, and the stock market clawed its way back to levels last reached just before the calamitous events of fall 2008.
But positive indicators can and do disappoint, so I decided to consult an expert on these matters: Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. As a reader of economic tea leaves over the last five turbulent years, Mr. Shepherdson has a darn good record. For instance, unlike the throng of economists who failed to see the housing crisis coming, Mr. Shepherdson warned his clients in fall 2005 that real estate would crash and a recession would ensue. 
He was early, of course, and now acknowledges that he was not nearly emphatic enough in his warnings. But he was fundamentally right back then and has been consistently on target since. So, I am happy to report that he sees the beginnings of a turn in the economy that could translate to a rise in gross domestic product growth and an improving employment picture in the second half of 2011.
The basis for his view is a shift, albeit nascent, in commercial and industrial bank lending. The trend is real, he said, and as it gains steam, small businesses should receive more credit, for which they have been starved. And because these companies employ half of the nation's work force, this credit expansion will translate into real employment gains.
''The depression in small businesses explains pretty much everything in the weakness of this cycle,'' Mr. Shepherdson said. ''I reckon in the last cycle they accounted for two-thirds of all new job creation. Not only are they big, they are better job-creation engines than big companies, which are more inclined to do their new hiring offshore.''
HERE are the data that have caught his eye. At this time last year, the total stock of commercial and industrial bank credit was $1.32 trillion; it was contracting at a blistering pace -- about $7 billion a week. Indeed, between the peak of such lending in October 2008 and the trough in June of this year, total commercial and industrial bank credit fell by one-quarter.
Now, this contraction has stopped. The data have recently turned positive and should continue climbing, albeit slowly. ''Getting to zero is not bullish at the moment,'' Mr. Shepherdson said. ''I would want to see commercial and industrial credit growing reasonably strongly to an outright positive four, five or six billion dollars a week. The story is really that the credit contraction seems to be coming to an end.''
One problem for economists and investors, he said, is that our current economic cycle does not have the typical recession-recovery characteristics or timeline. Those who thought it would be similar to recent recessions were trying to fit a square peg into a round hole; there was nothing normal or routine about the events we have just lived through.
But Mr. Shepherdson says he does find parallels in our experience and that of Sweden in the early 1990s. The expansion of bank credit before the peak was similar in both countries. Furthermore, Sweden's boom, like ours, resulted in rocketing real estate prices and overleveraged consumers.
When the bubble burst, both countries experienced similarly awful contractions. Gross domestic product declined 5.1 percent in Sweden at the trough, compared with 4.1 percent in the United States.
Mr. Shepherdson hopes that the Swedish experience on the upside also repeats itself in the United States. After Sweden's output bottomed out in early 1993, the country began an upswing that soon became supercharged. The initial growth was at an annualized rate of 2.5 percent, but by the second year of the rebound, G.D.P. growth was 5.3 percent, annualized.
We may not end up with a recovery that hot, Mr. Shepherdson said. But if the credit expansion he is expecting does transpire, he said, we could achieve annualized growth of between 3 percent and 4 percent in the second half of 2011. And the year after that looks even more promising, he said, because ''credit conditions will be back to something like normal.''
He expects that in the meantime, we will bump along at around 2 percent in economic growth, with no double-dip recession.
As commercial and industrial credit eases up a bit, Mr. Shepherdson said, it will unleash a pent-up demand among smaller companies for capital equipment, software, vehicles and other goods.
''We have seen strong capital spending in the gross domestic product accounts, but that's all been big companies,'' he said. ''The next step is for small companies to pick up their buying and start hiring people.''
This lag in small-company spending is all about the tight credit conditions in that sector. The divergence between the amount of credit extended to big and small companies, he said, shows up in the distressingly wide gap between two closely watched sentiment surveys: the reports from the Institute for Supply Management, which reflects manufacturing activity of larger enterprises, and from the National Federation of Independent Business, representing smaller companies. While the I.S.M. figure is in recovery mode, the N.F.I.B. statistic remains squarely in recession territory.
Obviously, a growth in lending to small businesses is not yet being felt across the board, Mr. Shepherdson said. But as the credit expansion trickles down to these companies, the gap will start to close and employment will begin to ramp upward.
''My overwhelming condition for things to get better in the small-business sector is credit, so the positive data are a hugely exciting development,'' he said. ''I don't think we will see all these gaps close by December, but over the next 12 months I think we will see a transition out of a sluggish 2 percent economy to a real, properly growing recovery. And the second half of 2011 may be the true turning point for unemployment.''
THERE'S no denying that our long economic despond has hurt vast numbers of people nationwide. And Mr. Shepherdson cautions that good times aren't likely to roll immediately. ''I wish it would be one of those situations that fixes itself in three months, which would be a normal cyclical rebound,'' he said. ''But by August of next year there is a very good chance that we will be on a recovery path.''
Let's hope he is right again. And let the countdown begin.

PERSON: Jule Sugarman 

HEADLINE: Jule Sugarman, 83, Director And Architect of Head Start

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Jule Sugarman, a primary architect of Head Start, the federal support program for millions of poor preschoolers, died Tuesday at his home in Seattle. He was 83.
The cause was cancer, his wife, Candace Sullivan, said.
Mr. Sugarman, who also ran the program for most of its first five years, was executive secretary of the 13-member commission that planned Head Start in 1964 after President Lyndon B. Johnson declared his War on Poverty. Five-year-olds ''are inheritors of poverty's curse and not its creators,'' the president said in introducing Head Start.
''Unless we act,'' he added, ''these children will pass it on to the next generation like a family birthmark.'' 
In the planning phase, consultants suggested a demonstration project. But Sargent Shriver, the Office of Economic Opportunity director, argued for a full-scale effort. ''We want to write Head Start across this land so that no Congress or president will ever destroy it,'' Mr. Shriver said.
As a result, after only seven months of planning, more than half a million children were enrolled in an eight-week summer program budgeted at $96.4 million. In August 1965, Johnson announced that it would become a full-year program.
''Jule Sugarman was absolutely central in mounting the program and was an administrative genius,'' said Edward Zigler, a Yale psychology professor who was on the planning committee and succeeded Mr. Sugarman as Head Start director in 1970. ''The rest of us were scholars and experts on children; his bureaucratic brilliance is what the rest of us did not have.''
The original director, Julius Richmond, became ill during the first year, and Mr. Sugarman took charge. With a small staff and thousands of grant applications coming in, Dr. Zigler said, ''we were supposed to enroll 250,000 kids that first summer, and instead we put in 560,000.''
Under Mr. Sugarman, enrollment climbed to 733,000 in 1966 and for the next three years settled at slightly below 700,000.
''It's the execution that counts, and the execution that makes it enduring,'' Yasmina Vinci, executive director of the National Head Start Association, a nonprofit organization, said Friday. ''The proof that Jule did a great job is the fact that it has lasted for 45 years and 27 million children and families have had their lives transformed.''
With a budget of $8 billion, the program now serves more than 900,000 children a year.
Born in Cincinnati on Sept. 23, 1927, Jule M. Sugarman was the only child of Melville Sugarman, a jeweler, and the former Rachel Meyer, a nursery school teacher. He spent two years at Western Reserve University in Cleveland and another two years as an Army supply sergeant in Japan after World War II, and then finished college at American University in 1950 with a degree in public administration.
Mr. Sugarman began his federal service in 1951, working at the Civil Service Commission and, over the next 15 years, the Bureau of the Budget, the Bureau of Prisons and the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs.
After Head Start, he became New York City human resources administrator under Mayor John V. Lindsay and served under President Jimmy Carter.
Mr. Sugarman's first wife, Sheila Shanley Sugarman, died in 1983; their son Christopher died in 2002. Besides Ms. Sullivan, whom he married in 1989, he is survived by three children from his first marriage, a daughter, Maryanne Costa, and two sons, Jason and James; and eight grandchildren.
A lifelong question for him, Mr. Sugarman told The New York Post in 1979, ''is, Do we make any difference to people? Do more children learn things? Do more families stay together? Do more older people lead happier lives? Are more children taken off the streets and sent into productive employment?''
His wife said, ''He sure tried, never gave up.''

HEADLINE: A Climate Of Unease For Artists In Syria

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
Damascus, Syria
IN a leafy neighborhood of this city, where crumbling housing developments give way to gated embassies and idling BMWs, Janet Moore, a high-end travel agent from California, stopped one recent day into the cool, sleek quarters of the Ayyam Gallery on a scouting mission. She wanted to set up studio visits with ''the hottest young artists in town,'' she told Sharon Othman of the gallery. The plan was to organize a trip for a dozen or so contemporary art collectors, the sort, Ms. Moore said, who, on hearing that Syria is the Next Big Thing, would reach for their checkbooks and head straight for the airport, few questions asked.
''Syria is moving toward a very bright future,'' Ms. Othman said, happy to accommodate.
This is one face of Syria now, the one that lately has been making the pages of glossy lifestyle magazines and art-world tip sheets. But just before the travel agent arrived, Ms. Othman had been saying that the gallery couldn't publish some of its fancy catalogs here, because the nudes in them didn't pass muster with Syria's omnipresent censors. 
That's the other face of life here. A corrupt and oppressive regime still rules, and newfound economic prosperity for a well-connected class, while useful as propaganda, has only reinforced a deeper culture of political stagnation.
Stagnant social politics in this part of the world tend to preclude much of an artistic life. That's the classic historical paradigm. Around here commercial globalization and the Web, having promised to erode the power of authoritarian regimes and foster new cultural riches, mostly have just concentrated more wealth in the hands of those close to power. And, aside from a proliferation of the usual chain stores, boutique hotels and restaurants that are today's fashionable excuse for ''worldly'' culture, they have produced among Syrians only a climate of greater unease.
So say many Syrian artists and intellectuals, anyway. Syria's economic role models used to be East Germany and North Korea. Now the model is China, never mind that Syria has 23 million people, and is about the size of North Dakota. But economic opportunity for the elite clearly hasn't brought cultural liberalization to the many. If anything, Syrian artists, writers and intellectuals complain that liberties have been only further curtailed by a regime still trying to grasp the challenges of the Web. Every book, art catalog, film script and television program, big or small, still runs a gantlet of government censors. Fifty Syrians can't congregate in public without getting official consent. When Bashar al-Assad took over as president in 2000, he ushered in a brief period of openness that came to be called the Damascus Spring. But those gains are long gone, and now, despite the influx of first-run Hollywood movies and the token appearance by a pioneering Western dancer or musician for the odd arts festival, the situation has gotten worse.
Why? Perhaps it's partly a question of changed expectations. Under Mr. Assad's father, President Hafez al-Assad, there were clear red lines of intolerance. Now those lines are no longer clear, increasing, not diminishing, the sense of uneasiness and tendency toward self-censorship. Rosa Yassin Hassan, a novelist, put it this way one recent morning: ''Two people write about the same thing, and one is imprisoned today, the other not. That sends a message, I believe. It is done on purpose to increase fear and apprehension.''
Meanwhile the United States and Western Europe have been making quiet overtures toward Syria, hoping among other things to drive a wedge between it and Iran. Yet Syria has been pursuing its usual wily, paradoxical policies: cracking down on political Islamists at home, supporting movements like Hamas and Hezbollah abroad, accepting new organizations that support women, children and the environment but not human-rights groups that might speak out against the regime. Even as officials allow a few poetry readings, where a small number of Syrians occasionally let off some steam by poking fun at the establishment, they have also drafted a law that would now force bloggers and other journalists to submit all writings for review before publication.
So what culture arises from this climate? For starters, a culture of small-bore opportunism. A young generation of Syrian entrepreneurs, weaned on the Internet and devoted to the global marketplace, has arisen in the last decade or so. They see fresh chances to make big bucks and show little appetite for political confrontation. During the 1960s, and then under Hafez al-Assad in the '70s, Syria had its version of the youth movement. It survived partly because Syrian activist-artists steeped in Sartre shared with the country's rulers a dream of pan-Arab prosperity. But today young Syrians, many of them freely admit, dream not about making waves but making money.
The painter Youssef Abdelke, 59, belongs to an older generation. He moved back here a few years ago, after living 28 years in a kind of self-imposed exile in Paris. His subjects tend to be still lifes, benign seeming at first: fish, birds and other animals, ambiguously dead or alive. ''To be dead but to refuse to be dead,'' was how he described them when we met in his studio here one evening.
Protest had been part of his upbringing, he recalled. His father had been imprisoned many times during the '60s and '70s, he said, and Mr. Abdelke himself, as a young member of the Communist Labor Party, spent nearly two years in prison during the late '70s. Afterward he moved to France. But he returned in 2005, above all because he missed home and because he is, in the end, a Syrian artist.
''There's a false image of openness now,'' he contended with an openness that was striking but almost casual. ''The authorities are still controlling everything, and you can't even hire a cleaning woman without the security services' permission. Today the world media knows when a dissident is jailed, which wasn't the case when I was imprisoned. But this creates an impression that there's less of a problem, when actually things are just as bad or worse. The market contributes to the problem.''
Syrian artists, exposed to a global audience, ''now feel pressure'' to cater to nouveau riche Arabs, among others, he said, and they're less concerned about thorny issues of Syrian identity or Syrian politics.
Mouna Atassi, a veteran dealer whose gallery is one of the finest and most respected in Damascus, echoed that thought, lamenting how the Syrian art world ''used to be small but tightly knit.''
''Artists here traded paintings, collectors knew the artists socially,'' she said. ''They were all middle class. Ambition back then had nothing to do with money. It had to do with ideas.'' The last few years have witnessed ''tremendous new interest from collectors in the Gulf and in the West and the arrival of big money shaping what people here make and sell,'' Ms. Atassi continued. ''But it's all about money and the market now, about tourist consumption and a few rich Syrians.''
Chalk up those remarks by Mr. Abdelke and Ms. Atassi to nostalgia and romanticism. But Ousama Ghanam, a playwright in his 30s who teaches and directs theater here, although describing the situation differently, sounds hardly more optimistic. The problem for serious culture in Syria today, he said, is the lack of money, not the influx of it. He meant that most performing arts events here are still state sponsored. And while the government imposes few ''red lines,'' in terms of programming, Mr. Ghanam said, the regime naturally favors populist, uncontroversial fare. At the same Syria's private benefactors, such as they are, so far don't show much interest in, or just aren't familiar with experimental theater, dance and film, and they want to back events that make money.
So they're big on soap operas, perhaps the country's major artistic export. Mr. Ghanam teaches Robert Wilson, among other modern Western authors and dramatists, to his Syrian students, but he said they graduate only to find that the jobs available as actors, directors and playwrights are all on the soaps. ''This is the new reality,'' Mr. Ghanam said. ''So the soap operas and historical melodramas are creating taste.''
Of course that's not the whole story. Rosa Yassin Hassan, the young novelist who spoke about the climate of unease, was in a hotel restaurant the other morning, scanning the room for unfriendly faces before settling down to an interview. She noted with resignation a table of aged government officials nearby.
Ms. Hassan has become outspoken here. Syrian censors, she recounted, originally agreed to publish ''Ebony,'' her first novel, but then excised passages they deemed sexually offensive. When she objected, a public firestorm ensued. Ms. Hassan decided to publish abroad. Her next book chronicled the lives of former female political prisoners. The book after that landed her on the shortlist for an Arabic version of the Booker Prize but stirred more condemnation, and today Ms. Hassan isn't allowed travel outside the country.
''It's complicated,'' she said, about the situation, ''because nowadays, with the Internet and satellite TV and translations from and to Arabic, writers in Syria are not isolated from the world. It is not like it was 30 years ago. We can publish elsewhere. There can be a public fuss. But in a sense this only makes the situation feel worse for younger writers because we can dream.''
The Syrian reading public, she went on, ''has always been tiny, and intellectuals are isolated from the rest of society.'' At the same time a young literary scene has developed, she insisted, publishing abroad, like herself, if necessary, and writing about issues like ''social diversity, life among refugees and minorities, subjects that used to be unexplored.''
''It's more about individual expression now, which to me is in the best long-term interest of culture as culture,'' she said, adding that making art in Syria is ''like dropping a pebble in still water.''
That happened to be the metaphor Hatem Ali also used. At 48, Mr. Ali is one of Syria's most successful television and film directors. He has directed several of the country's widely distributed historical soap operas, and he recently shot a feature film, ''The Long Night,'' about political prisoners. We met in his office suite here one morning, beneath a photograph of Mr. Ali standing beside President Assad.
The soaps bought him, as he put it, ''immunity'' to make ''The Long Night.'' He was able to muster $250,000 in private money, a meager budget. The film was then tacitly banned by Syrian authorities, who never gave permission for it to be shown here. ''We got permission on paper from one committee to go ahead with the film, but then another government committee saw the film, and my own long night with the Syrian authorities started,'' he said, shaking his head.
So why did he make it?
''Young Syrian directors who grew up with the success of Syrian dramas see television as where the money and opportunities are now, and they produce shows that long for a backward world and that hide in religion and the historical past, no matter how bad the past was,'' he said.
I had seen what he meant just the previous night, wandering past a cafe where dozens of Syrians had gathered outdoors as usual to watch, on a big screen, ''Bab al-Hara,'' a hugely popular soap opera across the Arab world about life in Damascus at the turn of the last century. In it women gossip, men shoot guns and shout at one another. It's what passes for popular culture -- not worse than what passes for it in Rome or Red Hook, maybe, except that for Syrians the alternatives are few.
''It's our job to raise our voices, a little bit,'' Mr. Ali said, speaking about Syrian artists generally. ''Movies don't move people to revolution. But they're part of a discourse, pebbles in a still lake.''
''I am not desperate yet,'' he added. ''But I am less hopeful.''

HEADLINE: While Warning About Fat, U.S. Pushes Cheese Sales

BYLINE: By MICHAEL MOSS

 BODY:
Domino's Pizza was hurting early last year. Domestic sales had fallen, and a survey of big pizza chain customers left the company tied for the worst tasting pies.
Then help arrived from an organization called Dairy Management. It teamed up with Domino's to develop a new line of pizzas with 40 percent more cheese, and proceeded to devise and pay for a $12 million marketing campaign.
Consumers devoured the cheesier pizza, and sales soared by double digits. ''This partnership is clearly working,'' Brandon Solano, the Domino's vice president for brand innovation, said in a statement to The New York Times.
But as healthy as this pizza has been for Domino's, one slice contains as much as two-thirds of a day's maximum recommended amount of saturated fat, which has been linked to heart disease and is high in calories. 
And Dairy Management, which has made cheese its cause, is not a private business consultant. It is a marketing creation of the United States Department of Agriculture -- the same agency at the center of a federal anti-obesity drive that discourages over-consumption of some of the very foods Dairy Management is vigorously promoting.
Urged on by government warnings about saturated fat, Americans have been moving toward low-fat milk for decades, leaving a surplus of whole milk and milk fat. Yet the government, through Dairy Management, is engaged in an effort to find ways to get dairy back into Americans' diets, primarily through cheese.
Americans now eat an average of 33 pounds of cheese a year, nearly triple the 1970 rate. Cheese has become the largest source of saturated fat; an ounce of many cheeses contains as much saturated fat as a glass of whole milk.
When Michelle Obama implored restaurateurs in September to help fight obesity, she cited the proliferation of cheeseburgers and macaroni and cheese. ''I want to challenge every restaurant to offer healthy menu options,'' she told the National Restaurant Association's annual meeting.
But in a series of confidential agreements approved by agriculture secretaries in both the Bush and Obama administrations, Dairy Management has worked with restaurants to expand their menus with cheese-laden products.
Consider the Taco Bell steak quesadilla, with cheddar, pepper jack, mozzarella and a creamy sauce. ''The item used an average of eight times more cheese than other items on their menu,'' the Agriculture Department said in a report, extolling Dairy Management's work -- without mentioning that the quesadilla has more than three-quarters of the daily recommended level of saturated fat and sodium.
Dairy Management, whose annual budget approaches $140 million, is largely financed by a government-mandated fee on the dairy industry. But it also receives several million dollars a year from the Agriculture Department, which appoints some of its board members, approves its marketing campaigns and major contracts and periodically reports to Congress on its work.
The organization's activities, revealed through interviews and records, provide a stark example of inherent conflicts in the Agriculture Department's historical roles as both marketer of agriculture products and America's nutrition police.
In one instance, Dairy Management spent millions of dollars on research to support a national advertising campaign promoting the notion that people could lose weight by consuming more dairy products, records and interviews show. The campaign went on for four years, ending in 2007, even though other researchers -- one paid by Dairy Management itself -- found no such weight-loss benefits.
When the campaign was challenged as false, government lawyers defended it, saying the Agriculture Department ''reviewed, approved and continually oversaw'' the effort.
Dr. Walter C. Willett, chairman of the nutrition department at the Harvard School of Public Health and a former member of the federal government's nutrition advisory committee, said: ''The U.S.D.A. should not be involved in these programs that are promoting foods that we are consuming too much of already. A small amount of good-flavored cheese can be compatible with a healthy diet, but consumption in the U.S. is enormous and way beyond what is optimally healthy.''
The Agriculture Department declined to make top officials available for interviews for this article, and Dairy Management would not comment. In answering written questions, the department said that dairy promotion was intended to bolster farmers and rural economies, and that its oversight left Dairy Management's board with ''significant independence'' in deciding how best to support those interests.
The department acknowledged that cheese is high in saturated fat, but said that lower milk consumption had made cheese an important source of calcium.
''When eaten in moderation and with attention to portion size, cheese can fit into a low-fat, healthy diet,'' the department said.
In its reports to Congress, however, the Agriculture Department tallies Dairy Management's successes in millions of pounds of cheese served.
In 2007, the department highlighted Pizza Hut's Cheesy Bites pizza, Wendy's ''dual Double Melt sandwich concept,'' and Burger King's Cheesy Angus Bacon cheeseburger and TenderCrisp chicken sandwich. ''Both featured two slices of American cheese, a slice of pepper jack and a cheesy sauce,'' the department said.
These efforts, the department reported, helped generate a ''cheese sales growth of nearly 30 million pounds.''
Relentless Marketing
Every day, the nation's cows produce an average of about 60 million gallons of raw milk, yet less than a third goes toward making milk that people drink. And the majority of that milk has fat removed to make the low-fat or nonfat milk that Americans prefer. A vast amount of leftover whole milk and extracted milk fat results.
For years, the federal government bought the industry's excess cheese and butter, an outgrowth of a Depression-era commitment to use price supports and other tools to maintain the dairy industry as a vital national resource. This stockpile, packed away in cool caves in Missouri, grew to a value of more than $4 billion by 1983, when Washington switched gears.
The government started buying only what it needed for food assistance programs. It also began paying farmers to slaughter some dairy cows. But at the time, the industry was moving toward larger, more sophisticated operations that increased productivity through artificial insemination, hormones and lighting that kept cows more active.
In 1995, the government created Dairy Management Inc., a nonprofit corporation that has defined its mission as increasing dairy consumption by ''offering the products consumers want, where and when they want them.''
Dairy Management, through the ''Got Milk?'' campaign, has been successful at slowing the decline in milk consumption, particularly focusing on schoolchildren. It has also relentlessly marketed cheese and pushed back against the Agriculture Department's suggestion that people eat only low-fat or fat-free varieties.
In a July letter to the department's nutrition committee, Dairy Management wrote that efforts to make fat-free cheese have largely foundered because fat is what makes cheese appealing. ''Consumer acceptance of low-fat and fat-free cheeses has been limited,'' it said.
Agriculture Department data show that cheese is a major reason the average American diet contains too much saturated fat.
Research has found that the cardiovascular benefits in cutting saturated fat may depend on what replaces it. Refined starches and sugar might be just as bad or even worse, while switching to unsaturated fats has been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease.
The department's nutrition committee issued a new standard this summer calling for saturated fat not to exceed 7 percent of total calories, about 15.6 grams in a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet. Yet the average intake has remained about 11 percent to 12 percent of total calories for at least 15 years.
The department issued nutritional hints in a brochure titled ''Steps To A Healthier You!'' It instructs pizza lovers: ''Ask for whole wheat crust and half the cheese'' -- even as Dairy Management has worked with pizza chains like Domino's to increase cheese.
Dairy Management runs the largest of 18 Agriculture Department programs that market beef, pork, potatoes and other commodities. Their budgets are largely paid by levies imposed on farmers, but Dairy Management, which reported expenditures of $136 million last year, also received $5.3 million that year from the Agriculture Department to promote dairy sales overseas.
By comparison, the department's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, which promotes healthy diets, has a total budget of $6.5 million.
Although by law the secretary of agriculture approves Dairy Management's contracts and advertising campaigns, the organization has become a full-blown company with 162 employees skilled in product development and marketing. It also includes the National Dairy Council, a 95-year-old group that acts as its research and communications arm.
Dairy Management's longtime chief executive, Thomas P. Gallagher, received $633,475 in compensation in 2008, with first-class travel privileges, according to federal tax filings. Annual compensation for two other officials top $300,000 each.
Mr. Gallagher, who declined to be interviewed for this article, was described by board members, employees and food industry officials as an astute executive and effective champion of the sprawling dairy industry.
''He's a big thinker,'' said David Brandon, former chief executive of Domino's. ''A very creative guy who thinks big and is willing to make bets in helping to drive the business on behalf of his dairy farmers.''
Disputed Research
''Great news for dieters,'' Dairy Management said in an advertisement in People magazine in 2005. ''Clinical studies show that people on a reduced-calorie diet who consume three servings of milk, cheese or yogurt each day can lose significantly more weight and more body fat than those who just cut calories.''
With milk consumption in decline, Dairy Management had hit on a fresh marketing strategy with its weight-loss campaign.
When the campaign began in 2003, a Dairy Management official said it was inspired by newly relaxed federal rules on health claims and the ensuing ''rapid growth of 'better for you' products.''
It was based on research by Michael B. Zemel, a University of Tennessee nutritionist and author of ''The Calcium Key: The Revolutionary Diet Discovery That Will Help You Lose Weight Faster.'' Precisely how dairy facilitates weight loss is unclear, Dr. Zemel said in interviews and e-mails, but in part it involves counteracting a hormone that fosters fat deposits when the body is low on calcium.
Dairy Management licensed Dr. Zemel's research, promoted his book and enlisted a team of scientific advisers who ''identified further research to develop more aggressive claims in the future,'' according to a campaign strategy presentation.
One such study was conducted by Jean Harvey-Berino, chairwoman of the Department of Nutrition and Food Sciences at the University of Vermont. ''I think they felt they had a lot riding on it,'' she said of the weight loss claim, ''and felt it was a cash cow if it worked out.''
''I'm a big promoter of dairy,'' she added, noting that her research was also paid for by Dairy Management.
But by 2004, her study had found no evidence of weight loss. She said Dairy Management took the news poorly, threatening to audit her work. She said she was astonished when the organization pressed on with its ad campaign.
''I thought they were crazy, and that eventually somebody would catch up with them,'' she said.
Her study was published in 2005, and at scientific meetings she heard from other researchers who also failed to confirm Dr. Zemel's work, including Dr. Jack A. Yanovski, an obesity unit chief at the National Institutes of Health.
But in late 2006, Dairy Management was still citing the weight-loss claim in urging the Agriculture Department not to cut the amount of cheese in federal food assistance programs. ''The available data provide strong support for a beneficial effect of increased dairy foods on body weight and body composition,'' two organization officials wrote, making no mention of Dr. Harvey-Berino's findings.
Having dismissed the weight-loss claim in 2005, the federal nutrition advisory committee this summer again found the underlying science ''not convincing.''
The campaign lasted until 2007, when the Federal Trade Commission acted on a two-year-old petition by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, an advocacy group that challenged the campaign's claims. ''If you want to look at why people are fat today, it's pretty hard to identify a contributor more significant than this meteoric rise in cheese consumption,'' Dr. Neal D. Barnard, president of the physicians' group, said in an interview.
The trade commission notified the group that Agriculture Department and dairy officials had decided to halt the campaign pending additional research. Dr. Zemel said he remained hopeful that his findings would eventually be upheld.
Meanwhile, Dairy Management, which allotted $12.4 million for nutrition research in 2008, has moved on to finance studies on promising opportunities, including the promotion of chocolate milk as a sports recovery drink and the use of cheese to entice children into eating healthy foods like string beans.
An All-Out Campaign
On Oct. 13, Domino's announced the latest in its Legends line of cheesier pizza, which Dairy Management is promoting with the $12 million marketing effort.
Called the Wisconsin, the new pie has six cheeses on top and two more in the crust. ''This is one way that we can support dairy farms across the country: by selling a pizza featuring an abundance of their products,'' a Domino's spokesman said in a news release. ''We think that's a good thing.''
A laboratory test of the Wisconsin that was commissioned by The Times found that one-quarter of a medium thin-crust pie had 12 grams of saturated fat, more than three-quarters of the recommended daily maximum. It also has 430 calories, double the calories in pizza formulations that the chain bills as its ''lighter options.''
According to contract records released through the Freedom of Information Act, Dairy Management's role in helping to develop Domino's pizzas included generating and testing new pizza concepts.
When Dairy Management began working with companies like Domino's, it first had to convince them that cheese would make their products more desirable, records and interviews show. It provided banners and special lighting for the drive-up window menus at fast food restaurants, recalled Debra Olson Linday, who led Dairy Management's early efforts in promoting cheese to restaurant chains before leaving in 1997.
By 1999, food retailers and manufacturers were coming to Dairy Management for help.
''Let's sell more pizza and more cheese!'' said two officials with Pizza Hut, which began putting cheese inside its crust after holding development meetings with Dairy Management, according to a memorandum released by the Agriculture Department.
Derek Correia, a former Pizza Hut product innovations chief, said Dairy Management also helped find suppliers for the extra cheese. ''We were using four cheeses, if not six, and with a company like Pizza Hut, that is a lot of supply,'' he said in an interview.
And unlike with its advertising campaigns, Dairy Management and the Agriculture Department could point to specific results with these projects. The ''Summer of Cheese'' promotion it developed with Pizza Hut in 2002 generated the use of 102 million additional pounds of cheese, the department reported to Congress.
''More cheese on pizza equals more cheese sales,'' Mr. Gallagher, the Dairy Management chief executive, wrote in a guest column in a trade publication last year. ''In fact, if every pizza included one more ounce of cheese, we would sell an additional 250 million pounds of cheese annually.''
Working with some of the largest food companies, Dairy Management has also pushed to expand the use of cheese in processed foods and home cooking. The Agriculture Department has reported a 5 percent to 16 percent increase in sales of cheese snacks in stores where Dairy Management has helped grocers reinvent their dairy aisles. Now on display is an array of sliced, grated and cubed products, along with handy recipes for home cooking that use more cheese.
The strategy is focusing on families whose cheese ''habit'' outpaces their concern about the health risks, Dairy Management documents show. One study gave them a name: ''Cheese snacking fanatics.''

HEADLINE: When a Rig Moves In Next Door

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS and TOM ZELLER Jr.

 BODY:
IN the sparsely populated pastures of De Soto Parish in Louisiana, the ability to extract gas from shale -- which can involve a process known as fracking -- has been welcomed as an economic windfall. Some residents call it a gift from God.
But 1,400 miles to the north, in Susquehanna County in Pennsylvania, shale gas development has divided neighbors, spurred lawsuits and sown deep mistrust. Along Grove Avenue in Montrose, the county seat, a billboard looms overhead, advertising the services of a personal-injury law firm. ''HURT by DRILLING?'' it asks.
Natural gas currently satisfies nearly a quarter of the nation's power needs. And with vast methane reserves now available in previously inaccessible layers of shale deep underground, its position as a cornerstone of the domestic energy supply may well be secured for decades -- if the public supports it.
Support for drilling has proved fairly easy in many states, including Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas. But it has met with major resistance in the Northeast. In Pennsylvania, lawsuits over drinking water and other potential environmental issues are driving up production costs on what is known as the Marcellus Shale, and the governor recently ordered a moratorium on new drilling permits in state forests. 
Jerry Dugas, a veteran driller originally from Louisiana, is now a well superintendent for Cabot Oil and Gas in Pennsylvania. ''They have been drilling oil and gas wells in the South for the last 100 years,'' he says. ''Everyone there is accustomed to seeing all of this stuff and they understand what's going on, so it's nothing new. That's the environment I grew up in.''
''Once I came up here,'' he adds, ''it became real clear to me real quick that this is a whole other animal.''
The differences between De Soto and Susquehanna, both historically poor locales that are now rich fountains of natural gas, arise from a mixture of culture, geography and history. Understanding those differences may prove nearly as important as geology in determining how much gas will ultimately be produced -- and at what cost.
BILL WILLIAMSON, a retired telephone factory worker, relaxes in a rocking chair on the porch of his farmhouse in Stonewall, a town in north-central De Soto Parish. The town sits 10,000 to 13,000 feet above a rich underground gas deposit known as the Haynesville Shale.
A gas rig operated by Encana, the Canadian gas giant, was busy drilling just beyond Mr. Williamson's front yard.
''God made everything,'' he says, reflecting on the rig. ''He made the minerals in the ground and the trees on top of the ground, and he put them there for a purpose. It's in our best interest to use the resources.''
Mr. Williamson and his wife, Nancy, a retired nurse, live on 34 acres of mostly grazing land. An air horn blows loudly at the nearby gas rig. But the Williamsons, who, like most of their neighbors, earn tidy incomes from gas drillers' leasing their land, don't seem to notice.
Oil and gas booms -- and subsequent busts -- have been common in De Soto for much of the last 100 years, and the economy has struggled since cotton farming gave way to dairy farming, which then gave way to logging and paper mills.
By the 2000s, De Soto, with a population of about 28,000, was one of the poorest parishes in the state.
Then came the shale.
''People went to bed one night poor and woke up the next day rich, enabled to buy a Cadillac and pay cash,'' said Mayor Curtis McCoy of Mansfield, the parish seat. ''It's kind of like the show 'The Beverly Hillbillies.' ''
Farmers who once lived check to check are now extremely comfortable, if not downright wealthy. New cars, recreational vehicles and trailers are parked in nearly every driveway. Vinyl siding has been applied to weather-beaten cottages and clapboard houses.
Homeowners have typically earned signing bonuses of $350 to as much as $30,000 an acre from the gas companies, as well as royalties that can last for decades. Many earned additional hefty checks for giving right of way to piping companies.
And many more are digging ponds on their properties to supply the gas companies with the water they need to perform hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a process involving the high-pressure injection of water, sand and chemicals deep underground to break up shale formations and release their stores of gas.
The technique is credited with unlocking gas deposits that would otherwise not be accessible. It is also a source of environmental worries.
The Haynesville area has not been spared from drilling accidents, experiencing several over the last two years that might make residents howl in some other parts of the country.
Nearly 150 homes had to be evacuated in the neighboring Caddo Parish in April, when drillers of an Exco Resources well struck a shallow pocket of gas, causing a blowout. Exco says methane was already in the drinking water, and suggests that further study is needed to determine whether some gas came from the well.
A year earlier, 16 cattle were found dead near a Chesapeake Energy well site, apparently after they drank chemicals used by drillers that had flooded off a well pad during a storm. Since then, the company says it has changed its practices to contain similar spills if they occur.
The events received attention in national news media, but provoked little local worry.
''There was no reaction, really,'' said Charlie Waldon, the mayor of the tiny town of Stonewall. As vice president of the parish water board, Mr. Waldon worries that the gas industry will deplete the parish's precious groundwater supply, and he is frustrated that his constituents don't share his concern.
''It's going to take something major to wake them up,'' he says.
Many of his constituents, though, say their eyes are wide open. They point to local sales tax revenue, which has gone up so much since the shale gas boom began that the North De Soto Upper Elementary School has been able to buy 96 new computers as well as other equipment -- even as the state cut education funds amid the economic downturn. Salaries for first-year teachers in the parish have risen to $49,000 from $35,000.
As for possible environment effects, ''we're all concerned,'' said Brandon Burback, principal of the school, where a giant copy of an $18,000 check from Encana is displayed prominently in the lobby. He acknowledged the risk that a nearby well could blow out, causing a leak of natural gas.
But Mr. Burback said parents and faculty members felt better after Encana contracted a company to work out an evacuation plan in case of an emergency. ''We tend to fear what we don't know much about,'' he said, ''but they have made an effort to educate and reduce the amount of fear.''
MARLENE DEAN, 58, has lived her entire life on the same rural property on Route 92 in South Gibson, Pa., in the heart of Susquehanna County. For nearly all of that time, she and her family drew their drinking water from a well.
In 2008, that changed.
In the spring of that year, the Southwestern Energy Company, an oil and gas business based in Houston, began work on a shale gas well on a neighbor's property across the road.
Gas cash was flowing freely by then, as landowners signed contracts to lease their land. Some agreed to allow drilling directly on their property, with some deals reaching $5,000 an acre. Other landowners, including Mrs. Dean, cashed in by leasing their mineral rights, permitting gas companies to drill and frack horizontally under their properties.
Residents welcomed the influx of cash. Situated at the eastern edge of the Endless Mountains and bordering the Southern Tier of New York, Susquehanna County has traditionally ranked among Pennsylvania's poorest counties. Much of its population of 40,000 long relied on agriculture, blue stone quarrying and light manufacturing to make a living.
In May, an industry-financed study conducted by the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences at Pennsylvania State University estimated that gas companies had spent $4.5 billion developing the Marcellus in Pennsylvania, generating $389 million in state and local tax revenue and more than 44,000 jobs.
Mrs. Dean, for one, received $500 for the mineral rights under her one acre of land, and signed another deal to collect a 12.5 percent cut of royalties arising from the well across the road, whenever it started production.
Rowena Shager of South Gibson was another beneficiary. By 2007, she had negotiated a nearly $20,000 deal to lease her 57 acres. ''I was going through a divorce at the time, and I really needed the money,'' she said.
But by the fall of 2008, homes around the well began producing muddy water at the faucet, she said. Mrs. Shager, Mrs. Dean and a dozen other nearby residents contended, among other things, that Southwestern -- through sloppy operations -- somehow managed to pollute their water with drilling or fracking fluids.
''If I thought I was putting my family's life in jeopardy, or taking away from the value of my property, I never would have signed,'' Mrs. Shager says.
Southwestern has vehemently denied the allegations, arguing among other things that the primary chemical contaminants identified in the lawsuit -- barium, manganese and strontium -- were never used at the well site. The company pointed out in a recent press release that ''barium is one of the most common elements in the Earth's crust and occurs naturally in many water supplies.''
''The unfortunate thing I see from all this is that it really hurts those people that may actually have good lawsuits against companies that are actually doing things they shouldn't have done,'' says Mark K. Boling, a vice president and general counsel for Southwestern.
The suit, which is pending in federal court, taps into a culture of mistrust and fear percolating across the Marcellus Shale.
The Environmental Protection Agency is starting a study of how fracking might affect groundwater, and some environmental groups are lobbying hard for tighter federal regulation of the industry and the chemicals it uses.
The industry says that no conclusive evidence has been produced that fracking fluids can migrate thousands of feet back up from a well bore, through multiple layers of rock and into aquifers much closer to the surface.
Some environmentalists support fracking and other means of extracting natural gas because gas emits a fraction of the carbon of either oil or coal. They also prefer it because it could replace coal as the nation's principal source of electricity and provide a lower-carbon bridge before renewable energy sources can be developed on a larger scale.
But court battles and political bickering across Susquehanna County suggest that this has little truck with many residents.
FURTHER south, in Dimock Township, more than a dozen residents have joined a lawsuit against Cabot Oil and Gas, which is accused of causing methane to bleed into residents' water wells -- and in some cases, spew from the kitchen tap. The recent documentary ''Gasland'' featured some of these landowners -- many leasing to Cabot -- igniting fumes coming from their faucets..
John Hanger, Pennsylvania's environmental secretary, recently announced a $12 million plan to pipe municipal water from Montrose down to Dimock -- a solution, he said, to the community's water woes.
The plan calls for Cabot to foot the bill for the new 5.5-mile pipeline. The company has already been providing expensive water filtering systems to many residents despite what it says is a lack of any credible evidence that it caused contamination. The issue is so sensitive that Cabot has taken to using armed and uniformed escorts on some visits to residents in the area.
George Stark, a spokesman for the company brought on board in April to help deal with simmering discontent, said that much of the friction arose from the fact that oil and gas development was virtually unknown in Susquehanna before Cabot drilled its first well there in 2006.
Today, Cabot, Chesapeake and other companies have drilled nearly 200 wells in the county, with more permits pending.
The picture is further confused by less vocal homeowners here -- equally exposed to gas drilling -- who embrace the gas boom.
In the basement of the historic Inn at Montrose, a group of Dimock Township residents gathered on a recent evening to relate their opposition to the planned water pipeline -- and more generally to issue a defense of gas companies like Cabot. They planned, they said, to formally charter an organization called Enough Already.
Among the residents was Martha Locey, 78, who has lived on her family's farm since 1932.
''My father dug our well in 1945, and we knew it had lots of iron in it, and we thought it had something else, but we weren't sure, because it had lots of bubbles in it,'' Ms. Locey said. ''So my nephew took it to school in the '60s, and the science teacher lit it, and it burned, so he said, 'It's methane.' ''
''The truth is, our well has been that way since 1945,'' added Ms. Locey, who has signed an affidavit in support of the gas company's legal case. ''I don't think Cabot was here back then.''

HEADLINE: While Warning About Fat, U.S. Pushes Cheese Sales

BYLINE: By MICHAEL MOSS

 BODY:
Domino's Pizza was hurting early last year. Domestic sales had fallen, and a survey of big pizza chain customers left the company tied for the worst tasting pies.
Then help arrived from an organization called Dairy Management. It teamed up with Domino's to develop a new line of pizzas with 40 percent more cheese, and proceeded to devise and pay for a $12 million marketing campaign.
Consumers devoured the cheesier pizza, and sales soared by double digits. ''This partnership is clearly working,'' Brandon Solano, the Domino's vice president for brand innovation, said in a statement to The New York Times.
But as healthy as this pizza has been for Domino's, one slice contains as much as two-thirds of a day's maximum recommended amount of saturated fat, which has been linked to heart disease and is high in calories. 
And Dairy Management, which has made cheese its cause, is not a private business consultant. It is a marketing creation of the United States Department of Agriculture -- the same agency at the center of a federal anti-obesity drive that discourages over-consumption of some of the very foods Dairy Management is vigorously promoting.
Urged on by government warnings about saturated fat, Americans have been moving toward low-fat milk for decades, leaving a surplus of whole milk and milk fat. Yet the government, through Dairy Management, is engaged in an effort to find ways to get dairy back into Americans' diets, primarily through cheese.
Americans now eat an average of 33 pounds of cheese a year, nearly triple the 1970 rate. Cheese has become the largest source of saturated fat; an ounce of many cheeses contains as much saturated fat as a glass of whole milk.
When Michelle Obama implored restaurateurs in September to help fight obesity, she cited the proliferation of cheeseburgers and macaroni and cheese. ''I want to challenge every restaurant to offer healthy menu options,'' she told the National Restaurant Association's annual meeting.
But in a series of confidential agreements approved by agriculture secretaries in both the Bush and Obama administrations, Dairy Management has worked with restaurants to expand their menus with cheese-laden products.
Consider the Taco Bell steak quesadilla, with cheddar, pepper jack, mozzarella and a creamy sauce. ''The item used an average of eight times more cheese than other items on their menu,'' the Agriculture Department said in a report, extolling Dairy Management's work -- without mentioning that the quesadilla has more than three-quarters of the daily recommended level of saturated fat and sodium.
Dairy Management, whose annual budget approaches $140 million, is largely financed by a government-mandated fee on the dairy industry. But it also receives several million dollars a year from the Agriculture Department, which appoints some of its board members, approves its marketing campaigns and major contracts and periodically reports to Congress on its work.
The organization's activities, revealed through interviews and records, provide a stark example of inherent conflicts in the Agriculture Department's historical roles as both marketer of agriculture products and America's nutrition police.
In one instance, Dairy Management spent millions of dollars on research to support a national advertising campaign promoting the notion that people could lose weight by consuming more dairy products, records and interviews show. The campaign went on for four years, ending in 2007, even though other researchers -- one paid by Dairy Management itself -- found no such weight-loss benefits.
When the campaign was challenged as false, government lawyers defended it, saying the Agriculture Department ''reviewed, approved and continually oversaw'' the effort.
Dr. Walter C. Willett, chairman of the nutrition department at the Harvard School of Public Health and a former member of the federal government's nutrition advisory committee, said: ''The U.S.D.A. should not be involved in these programs that are promoting foods that we are consuming too much of already. A small amount of good-flavored cheese can be compatible with a healthy diet, but consumption in the U.S. is enormous and way beyond what is optimally healthy.''
The Agriculture Department declined to make top officials available for interviews for this article, and Dairy Management would not comment. In answering written questions, the department said that dairy promotion was intended to bolster farmers and rural economies, and that its oversight left Dairy Management's board with ''significant independence'' in deciding how best to support those interests.
The department acknowledged that cheese is high in saturated fat, but said that lower milk consumption had made cheese an important source of calcium.
''When eaten in moderation and with attention to portion size, cheese can fit into a low-fat, healthy diet,'' the department said.
In its reports to Congress, however, the Agriculture Department tallies Dairy Management's successes in millions of pounds of cheese served.
In 2007, the department highlighted Pizza Hut's Cheesy Bites pizza, Wendy's ''dual Double Melt sandwich concept,'' and Burger King's Cheesy Angus Bacon cheeseburger and TenderCrisp chicken sandwich. ''Both featured two slices of American cheese, a slice of pepper jack and a cheesy sauce,'' the department said.
These efforts, the department reported, helped generate a ''cheese sales growth of nearly 30 million pounds.''
Relentless Marketing
Every day, the nation's cows produce an average of about 60 million gallons of raw milk, yet less than a third goes toward making milk that people drink. And the majority of that milk has fat removed to make the low-fat or nonfat milk that Americans prefer. A vast amount of leftover whole milk and extracted milk fat results.
For years, the federal government bought the industry's excess cheese and butter, an outgrowth of a Depression-era commitment to use price supports and other tools to maintain the dairy industry as a vital national resource. This stockpile, packed away in cool caves in Missouri, grew to a value of more than $4 billion by 1983, when Washington switched gears.
The government started buying only what it needed for food assistance programs. It also began paying farmers to slaughter some dairy cows. But at the time, the industry was moving toward larger, more sophisticated operations that increased productivity through artificial insemination, hormones and lighting that kept cows more active.
In 1995, the government created Dairy Management Inc., a nonprofit corporation that has defined its mission as increasing dairy consumption by ''offering the products consumers want, where and when they want them.''
Dairy Management, through the ''Got Milk?'' campaign, has been successful at slowing the decline in milk consumption, particularly focusing on schoolchildren. It has also relentlessly marketed cheese and pushed back against the Agriculture Department's suggestion that people eat only low-fat or fat-free varieties.
In a July letter to the department's nutrition committee, Dairy Management wrote that efforts to make fat-free cheese have largely foundered because fat is what makes cheese appealing. ''Consumer acceptance of low-fat and fat-free cheeses has been limited,'' it said.
Agriculture Department data show that cheese is a major reason the average American diet contains too much saturated fat.
Research has found that the cardiovascular benefits in cutting saturated fat may depend on what replaces it. Refined starches and sugar might be just as bad or even worse, while switching to unsaturated fats has been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease.
The department's nutrition committee issued a new standard this summer calling for saturated fat not to exceed 7 percent of total calories, about 15.6 grams in a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet. Yet the average intake has remained about 11 percent to 12 percent of total calories for at least 15 years.
The department issued nutritional hints in a brochure titled ''Steps To A Healthier You!'' It instructs pizza lovers: ''Ask for whole wheat crust and half the cheese'' -- even as Dairy Management has worked with pizza chains like Domino's to increase cheese.
Dairy Management runs the largest of 18 Agriculture Department programs that market beef, pork, potatoes and other commodities. Their budgets are largely paid by levies imposed on farmers, but Dairy Management, which reported expenditures of $136 million last year, also received $5.3 million that year from the Agriculture Department to promote dairy sales overseas.
By comparison, the department's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, which promotes healthy diets, has a total budget of $6.5 million.
Although by law the secretary of agriculture approves Dairy Management's contracts and advertising campaigns, the organization has become a full-blown company with 162 employees skilled in product development and marketing. It also includes the National Dairy Council, a 95-year-old group that acts as its research and communications arm.
Dairy Management's longtime chief executive, Thomas P. Gallagher, received $633,475 in compensation in 2008, with first-class travel privileges, according to federal tax filings. Annual compensation for two other officials top $300,000 each.
Mr. Gallagher, who declined to be interviewed for this article, was described by board members, employees and food industry officials as an astute executive and effective champion of the sprawling dairy industry.
''He's a big thinker,'' said David Brandon, former chief executive of Domino's. ''A very creative guy who thinks big and is willing to make bets in helping to drive the business on behalf of his dairy farmers.''
Disputed Research
''Great news for dieters,'' Dairy Management said in an advertisement in People magazine in 2005. ''Clinical studies show that people on a reduced-calorie diet who consume three servings of milk, cheese or yogurt each day can lose significantly more weight and more body fat than those who just cut calories.''
With milk consumption in decline, Dairy Management had hit on a fresh marketing strategy with its weight-loss campaign.
When the campaign began in 2003, a Dairy Management official said it was inspired by newly relaxed federal rules on health claims and the ensuing ''rapid growth of 'better for you' products.''
It was based on research by Michael B. Zemel, a University of Tennessee nutritionist and author of ''The Calcium Key: The Revolutionary Diet Discovery That Will Help You Lose Weight Faster.'' Precisely how dairy facilitates weight loss is unclear, Dr. Zemel said in interviews and e-mails, but in part it involves counteracting a hormone that fosters fat deposits when the body is low on calcium.
Dairy Management licensed Dr. Zemel's research, promoted his book and enlisted a team of scientific advisers who ''identified further research to develop more aggressive claims in the future,'' according to a campaign strategy presentation.
One such study was conducted by Jean Harvey-Berino, chairwoman of the Department of Nutrition and Food Sciences at the University of Vermont. ''I think they felt they had a lot riding on it,'' she said of the weight loss claim, ''and felt it was a cash cow if it worked out.''
''I'm a big promoter of dairy,'' she added, noting that her research was also paid for by Dairy Management.
But by 2004, her study had found no evidence of weight loss. She said Dairy Management took the news poorly, threatening to audit her work. She said she was astonished when the organization pressed on with its ad campaign.
''I thought they were crazy, and that eventually somebody would catch up with them,'' she said.
Her study was published in 2005, and at scientific meetings she heard from other researchers who also failed to confirm Dr. Zemel's work, including Dr. Jack A. Yanovski, an obesity unit chief at the National Institutes of Health.
But in late 2006, Dairy Management was still citing the weight-loss claim in urging the Agriculture Department not to cut the amount of cheese in federal food assistance programs. ''The available data provide strong support for a beneficial effect of increased dairy foods on body weight and body composition,'' two organization officials wrote, making no mention of Dr. Harvey-Berino's findings.
Having dismissed the weight-loss claim in 2005, the federal nutrition advisory committee this summer again found the underlying science ''not convincing.''
The campaign lasted until 2007, when the Federal Trade Commission acted on a two-year-old petition by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, an advocacy group that challenged the campaign's claims. ''If you want to look at why people are fat today, it's pretty hard to identify a contributor more significant than this meteoric rise in cheese consumption,'' Dr. Neal D. Barnard, president of the physicians' group, said in an interview.
The trade commission notified the group that Agriculture Department and dairy officials had decided to halt the campaign pending additional research. Dr. Zemel said he remained hopeful that his findings would eventually be upheld.
Meanwhile, Dairy Management, which allotted $12.4 million for nutrition research in 2008, has moved on to finance studies on promising opportunities, including the promotion of chocolate milk as a sports recovery drink and the use of cheese to entice children into eating healthy foods like string beans.
An All-Out Campaign
On Oct. 13, Domino's announced the latest in its Legends line of cheesier pizza, which Dairy Management is promoting with the $12 million marketing effort.
Called the Wisconsin, the new pie has six cheeses on top and two more in the crust. ''This is one way that we can support dairy farms across the country: by selling a pizza featuring an abundance of their products,'' a Domino's spokesman said in a news release. ''We think that's a good thing.''
A laboratory test of the Wisconsin that was commissioned by The Times found that one-quarter of a medium thin-crust pie had 12 grams of saturated fat, more than three-quarters of the recommended daily maximum. It also has 430 calories, double the calories in pizza formulations that the chain bills as its ''lighter options.''
According to contract records released through the Freedom of Information Act, Dairy Management's role in helping to develop Domino's pizzas included generating and testing new pizza concepts.
When Dairy Management began working with companies like Domino's, it first had to convince them that cheese would make their products more desirable, records and interviews show. It provided banners and special lighting for the drive-up window menus at fast food restaurants, recalled Debra Olson Linday, who led Dairy Management's early efforts in promoting cheese to restaurant chains before leaving in 1997.
By 1999, food retailers and manufacturers were coming to Dairy Management for help.
''Let's sell more pizza and more cheese!'' said two officials with Pizza Hut, which began putting cheese inside its crust after holding development meetings with Dairy Management, according to a memorandum released by the Agriculture Department.
Derek Correia, a former Pizza Hut product innovations chief, said Dairy Management also helped find suppliers for the extra cheese. ''We were using four cheeses, if not six, and with a company like Pizza Hut, that is a lot of supply,'' he said in an interview.
And unlike with its advertising campaigns, Dairy Management and the Agriculture Department could point to specific results with these projects. The ''Summer of Cheese'' promotion it developed with Pizza Hut in 2002 generated the use of 102 million additional pounds of cheese, the department reported to Congress.
''More cheese on pizza equals more cheese sales,'' Mr. Gallagher, the Dairy Management chief executive, wrote in a guest column in a trade publication last year. ''In fact, if every pizza included one more ounce of cheese, we would sell an additional 250 million pounds of cheese annually.''
Working with some of the largest food companies, Dairy Management has also pushed to expand the use of cheese in processed foods and home cooking. The Agriculture Department has reported a 5 percent to 16 percent increase in sales of cheese snacks in stores where Dairy Management has helped grocers reinvent their dairy aisles. Now on display is an array of sliced, grated and cubed products, along with handy recipes for home cooking that use more cheese.
The strategy is focusing on families whose cheese ''habit'' outpaces their concern about the health risks, Dairy Management documents show. One study gave them a name: ''Cheese snacking fanatics.''

HEADLINE: Fantasy Politics

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CALDWELL. 
Christopher Caldwell is a contributing writer for the magazine and the author of ''Reflections on the Revolution in Europe: Immigration, Islam and the West.''

 BODY:
Throughout his recent run for Senate, the Florida Republican Marco Rubio made a big deal of the sacrifices his Cuban immigrant family made ''so that I could live the American dream.'' By campaign's end, he was using the phrase so regularly that spokesmen for his Democratic opponent, Congressman Kendrick B. Meek, were reminding reporters that Rubio did not have a patent on it. The American dream mattered a lot in this election. Americans for Prosperity, a conservative activist group, laid out plans for repealing President Obama's health care reform and fighting environmental regulation at its Defending the American Dream Summit two months ago. The president, meanwhile, closed this fall's campaign with an exhortation to ''restore the American dream for not just some, but for every, every, everybody in this great land.'' If both sides agree that the dream is imperiled, and that recovering it is a top national priority, then it may be this ''dream''of ours is not a unifying idea but a vague slogan, no more to be trusted than any other piece of campaign rhetoric. 
When the popular historian James Truslow Adams coined the phrase ''the American dream'' in ''The Epic of America'' (1931), it was as a kind of lazy-minded leitmotif. Sometimes it meant the frontier spirit, sometimes Jeffersonian democracy and sometimes just the hope that Americans could ''grow to fullest development as men and women, unhampered by the barriers which had slowly been erected in older civilizations.'' As a chronicler of common people, Adams had a peculiarity: he was a snob. He was dazzled by the material and cultural riches of aristocratic societies and bemoaned their lack in America. The American dream, he implied, is what we got as a consolation prize. It could find its expression in plebeian anti-intellectualism and an unjustified sense of entitlement. It was never, Adams admitted, ''a logical concept of thought.''
But it was a concept of such power that Americans have imposed their own logic on it ever since. Franklin Roosevelt, a decade after Adams's book, enunciated his Four Freedoms -- freedom of speech and worship, freedom from want and fear -- which Norman Rockwell turned into a series of paintings that embodied the idea. There were skeptics and debunkers, too. In Edward Albee's play ''The American Dream'' (1960), parents mutilate and kill their adopted son. Norman Mailer's novel ''An American Dream'' (1965) is about a guy who murders his wife.
A lot of elements make up the American dream -- pride, equality, autonomy, upward mobility, a just reward for effort and so on. As American culture got more pluralistic in the last half century, the American dream developed minority strands. Anyone who started a commune in Vermont was living a version of it, however dissident or ironic. But during the great de-ironization that began around the time of Ronald Reagan's election, one element of the American dream came to predominate: homeownership.
If the American dream has appeared endangered since the housing bubble brought the financial system to the brink of ruin, that is with good reason. The American dream is the ideology of the housing bubble. Karl E. Case, co-creator of the Case-Shiller home-price index, wrote recently of the rude awakening faced by those who ''think the American dream is owning property that appreciates by 30 percent a year.'' Some of the most destructive government programs traveled under that banner: in 2003, President Bush launched an American Dream Downpayment Initiative to provide federally subsidized booster payments for ''deserving families who have bad credit histories.'' His housing secretary, Mel Martinez, promoted minority homeownership by outfitting a bus called the American Dream Express.
Many Americans who got caught up in the housing bubble grew entitled and complacent, as Adams warned they might, and overborrowed. But a feckless government also deserves the blame for pushing more credit on citizens than they could withstand -- perhaps to counterbalance the rise of income inequality to dangerous levels. So argues the Chicago finance professor Raghuram G. Rajan in his convincing recent book, ''Fault Lines.'' You can draw a variety of political conclusions from the mess we're in: either the public hasn't been worthy of the American dream, or the government has been peddling a counterfeit of it.
Perhaps because they were making so much money out of it, Americans were slow to notice something peculiar about the American dream, and potentially divisive. The ideal of living ''unhampered,'' as Adams put it, by the barriers to social mobility erected in other countries is meaningful most of all to those familiar with other countries. The American dream is more evident to elites (including well-traveled historians like Adams) and to immigrants than it is to others. It is cosmopolitanism masquerading as American exceptionalism. When the billionaire Peter Peterson announced this year that he would join an initiative launched by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett and use at least half his wealth for philanthropy, he referred to himself as ''the son of poor Greek immigrants who has certainly lived the American dream.'' Paradoxically, it is Peterson's Greekness rather than his Americanness that gives him the bona fides to pronounce on the subject.
Optimism in the face of hardship is, of course, one of the glories of America's immigrant history. A 75-minute bus commute to a job at Wal-Mart, which looks like wage-slavery to the son of a unionized industrial worker, might be a dream come true for an immigrant from a poor country, or even for that immigrant's son. So it should not surprise us that polling results released by Xavier University last winter showed new immigrants to be among the biggest believers in the American dream. But it ought to worry us more than it does that middle-aged Midwestern white women, according to Xavier, are among the most skeptical about it. Confronted with the economy we are now living through, such people are unlikely to be comforted by assurances that their circumstances beat those of mid-20th-century Greece.
Most of the time we do not realize that what we are dreaming is the American dream, any more than we realize that what we are speaking is prose. World travelers, politicians and self-made men are not wrong to see the promise of American life as a stirring and romantic tale. To the median, native-born American with no other frame of reference but his life's span in this country, however, it is not a dream. It is simply the social contract. We are increasingly discovering that there are rational, nononeiric ways to measure when that contract is being broken.

HEADLINE: In Presidio, a Grasp at the Holy Grail of Energy Storage

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH. 
kgalbraith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Dozens of gray compartments, lined neatly in rows, inhabit a boxy concrete building on the edge of the impoverished border town of Presidio. The only sound, aside from occasional clanking, is the whirring of air-conditioners to keep the compartments cool.
This $25 million contraption is the largest battery system in the United States -- locals have dubbed it Bob, for Big Ole Battery. It began operating earlier this year, and is the latest mark of the state's interest in a nascent but rapidly evolving industry: the storage of electricity.
Storage is often referred to as the holy grail of energy technology, because it can modernize the grid by more efficiently matching demand for power with the generation of electricity. A variety of early-stage technologies are being studied in Texas, ranging from the Presidio battery (which can power the town of about 4,000 people for up to eight hours in the event of a power failure) to superconducting magnets to caverns that would store and release air compressed by electricity. 
The state is especially keen on storage because of the proliferation of wind turbines in West Texas. The machines generate the most power at night, when people are sleeping -- so if their power could be stored for use during the day, the usefulness of wind power, which currently accounts for about 6 percent of the state's electricity generation, would significantly increase.
''Storage has been an elusive goal of our industry for a long time,'' said Barry Smitherman, the chairman of the Public Utility Commission, which regulates the operations of the state's electric grid. ''I think there's a lot of great R&D being done in this area.''
The Presidio project does not back up the wind power, although future versions of the battery system could be used for such purposes. Instead, the four-megawatt sodium-sulfur battery is supposed to help provide a steadier electricity supply for the town, which sits at the end of a 60-mile transmission line built in 1948. The line -- still with many of the original wooden poles -- is often struck by lightening, causing power failures. A transmission line company, Electric Transmission Texas, plans to replace the line by 2012, but it installed the battery to keep the lights on in the meantime, as well as after the new line is built.
The concept of electricity storage has been around a long time. Decades ago, rural off-grid ranchers could buy batteries to back up their small wind turbines, but they stored only enough electricity to at least partially power a single home -- far less than the Presidio battery.
Additional battery projects, and potential projects, are sprinkled around Texas. Earlier this year, AES Energy Storage, a power company, began operating a one-megawatt battery near its petroleum coke-fired power plant in the Houston area. The company's goal is to test how the technology will work with the grid system.
Duke Energy, a utility based in North Carolina, expects final word around year's end on whether it will receive the bulk of a $22 million federal grant to build batteries near a wind farm in Ector and Winkler Counties.
Another project, a multiyear study of a zinc-flow battery concept by the San Antonio utility CPS Energy, was canceled last year after the manufacturer of the not-yet-commercial technology ''had some challenges,'' said Lisa Lewis, a CPS Energy spokeswoman.
Other types of energy-storage experiments are also under way around the state. In August, a consortium including the University of Houston was awarded a $4.2 million grant from the Department of Energy to develop an energy storage system from superconducting magnets.
The wind-power arm of Shell and the power-generation company Luminant have been looking into the concept of ''compressed air storage'' to back up power from a wind farm in the Panhandle. Excess power, like wind power generated at night, would compress air and pump it into a salt cavern or other suitable underground formation; the air could later be burned with natural gas and expand, generating electricity. So far, this technology has been put to work mainly in Alabama and Germany, but Allan Koenig, a Luminant spokesman, said the project was ''moving,'' although still in the development stage.
The main trouble with storage is that it is expensive. The Presidio battery and accompanying substation cost $25 million to build, which amounts to about $6,000 for every resident of Presidio. Put another way, that is about $1 for every Texan.
Steven Stengel, a spokesman for NextEra Energy Resources, a major renewable energy developer, said that, generally speaking, the economics of battery storage -- without significant grants or state or federal aid -- were difficult to make work for his company. NextEra is not currently planning investments in any storage projects, Mr. Stengel said.
The plunge in natural gas prices over the past few years has also hurt storage economics.
Calvin Crowder, the president of Electric Transmission Texas, likens the enormous Presidio battery, which occupies an area the size of a big house, to the first digital computer built in Iowa in the 1930s. Subsequent computer technologies, Mr. Crowder said, became ''cheaper and more compact'' -- and the same should happen with batteries. The Presidio battery, which was made in Japan, required two dozen semitrailers to transport it to Texas from the port of Long Beach, Calif.
Who should pay for storage projects, and the associated matter of how they should be classified within the electric grid system, are important and complex policy questions that the state must soon grapple with. In July, the state's grid operator, Electric Reliability Council of Texas, convened the first meeting of a power storage working group; it will hold its fourth meeting on Nov. 8.
In the case of the Presidio battery, the Public Utility Commission in effect classified the battery as a form of transmission rather than power generation, meaning the cost will be shouldered by all rate-payers on the Texas grid.
Right now, Mr. Smitherman said, the commission is looking at each project case by case. He cautioned against reading too much into the Presidio decision. But storage, he said, is ''probably a longer-term policy issue that we need to tee up for discussion and resolution.''
Robert J. King, the president of Good Company Associates, an energy-efficiency and renewables consulting firm in Austin, which has convened the Texas Energy Storage Alliance, said uncertainty over how storage would be classified -- and related questions about whether the range of benefits it provided could be captured -- was making companies less likely to invest.
Another technology that holds some hope for storage is electric cars. Texas will see the arrival of hundreds or thousands of such vehicles in the next few months. They are expected to charge primarily at night, taking advantage of the night-time windiness. In theory, the electricity the cars have taken in could be sent back out to the grid in times of high need, like late-summer afternoons.
''An electric vehicle,'' Mr. Smitherman said, ''is basically a battery with wheels.''

HEADLINE: Application Inflation

BYLINE: By ERIC HOOVER

 BODY:
This article is the first of a collaboration between The New York Times and The Chronicle of Higher Education, a daily news source for professors and administrators. Eric Hoover is a senior writer for The Chronicle covering admissions.
THE numbers keep rising, the superlatives keep glowing. Each year, selective colleges promote their application totals, along with the virtues of their applicants.
For this fall's freshman class, the statistics reached remarkable levels. Stanford received a record 32,022 applications from students it called ''simply amazing,'' and accepted 7 percent of them. Brown saw an unprecedented 30,135 applicants, who left the admissions staff ''deeply impressed and at times awed.'' Nine percent were admitted.
The biggest boast came from the University of California, Los Angeles. In a news release, U.C.L.A. said its accepted students had ''demonstrated excellence in all aspects of their lives.'' Citing its record 57,670 applications, the university proclaimed itself ''the most popular campus in the nation.'' 
Such announcements tell a story in which colleges get better -- and students get more amazing -- every year. In reality, the narrative is far more complex, and the implications far less sunny for students as well as colleges caught up in the cruel cycle of selectivity.
To some degree, the increases are inevitable: the college-bound population has grown, and so, too, has the number of applications students file, thanks in part to online technology. But wherever it is raining applications, colleges have helped seed the clouds -- by recruiting widely and aggressively for ever more applicants.
Admissions officers are chasing not so much a more perfect student as a more perfect class. In a given year, this elusive ideal might require more violinists, goalies, aspiring engineers or students who can pay the full cost of attendance. Colleges everywhere want more minority students, more out-of-state students and more students from overseas. The pursuit reveals the duality of the modern college. It's a place that serves the public interest, and a business with a bottom line.
Although the tension between mission and marketing has long defined admissions, many believe the balance has tilted too far toward the latter. Many colleges have made applying as simple as updating a Facebook page. Some deans and guidance counselors complain that it's too easy. They question the ethics of intense recruitment by colleges that reject the overwhelming majority of applicants.
''It's like needing a new stereo and buying the whole Radio Shack,'' says Mark Speyer, director of college counseling at the Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School in New York. ''With these bigger pools, colleges are getting a lot of students who have no chance.''
Fred Hargadon, former dean of admissions at Princeton and Stanford, doubts that more and more applicants make for a stronger class. ''I couldn't pick a better class out of 30,000 applicants than out of 15,000,'' he says. ''I'd just end up rejecting multiples of the same kid.''
The tide shows no signs of ebbing. This year, the University of Chicago, Duke and Tulane -- the last juggling 43,816 submissions -- surpassed their previous application records by double-digit percentages. Applications are, of course, a proxy for popularity and metric of merit. Such is the allure of exclusivity, and the appeal of simplicity. Measuring quality is difficult; measuring quantity is as easy as counting. The more apps a college receives, and rejects, the more impressive it seems.
Today's application inflation is a cause and symptom of the uncertainty in admissions. As application totals soar, colleges struggle to predict yield -- the number of admitted students who actually attend -- leading to longer wait lists and other competitive enrollment tactics. Students hedge against the plummeting admissions rates by flooding the system with even more applications.
Sarah Markhovsky sees the uncertainty in the students she counsels at Severn School, in Maryland. ''They'll say, 'Oh, my gosh, I should apply to a million schools -- if I shoot lots of arrows, maybe I'll hit something,' '' she says. ''This translates into hype that's not useful. It feels like the kids are commodities.''
That's how Shaun Stewart felt when he started receiving brochures from colleges. ''They want you so they can reject you,'' says Mr. Stewart, a senior in Burnsville, Minn., who has a 3.5 grade-point average and scored a 27 (out of 36) on the ACT. Those numbers are well below the freshman averages at some of the big-name colleges that sent him applications along with brochures.
''Colleges are there to educate you, but they make it all about who's the best college,'' he says. ''They make it too stressful. Then we make it too stressful on ourselves.'' He is considering liberal arts colleges like Carleton and Gustavus Adolphus, which he says have shown a more personal touch.
The scale of rejection worries Karl M. Furstenberg, dean of admissions and financial aid at Dartmouth from 1992 to 2007. ''When people keep hearing that they're not good enough, this has an undermining psychological effect,'' he says. Over the last 15 years, he says, growing applicant pools reflected an earnest push for greater diversity among the wealthiest institutions. Yet he believes many have reached a point of diminishing returns.
''It's a classic arms race -- escalation for not a whole lot of gain,'' he says. ''I don't think these larger applicant pools are materially improving the quality of their classes. Now what's driving it is the institutional self-interest factor, where bigger pools mean you're more popular, you're better.''
NEVER has the University of Chicago been more popular. It received a record 19,347 applications for this fall -- a 43 percent increase over last year -- for a freshman class of about 1,400 students. Those numbers would have been noteworthy anywhere, but here they were startling. Chicago had been a holdout, attracting fewer applicants than other intellectual powerhouses. What changed -- and why -- reveals the dynamics of admissions in the 21st century.
The University of Chicago was founded in the South Side's Hyde Park neighborhood in 1890, but its Gothic buildings look centuries older. Its ''Common Core'' curriculum steeps undergraduates in the liberal arts. Many deep thinkers -- Saul Bellow, Milton Friedman, Carl Sagan -- have come here to ponder big questions. Even the wide-eyed gargoyles here seem struck by inspiration.
For years, Chicago's admissions office emphasized the university's distinctiveness: one offbeat mailing was a postcard ringed with a coffee stain. Its application has long included imaginative essay prompts, like ''If you could balance on a tightrope, over what landscape would you walk? (No net).'' This became known as the ''Uncommon Application,'' in contrast to the Common Application, the standardized form that allows students to apply to any of hundreds of participating colleges.
That some students wouldn't like Chicago's quirky questions was the point. ''If understood properly, no given college will appeal to everyone -- that wouldn't be possible,'' says Theodore A. O'Neill, the university's dean of college admissions from 1989 to 2009. ''It's important to signal something true and meaningful about yourself. The more signals, the more honest you're being, and doing that does limit the applications.''
Mr. O'Neill was not opposed to attracting more applicants. Over time, the admissions staff had expanded outreach and increased diversity.
Yet some of Chicago's leaders concluded that the admissions office had trapped the university in a niche. It had long been dogged by a stereotype as a place for nerds and social misfits who shun sunlight and conversation. T-shirts created by students lovingly mock the university (the most famous is ''Where Fun Comes to Die''). In recent years, the university has built new residential complexes, and expanded its study-abroad programs, career-counseling services and recreational offerings.
''It's not that we weren't getting students of quality that we wanted, because we were -- they were terrific,'' says John W. Boyer, dean of the college since 1992. ''But we still had the feeling that, as much progress as we were making, there were still a lot of people out there who had these older images of the place. We were not using our admissions office to the maximum degree to say what the college was to the American people.''
Conventional wisdom holds that colleges seek more applicants to improve their rankings, but this is a narrow view of the issue. In fact, a college's admissions rate accounts for just 1.5 percent of its score in U.S. News & World Report's ratings. Still, rising selectivity can please alumni, aid fund-raising and help attract top professors.
Bond rating agencies also study application totals. Roger Goodman, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody's Investment Services, says applications are one measure of demand, an indicator of market position and financial health, which affect the cost of borrowing. ''If an institution is not growing and improving selectivity, that would probably be more of a concern than it would have been a decade ago,'' Mr. Goodman says. ''Even at a place that's highly selective, there can be very good reasons to expand its applicant base, as long it's coming from wanting to attract a diverse class.''
In 2006, under a new president, Robert J. Zimmer, Chicago announced that it would join the Common Application, which many admissions deans say attracts more applicants, especially low-income and minority students. Although the university vowed to retain its essays in a required supplement, the demise of the ''Uncommon Application'' sparked a student protest.
Mr. Zimmer, who attended Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan, told officials he wanted more applicants, especially top students from the New York area. The university commissioned market research to meet that goal.
Last year, Mr. O'Neill, one of the profession's most respected members, stepped down (he's now a lecturer at the university). In his place, Chicago hired James G. Nondorf as vice president and dean of college admissions and financial aid.
Colleagues describe Mr. Nondorf as a ''super-marketer,'' a man who gets results. At Yale, he helped diversify the applicant pool and pioneered the university's use of a ''likely letter,'' sent to top applicants before official acceptances. In three years as the top enrollment official at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, he oversaw a doubling of applications, which brought record numbers of women.
At Chicago, Mr. Nondorf's first priority was to create a recruitment booklet that contained many photographs of students engaged in group activities, including music, dance, tennis and football. Later, Chicago sent tailored letters to students who had expressed an interest in the arts or in medicine. Admissions officers talked up pre-professional opportunities and career preparation. Visiting families received special rates from the Hilton, where a letter from Mr. Nondorf and a pouch of chocolates awaited them. Over the last year, Chicago's admissions representatives visited about twice as many high schools as they had the previous year. Mr. Nondorf sent three to California instead of one, and for the first time, the university received more applications from the Golden State than from Illinois.
Chicago officials have cited many reasons for this year's application explosion, including the popularity of President Obama, who taught at the university. But some credit should go to Royall & Company, a direct-marketing firm hired last spring to help conduct an expansive recruitment campaign. This included a series of short e-mails sent in rapid succession; some students received nearly 20 in all. This year, Royall's clients averaged a 7 percent increase in applicants.
To each applicant, Chicago assigns a ''fit'' rating based on holistic measures -- say, intellectual curiosity or evidence that a student applied a favorite subject to life. This year it admitted more top students with high ratings than in the past, according to Mr. Nondorf. ''The number of applications reflects something, but they're not necessarily what we're after,'' he says. ''Crafting a better educational experience through a better class is the goal.''
Still, at an admissions conference in Rhode Island this May, Mr. Nondorf described the pressure on deans. ''Don't kid yourselves, the presidents and trustees want you to have more applications,'' he said. ''If you don't think that's the case, I don't know what schools you're working at, but it's true.''
Mr. Boyer has compared Chicago's application total with that of Columbia University, which also has a strong liberal arts curriculum. ''I believe we are a better university than they are, so I think we should have more applications than they do,'' he told the student newspaper last winter. The remark was a ''friendly, competitive gesture,'' Mr. Boyer says today. ''I don't think Chicago should stand behind New York on this one. We deserve the same number of applications, if not more.''
Such talk worries Andre Phillips, who left Chicago last year after two decades as associate director of admissions. ''By changing the admissions culture, Chicago has gone in for the quick fix,'' he says. ''My concern is that the institution is marketing itself as something it isn't.''
COLLEGES operate in a realm of perceptions influenced by numbers, yet admissions rates can be a statistical mirage.
As Caroline M. Hoxby noted in a 2009 paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, admissions rates fall even when students apply who don't have a shot. Moreover, while increasing selectivity suggests better students than in years past, in truth the most competitive applicants couldn't get more amazing if they levitated. The number of such all-stars isn't multiplying, either. Instead, they are jumping into more applicant pools, which Ms. Hoxby, a Stanford economist, describes as the nationwide ''re-sorting'' of students as more attend college far from home.
So it behooves colleges to cast wide nets. Most colleges start by buying the names of students whose standardized test scores and grade-point averages fall within a particular range. In the early 1990s, the College Board sold 35 million names a year; now it sells 80 million to about 1,200 colleges, at 32 cents a name. More colleges are buying names of sophomores to jump-start interest.
Over time, the nature of the application has changed. Dozens of colleges send ''fast-track'' applications, with some information already filled in -- and no fee. Tulane mails its ''V.I.P. Application'' to 130,000 students annually. In an e-mail to the campus this year, its president, Scott S. Cowen, described Tulane's nearly 44,000 applications as ''the largest of all private universities in the country.''
Earl Retif, Tulane's vice president for enrollment management, credits aggressive recruitment and a new community-service emphasis for helping the university attract more applicants after Hurricane Katrina.
''We don't need 44,000 applications -- it just means more people to choose from,'' Mr. Retif says. ''Some people see it as a sign of our popularity. I keep saying it's a double-edged sword.'' For one, most of the winning applicants did not come. Only about 16 percent of the 10,000 students Tulane admitted ended up enrolling. And the volume of applications has taxed the admissions office, which processed a million pieces of paper this year. Counselors must review 1,200 to 1,500 applications per cycle, compared with 700 to 800 a few years ago.
And it's hard telling so many students no, Mr. Retif says. ''Some people say, 'Hey, you invited me.' ''
This year, Duke faced similar challenges, with more than 26,000 applications and an evaluation process meant to handle half that. Christoph Guttentag, dean of undergraduate admissions, says the deluge left his staff with too little time to trim its wait list of nearly 3,400 students, roughly twice the size of its freshman class.
Mr. Guttentag believes that application increases heighten anxiety for everyone involved, but he doesn't anticipate much change. ''The pressure for more applications isn't offset by an equal pressure for less,'' he says, ''and no college wants to consciously put itself in a weaker competitive position.''
Some deans say they have all the applicants they need. Among them is Charles A. Deacon, dean of undergraduate admissions at Georgetown University, which reviewed 18,000 applications this year. Sitting behind a long wooden table, with admissions reports fanned out in front of him, Mr. Deacon explains why he refuses to adopt the Common Application. The ease of the form, he says, would bring Georgetown thousands more applicants. Yet he fears that adding the application would weaken Georgetown's admissions process, in which nearly all applicants are interviewed. ''We believe this is a personal relationship between a student and a college,'' Mr. Deacon says. ''With our own application, we know people are applying who want to apply.''
Georgetown buys names of students with PSAT scores equivalent to 1270 on the SAT critical reading and math sections, and grade-point averages of A- or better. There are only so many students with these attributes to go around -- about 44,000 a year, out of 1.5 million test takers. Georgetown lowers that threshold to search for another 5,000 or so under-represented minority students.
This year, Georgetown enrolled a record 142 black students, selected from a pool of 1,400. Mr. Deacon doubts he could have chosen a more accomplished group from a pool of 2,800. ''The question is, what's a good enough class?'' he says. ''We're not going to say, 'Come one, come all' just to find that one gem of a student and devastate the dreams of all the rest.''
William R. Fitzsimmons, Harvard's dean of admissions, describes his university's recruitment as ''aggressive'' -- and crucial. ''Nobody wants to go back to the bad old days, when getting into America's top colleges was like knowing a secret handshake,'' Mr. Fitzsimmons says. ''If we started cutting back, applications would go down from the students who need real outreach.''
Harvard enlists students to call and e-mail thousands of prospective minority applicants with high test scores. Lucerito Ortiz, who graduated last spring, grew up in Los Angeles, the daughter of two immigrants. Although she earned good grades in high school, she did not think about Harvard. ''People like me didn't go to places like that,'' she recalls.
Her thinking changed when Harvard sent her a search letter. After enrolling at the university, Ms. Ortiz helped the admissions office contact students from backgrounds like hers. She says she always explained the long odds of getting in (Harvard's admissions rate was just under 7 percent this year). ''In a way, it's sad, but I don't feel bad about it,'' says Ms. Ortiz, now an admissions officer at Harvard. ''I don't feel guilty for giving students the chance to have their lives changed.''
A Harvard representative contacted Sally Nuamah her junior year of high school in Chicago. Ms. Nuamah had good grades but an ACT score she describes as low. Her parents, who came from Ghana, had little money. As she welcomed the admissions rep into her living room one day, she was nervous. ''I was like, 'Oh, goodness, I don't want to disappoint anyone,' '' she says.
Ensuing conversations brought mixed emotions. ''I felt that I was pushed and given motivation,'' she says, ''but on the other hand, I wondered if what they were telling me was feasible.'' She knew her scores were below the average for Harvard students. Nonetheless, she applied. Months later, a rejection letter came.
Ms. Nuamah, now a senior at George Washington University, asserts that such outreach can help low-income students who lack confidence, but she sees a potential downside. ''Many of those students are so conditioned to disappointment,'' she explains. ''If colleges are targeting hundreds of students somewhere and not one is accepted, they may need to re-evaluate their efforts. Some people might say, 'Those colleges come here and do that to us, and nobody ever ends up going.' ''
A HALF-CENTURY ago, B. Alden Thresher wrote a prescient book called ''College Admissions and the Public Interest.'' Thresher, a former director admissions at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, described colleges' justifications for increasing selectivity as ''rationalizations for a kind of insensate avarice: we want the best and only the best, we are never satisfied.'' But he saw something noble, too, in the relentless search: ''It is also deeply connected with the highest virtues of academic man -- the impulse toward perfection.''
The quest for the perfect class involves irony: the push for more inclusiveness inevitably leads to more exclusivity. Andrew Delbanco, professor of humanities at Columbia and author of a forthcoming book about higher education, has pondered the meaning of declining admissions rates. He describes his students as smart, engaged and imaginative but not necessarily more than they were 10 years ago, when Columbia had far fewer applicants.
Ever-increasing selectivity, Mr. Delbanco says, has shaped the way some students think about education.
''If you succeed in getting into a selective college, it would take a pretty extraordinary person not to think you've already done something pretty terrific,'' he says. ''One of the hazards of this arms race is that it can inculcate a feeling of self-satisfaction on the part of the student, as well as the institution.''
William M. Shain, an educational consultant and former admissions dean at three private colleges, believes that bigger applicant pools can bring better students -- up to a point. ''You'll always get a class where things that can be measured, like testing, go up,'' he says. ''But you won't necessarily get a class that thinks better or enhances the classroom.''
Moreover, because so many seats go to ''hooked'' students, Mr. Shain questions the benefits of recruiting by colleges that accept fewer than 20 percent of applicants. Take Mr. Shain's alma mater, Princeton, whose freshman class this year is 37 percent minority students, 17 percent athletes, 13 percent legacies and 11 percent international students. ''Among very, very good schools, a huge percentage of the class is not in play on academic grounds,'' he says. ''How much can you improve the class when you're only working with half or less?''
Susan Tree, director of college counseling at the Westtown School, a college-prep academy in Pennsylvania, attends about 100 college presentations a year. She's often struck by the cookie-cutter nature of recruitment pitches. ''It seems colleges have lost the sense of presenting places so that some kids are turned on and others are turned off,'' she says. She believes the University of Chicago had something that many colleges desired -- an identity: ''The risk they run is that they're joining the ranks of generic, highly selective colleges.''
But selectivity speaks. Maya Lozinski, a freshman at Chicago, grew up in Menlo Park, Calif. She had never heard of the university until it sent her a postcard.
Ultimately, Chicago was her first choice. She says the university is becoming ''normal,'' more career oriented. She liked the maroon scarf it sent her. She also liked its declining admissions rate. In 2004, Chicago accepted 40 percent of its applicants, compared with 18 percent this year. ''I wouldn't have applied a few years ago -- I would have felt overqualified,'' says Ms. Lozinski, who had an A average in high school and scored a 2370 (out of 2400) on the SAT. ''A college's admissions rate says something about the quality of students who go there and the prestige of it.''
Perhaps the University of Chicago will end up trading one kind of exclusivity for another. Marshall Knudson says that some students on the campus fret that the university will lose its niche as it attracts more applicants, while other students see the declining admissions rate as adding value to their degrees.
Mr. Knudson, who graduated from Chicago last spring, chose the university for its ''feverish intellectual vapors.'' As a freshman, he protested the adoption of the Common Application, fearing it would diminish the culture of the university. Looking back, Mr. Knudson is skeptical of such ''utopian visions.'' He doubts any university could deliver an experience that matches the story it tells the world beyond its gates. ''People like to promote a vision of what makes them unique, but it's just wishful thinking,'' he says. ''It was a great education. I'm glad I went there. But I don't think it ever lived up to its ideal.
''And maybe that's the value of an education,'' he says. ''It helps you realize the limits of an ideal.''

HEADLINE: Black Business Leaders Ponder Mayoral Election

BYLINE: By DON TERRY. 
dterry@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
Generations of the city's black business leaders have played a vital yet largely unsung role in the struggle for civil rights and black political and economic empowerment in Chicago -- from the Great Migration in the early 20th century to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s battle for open housing in the 1960s to the victory of Harold Washington in the 1980s to the making of a black president on a warm November night in Grant Park two years ago.
The tradition continues. With the Feb. 22 mayoral election looming, the current generation of prominent Chicago black business men and women has formed a candidate search and support committee. Informally known as the Business Leadership Council, the group, which has about 25 members, hopes to help replicate the energy and minority voter interest that led to the election of Mr. Washington as the city's first black mayor nearly 30 years ago.
But agreeing on a candidate has been difficult for the business leaders and for a much larger coalition of black elected officials, clergy members and grass-roots groups. The political passion that turned Mr. Washington's campaign into a crusade is absent, said Hermene Hartman, a member of the leadership council and publisher of N'Digo, a weekly newspaper. 
''Maybe people are feeling too comfortable and satisfied with Obama in the White House,'' Ms. Hartman said. ''Whatever it is, it's worlds apart from Harold.''
The group's goal is to find a candidate who will focus on the issues that one of its co-chairmen, Frank Clark, chief executive of ComEd, said were ''uniquely prevalent to the African-American community'' -- poor education, high crime and joblessness.
''Now, I'm not saying that non-black candidates cannot do that; indeed they can,'' Mr. Clark said. ''What I am saying is that these problems are prevalent in our community, and we ought to be able to make sure that we develop leaders who are trying to address and solve those issues.''
Short of a black candidate reaching Chicago's political mountaintop, the group wants to ensure that ''the black business community has a voice, a seat at the table'' and that the next mayor, regardless of race, sex or ethnicity, is ''responsive to the needs of all Chicagoans,'' said Ralph G. Moore, a council member and president of Ralph G. Moore and Associates, a management firm.
''But the issues are much more complex than they were 40, even 20, years ago,'' Mr. Moore added. ''You don't have all the black business people on board just because a candidate is black. There are members of the black business community who are very comfortable in supporting candidates who are not black.''
Mellody Hobson, president of Ariel Investments, who is black, is the co-chairman of the mayoral campaign of Rahm Emanuel, President Obama's former chief of staff. Her boss, John W. Rogers Jr., the founder of Ariel and a longtime supporter of Mayor Richard M. Daley, is also black. Mr. Rogers, along with James Reynolds of Loop Capital Markets and Mr. Clark, is a co-chairman of the leadership council.
''In some ways, we are trying to relive the experiences of Harold's election,'' Mr. Rogers said. ''It's been very interesting, very healthy. There's a real sense of coming together.''
The leadership council was formed seven weeks ago, shortly after Mr. Daley announced he would not seek a seventh term. There is a sense of urgency among the members -- that they are already behind.
''People don't understand that this is a 60-days campaign,'' said Melody Spann-Cooper, president of WVON Radio and a member of the council. ''The window is closing fast. We need to be on the same page, so we can pool our collective resources to support the best candidate.''
The council has commissioned a citywide poll of a long list of potential candidates -- black, white and Hispanic.
''I want to be very thoughtful and careful in choosing my words,'' Mr. Clark said. ''Yes, I think it's important for the black community to identify candidates, but these candidates must have the ability to cross over. If a candidate can't reach across ethnic lines, then he or she will not be successful.''
The council members have also held meetings to analyze each of the 11 black mayoral hopefuls. Who can get on the ballot? Who can register voters? Who can energize the base? Who can raise money?
''Money is going to be key to this race,'' said Jacky Grimshaw, a former adviser to Mayor Washington who is not a council member ''The black business community is going to be very important.''
The council estimates it will take a minimum of $3 million for a candidate to be competitive. According to news media accounts, Mr. Emanuel is expected to have more than twice that amount by the end of the year.
''Matching dollar for dollar, considering the national prominence of at least one of the candidates, will be hard to do,'' Mr. Clark said. ''Which is why it's also important to have an organization, to have a base, to have people who you can put in the field.''
In a sign of just how difficult the process will be, the council essentially admitted it was divided when it announced that it had identified two candidates with the best chance of winning -- though it will not necessarily back them. The two, State Senator James T. Meeks and former Senator Carol Moseley Braun, have high name recognition. Mr. Meeks is pastor of one of the largest churches in the state, with a congregation of about 20,000.
In assembling the group, Mr. Rogers said, the council made sure to include business leaders from earlier generations, like George Johnson, 83, a former banker whose mother took him to Chicago from Mississippi when he was 2.
Mr. Johnson helped found Independence Bank on the South Side and financially supported both Dr. King's Chicago Freedom Movement in the 1960s and a generation later the winning mayoral campaigns of Mr. Washington.
''It was so exciting to see George Johnson come to the first meeting,'' Mr. Rogers said. ''To hear some of the stories was inspiring. It makes me feel good to see us reaching back and understanding that there is much to be learned from that prior leadership.''
One of those stories begins in Chicago, where Dr. King spent 1966 campaigning for open housing. The movement had almost no money, and Dr. King had no idea where he was going to get the $30,000 he needed to cover payroll and other expenses like travel and bail.
A bank in Atlanta had turned him down for a loan, and Dr. King was about to catch a plane and scour the country for donations when his lieutenant, the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, told him a group of black Chicago businessmen could raise the money. Mr. Jackson had been working with several of the men, trying to help them get their products on the shelves of white-owned stores that refused to stock their goods.
Dr. King was skeptical, but agreed to sit down with the businessmen, who included Mr. Johnson.
''Our bank loaned Dr. King $140,000 to get him out of the hole in 1966,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''All the members of the executive committee signed personally. We were all on the hook. We were ready to pay, but he paid it all back.''
As Dr. King left the meeting that night, Mr. Johnson said, ''he was so emotional he had tears in his eyes. That was a great, great period. Years later, we did the same thing for Harold.''
The question is, Can they do it again? Can lightning be captured in a voting booth one more time?

HEADLINE: At Talks in Japan, U.S. Defends Actions of Fed

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI; Reporting was contributed by Sewell Chan in Jekyll Island, Ga., Keith Bradsher in Hong Kong, Jack Ewing in Frankfurt and Vikas Bajaj in Mumbai.

 BODY:
KYOTO, Japan -- The United States confronted growing restiveness with its economic policy on Saturday as leading Asian countries resisted its call to set limits on trade deficits and surpluses while also warning that the decision to pump more money into the American economy would have harmful global repercussions.
The heightened wariness about United States policy underscores the difficulties facing the Obama administration as it experiments with ways to shore up the economy. The strategy differences will present a challenge to President Obama when he travels to Seoul this week for a meeting of the Group of 20 nations, where leaders will try to reach a framework for correcting the trade imbalances that economists say threaten a fragile global recovery. 
The growing divide was evident here on Saturday at a gathering of finance ministers from the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, after several days of sharp criticism of the Federal Reserve's announcement that it would buy $600 billion in Treasury securities to bolster growth.
Countries like China, Brazil and Germany have warned that the unilateral move devalues an already-weak dollar, and could set off a destabilizing flow of funds into emerging economies that will inflate their own currencies and make their exports more expensive.
On Friday, the German finance minister assailed United States monetary policy as ''clueless,'' and China suggested that American officials explain their decision so as to calm international anxiety.
Though the atmosphere at the forum on Saturday was less charged, the United States was on the defensive. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner took pains to rebut some of the criticism, saying American economic policy was aimed at shoring up the recovery, and not an attempt to deflate the dollar to help exports.
''We will never use our currency as a tool to gain competitive advantage,'' Mr. Geithner said after the meeting, adding that the United States was committed to a strong dollar.
He said that capital inflows into emerging markets were a vote of confidence in their fast-growing economies, and that a healthy American economy would benefit all its trading partners. ''I think that confidence is justified,'' he said, ''and something that should be welcomed. It does come with pressures, and they're going to have to manage those pressures.''
But Asian countries remained concerned about the effect of American policy.
''In the long term, there's a hope that capital inflows will become good investments, but in the short term, they work to strengthen local currencies and that's a problem,'' the Japanese finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda, told reporters here. He said that Japan would work particularly closely with emerging economies in Southeast Asia to find solutions.
The Thai finance minister, Korn Chatikavanij, said that while he understood the need to address excessive trade surpluses and deficits, it was important ''at the same time that trade protectionism is not used as a tool to correct imbalances.''
Countries like Thailand, South Korea and Brazil that have successful export economies have threatened to take measures to curb the flood of money that has pushed up currency values and raised the specter of asset bubbles.
With the Democrats having suffered a stinging defeat in elections, and with more government stimulus spending seemingly out of the question, economic recovery has increasingly hinged on the Fed's injection of money into the economy, an attempt to encourage businesses to borrow and invest. Mr. Obama emphasized that point in an address to business leaders on Saturday in India as he called for job-creating economic ties between the two countries.
But increasing the money supply also weakens the dollar, and has opened the United States to the charge that it is doing what it has long accused China of doing: keeping its currency artificially weak, and helping to create dangerous imbalances in the world economy.
''Essentially, what the Fed's doing is trying to get U.S. growth up on the backs of other countries' growth -- at least that's the sense that other countries have,'' said Raghuram G. Rajan, a former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund. ''You are forcing them to adjust by making their exports to the U.S. more expensive.''
Mr. Rajan said the Fed could not ignore the overseas impact of its policies.
''When the Fed has reached the limits of expanding U.S. demand and monetary policy works primarily on the exchange rate, rather than on expanding spending, then it comes dangerously close to direct exchange-rate intervention,'' Mr. Rajan said.
Mr. Geithner also encountered continued resistance to his proposal to set numerical limits to trade surpluses and deficits.
Asean, the 10-nation group of southeast Asian countries, will raise concerns over the United States proposals at the G-20 meeting this week.
Mr. Geithner did not appear concerned, and said that agreeing on specifics would take more time. But he cited an emerging consensus on obliging countries to avoid excessive trade imbalances: namely, too heavy a reliance on exports or imports.
''What I'm very pleased with is how much broad support there is for the idea that you need to build a better set of understandings around exchange rate cooperation,'' Mr. Geithner said. ''I really believe it will help reduce some of the tensions, some of the pressures you're seeing.''
The divisions underscore a deterioration in global camaraderie in recent months. Less than five months ago, G-20 leaders in Toronto exchanged far friendlier words, pledging to work toward ''shared objectives.''
At the meeting on Saturday, the atmosphere was one of labored consent, with the United States and China notably stepping back from the critical tone that has colored recent comments on economic policy.
Yet ministers at the two-day meeting broke no new ground in correcting global trade imbalances that economists say threaten the fragile worldwide recovery.
In a joint statement, the ministers pledged not to use their currencies as trade weapons and to take steps to shrink damaging trade gaps to bring more stability to the global economy.
For most of this year, the debate over trade gaps has focused on China and the value of its currency, which many countries have charged is being kept artificially low. But with criticism of its policies mounting, the United States appears to have diverted attention to itself and away from China.

HEADLINE: An Uncompromising Woman

 BODY:
Anyone who knows the situation in Liberia would take issue with Daniel Bergner's characterization of President Sirleaf as an ''uncompromising woman.'' Any leader of a country in a situation like Liberia's will have to compromise every day in every way with giant donors like the World Bank, the E.U. and the U.S. State Department, not to mention the competing interests and demands of a war-ravaged population and a political class that is constantly fighting over a very small plate of spoils. 
President Sirleaf has done a masterful job of presenting Liberia as a country on the move; this despite the continuing presence of 10,000 U.N. troops, an unemployment rate over 80 percent, a private sector controlled by foreigners and a mind-boggling set of dysfunctional social realities that range from corroding political corruption to completely broken health, education and social-welfare systems. In addition, the government has yet to issue its official position on the Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission's report of last year which called for the banning of President Sirleaf from political office for 30 years because of her involvement in the conflict and for the creation of war-crime tribunals (whose first customer would most likely be one of her main opponents in the 2011 election, the senator from Nimba County, Prince Johnson).
It is disheartening to hear Sirleaf's optimism about the positive effects that potential oil discoveries would have for Liberia given the impact of the ''oil curse'' in other West African states. Liberia doesn't need oil; it needs a new set of ideas that Sirleaf and her clique are unlikely to provide.
The real hope for Liberia lies with young Liberians now studying inthe United States and elsewhere who might be enticed to return home and try their hands at nation-building.
President Sirleaf will very likely win a well-deserved second term, but she is still just a placeholder for the generation of Liberians who can really createan uncompromising space for the citizens of their fascinating but terribly ravaged country.

HEADLINE: Democrats Divided on Tax Cut Strategy

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration and Congressional Democrats are struggling for a strategy to deal with the soon-to-expire Bush-era tax cuts, each side uncertain whether the other is up for a fight with Republicans in the wake of the Democrats' election trouncing -- or whether they could win, in any event.
That has both parties betting that the most likely outcomes could be either a truce that extends the tax cuts for all income levels for perhaps a year past their scheduled Dec. 31 expiration, or a stalemate that lets them expire temporarily, in either case delaying the battle until 2011. 
President Obama devoted his weekly address on Saturday to reaffirming his support for extending only the tax rates that apply to incomes below $250,000, and not ''for millionaires and billionaires,'' even as he restated his post-election overture to compromise with the strengthened Congressional Republicans.
They insist on making the tax cuts for all incomes permanent. That would cost more than $4 trillion over the next decade and Mr. Obama's partial extension about $3 trillion.
Mr. Obama's assertiveness masked the doubts and indecision that plagued Democrats about the tax issue even before the midterm elections, and caused them to delay a vote until afterward. Now the divisions are intensified within their demoralized ranks.
Some Democrats want to take a stand, win or lose, for any option that could depict Republicans as patrons of the richest taxpayers, at the expense of blocking continued tax cuts for the middle class. Others have no appetite left for combat.
With Mr. Obama on a 10-day trip to Asia and lawmakers scattered to their states, Democrats say any resolution must wait until they regroup in the capital next week for a lame-duck Congressional session that will include those who lost their seats.
The tax issue is likely to dominate that session, and could also determine the outcomes for other pressing issues, including spending bills to keep the government running and myriad other expiring tax breaks.
Republicans are also unsure how to proceed, since Democrats could block a permanent extension of the Bush tax cuts for the highest incomes, either by their votes or Mr. Obama's veto. But they favor any option that delays the issue until next year, when they will run the House and have a bigger Senate minority.
''Let's start where we agree,'' Mr. Obama said in his address. ''All of us want certainty for middle-class Americans. None of us want them to wake up on Jan. 1st with a higher tax bill. That's why I believe we should permanently extend the Bush tax cuts for all families making less than $250,000 a year. That's 98 percent of the American people.''
He added: ''But at a time when we are going to ask folks across the board to make such difficult sacrifices, I don't see how we can afford to borrow an additional $700 billion from other countries to make all the Bush tax cuts permanent, even for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. We'd be digging ourselves into an even deeper fiscal hole and passing the burden on to our children.''
Mr. Obama's emphasis on his opposition to a permanent extension left open the prospect that he could agree to a one- or two-year extension, an idea that has gained traction among Democrats since last Tuesday's election losses.
But many Democrats say they should insist that the tax cuts for the middle class be extended longer than those on high income -- ''de-coupling'' them, in effect, so that when the extensions expire for the richest 2 percent of taxpayers, Republicans would not have the political cover of packaging them with the tax cuts for everyone else.
Mr. Obama's post-election stance comes after debate within the administration over how explicit he should be about what he would or would not accept as his bottom line. For example, should he specify how long an extension of rates he would accept for high incomes? And what might he demand in return? One possibility is extended aid to the long-term unemployed, which expires for two million jobless Americans after Nov. 30.
The president indicated in his address on Saturday that he has opted for now to stick with his pre-election mantra against permanently lower rates for high incomes.
Some Democrats suggest as a new bargaining position an income cutoff of $1 million instead of $250,000, arguing that would better define Republicans' priorities rhetorically. As Mr. Obama said on Saturday, ''I believe we can't afford to borrow and spend another $700 billion on permanent tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires.''
If a stalemate causes all the tax cuts to expire, it is unclear how much of a headache will ensue for taxpayers. Treasury officials say the Internal Revenue Service has flexibility to leave the current tax withholding tables in place temporarily, on the assumption there will be some resolution in 2011.

HEADLINE: PLENTY OF WORK FOR THE LAME DUCK: The $4 Trillion Question

 BODY:
The Bush-era tax cuts are set to expire at year end. That means the lame duck Congress has tough choices to make and not a lot of time to make them.
Punting, with the assumption that the next Congress will restore some or all of the cuts, will only intensify the uncertainty for individuals and businesses. Making the wrong choice could drive up the deficit disastrously or stall the recovery. Now that the campaign is over, lawmakers need to put aside the posturing and politicking and do what is right for the country.
The Republicans want to permanently extend all of the tax cuts, including those for the richest Americans. Before the midterm election, President Obama called for permanently extending the cuts for the 98 percent of households earning less than $250,000 a year, and letting most of the cuts expire for those who make more than that. Last week, he said he was open to negotiation. 
What should happen? What would it mean to your tax bill? To the deficit?
Permanent cuts would bust the budget. Extending all of them would cost nearly $4 trillion over the next decade -- $3.2 trillion for the so-called middle-class cuts and $700 billion for the richest Americans. There is no plausible level of spending cuts to offset the damage; the result would be chronic deficits and debilitating debt.
That is why we believe that for the sake of fiscal sanity any extensions of the Bush tax cuts must be temporary and focused on spurring consumer spending while the economy is weak. We support a one- or two-year extension of the cuts for low-, middle-, and upper-middle-income taxpayers, who spend most of their income.
Under this approach, unless you are at the top of the ladder, you will keep your Bush tax cuts in the near term. The top 2 percent of households would take a hit, but hardly a body blow. A married couple making $325,000 a year, with two school-age children, would see their taxes rise by $7,400, from $63,600 to $71,000, according to estimates by Deloitte Tax. If the couple made $1 million, their taxes would rise from $236,200 to $289,400.
A one-year extension of the cuts for the lower 98 percent would add about $140 billion to the deficit, but the support to the economy is more important right now. Revenue from letting the high-end tax cuts expire -- an estimated $40 billion in 2011 alone -- could be used for job-creating measures in the near term and deficit reduction later on.
Politics being as they are, what lawmakers should do is not what they probably will do.
One compromise that President Obama is reportedly considering would extend all of the Bush tax cuts for a year or two. That is a dangerous step, because lawmakers could face the same decision in 2012 -- in the middle of another campaign -- and would probably make the same choice. Serial extensions would be tantamount to a permanent extension.
To complicate things further, Bush-era income taxes are not the only taxes on the table for the lame duck Congress. Lawmakers must also decide on new rates and exemptions for the estate tax, which reverts to its pre-2001 level in 2011.
Most Democrats have called for restoring the estate tax to its level in 2009, which would exempt 99.8 percent of estates from ever facing the tax. The tax would not kick in until an estate is worth more than $3.5 million ($7 million for couples), with a rate of 45 percent on property above those levels. The proposal -- which could cost $250 billion over 10 years -- is more than generous.
Republicans and some Democrats want to raise the exemptions to $5 million ($10 million for couples), and lower the rate to 35 percent. That would be a huge break for mega estates, an unconscionable giveaway that would cost $130 billion more than the Democrats' plan over 10 years.
At the other end of the spectrum, several tax breaks from last year's stimulus law -- focused on middle- and low-income working families -- will expire at year end unless extended. Mr. Obama has called for making the low-income breaks permanent, at a 10-year cost of nearly $100 billion. Republicans have not mentioned keeping the low-income tax cuts. Their silence speaks volumes.
If the lame duck Congress is responsible -- a big if -- it will require the wealthy to pay more and shield the vulnerable from increases.
Everyone else would keep their tax breaks in the near term, but be put on notice that fixing the budget will require tax increases and spending cuts as the economy recovers. Then the next Congress must pick up where the lame ducks leave off, by undertaking broad tax-and-spending reform to bring revenues in line with outlays.

HEADLINE: Alaska Writes a Senator Back Into Contention

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
ANCHORAGE -- Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska played many novel roles in her historic run as a write-in candidate. She was the insurgent incumbent, the maverick moderate, the outsider from the establishment, the underdog boasting about her seniority.
Yet over and over again, she also returned to what might seem the most unimaginative of political platitudes: the local rallying cry.
''This,'' she would tell supporters, freighting her voice with meaning, ''is about Alaska!''
Trite proved true. Write-in votes, which will be manually counted next week in Juneau, were well ahead after initial tallying, but legal challenges are looming. Still, while many candidates across the country rode to victory on voter anger at the direction of the nation, a crucial reason Ms. Murkowski, a Republican, is given a strong chance of prevailing is that she appealed so effectively to Alaska's distinctive sense of identity -- and to its particular anxieties. 
''We need seniority,'' said Mark Saugstad, a Republican from Girdwood, referring to Ms. Murkowski's eight years in the Senate. ''It's extremely important to this state economically, and I think Miller's a super wild card.''
Joe Miller, the Republican nominee, promoted a conservative utopia in the Last Frontier, an autonomous Alaska that could drill and mine and log at will without fear of federal meddling. But he did not stop there. He framed the image within a broader crusade against the federal government: privatize Social Security, eliminate the Department of Education, slash taxes and spending, end earmarks.
''It is Alaska's destiny,'' Mr. Miller told supporters at a final rally before the election, ''to lead this nation into the future.''
But while Mr. Miller was arguing states' rights, Ms. Murkowski, who would be the first write-in candidate elected to the Senate since 1954, was talking about the state's reality.
For all the populist anger and legal wrangling in Alaska over federal oversight of its natural resources and protected species, from offshore oil to polar bears, many Alaskans long ago made a pragmatic peace with the arrangement, and they worry what will happen if things change significantly. A third of the state economy depends on federal spending. Many rural villages lack basic plumbing. Only a fraction of Alaska is reachable by road.
''To hell with politics,'' Ms. Murkowski would tell crowds. ''Let's do what's right for Alaska.''
It was a clever call to arms. She was invoking and directly quoting former Senator Ted Stevens, known as Uncle Ted, who died in August, her mentor and a figure revered for bringing home billions of dollars in federal money. Yet she was also tapping provincial pride, a rich vein here, and shifting the debate away from the national concerns that Mr. Miller and others across the country peddled so effectively. She was selling stability.
''We were never shy in pointing out the case that we wanted to continue the legacy of Senator Stevens,'' said Kevin Sweeney, who managed Ms. Murkowski's write-in campaign.
If Ms. Murkowski prevails in the race, she will pull off a political feat not seen since Eisenhower was in the White House. The last person elected to the Senate as a write-in candidate was Strom Thurmond of South Carolina in 1954.
She will also embarrass Sarah Palin, whose endorsement of Mr. Miller pushed him to prominence. While Ms. Palin has often wrapped herself in Alaska's rugged independence, Ms. Murkowski engages with the state's more practical concerns, and her apparent success proves how effective that can be.
Politicians and strategists say if she prevails it will be because, after losing the primary, she returned to campaign tirelessly and creatively. That meant leading crowds at campaign rallies in spelling aloud her name, singing voter instructions -- ''fill in the oval, write it on the line'' -- as she once did in Fairbanks, and investing time courting Alaska Natives, whose support proved crucial on Election Day.
In the end, she was fortunate, too, in her opponents. One was a little-known Democrat in a conservative state. The other was a Tea Party favorite whose appeal proved limited.
Mr. Miller narrowly won the Republican primary, receiving 56,000 votes, and he was never able to significantly expand his support. With about 80 percent of all ballots having been counted so far in the general election, he has received 70,000 votes. Votes that contained a write-in candidate tallied 83,000 or 41 percent. Scott McAdams, a Democrat, has 48,000 votes.
''When he got into the general and the lights got a little brighter, people were saying, 'Wait a minute, is this really going to work?' '' Andrew Halcro, a political consultant and a supporter of Ms. Murkowski, said of Mr. Miller.
''And he didn't just have one October surprise,'' Mr. Halcro added. ''He had a whole wardrobe of October surprises.''
Ms. Murkowski clearly benefited from Mr. Miller's many stumbles in the final weeks, from revelations that he had been disciplined in a previous job for using government computers for political purposes, and then lying about it, to the day his security guards handcuffed a reporter who asked about the matter.
Mr. Miller was smart and articulate and had an impressive resume -- Yale Law School, West Point, a Bronze Star in the Persian Gulf war -- but he exuded edginess, and not always the appealing form.
Asked in a debate to name a common misconception about him in the campaign, Mr. Miller responded, ''That I'm mean.''
Wariness of Mr. Miller extended beyond Alaska. Even after top Senate Republicans in Washington had embraced him, the party's full conference rejected an attempt during the campaign to remove Ms. Murkowski as the ranking member on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. That proved critical for her seniority argument during the campaign.
After running a lackluster primary campaign, she aggressively pursued important constituencies. The Alaska Federation of Natives endorsed her, and Native corporations, which have benefited from controversial no-bid federal contracts supported by Ms. Murkowski, spent more than $1 million on her campaign. She also met with Democratic groups whose support she needed.
The final result is far from certain. More than 40,000 absentee and questioned ballots remain to be counted and write-in ballots must be manually read to determine the name written on them. Senate Republicans are raising money for Mr. Miller's potential legal challenges. Even if she wins, Ms. Murkowski may find it challenging to serve her new supporters, including Democrats, environmentalists and wary Republicans, who might have cast a reluctant ballot on her behalf. And she would also represent the 59 percent of voters who chose someone else.
''It's going to be incumbent on me to make sure that we take this message from this election and continue it through my tenure in the United States Senate,'' Ms. Murkowski said the day after the election. ''It cannot be just kind of business as usual, and I'm looking forward to that.''

HEADLINE: Throwing the Bums Out for 140 Years

BYLINE: By DAVID M. KENNEDY. 
David M. Kennedy teaches history and is co-director of the Bill Lane Center for the American West at Stanford.

 BODY:
Stanford, Calif.
SO we have had three ''wave'' elections in a row: control of both chambers of Congress changed hands in 2006, as did the presidency in 2008, and the House flipped back to Republican domination last week. All this apparently incoherent back-and-forth has left the political class reeling and set the commentariat aflutter.
Explanations for our current political volatility abound: toxic partisanship, the ever more fragmented and strident news media, high unemployment, economic upheaval and the clamorous upwelling of inchoate populist angst. 
But the political instability of our own time pales when compared with the late 19th century. In the Gilded Age the American ship of state pitched and yawed on a howling sea of electoral turbulence. For decades on end, ''divided government'' was the norm. In only 12 of the 30 years after 1870 did the same party control the House, the Senate and the White House.
The majority party in the House -- intended to be the branch of government most responsive to swings in popular sentiment -- shifted six times in the era's 15 Congressional elections. Three of those shifts in power entailed losses of more than 70 seats by the majority party (at a time when there were roughly 100 fewer seats than today's 435). In 1894, Democrats shed more than 100. Today's electoral oscillations, for all their drama, seem modest by comparison.
And yet there are features of the Gilded Age that suggest some disturbing parallels with our own time. Generations of American scholars have struggled to find a coherent narrative or to identify heroic leaders in that era's messy and inconclusive political scene. The history books give us a succession of Lilliputian presidents often described as ''bearded, bland and boring.''
These men left but the faintest of tracks in the historical record. Chester A. Arthur? He is best remembered, if at all, for reportedly possessing more than 80 pairs of trousers. Benjamin Harrison? Of him can be said virtually nothing memorable at all. The likes of the monumental figures who strode the national stage in the early years of the Republic -- Jefferson, Jackson, Calhoun, Clay, Webster, Lincoln -- were nowhere to be found in the years after the Civil War. Nor were there any leaders of the caliber that would emerge in the 20th century -- from the two Roosevelts to Ronald Reagan.
It is not as if the Gilded Age did not have plenty of urgent and potentially galvanizing issues: healing the wounds of the Civil War; managing enormous nation-building agendas in the conquered South and the dauntingly arid West; navigating the enormous and rushed transition from an agricultural to an industrial economic base, and from countryside to city; quelling the labor unrest that repeatedly erupted into bloodshed; accommodating the millions of immigrants who streamed ashore in the century's closing decades; and defining an international role for an increasingly prosperous and powerful country, just to name a few.
Yet the era's political system proved unable to grapple effectively with any of those matters.
What's instructive to us now is the similarity between the Gilded Age's combination of extraordinary social and economic dynamism and abject political paralysis. We face a no-less-formidable array of issues, and there is little mystery about their nature. Some have a familiar face: unemployment, sadly, as well as immigration and the quest for an appropriate national security strategy and foreign policy.
Others are almost wholly novel: the passage to a post-industrial information age; mounting competition in virtually all the world's marketplaces; worsening educational achievement; giddily levitating health costs; a looming fiscal apocalypse in entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid; environmental degradation and climate change; and the search for sustainable energy supplies.
In the face of all those challenges, like our Gilded Age forebears, we have a political system that manages to be both volatile and gridlocked -- indeed, it may be gridlocked not least because it is so volatile. And, like their 19th-century forebears, today's politicians have great difficulty gaining traction on any of those challenges. Now as then, it's hard to lead citizens who are so eager to ''throw the bums out'' at every opportunity.
Yet the Gilded Age was but a chapter in American history, and we are permitted to hope that the sorry spectacle of our own time may well come to a similar conclusion. The pent-up demand for some kind of meaningful approach to the great issues that hung so heavily on the land more than a century ago eventually produced the Progressive Era.
Eventually, leaders emerged in both major parties -- most conspicuously the Republican Theodore Roosevelt and the Democrat Woodrow Wilson -- who breathed vitality into the wheezing political system and effectively initiated the tortuous process of building institutions and writing laws commensurate with the scope and complexity of the society over which they presided.
So perhaps the stasis of the Gilded Age and the stalemate of our recent years reflect not so much the defects of our political structures as the monumental scale of the issues at hand. From that perspective, ''wave'' elections mark a necessary stage of indecision, shuffling, avoidance and confusion before a fractious democratic people can at last summon the courage to make tough choices, the creativity to find innovative solutions, the will to take consequential action and the old-fashioned moxie to put the ship of state again on an even keel.

HEADLINE: The Almost-Special Relationship

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- At a panel discussion last week on relations between India and the United States, Strobe Talbott, the former American diplomat, told an audience of Indian business leaders that he had learned a valuable lesson about India: Do not hyphenate it. As in Indo-Pak. (Or, in a close cousin of a hyphen, as in Chindia.) The audience smiled at his epiphany: India matters because it is India.
In a nutshell, President Obama is trying to deliver the same message during his three-day visit to India, the first stop on a broader Asian tour. Both countries are eager to build on their improved ties and set up a unique, special relationship, given that together they represent the world's richest and largest democracies. Faced with a rising authoritarian China, and an economically wounded Europe, a weakened United States is casting about for global partners. India would seem a nice fit.
''This is the time to be ambitious about this relationship,'' said Shivshankar Menon, India's national security adviser, speaking on the panel with Mr. Talbott. 
And yet eliminating the hyphen is not easy, especially given India's fraught relations with its neighbors in what is perhaps the most politically complicated region on earth, one in which American lives and treasure are at stake in Pakistan and Afghanistan. And India's evolving relationship with another neighbor, China, is also a prime concern for America. Indeed, the decision to focus Mr. Obama's India trip on India was itself not easily achieved; some senior administration officials lobbied the president to put pressure on Indian leaders for a conciliatory gesture toward Pakistan, in hope that such a carrot might entice the Pakistanis to do more to help America against the Taliban.
These sorts of political equations have long tangled the U.S.-India relationship: The Americans, at different times, have pushed the Indians to cut a deal with Pakistan over the disputed region of Kashmir, but the Indians have bristled at any interference. The Indians still want the Americans to sponsor India for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. Not such an easy thing, the Americans reply, since America alone can't do this and it creates issues between America and China. It has sometimes seemed like a relationship built around one country asking the other to do something it considers against its self-interest.
Moreover, the economic relationship between the two countries often has been a source of friction. High unemployment in America has renewed complaints that outsourcing to India hurts American workers. Indians complain that American protectionism is hurting Indian companies and that American export restrictions on technologies that can have both military and civil uses are outdated and unnecessary in a relationship between putative allies.
Mr. Obama's trip is an attempt to reboot or refocus the relationship away from these disputes and de-emphasize the tangible goodies (for example, contracts) that politicians call ''deliverables.'' Instead, the two sides are discussing how they can partner on education, clean energy, agriculture, technological development and military cooperation. The thematic emphasis of the visit is on shared democratic values -- a pointed dig at China -- and what the two countries say are shared opportunities. American officials say that an expected $4 billion deal for India to buy military transport aircraft -- yes, a goodie -- will provide thousands of American jobs. Indian officials emphasize that trade between the two countries is basically balanced -- unlike with China -- and that the anger over outsourcing is misplaced, especially since some Indian companies are investing and creating jobs in the United States.
Some Indian commentators have groused that all the diplospeak about shared opportunities obscures the fact that the trip lacks a ''big idea'' to excite or elevate the relationship, even as big, unavoidable problems are seemingly being avoided. In 2000, former President Bill Clinton spent five days in India on a door-opening visit that was credited with righting what had been a stalled relationship. Then former President George W. Bush made the most dramatic gesture by pushing through an agreement to cooperate on civilian nuclear projects; the move effectively legitimized India as a nuclear power and lifted a 30-year moratorium on nuclear trade with India even though India had not signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. By comparison, Mr. Obama seems not to be offering much.
''The jury is out,'' said Shekhar Gupta, editor of The Indian Express, speaking of how India's political establishment views Mr. Obama.
But Ronen Sen, who recently retired from India's diplomatic corps after serving as ambassador to the United States, says the focus on a ''big idea'' is misplaced. Given the litany of difficult problems between the two countries, Mr. Sen said, Mr. Obama's approach was a reasonable way to build trust and broaden a bilateral relationship that, while greatly improved, had not yet fully matured.
''It has not yet reached a critical mass where it can be self sustaining,'' Mr. Sen said.
Indeed, even the landmark civil nuclear deal remains a subject of dispute as the two sides still squabble over fine details of how American suppliers could begin doing business in the lucrative Indian nuclear energy market. The Americans say that rules recently approved by India are inconsistent with accepted global practice, which exempts foreign suppliers from liability in cases of accidents, leaving it solely with local operators. A senior American official said ''intense discussions'' were underway to find a solution. If one is found, Mr. Obama may get a nice ''deliverable'' -- an open door through which American firms, as originally expected, can sell nuclear equipment to India and provide jobs at home.
There is less talk of the chances of solving bigger problems, like differences between America and India in global negotiations on climate change and trade. And the uncertainty over the most problematic hyphens -- Afghanistan and Pakistan -- looms over the visit. Even as Mr. Obama seeks a way to stabilize Afghanistan and get out, Indian officials dread the day America leaves. They worry about what will be left behind, since India cannot leave the neighborhood.
''Quite obviously, we have strategic stakes there,'' said Brig. Gurmeet Kanwal, director of the Center for Land Warfare Studies, a military research institute. ''We do not wish to have a government in Afghanistan or a government in Kabul that is inimical to Indian interests.''
He added: ''We see the United States as a stabilizing influence in Asia.''
And so a political courtship will continue, problems and all. Governmental ties already lag far behind the people-to-people relationships. America remains the premier destination for Indian students studying abroad, and Indian immigrants in America have achieved disproportionate success in business, medicine and many other fields. It is this backchannel closeness that serves as a cattle prod nudging the governments to become closer, too.
K. Subrahmanyam, a leading Indian defense analyst, believes that India and the United States represent the inevitable and necessary partnership of the 21st century because China's rise represents a threat to a global order based on democratic principles. He said that demographic trends, too, should bind the two countries together.
''If America needs a partner, Europe is aging, Japan is aging and China is going to age,'' he said. ''The only two major nations in the world who will not be aging, at least for the next 30 years, are the United States and India.''

HEADLINE: Election Could Derail U.S. Efforts to Mend Ties With Russia

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Republican election victory last week was fueled by opposition to President Obama's economic and domestic initiatives, but it could undo his central foreign policy achievement, his new partnership with Russia, and embolden anti-American hawks in Moscow.
In forging a friendlier relationship with the Kremlin after years of tension, Mr. Obama needs Congress to sign off on three major policy changes: an arms control treaty to reduce nuclear arsenals and resume inspections; a civilian nuclear agreement to permit greater cooperation; and a repeal of cold war-era trade restrictions so Russia can join the World Trade Organization. 
Persuading Congress to approve any of those was already daunting when Democrats had control of both houses, but with Republicans taking over the House and bolstering forces in the Senate, all of these initiatives appear in jeopardy. If Mr. Obama cannot deliver on his promises, American officials and foreign policy specialists fear it will rupture the so-called reset policy and validate Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin and other hard-liners who have been skeptical of the rapprochement.
In the days since the election, Russian officials have already threatened to shelve the New Start arms control treaty. Mr. Obama has decided to make a concerted push to persuade the departing Senate to approve the treaty in a lame-duck session this month. The president brought it up last week, along with extending middle-class tax cuts, as his biggest priorities for the session.
''This is not a traditionally Democratic or Republican issue but rather an issue of American national security,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And I am hopeful that we can get that done before we leave and send a strong signal to Russia that we are serious about reducing nuclear arsenals, but also sending a signal to the world that we're serious about nonproliferation.''
If he fails to win approval before the old Senate adjourns, Mr. Obama's advisers and allies worry that the relationship with Russia will be frozen at a time when they consider it critical to increase Russian cooperation on several fronts, most notably pressuring Iran to give up its nuclear program.
''If that goes down, everything else is on ice,'' said Samuel Charap, an analyst at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research organization. Cooperation on Iran, nonproliferation, Afghanistan and terrorism could be affected, he said. ''None of that, zero, is going to happen. It really could have a major effect.''
Within the administration, a nightmare scenario envisions even worse consequences. Russian leaders traditionally have looked for weakness in American counterparts, and Mr. Obama's failure to impose his will on Congress would be seen as a sign of impotence. That could undercut President Dmitri A. Medvedev, who has made the improved relationship between Russia and the United States a centerpiece of his tenure despite Mr. Putin's doubts. If the reset comes undone, some analysts suggested it would hurt Mr. Medvedev's chances of persuading Mr. Putin to let him run for a second term in 2012. It could embolden those in the security establishment who want to keep close ties with Iran. By some estimates, Russia's decision to go along with sanctions on Iran could cost as much as $13 billion in arms sales.
Most important among those abandoned sales was the transfer of a sophisticated S-300 anti-aircraft system to Tehran that Mr. Medvedev blocked. If relations with the United States deteriorate and Moscow resumed the sale, security specialists said it could provoke Israel to attack Iran's nuclear program before the S-300 missiles are delivered because, once in place, they would make it far more dangerous for attacking warplanes.
Skeptics of the New Start treaty say the administration overstates the chances that Russia would pull away if the pact is not approved during the lame-duck. ''You see these reports that they're going to walk away from the treaty,'' said Stephen G. Rademaker, a former nonproliferation official in the Bush administration. ''That's simply ludicrous. The treaty is totally in their interest. Their negotiators did a fantastic job of getting what they want.''
The administration and its allies believe they have about a dozen Republican votes, enough to meet the two-thirds requirement for passage, if they can reach agreement with Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, who has been holding out in exchange for commitments to modernize the nuclear arsenal. Senate Republican aides said the treaty would pass as long as Mr. Kyl was satisfied.
Democrats included money for the first year of a 10-year modernization program in the stopgap spending resolution that is now keeping the government operating, virtually the only spending increase included in the measure. But they may threaten to take it out of the next stopgap resolution, due Dec. 3, if the Senate does not act on the treaty.
Mr. Kyl would not comment, but his spokesman said he was still waiting for more assurances from the administration.
Daryl G. Kimball, head of the Arms Control Association, said time was essential because nuclear arms inspections halted a year ago with the expiration of the first Start treaty. ''The more time goes by without that, the less we know about Russia's strategic forces,'' he said.
Congress also has a say in two other central elements in Mr. Obama's Russia policy. The president has revived a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement negotiated by President George W. Bush. Under the law, Congress has 90 days to reject the agreement or it goes into effect.
But the clock runs only when Congress is in session and about two weeks remain to meet the 90-day requirement. If lawmakers do not remain in lame-duck session that long, Mr. Obama would have to resubmit it next year and restart the clock. Administration officials fear the newly strengthened Republican skeptics could attach conditions that would be difficult if not impossible to meet.
The other Obama initiative has yet to be sent to Congress. To finally admit Russia into the World Trade Organization, the administration wants to lift the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the trade act of 1974 that imposes restrictions on Moscow. Mr. Obama's advisers worry that Republicans may use the issue as a proxy debate about Russia, essentially stalling or blocking Moscow's entry into the W.T.O.
The threat to Mr. Obama's reset policy comes as he prepares to meet with Mr. Medvedev next Sunday on the sidelines of an economic summit meeting in Japan. The lame-duck session of Congress opens the next day.

HEADLINE: Barack Obama, Phone Home

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
AFTER his ''shellacking,'' President Obama had to do something. But who had the bright idea of scheduling his visit to India for right after this election? The Democrats' failure to create jobs was at the heart of the shellacking. Nothing says ''outsourcing'' to the American public more succinctly than India. But the White House didn't figure this out until the eve of Obama's Friday departure, when it hastily rebranded his trip as a jobs mission. Perhaps the president should visit one of the Indian call centers policing Americans' credit-card debts to feel our pain.
Optics matter. If Washington is tumbling into a political crisis as the recovery continues to lag, maybe the president shouldn't get out of Dodge. If the White House couldn't fill a 13,000-seat arena in blue Cleveland the weekend before the midterms, maybe it shouldn't have sent the president there. If an administration charged with confronting a Great Recession knew that its nominee for secretary of the Treasury serially cut corners on his taxes, maybe it should have considered other options. Shoulda, woulda, coulda. Well, here we are.
True, the big things matter more than the optics. Unfortunately, they are a mess too. 
You can't win an election without a coherent message. Obama, despite his administration's genuine achievements, didn't have one. The good news -- for him, if not necessarily a straitened country -- is that the G.O.P. doesn't have one either. This explains the seemingly irrational calculus of Tuesday's exit polls. Voters gave Democrats and Republicans virtually identical favorability ratings while voting for the G.O.P. They gave Obama a slightly higher approval rating than either political party even as they punished him. This is a snapshot of a whiplashed country that (understandably) doesn't know whose butt to kick first. It means that Obama can make a comeback, but only if he figures out what he has to come back from and where he has to go.
The president's travails are not merely a ''communications problem.'' They're also a governance problem -- which makes them a gift to opponents who prefer no governance at all. You can't govern if you can't tell the country where you are taking it. The plot of Obama's presidency has been harder to follow than ''Inception.''
Health care reform remains at the root of this chaos. Obama has never explained why a second-tier priority for him in the 2008 campaign leapt to the top of his must-do list in March 2009. For much of the subsequent year spent fighting over it, he still failed to pick up the narrative thread. He delayed so long in specifying his own priorities for the bill that his opponents filled the vacuum for him, making fictions like ''death panels'' stick while he waited naively for bipartisanship to prevail. In 2010, Obama and most Democrats completed their transformation of a victory into a defeat by running away from their signature achievement altogether.
They couldn't talk about their other feat -- the stimulus, also poorly explained by the White House from the start -- because the 3.3 million jobs it saved are dwarfed by the intractable unemployment rate. Nor could they brag stirringly about a financial regulatory reform effort that left too many devilish details unresolved, too many too-big-to-fail banks standing and nearly all the crash culprits unaccountable.
With a cupboard this bare, Blame Bush became the Democratic message by default. But a message that neither boasts of any achievements nor offers any specifics for the future is a political suicide note.
Blame Bush was also a part of the G.O.P. message this year. When Republican candidates weren't trashing Obama, they routinely deplored the spending excesses of their own Bush-era Congress and ripped into the villainous Bush- Paulson TARP as if their leaders hadn't all signed on to it. The rest of the G.O.P. message -- typified by the ''Pledge to America'' peddled by John Boehner -- was as incoherent as the Democrats'. Traditional Republican boilerplate -- lower taxes, less spending, smaller government -- was chanted louder and louder, to pander to the Tea Party rebels, but with zero specifics of how it might be carried out. The midterm strategy was appropriately labeled ''80-20'' by the House majority leader in-waiting Eric Cantor -- 80 percent attacks on Democrats, 20 percent proposing a G.O.P. plan.
But there was no plan. Even in victory, most Republicans can't explain exactly what they want to do besides cut taxes and repeal health care (a quixotic goal, given the president's veto pen and the law's more popular provisions). A riotous dissection of this empty agenda could be found on election night on MSNBC, where a Republican stalwart, Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, called for ''across the board'' spending cuts. Under relentless questioning from Chris Matthews, she exempted defense and entitlements from the ax, thereby eliminating some 85 percent of the federal budget from her fiscal diligence.
Pressed about Social Security and Medicare, Blackburn would only promise to have an ''adult conversation'' with Americans on the subject. That's the new Republicanese for punting. The G.O.P. budget guru, Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, also called for a ''conversation'' in a specifics-deficient op-ed manifesto in The Financial Times last week. Boehner and Mitch McConnell, in their postelection press conference, declared no fewer than 11 times that they were eager to ''listen'' to the American people. At the very least they are listening to a message guru like Frank Luntz.
Were they to listen to Americans, they'd learn that they favor budget cuts mainly in theory, not in fact. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll this summer found that three-quarters of Americans don't want to cut federal aid to education -- high on the hit list of most fiscal hawks -- and more than 60 percent are opposed to raising the Social Security retirement age to 70. Even in the Republican-tilted electorate of last week, exit polls found that only 39 percent favored extending the Bush tax cuts to all Americans, including those making $250,000-plus. Yet it's a full Bush tax cut extension that's the entirety of the G.O.P. jobs program in 2010. This will end ''uncertainty'' among the wealthiest taxpayers, you see, and a gazillion jobs will trickle down magically from Jackson Hole.
Obama has a huge opening here -- should he take it. He could call the Republicans' bluff by forcing them to fill in their own blanks. He could start by offering them what they want, the full Bush tax cuts, in exchange for a single caveat: G.O.P. leaders would be required to stand before a big Glenn Beck-style chalkboard -- on C-Span, or, for that matter, Fox News -- and list, with dollar amounts, exactly which budget cuts would pay for them. Once they hit the first trillion -- or even $100 billion -- step back and let the ''adult conversation'' begin!
Better still, the president should open this bargaining session to the full spectrum of his opposition. As he said at his forlorn news conference on Wednesday, he is ready to consider policy ideas ''whoever proposes them.'' So why not cut to the chase and invite Congressional Tea Party heavyweights like Jim DeMint, Rand Paul and Michele Bachmann to the White House along with the official G.O.P. leadership? They will offer the specifics that Boehner and McConnell are too shy to divulge.
DeMint published a book last year detailing his view that Social Security be privatized to slow America's descent into socialism. Paul can elaborate on his ideas for reducing defense spending and cutting back on drug law enforcement. Bachmann will explain her plans for weaning Americans off Medicare.
Maybe some of the big Tea Party ideas will be as popular as the Tea Partiers claim them to be. We won't know until Congress tries to enact them. Nor will we know Obama's true measure until he provides a coherent alternative of his own about how he intends to put Americans back to work and keep them in their homes. If he has such a plan, few, if any, Americans have any idea what it is.
To do this, he'll have to break out of the White House bubble he lamented again last week. He can no longer limit interactions with actual working Americans to photo ops on factory floors or outsource them to a ''Middle Class Task Force'' led by Joe Biden. He must move beyond his Ivy League-Wall Street comfort zone to overhaul his economic team. If George Bush could announce Donald Rumsfeld's replacement the day after his 2006 midterm thumping, why is the naming of Lawrence Summers's much-needed successor receding into eternity?
In the 1946 midterms, the unpopular and error-prone rookie president Harry Truman, buffeted by a different set of economic dislocations, watched his party lose both chambers of Congress (including 54 seats in the House) to a G.O.P. that then moved steadily to the right in its determination to cut government spending and rip down the New Deal safety net. Two years after this Democratic wipeout, despite a hostile press and a grievously divided party, Truman roared back, in part by daring the Republican Congress to enact its reactionary plans. He won against all odds, as David McCullough writes in ''Truman,'' because ''there was something in the American character that responded to a fighter.''
Surely there are dozens of supporters reassuring Obama with exactly this Truman scenario this weekend. But if he lacks the will to fight, he might as well just take his time and enjoy the sights of Mumbai.

HEADLINE: Bernanke Attempts to Soothe Doubters

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
JEKYLL ISLAND, Ga. -- Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, continued on Saturday to rebut critics who feared the central bank's latest bid to stimulate the economy could trigger dangerous inflation down the line and antagonize other countries by weakening the dollar.
Mr. Bernanke said the Fed's decision on Wednesday to pump $600 billion into the economy by mid-2011 was a response to the rate of inflation being too low and an attempt to mitigate high unemployment, though he suggested that the first problem was easier to fix than the second. 
''We're not in the business of trying to create inflation,'' he said at a conference here, speaking on a panel with his predecessor, Alan Greenspan. ''Our purpose is to provide some additional stimulus to help the economy recover and to avoid, potentially, additional disinflation.''
Not everyone at the conference, organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and Rutgers University, agreed.
E. Gerald Corrigan, a former president of the New York Fed who also spoke on the panel with Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Greenspan, said he felt ''uneasiness'' about the latest decision.
''Inflation is, by its nature, a cumulative and self-reinforcing process,'' Mr. Corrigan, now at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a paper accompanying his remarks. ''Thus there is a risk, however small, that once that nudge takes hold, it may not be easy to cap inflation and inflationary expectations at levels that are still broadly compatible with price stability.''
Mr. Bernanke said he was ''very sympathetic'' to that concern, which tends to be held by Fed veterans whose formative experience was the Fed's painful but successful battle against inflation from 1979 to 1982. But he also revealed a certain frustration at the sharp response to the Fed's decision to renew a strategy, known as quantitative easing, that involves buying Treasury securities to lower long-term interest rates.
The strategy is unconventional, but the Fed's usual tool to stimulate the economy, lowering short-term rates, is no longer available because the Fed already lowered those rates to nearly zero in December 2008.
''There's a sense out there that, quote, quantitative easing, or asset purchases, is some completely foreign, new, strange kind of thing, we have no idea what the hell is going to happen, and it's an unanticipated and unpredictable policy,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''Quite the contrary: this is just monetary policy. Monetary policy involves the swapping of assets -- essentially, the acquisition of Treasuries and swapping those for other kinds of assets.''
Mr. Bernanke said that the new approach ''will work, or not work, in much the same way that monetary policy -- ordinary, more conventional, familiar monetary policy -- will work'' and that there was ''not as much discontinuity as people think.''
The statement seemed directed both at inflation-fearing critics and overseas critics -- from Germany and Brazil -- who say the central bank is effectively weakening the dollar.
The two-day conference was held at a time of significant uncertainty at the Fed, a point Mr. Corrigan underscored, writing that ''the policy dilemmas faced by the Fed today are more acute than at any point in the 40-plus years that I have been a participant in, or a close observer of, the monetary policy process.''
But the gathering was also intended to offer reassurance about the economy.
''The Federal Reserve is respected, and it's respected at a time when respect and trust in all our government institutions is all too rare,'' Paul A. Volcker, a former Fed chief who tamed inflation, said in taped remarks. ''It's that respect and that trust that at the end of the day is vital to the acceptance of its independence and to support for its policies.''
Mr. Greenspan's tenure at the Fed, which ended in 2006, was once celebrated but is now being reassessed in light of the financial crisis. Raghuram G. Rajan, the economist who moderated the discussion, asked Mr. Greenspan to appraise the idea of the ''Greenspan put,'' the notion that stocks and other assets soared to unsustainable levels because investors had believed that Mr. Greenspan would not allow the stock market to fall too sharply.
Some say Mr. Greenspan held rates low for too long, contributing to the housing bubble.
Mr. Greenspan rejected the notion that propping up the stock market had been his goal. ''We're responding to the economy -- not to the markets, not to interest rates,'' he said.

HEADLINE: What Springsteen Kept to Himself

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DeCURTIS

 BODY:
Colts Neck, N.J.
OVER the course of nearly four decades Bruce Springsteen has become such a reassuring figure that he once wearily noted that people seemed to think of him as Santa Claus, with New Jersey serving as the North Pole. The notion, then, of Mr. Springsteen leaping onto a conference table in a Midtown law office and screaming obscenities at a lawyer who was questioning him during a pretrial deposition hardly corresponds to his inspirational image.
But in the summer of 1976 Mr. Springsteen, who less than a year before had been on the covers of Time and Newsweek to mark the release of his album ''Born to Run,'' now a classic, had grown desperate that his career was being derailed. He and the man who had been his manager and producer had become embroiled in bitter lawsuits, and Mr. Springsteen's control of his life and work hung in the balance. 
The raw emotions of that period partly account for the continuing power of ''Darkness on the Edge of Town,'' the album Mr. Springsteen released in 1978, after the lawsuits had been settled. An elaborate three-CD, three-DVD boxed set, ''The Promise: The Darkness on the Edge of Town Story,'' scheduled for release on Nov. 16, tells the tale of how that album came to be. The collection includes a documentary on the making of the album, a two-CD set of previously unreleased tracks that will also be available separately, two additional DVDs of live material, and a remastered version of ''Darkness on the Edge of Town'' itself.
The dread and exultation woven through all that material reflects the contradictions of those times, as well as the twin poles of Mr. Springsteen's work since then.
''Those are our specialties,'' he said with a laugh, as he recalled that period. Wearing black jeans and a light-blue-plaid shirt open to the middle of his chest, with chains and medals hanging around his neck, Mr. Springsteen sat on a high stool in front of a fireplace in a 300-year-old cottage on his property in Colt's Neck, near Asbury Park. Mr. Springsteen, relishing the heat from the fire, would hunch over and look down when he was thinking and look straight ahead intently when he found his train of thought.
If the highly romantic ''Born to Run'' had been a final howl of adolescence for Mr. Springsteen, the 10 songs on ''Darkness'' marked his entry into the troubled, compromised, ambiguous world of adulthood. It was not an easy transition, as the 21 songs on ''The Promise,'' all of which Mr. Springsteen recorded while working on ''Darkness,'' make clear.
''I loved all of that music tremendously,'' he said about the dozens of songs he recorded while finding his way to the rigorously spare ''Darkness.'' ''It was in me, and I had to get it out. And I'm glad I did.
''It's filled with melody and the Brill Building and soul music and English pop music.''
At the time, however, Mr. Springsteen was concerned about being labeled a ''revivalist'' because of his love of those classic genres. ''I felt that would have been a diminishment of what my abilities might be,'' he said. Critics had viewed him as the savior of rock 'n' roll, but he was determined to carve out a future, not simply restore what the music had meant in the past.
''The only thing I was always nervous about was not living up to what my potential might be,'' he said. ''That frightened me the most. I didn't think I was the most gifted performer or singer. I felt like I was given a heavy dose of journeyman's talents, and that if I worked those things with everything I had, they could coalesce into something that was specifically mine.''
Mr. Springsteen, who was in his late 20s, had just begun to define his vision with ''Born to Run,'' and he wanted to make sure his next step extended his creative reach. ''I was chasing my own voice, and I was also concerned with adulthood,'' he said. ''In 1977 the ceiling on the age for rock musicians wasn't 70 years old, as it is today. It was about 33.
''Plus, I was becoming interested in music that dealt with the pressures of the adult world: work, family entanglements, social forces arrayed for or against you.''
Mr. Springsteen hit that target hard on ''Darkness.'' Songs like ''Factory'' and ''Racing in the Street'' portray the lives of the working-class people he had grown up with in stark, existential terms. The choices available are a grim descent into numbness or exultant, if potentially destructive, sensation seeking:
Some guys they just give up living
And start dying little by little, piece by piece,
Some guys come home from work and wash up,
And go racin' in the street.
It was a worldview that was coming into focus in the 70s, a time of gas lines, narrowing economic horizons and what President Jimmy Carter characterized as a national ''malaise.'' The director Martin Scorsese and actors like Robert De Niro and Al Pacino (whom Mr. Springsteen strongly resembles in the cover portrait for ''Darkness'') portrayed blue-collar lives with force and dignity in the movies.
Mr. Springsteen created an album very much in tune with those cultural currents, but he paid a price in the many worthwhile songs he set aside in order to do that. ''The Promise,'' a song that had become a favorite of Mr. Springsteen's fans in performance, lost its place on the album, Mr. Springsteen said, because he believed it to be too autobiographical, too tied to his legal troubles and therefore too narrow in its focus. ''I don't write songs about lawsuits,'' he had snapped at the time, but, at least in part, he had, and that was the song's demise. It has now been restored to prominence.
''It was a song about defeat, and it was self-referential, which made me uncomfortable,'' Mr. Springsteen said about ''The Promise.'' ''I didn't want it to overtake the album, which, in the end, was not my personal story. I wanted 'Darkness' to be completely independent of that. So I left it off. But I remember saying to myself, 'This is something I can sing later.' The distance really helps it now.''
Jon Landau, who is Mr. Springsteen's manager and who co-produced ''Darkness on the Edge of Town,'' describes another critical decision Mr. Springsteen made in selecting the songs for ''Darkness'': ''The album had no hits. The songs that were pretty obviously going to be pop hits, 'Fire,' 'Because the Night,' '' songs that Mr. Springsteen gave to the Pointer Sisters and Patti Smith. ''Bruce took them off at a very early stage. He did not want what he was trying to do with the album to be overshadowed.''
Mr. Springsteen's versions of those songs are now on ''The Promise,'' which in both Mr. Springsteen's and Mr. Landau's view stands as a coherent work, not simply a collection of outtakes. ''We organized, sequenced and finished these 21 songs as an album,'' Mr. Landau said. ''It is the album that might well have come during that three-year time between 'Born to Run' and 'Darkness.' ''
As difficult as the years leading up to ''Darkness on the Edge of Town'' were for Mr. Springsteen, the story has a happy ending. He and Mr. Landau solidified their working relationship, and collaborate to this day. With the lawsuit long ago settled, Mr. Springsteen has reconciled with his former manager, Mike Appel, and they are friends once again. Much of the work that Mr. Springsteen cast aside to hone his vision for ''Darkness'' is seeing the light of day.
And, most important, ''Darkness on the Edge of Town'' itself is now regarded as a classic, a breakthrough into a world that, as Mr. Springsteen hoped, is specifically his own. ''I went back to where I was from, and I looked into that world and those lives, which I understood was only tangentially going to be my life from there on in,'' he said, as the fire behind him burned. ''But if I was dedicated to it, and if I thought hard enough about it, and if I put in my time, I could tell those stories well. And that's what I did.''

HEADLINE: Now Appearing

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When the hip-hop star Kanye West says he can ''connect with'' George W. Bush, perhaps it is time to think about whether America has begun to reconsider its 43rd president.
It was Mr. West, after all, who delivered one of the harshest attacks on Mr. Bush during his eight years in office. When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005, Mr. West memorably charged that ''George Bush doesn't care about black people.''
After learning last week that Mr. Bush considered that the lowest moment of his presidency, Mr. West went on a Houston radio station to take it back. Noting that he too was accused of bigotry for interrupting Taylor Swift during an MTV awards ceremony last year, Mr. West said he now sympathizes with how his criticism stung Mr. Bush. ''I really more connect with him just on a humanitarian level,'' Mr. West said. 
Whether the rest of the country is ready to connect with Mr. Bush again remains to be seen, but after nearly two years of silence, he is emerging from self-imposed exile to forcefully defend his record and begin the process of defining his legacy at a moment when his successor is on the ropes. As he releases his new memoir, hits the television circuit and prepares to break ground on his presidential center, Mr. Bush finds himself in an evolving place in American society.
Most Americans still do not view him favorably and a good portion still revile him for invading Iraq, waterboarding terror suspects and presiding over the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. He is still a punchline, to many a failed president, the source of today's economic and foreign policy troubles. And yet, with Mr. Obama increasingly unpopular and ''Miss Me Yet?'' T-shirts for sale at Washington's Union Station a short walk from the Capitol, some polls suggest a slight softening of views. Mr. Obama's blame-Bush strategy did not stop voters last week from returning Republicans to power in the House and handing them more seats in the Senate.
''The statute of limitations of attacking President Bush has passed,'' said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader. ''They spent a lot of time attacking President Bush, and they got unelected.''
Still, the newly elected Republicans are dancing gingerly around Mr. Bush as he returns to the public stage. In a way, they are borrowing from President Bill Clinton and ''triangulating'' not only away from Mr. Obama but also from Mr. Bush. Many Republican candidates, particularly those with Tea Party roots, ran against the former president's spending policies and Wall Street bailout. In his election night victory speech, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the presumed new House speaker, vowed ''to take a new approach that hasn't been tried before in Washington by either party.''
Jim Dyke, a Republican political consultant, said public attitudes toward Mr. Bush have begun to shift but at the same time, the new Congressional leaders need to carve their own path. ''They're wise to be independent and define themselves in a way that is more current and more relative to today's environment,'' he said.
''Given the great issues facing the nation at home and abroad,'' added John Weaver, a political strategist who worked for Senator John McCain in his 2000 nomination battle with Mr. Bush, ''there isn't an appetite by the public in looking in the rear-view mirror.''
But Democrats hope Mr. Bush's new high profile will help them frame the emerging Republican generation. Mark Mellman, a Democratic strategist, called Mr. Bush's public tour ''great news for Democrats.'' He added: ''The G.O.P. was lucky he was out of sight and out of mind through Tuesday. His reemergence on the national stage will reinforce voters' already negative views of the G.O.P.''
With rare exception, like helping out with Haiti earthquake relief at Mr. Obama's request, Mr. Bush has remained out of sight since leaving office, determined not to complicate his successor's life with running commentary about current affairs. Even as he begins to promote his new book, ''Decision Points,'' to be published by Crown on Tuesday, he is avoiding any involvement in the political debate now consuming the country.
In the book, a copy of which was obtained last week by The New York Times, he has nothing but gracious things to say about Mr. Obama and makes little mention of his policy choices other than to praise him for sending more troops to Afghanistan. When Oprah Winfrey tried to get him to weigh in on Sarah Palin's presidential chances in an interview to be aired later this week, Mr. Bush demurred. ''You're asking me to wade back into the swamp,'' he said.
Until now, Mr. Bush has focused on writing the book, along with his ghostwriter and former White House speechwriter, Christopher Michel, as well as giving paid speeches, raising money for his presidential center and designing his public policy institute. After this week's spurt of interviews with Ms. Winfrey, Matt Lauer and Candy Crowley, he will host a Nov. 16 groundbreaking ceremony for the George W. Bush Presidential Center at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.
He says he is using the institute to influence policy in his own way. ''He doesn't want to be in the current debate, certainly not the political debate,'' said James K. Glassman, executive director of the institute. ''He wants to be involved in policy in a big way, but with projects that are very forward looking and long term.''
So will Mr. Bush's reputation improve with time? Many presidents are viewed more generously in later eras, like Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Even Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon have experienced moments of reassessment, their failures in Vietnam and Watergate tempered by appreciation for the opening to China or the Great Society. Still, their disappointments seem indelibly marked in the history books.
A Gallup poll in July found that 45 percent of Americans viewed Mr. Bush favorably, still lower than either Mr. Obama or Mr. Clinton but better than the 34 percent who approved of him when he left office in January 2009. At the same time, when voters were asked in exit polls last Tuesday who was most to blame for current economic woes, they mentioned Mr. Bush along with Wall Street and Mr. Obama.
Mr. Bush has said for years that he imagines history will ultimately appreciate his presidency, crediting him with confronting international terrorism and protecting the country from further attack after Sept. 11, 2001, while promoting freedom abroad and perhaps, if Iraq eventually improves, transplanting the idea of democracy to a once-hostile region. In his book, he recalls that as president he eulogized both Reagan and Gerald R. Ford, noting that both were remembered more warmly by the time they died, and expresses hope that he will be too.
Maybe he will, or maybe that is wishful thinking. In any case, one memoir and a few television interviews by themselves will not be enough to determine the eventual outcome.
''Whatever the verdict on my presidency, I'm comfortable with the fact that I won't be around to hear it,'' he writes. ''That's a decision point only history will reach.''

HEADLINE: Myanmar Votes in Election Controlled by Military

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES; Seth Mydans contributed reporting from Bangkok.

 BODY:
YANGON, Myanmar -- Polling places appeared nearly empty around Yangon on Sunday as the rest of the city went about its business in the first election in this closed and tightly controlled nation in 20 years.
The process was expected to cement military rule behind a civilian facade but also to open the door slightly to possible shifts in the dynamics of power.
''It was an empty room,'' said one voter who emerged from a polling place where he said he had spoiled his ballot in protest, here in the country's commercial capital. 
Though the Constitution guarantees the military a leading role in the state apparatus, this will be the first civilian government in the former Burma since a military coup in 1962. With votes being tabulated locally, it was not known if results would be announced Sunday or later.
The appearance of electoral legitimacy and civilian institutions may make it easier for Myanmar's neighbors to embrace what has been a pariah, but it was unlikely by itself to ease a policy of isolation and economic sanctions among Western nations.
''You look at Burma holding flawed elections today that once again expose the abuses of the military junta,'' said Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, speaking in Melbourne, Australia, on Sunday. ''It's heartbreaking because the people of Burma deserve so much better.''
Voters were electing a 665-member, two-chamber national Parliament and 14 regional Parliaments. A total of 25 percent of those seats will be reserved for the military, and several senior military officials have resigned to run as civilians. Military officers are to head the key Ministries of Interior, Defense and Border Affairs, and the commander in chief of the armed forces will have power to take control of the country in times of emergency.
Thirty-seven parties were on the ballot, but the military appeared to have taken pains to assure the victory of parties it supports by severely restricting campaigns, setting high fees for candidacy, censoring political statements, controlling the media, excluding voters in unstable ethnic minority areas and barring outside election monitors. Hundreds of the strongest potential opposition candidates were in prison or under house arrest.
Each candidate was given 15 minutes on national television, but the censored, pretaped speeches had the feel of confessions at a Stalinist show trial.
Speaking in Bangkok on Thursday, Britain's ambassador to Myanmar, Andrew Heyn, said, ''These elections are going to be neither free, nor fair, nor inclusive. There is nothing in these elections themselves that could give us grounds for optimism.''
Kurt M. Campbell, the United States' assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs, said in Washington in September that it appeared the vote would lack international legitimacy, but that it might create ''new players, new power relationships, new structures inside the country'' that would bear watching.
The military appeared to be trying to avoid the pitfalls of the last election, in 1990, which it annulled after the party it backed was trounced by a democratic opposition led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.
In what could be the first sign of a backup plan if this election also did not go the military's way, Myanmar's state media, which has been urging people to vote, warned of the possibility of the election's being ''aborted,'' in which case, it said, ''the ruling government will have no choice but to keep taking state responsibilities until it holds another election.''
Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, now 65, has been held under house arrest for most of the time since the past election.
Her latest term of detention ends one week after the election, and the junta has hinted that she could be released. It has often made similar hints in the past, and there was no way to know what restrictions might be imposed if she is set free.
Her party chose not to take part in what it called a sham election and was therefore forced to disband.
Sunday's elections are the first for a large share of voters. Anyone 37 or younger was not eligible to vote two decades ago. With half of the population of Myanmar 26 or younger, many voters seemed puzzled by how the process actually worked. Newspapers have run articles giving step-by-step instructions to voters, and many residents of Yangon have received fliers from candidates or seen the sparse collection of election posters.
But in smaller towns and villages, where the vast majority of Myanmar's estimated 53 million people live, some people anticipated confusion at the polls. A restaurant owner in Bago, the former royal capital 42 miles north of Yangon, said his staff of about dozen workers did not fully understand voting procedures. ''I told them you have to tick a box and that's it,'' the owner said.
Some voters said they were afraid to go to polling stations because they were intimidated by election officials and assumed that their names and choices would be recorded, he said. The election has also engendered more general fears of unrest among some families, with households hoarding rice and other staples, the restaurant owner said.
But half an hour from Bago, amid the golden stalks of rice paddies ready for harvest, a family of farmers said they understood the system well after daily broadcasts on state radio instructing them on how to vote. The father knew the voting hours and how many candidates were running. Concerns about the overall fairness of the elections were widespread. Phone Win, an independent candidate running for a parliamentary seat in Yangon, said a major unknown in the election was the number of people, especially civil servants or police and military, who took part in advance voting.
The actual vote counting was to be done with representatives of each candidate present, but pre-voting takes place out of sight of election officials, Mr. Phone Win said.
He added that many people might stay away from the polls for a familiar reason in Myanmar. ''People are afraid,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Obama Casts Asian Trip As an Economic Mission

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
MUMBAI, India -- President Obama, fresh off a stinging electoral defeat for Democrats, opened a 10-day tour of Asia on Saturday with a courtship of corporate America, including private meetings with American business executives who are here for his visit and an announcement that he will lift longstanding restrictions on exports of closely held technologies to India.
After an election season dominated by voter dissatisfaction with his management of the economy, the president is casting the four-nation trip, which will also take him to Indonesia, South Korea and Japan, as an economic mission. His agenda is heavy on taking steps to open foreign markets to American goods; he hopes to come home from South Korea, for instance, with a renegotiated free trade pact.
Here in Mumbai, Mr. Obama lavished attention on American business leaders who coordinated their visit with the White House. He announced that, as part of the trip, American and Indian companies signed or are about to sign 20 deals worth about $10 billion that will help create more than 50,000 jobs at home, although many of the deals have been in negotiations for some time and some have yet to be completed despite 11th-hour negotiations before his trip. 
In addition, the easing of the so-called ''dual use'' restrictions, which bar American export of technologies that might be used to build weapons, represents a policy change that is a high priority for companies here and in the United States.
''As we look to India today, the United States sees an opportunity to sell our exports in one of the fastest-growing markets in the world,'' Mr. Obama told a gathering of political leaders and Indian and American executives. ''For America, this is a jobs strategy.''
Accompanied by his wife, Michelle, Mr. Obama began his day here on a somber note, paying homage to victims and survivors of the 2008 terrorist siege in Mumbai carried out by Pakistani militants. But the president failed to mention the terror threat to India that emanates from Pakistan -- an omission that drew some criticism in the media here. He also made a brief stop at the home, now a museum, where Mahatma Gandhi stayed while fighting for his country's independence.
But such symbolic acts quickly gave way to Mr. Obama's diplomatic and business agenda, aimed at strengthening ties between the two nations at a time in which China is more aggressively pursuing power in the region.
India has operated under the high-tech export barriers since its nuclear test in 1998, and has long sought a loosening of the export restrictions more for political reasons than economic ones -- the country does not want to be viewed as a rogue state.
Indians have argued the restrictions became outdated when they signed a groundbreaking civil nuclear cooperation deal with the United States when President George W. Bush was in office. That deal ended a long moratorium on providing India with the fuel and technology for desperately needed nuclear power plants.
Mr. Obama is also taking Indian defense research and space agencies off the United States' ''entities list,'' clearing the way for greater cooperation. Executives here welcomed the moves.
''It is a signal, No. 1, about India as an ally, and No. 2, it has a business potential,'' Anand Mahindra, managing director of the Indian conglomerate Mahindra & Mahindra, said in an interview. ''Both of these are important.''
Still, Mr. Obama seemed mostly to be aiming his message at American business leaders. Many executives during the recent political campaign accused the White House of being antibusiness and poured money into the coffers of Republican candidates and groups that aimed to defeat the Democrats.
More than 200 American executives timed a business conference here to coincide with Mr. Obama's arrival in Mumbai -- and the president worked hard to reciprocate.
The chief executive officer of Boeing, Jim McNerney, who also leads the President's Export Council, greeted Mr. Obama when Air Force One touched down, and then was whisked downtown aboard the presidential helicopter. Later, Mr. Obama met privately with American chief executives, among them Jeffrey R. Immelt of General Electric, who has been critical of the White House in the past.
''It's unprecedented,'' Mr. Immelt said in an interview, praising Mr. Obama for talking up trade, a politically risky move for a Democrat. ''I don't remember President Bush ever having a mission like this. I think it's quite rare and I hope the first of many.''
Mr. Obama decided early on that his predecessor had not paid enough attention to Asia, and it is no coincidence that the four countries Mr. Obama is visiting are all democracies. It is also no coincidence that China is not on the agenda; by building ties with emerging economies, like India and Indonesia, and strengthening them with longtime allies like South Korea and Japan, the administration hopes to dilute China's growing power in the region.
India's economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of more than 8 percent through 2015, and with a population of 1.2 billion, the White House views it as a prime market for American goods.
''The United States sees Asia and especially India as a market of the future,'' the president said in a speech to the U.S.-India Business Council. ''We don't simply welcome your rise as a nation and people, we ardently support it. We want to invest in it.''
In the afternoon, Mr. Obama met with a group of 25 Indian executives, including entrepreneurs who are working on startup companies involved in electric cars and water purifying companies. Mr. Obama told the group that he wanted to hear from them about new ideas that could help create jobs in the United States and emerging markets like India, said Shaffi Mather, a young Indian businessman who attended the meeting.
''He spoke in the background of the electoral pressures,'' Mr. Mather said, ''but he still clearly set the goal of economic growth not only of the U.S. but also of India.''
India is a politically delicate place for Mr. Obama to talk about jobs, given American concerns about outsourcing. As a candidate, Mr. Obama often lamented the tax incentives and lack of educational opportunities in the United States that, as he liked to say, forced children from Boston to compete for jobs with children from Bangalore. Here in Mumbai, he steered clear of the Boston-Bangalore analogy, as he made the case that investment overseas can create jobs at home.
''There still exists a caricature of India as a land of call centers and back offices that cost American jobs,'' Mr. Obama said. ''That's a real perception. But these old stereotypes, these old concerns ignore today's reality: In 2010, trade between our countries is not just a one-way street of American jobs and companies moving to India. It is a dynamic, two-way relationship that is creating jobs, growth, and higher living standards in both our countries.''
Mr. Obama is spending an unusually long time -- three days -- in India, the longest amount of time he has spent in any foreign country as president.
Soon after Air Force One touched down early Saturday afternoon, he and the first lady headed to the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel, which bore the brunt of the terror attacks on Nov. 26, 2008.
The president and his entourage are staying at the hotel, which is home to a memorial for the more than 160 people killed during the highly coordinated attacks over four days.
''To those who have asked whether this is intended to send a message, my answer is, simply, absolutely,'' Mr. Obama said, after he and Mrs. Obama signed a guest book at the memorial and met briefly with victims of the attacks. ''Ever since those horrific days two years ago, The Taj has been the symbol of the strength and resilience of the Indian people. So we use our visit here to send a very clear message that in our determination to give our people a future of security and prosperity, the United States and India stand united.''
Mr. Obama expressed similar sentiments in the guest book, writing that the United States ''stands in solidarity with all of Mumbai and all of India in working to eradicate the scourge of terrorism, and we affirm our lasting friendship with the Indian people.''
He signed his name and the date; Mrs. Obama signed her name next to his. Each left behind a white rose.

HEADLINE: Alaska Writes a Senator Back Into Contention

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
ANCHORAGE -- Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska played many novel roles in her historic run as a write-in candidate. She was the insurgent incumbent, the maverick moderate, the outsider from the establishment, the underdog boasting about her seniority.
Yet over and over again, she also returned to what might seem the most unimaginative of political platitudes: the local rallying cry.
''This,'' she would tell supporters, freighting her voice with meaning, ''is about Alaska!''
Trite proved true. Write-in votes, which will be manually counted next week in Juneau, were well ahead after initial tallying, but legal challenges are looming. Still, while many candidates across the country rode to victory on voter anger at the direction of the nation, a crucial reason Ms. Murkowski, a Republican, is given a strong chance of prevailing is that she appealed so effectively to Alaska's distinctive sense of identity -- and to its particular anxieties. 
''We need seniority,'' said Mark Saugstad, a Republican from Girdwood, referring to Ms. Murkowski's eight years in the Senate. ''It's extremely important to this state economically, and I think Miller's a super wild card.''
Joe Miller, the Republican nominee, promoted a conservative utopia in the Last Frontier, an autonomous Alaska that could drill and mine and log at will without fear of federal meddling. But he did not stop there. He framed the image within a broader crusade against the federal government: privatize Social Security, eliminate the Department of Education, slash taxes and spending, end earmarks.
''It is Alaska's destiny,'' Mr. Miller told supporters at a final rally before the election, ''to lead this nation into the future.''
But while Mr. Miller was arguing states' rights, Ms. Murkowski, who would be the first write-in candidate elected to the Senate since 1954, was talking about the state's reality.
For all the populist anger and legal wrangling in Alaska over federal oversight of its natural resources and protected species, from offshore oil to polar bears, many Alaskans long ago made a pragmatic peace with the arrangement, and they worry what will happen if things change significantly. A third of the state economy depends on federal spending. Many rural villages lack basic plumbing. Only a fraction of Alaska is reachable by road.
''To hell with politics,'' Ms. Murkowski would tell crowds. ''Let's do what's right for Alaska.''
It was a clever call to arms. She was invoking and directly quoting former Senator Ted Stevens, known as Uncle Ted, who died in August, her mentor and a figure revered for bringing home billions of dollars in federal money. Yet she was also tapping provincial pride, a rich vein here, and shifting the debate away from the national concerns that Mr. Miller and others across the country peddled so effectively. She was selling stability.
''We were never shy in pointing out the case that we wanted to continue the legacy of Senator Stevens,'' said Kevin Sweeney, who managed Ms. Murkowski's write-in campaign.
If Ms. Murkowski prevails in the race, she will pull off a political feat not seen since Eisenhower was in the White House. The last person elected to the Senate as a write-in candidate was Strom Thurmond of South Carolina in 1954.
She will also embarrass Sarah Palin, whose endorsement of Mr. Miller pushed him to prominence. While Ms. Palin has often wrapped herself in Alaska's rugged independence, Ms. Murkowski engages with the state's more practical concerns, and her apparent success proves how effective that can be.
Politicians and strategists say if she prevails it will be because, after losing the primary, she returned to campaign tirelessly and creatively. That meant leading crowds at campaign rallies in spelling aloud her name, singing voter instructions -- ''fill in the oval, write it on the line'' -- as she once did in Fairbanks, and investing time courting Alaska Natives, whose support proved crucial on Election Day.
In the end, she was fortunate, too, in her opponents. One was a little-known Democrat in a conservative state. The other was a Tea Party favorite whose appeal proved limited.
Mr. Miller narrowly won the Republican primary, receiving 56,000 votes, and he was never able to significantly expand his support. With about 80 percent of all ballots having been counted so far in the general election, he has received 70,000 votes. Votes that contained a write-in candidate tallied 83,000 or 41 percent. Scott McAdams, a Democrat, has 48,000 votes.
''When he got into the general and the lights got a little brighter, people were saying, 'Wait a minute, is this really going to work?' '' Andrew Halcro, a political consultant and a supporter of Ms. Murkowski, said of Mr. Miller.
''And he didn't just have one October surprise,'' Mr. Halcro added. ''He had a whole wardrobe of October surprises.''
Ms. Murkowski clearly benefited from Mr. Miller's many stumbles in the final weeks, from revelations that he had been disciplined in a previous job for using government computers for political purposes, and then lying about it, to the day his security guards handcuffed a reporter who asked about the matter.
Mr. Miller was smart and articulate and had an impressive resume -- Yale Law School, West Point, a Bronze Star in the Persian Gulf war -- but he exuded edginess, and not always the appealing form.
Asked in a debate to name a common misconception about him in the campaign, Mr. Miller responded, ''That I'm mean.''
Wariness of Mr. Miller extended beyond Alaska. Even after top Senate Republicans in Washington had embraced him, the party's full conference rejected an attempt during the campaign to remove Ms. Murkowski as the ranking member on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. That proved critical for her seniority argument during the campaign.
After running a lackluster primary campaign, she aggressively pursued important constituencies. The Alaska Federation of Natives endorsed her, and Native corporations, which have benefited from controversial no-bid federal contracts supported by Ms. Murkowski, spent more than $1 million on her campaign. She also met with Democratic groups whose support she needed.
The final result is far from certain. More than 40,000 absentee and questioned ballots remain to be counted and write-in ballots must be manually read to determine the name written on them. Senate Republicans are raising money for Mr. Miller's potential legal challenges. Even if she wins, Ms. Murkowski may find it challenging to serve her new supporters, including Democrats, environmentalists and wary Republicans, who might have cast a reluctant ballot on her behalf. And she would also represent the 59 percent of voters who chose someone else.
''It's going to be incumbent on me to make sure that we take this message from this election and continue it through my tenure in the United States Senate,'' Ms. Murkowski said the day after the election. ''It cannot be just kind of business as usual, and I'm looking forward to that.''

HEADLINE: A Gandhi Fan, Obama Faces A New India

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- Not long after Barack Obama was elected president, the United States Embassy in India printed a postcard showing him sitting in his old Senate office beneath framed photographs of his political heroes: the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Abraham Lincoln and the great Indian apostle of peace, democracy and nonviolent protest, Mohandas K. Gandhi.
The postcard was a trinket of public diplomacy, a souvenir of the new president's affinity for India. Now that Mr. Obama is visiting India for the first time, on a trip pitched as a jobs mission, his fascination with Gandhi is influencing his itinerary and his message as he tries to win over India's skeptical political class.
''He is a hero not just to India, but to the world,'' the president wrote in a guest book on Saturday in Gandhi's modest former home in Mumbai, now the Mani Bhavan museum. 
Yet if paying homage to Gandhi is expected of visiting dignitaries, Mr. Obama's more personal identification with the Gandhian legacy -- the president once named him the person he would most like to dine with -- places him on complicated terrain.
Gandhi remains India's patriarch, the founding father whose face is printed on the currency, but modern India is hardly a Gandhian nation, if it ever was one. His vision of a village-dominated economy was shunted aside during his lifetime as rural romanticism, and his call for a national ethos of personal austerity and nonviolence has proved antithetical to the goals of an aspiring economic and military power.
If anything, India's rise as a global power seems likely to distance it even further from Gandhi. India is inching toward a tighter military relationship with the United States, once distrusted as an imperialist power, even as the Americans are fighting a war in nearby Afghanistan.
India also has an urbanizing consumer-driven economy and a growing middle class that indulges itself in cars, apartments and other goods. It is this economic progress that underpins India's rising geopolitical clout and its attractiveness to the United States as a global partner.
Gandhi is still revered here, and credited with shaping India's political identity as a tolerant, secular democracy. But he can sometimes seem to hover over modern India like a parent whose expectations are rarely met.
Mr. Obama, too, has experienced the clash of those lofty expectations with political realities. When he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize, even as he was conducting two wars, he described himself as ''living testimony to the moral force'' of the nonviolent movement embodied by Dr. King and Gandhi.
''But as a head of state sworn to protect and defend my nation,'' he continued, ''I cannot be guided by their examples alone.''
That paradox was on vivid display on Saturday when Mr. Obama arrived in Mumbai, an event carried live on national television, celebrating Gandhi's legacy but also selling military transport planes and bringing along 200 American business leaders.
India's political establishment, if thrilled by the visit, is also withholding judgment. Mr. Obama was faulted in New Delhi for some early missteps, including his comment that China should play an active role in South Asia. His battering in the midterm elections has raised concerns about his political viability. And many Indian officials still hold a torch for former President George W. Bush, who was popular for pushing through a landmark civilian nuclear deal between the two countries.
Mr. Obama's visit is intended to dispel those doubts and deepen a partnership rooted in shared democratic values. Since taking office, he has already met several times with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, as well as with other delegations of Indian officials. On several occasions, he has cited his deep admiration for Gandhi, perhaps as evidence of his fondness for India.
''The impression on the Indian side is every time you meet him, he talks about Gandhi,'' said Shekhar Gupta, editor of The Indian Express, a leading English-language newspaper, adding that the repeated references struck some officials as platitudinous.
In praising Gandhi, Mr. Obama has often cited the influence of Gandhi's civil disobedience campaigns on the civil rights movement in the United States. Dr. King visited India in 1959, more than a decade after Gandhi's death, seeking to draw from the taproot of his moral power, in a trip publicized in India and the United States.
''The trip for King was very much about laying claim to the Gandhian legacy,'' said Nico Slate, a historian at Carnegie Mellon University who has researched the linkage between the two men.
Unlike Mr. Obama, Dr. King and Gandhi had the advantage of never having to govern. And even Dr. King learned the limits of Gandhi's influence in an India confronted with the realities of global politics. When he was invited to make an address on Indian radio, Dr. King condemned the cold war arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union, suggesting that India should set a higher, Gandhian standard by demilitarizing. Indian officials quickly rejected the idea.
''It was very Gandhian, but in many ways very unrealistic, at least from the vantage point of the Indian establishment,'' Mr. Slate said. ''Even King came to realize that India, in some ways, was never Gandhian.''
Dr. King also visited Gandhi's home in Mumbai and, like Mr. Obama, signed the guest book. ''Pretty cool,'' Mr. Obama said Saturday when a museum administrator showed him Dr. King's entry. ''Nineteen-fifty-nine. What a great book.''
On Sunday, Mr. Obama will fly to New Delhi and, like Dr. King, visit the Rajghat, the black marble memorial on the spot where Gandhi was cremated after his assassination in 1948. Today, the Rajghat attracts about 10,000 visitors a day and is a requisite stop for visiting foreign leaders, regardless of political ideology: Mr. Bush and former President Bill Clinton have visited. So has the Dalai Lama. But so has the Russian prime minister, Vladimir V. Putin; the president of authoritarian China, Hu Jintao; and, more recently, Senior Gen. Than Shwe, the leader of the ruling military junta in Myanmar.
Ramachandra Guha, a Gandhi biographer, said Indian officials approached him three months ago seeking suggestions for Gandhi-related sites for Mr. Obama's visit. Mr. Guha recommended an ashram in rural central India where Gandhi once lived, a suggestion rejected because of concerns over security and distance, he said.
To Gopalkrishna Gandhi, a grandson of Gandhi, the fact that his grandfather inspired the American president demonstrated the continued vibrancy of Gandhi's message. If he bemoaned the corruption and money contaminating Indian politics, he said Gandhi's spirit could still be found among the Indian civil society groups helping the poor and protecting the environment.
''Today, the need for a practical idealism is recognized throughout the world,'' he said.
The word practical seemed especially relevant.

HEADLINE: South Korea Is a Start

 BODY:
With protectionist policies gaining dangerous traction everywhere, the global economy needs a strong champion of free trade. After neglecting the issue, President Obama has now committed to winning approval of a free-trade pact with South Korea that was signed by the Bush administration in 2007 but never voted on in Congress because of staunch Democratic opposition. 
The White House is hoping to renegotiate several aspects in time for Mr. Obama's trip to Seoul this week, with a goal of presenting a new deal to Congress early next year. The president must not stop there. Trade deals with Colombia and Panama have also languished without Congressional action. And he must press to revive stalled global trade negotiations.
All three bilateral agreements would bolster relations with important allies. And American exporters should be concerned that while Washington dawdles, other countries are going ahead with their own trade deals. South Korea and the European Union have an agreement, as do Colombia and Canada.
Getting these trade deals through Congress won't be easy, although Mr. Obama may find new allies in the Republican-controlled House. American trade unions, an important Democratic constituency, are decidedly unenthusiastic. When it comes to South Korea, American carmakers and ranchers are demanding that the White House win broader market access for them.
The South Korean government has its own political problems. In 2008, huge street protests against imports of American beef nearly toppled the government. Mr. Obama should still press -- within reason.
Seoul can certainly commit to more transparency in setting pollution and fuel economy rules -- allowing American automakers to have a voice in the process. It needs to specify how it will bring its sanitary regulations on imported beef into line with international norms.
Mr. Obama also needs to make clear to lawmakers, especially those in his own party, that this agreement is essential to cementing relations with a strategic partner and one of Asia's most dynamic economies. Automakers and beef producers could lose a lot if this deal goes sour.
The symbolic value of these agreements is also important. Global trade is recovering from its 2009 collapse. And so far there have been no full-out trade wars. But protectionism -- trade barriers, but mostly high and unfair export subsidies -- is on the rise. In Washington, members of Congress are itching to punish China for its currency manipulation. A weakening dollar is sparking protectionist sentiment in many other countries.
The United States, which once carried the mantle for open trade, not only needs to avoid trade brawls. It also must stand up to protectionist pressures around the world and make the case that for the world economy to recover, it needs an open trading system.

HEADLINE: The Economic Mess: Which Way Out?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Mugged by the Moralizers'' (column, Nov. 1):
I'm not an economist, but it doesn't take one to understand the logic of Paul Krugman's prescription for economic recovery. And like him, I'm frustrated that no one, from the ''moralizers'' in the Tea Party movement to the Democratic Party and the Obama administration, seems to be listening.
Yet Mr. Krugman writes on, month after month, trying to explain the obvious: that governmental belt-tightening -- the failure to spend more on meaningful stimulus programs and infrastructure projects -- is precisely the wrong thing to do at a time when there is widespread unemployment, a mountain of private debt and a mortgage foreclosure crisis. 
Some conservatives are pushing their agenda out of a misguided desire to punish debtors for borrowing more than they could afford, others out of an equally misguided belief that large-scale government spending is inherently bad for the country.
The failure of our elected officials to pursue a more sensible course reflects nothing more than ignorance or cowardice -- fear of political fallout during an election year and of being labeled ''liberal'' or ''socialist.''
True patriotic Americans don't want to punish those less fortunate than themselves; they want to build up every citizen to make this country healthy and strong.
Ellen Schwartz El Cerrito, Calif., Nov. 1, 2010
To the Editor:
Paul Krugman correctly notes that one person's debt is another person's asset. He then proceeds to advocate widespread debt relief and deficit spending. But the corollary to one person's debt being another person's asset is that one person's debt relief is another person's asset confiscation.
The ''moralizers'' may not be so much upset at rewarding people who lived beyond their means as much as they are afraid that the reward will come at their expense.
Because it's not only the ''big bad banks'' that will be harmed by Mr. Krugman's proposed solutions, but also depositors (including retirees living on fixed incomes) who will suffer from bank failures, inflation and other adverse effects of widespread debt relief and deficit spending.
Zev M. Bomrind Brooklyn, Nov. 1, 2010
To the Editor:
Yves Smith (''How the Banks Put the Economy Underwater,'' Op-Ed, Oct. 31) gets it exactly right. The entire process of mortgage origination during the last decade was a mess caused by a blind rush for profit.
From shoddy underwriting to faulty documentation to outright fraud in pursuit of defaulting borrowers, the mortgage finance industry has dragged down millions of borrowers, and much of the global economy.
Now millions of mortgages are in foreclosure, seriously delinquent or significantly in excess of the value of the underlying home (''underwater'').
There is a painful process to bring the debt in line with the assets. Aside from its moral culpability, there are practical reasons to assign this cost to the banking industry by forcing principal reductions.
First, systematic loan restructuring is the most orderly way to approach the problem. The current chaos is dragging out the pain, and in many communities, values are in total free fall -- the market threatens to overcorrect.
Second, the financial services industry, far more than the average homeowner, is able to take the hit. With bonuses once again soaring, banks clearly have money to burn.

To the Editor:
Re ''5 Options for Congress to Cut Taxes,'' by David Leonhardt (Economic Scene column, Nov. 3):
No compromise on tax cuts. Full stop.
The fat cats need to pay their fair share. No more throwing us a bone to gnaw on while they dine on arugula and stuffed goose.

HEADLINE: Protesters Rally in Seoul Ahead of G-20 Summit

BYLINE: By MARK McDONALD

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- Tens of thousands of protesters held a peaceful, almost festive, rally in Seoul, South Korea, on Sunday to protest the Group of 20 summit meeting that begins here on Thursday. 
Organizers said that 40,000 union members, social activists and students turned out for the rally, but police officials put the number at half that, the local news media reported.
The main gathering broke up just after nightfall, although a few thousand union members stayed behind for a candlelight sit-in and a stare-down with the police, thousands of whom were present in armored riot gear. A temporary security law put in place just for the summit meeting prohibits marches after sunset, and the police used pepper spray to disperse some of the demonstrators.
''This happens every time, it's stupid,'' Kim Bo-ran, 26, said about the heavy security. ''We're peaceful. And look at the police, they all have new uniforms and new batons.''
The South Korean government is taking no chances with security during the meeting, which brings to Seoul 25 heads of state along with various billionaire business executives and representatives of organizations like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
The previous G-20 meeting, in Toronto in June, was marred by the presence of rampaging black-suited protesters who smashed store windows and burned police cruisers. About 900 people were arrested.
The police in Seoul said last week that 45,000 officers were being mobilized and that military units also had been placed on high alert.
The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, which has over 600,000 members, organized the rally on Sunday.
Many demonstrators arrived at the rally in well-organized teams, most of them led by flag bearers. The union groups wore coordinated outfits: baby-blue windbreakers or purple scarves, gray fleece jackets or olive-drab fishermen's vests.
They sat on the damp grass on foil-wrapped squares of heavy cardboard. They sang. They chanted. They fist-pumped. And they cheered the speakers who railed against a pending South Korean free trade agreement with the United States.
One poignant focus of the gathering was a commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the death of Jeon Tae-il, a garment worker who committed suicide by self-immolation on Nov. 13, 1970.
Mr. Jeon, 22, was protesting sweatshop conditions at textile factories in Seoul and the government's failure to enforce laws governing workplace conditions. His death helped galvanize the labor movement in South Korea, and a statue of him now stands outside the Peace Market area, where he once worked.

HEADLINE: In a Suburb, A Microcosm Of the Nation

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

 BODY:
MOUNT KISCO, N.Y.
You can pick your own microcosm representing last week's Tuesday Night Massacre, but the 19th Congressional District in the northern suburbs is as good as any.
One day John Hall, a co-founder of the rock band Orleans, was still the one -- a staunchly liberal, environmentally minded representative first elected in the Democratic surge in 2006, whose campaign benefited from concerts by musicians like Jackson Browne, James Taylor and Carole King.
And then, suddenly, he was tossed out in favor of Nan Hayworth, a Tea Party-backed retired ophthalmologist and free-enterprise absolutist whose goals include repealing or gutting the health care overhaul, abolishing the inheritance tax, extending the Bush tax cuts for everyone no matter how wealthy, and radically downsizing government. 
Just don't suggest that it seems schizophrenic. ''It's a corrective,'' Ms. Hayworth said. ''To use the word 'schizophrenic' implies we're just going from one extreme to the next. This is a rational response to the clear knowledge that we have a federal government that is doing things that are very bad and damaging to our economy and our future.''
She was picking at her French toast and bacon at the Mount Kisco Diner, having been accorded rock star treatment from supporters, whom she greeted with a natural ebullience that suggested someone for whom a second career in politics was hardly a stretch.
''You can't accumulate debt in the ways they have without imperiling the enterprise that has made us the strongest and most productive nation in history,'' she continued, tapping a finger on the Formica and speaking in rapid-fire, polysyllabic bursts. ''Are we perfect? No. But we are the greatest nation ever to exist. I do believe in American exceptionalism with all my heart, and that's why I ran, because American exceptionalism comes from free enterprise.''
We have heard much of this lately, but Ms. Hayworth is a reminder that you stereotype the winners in this year's Republican tsunami at your risk.
Ms. Hayworth's roots are in Midwestern conservatism: she grew up in Munster, Ind., her father a C.P.A., her mother an immigrant from England. She's also one of those dreaded elites; she graduated summa cum laude from Princeton (same class as Eliot Spitzer and Elena Kagan) and Cornell Medical College. And she embodies the traditional anti-tax, pro-market Republicanism of the suburbs -- take away the Tea Party label, and she's not far from Sue Kelly, the Republican Mr. Hall ousted.
To hear her tell it, her life changed in high school, when, at her father's urging, she read ''Economics in One Lesson'' by Henry Hazlitt, a popular explication of laissez-faire economics, whose listing on Amazon.com features endorsements by Ayn Rand and Ron Paul.
Often Ms. Hayworth sounds as if she is quoting from it: ''Private enterprise must thrive. It must flourish. And it must do so without the federal government putting a finger on the scale.''
As for the abuses of business, her attitude seems mostly to blame the government (the mortgage market, for example, was warped by government interference) or to figure that stuff happens. She supports -- and benefited from -- the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling allowing corporations to spend unlimited money influencing political races. ''Funding finds its way to a cause,'' she said matter-of-factly.
There's no question, Ms. Hayworth is smart, genuine and articulate -- she's already being eyed as a comer by the Republican leadership. We'll see whether her agenda of tax cuts for the top earners, an end to the inheritance tax and the rest works as well for those who voted for her as it does for a household headed by two doctors. Her husband, Dr. Scott Hayworth, a gynecologist she met at Princeton and went to medical school with, is president and chief executive officer of the Mount Kisco Medical Group, which has more than 200 doctors and increasingly dominates medicine in northern Westchester and nearby areas.
Like other Republicans, she is light on specifics about budget-cutting and how to square deficit fighting with an extension of all the Bush tax cuts.
Instead, she argues that Republicans like Paul D. Ryan are asking the right questions for how to cut. She concedes it can't be done overnight, but she seems like the Republican advantage in the enthusiasm gap incarnate. And unlike the Democrats, who never found a message, she's focused on advocating cutting government and taxes.
''Everything else,'' she said, ''is chaff.''
And what does she do for fun?
''This.''

HEADLINE: Cost of Tapping Green Power Makes Projects a Tougher Sell

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD and TOM ZELLER Jr.

 BODY:
Michael Polsky's wind farm company was doing so well in 2008 that banks were happy to lend millions for his effort to light up America with clean electricity.
But two years later, Mr. Polsky has a product he is hard-pressed to sell.
His company, Invenergy, had a contract to sell power to a utility in Virginia, but state regulators rejected the deal, citing the recession and the lower prices of natural gas and other fossil fuels. 
''The ratepayers of Virginia must be protected from costs for renewable energy that are unreasonably high,'' the regulators said. Wind power would have increased the monthly bill of a typical residential customer by 0.2 percent.
Even as many politicians, environmentalists and consumers want renewable energy and reduced dependence on fossil fuels, a growing number of projects are being canceled or delayed because governments are unwilling to add even small amounts to consumers' electricity bills.
Deals to buy renewable power have been scuttled or slowed in states including Florida, Idaho and Kentucky as well as Virginia. By the end of the third quarter, year-to-date installations of new wind power dropped 72 percent from 2009 levels, according to the American Wind Energy Association, a trade group.
Mr. Polsky calls the focus on short-term costs short-sighted.
''They have to look for the ratepayers' long-term interest,'' he said, ''not just the bills this year.''
Electricity generated from wind or sun still generally costs more -- and sometimes a lot more -- than the power squeezed from coal or natural gas. Prices for fossil fuels have dropped in part because the recession has reduced demand. In the case of natural gas, newer drilling techniques have opened the possibility of vast new supplies for years to come.
The gap in price can pit regulators, who see their job as protecting consumers from unreasonable rates, against renewable energy developers and utility companies, many of which are willing to pay higher prices now to ensure a broader energy portfolio in the future.
In April, for example, the state public utilities commission in Rhode Island rejected a power-purchase deal for an offshore wind project that would have cost 24.4 cents a kilowatt-hour. The utility now pays about 9.5 cents a kilowatt hour for electricity from fossil fuels.
The state legislature responded by passing a bill allowing the regulators to consider factors other than price. The commission then approved an agreement to buy electricity from a smaller wind farm, although that decision is being challenged in the courts.
Similarly, in Kentucky this year, the public service commission voted down a contract for a local utility, Kentucky Power, to buy electricity from NextEra Energy Resources in Illinois.
According to the commission, Kentucky Power argued that the contract would position the utility ''to better meet growing environmental requirements and impending government portfolio mandates for renewable energy'' and that it would benefit customers.
But Kentucky's attorney general, Jack Conway, joined by business and industrial electricity users, opposed the deal, contending that it would have increased a typical residential customer's rates by about 0.7 percent and was ''a discretionary expense'' that the utility's customers could ill afford.
Commissioner James W. Gardner, the lone dissenting commissioner, protested that ''there is a necessity for this power'' and said that ''there are great pressures nationally and in Kentucky to increase renewables.''
Companies that make solar cells and wind machines argue that a national energy policy is needed to guarantee them a market that will allow their industry to develop. Clean power will be an important industry globally for years, they say, and if the United States does not subsidize renewable energy now, it risks falling far behind other countries.
They point to China, which is rapidly increasing the amount of electricity it generates from renewable sources. In its most recent quarterly assessment of the renewable energy sector, the accounting and consulting firm Ernst & Young identified China as the most attractive market for investment in renewable energy.
In part, the analysis suggested, this reflected the failure of American lawmakers to pass a national renewable energy standard and the looming expiration of a Treasury program that allowed renewable developers to receive cash grants in lieu of tax credits.
In Europe, many national governments have guaranteed prices for energy from sun or wind. As a result, renewable advocates say, many countries are on track to meet the European Union's goal of 20 percent of energy from renewable sources by 2020.
The United States has relied on a combination of state renewable energy mandates and federal tax credits to encourage greater reliance on energy from renewable sources. Legislation that would have set a price on carbon-dioxide emissions and included a standard for increasing the share of clean energy in the nation's electricity portfolio failed in Congress this year.
''Our investors tell us they're nervous about all the uncertainty,'' said John Cusack, the president of Gifford Park Associates, a sustainability management and investment consulting firm in Eastchester, N.Y. ''They don't know what's going to happen.''
To be sure, a lot of renewable power development is still going forward. The American Wind Energy Association estimates that wind farms capable of producing 6,300 megawatts of wind power are under construction, and that a busy second half of 2010 would leave installations about 50 percent behind last year. Solar power is becoming less expensive, and its use is expanding rapidly. But it still accounts for less than 1 percent of the nation's electricity needs, providing enough to serve about 350,000 homes.
Renewable energy supporters argue that higher fossil fuel prices will eventually make renewable energy more competitive -- and at times over the last two decades, when the price for natural gas has spiked, wind power in particular has been a relative bargain. Advocates also argue that while the costs might be higher now, as the technology matures and supply chains and manufacturing bases take root, clean sources of power will become more attractive.
Fold in the higher costs of extracting and burning fossil fuels on human health, the climate and the environment, many advocates argue, and renewable technologies like wind power are already cheaper.
''One of the problems in the United States is that we haven't been willing to confront the tough questions,'' said Paul Gipe, who sits on the steering committee of the Alliance for Renewable Energy, a group advocating energy policy reform.
''We have to ask ourselves, 'Do we really want renewables?' '' he said. ''And if the answer to that is yes, then we're going to have to pay for them.''

HEADLINE: Mental Health Visits Seen Rising as Parent Deploys

BYLINE: By BENEDICT CAREY

 BODY:
Young children in military families are about 10 percent more likely to see a doctor for a mental difficulty when a parent is deployed than when the parent is home, researchers are reporting Monday in the most comprehensive study to date of such families' use of health insurance during wartime. 
Visits for mental health concerns, like anxiety and acting out at school, were the only kind to increase during deployment; complaints for all physical problems declined, the study found.
Researchers have long known that deployment puts a strain on families, particularly spouses. Experts said the new study, being published in the journal Pediatrics and including more than half a million children, significantly fills out the picture of the entire family as multiple deployments have become a norm.
''This study gives us an excellent beginning to understand what's happening'' in military households, said Benjamin Karney, a psychologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. ''It's pretty amazing that they were able to look at essentially the entire military population and strongly document something we suspected was happening but didn't know for sure.''
In the study, a research team led by Dr. Gregory H. Gorman of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences analyzed the health records of 642,397 children ages 3 to 8 with parents in the military. It compared the frequency of health visits from 2006 to 2007 when a parent was deployed with those when the parent was home.
The researchers found that the children saw a doctor or other health professional about six times a year and about once every two years for a mental health reason. During deployment of a parent, however, the visit rate dropped by about 11 percent for physical problems but rose by 11 percent for psychological complaints. Stress, anxiety and attention-deficit problems were among the more common diagnoses, and mothers were far more likely than fathers to take a child to a doctor.
''It's not clear yet whether kids are in fact suffering more mental problems when a parent is deployed, or that mothers are more attendant to any shift in behavior,'' Dr. Karney said. ''That's the next question we have to ask.''
The rates were highest for 7- and 8-year-olds in two-parent families. This may be because when single parents deploy, children are left with caregivers who are less sensitive to changes in behavior and therefore less likely to seek treatment, the study's authors suggested.
''These findings are especially important for nonmilitary pediatricians, who provide almost two-thirds of outpatient care for the children of military parents,'' they concluded.
Despite the strain of duty, military marriages tend to be relatively stable, research suggests. In a recent study, Dr. Karney and John S. Crown of the RAND Corporation found time deployed was associated with a lower risk of divorce for most of the military, at least from 2002 to 2005.

HEADLINE: A Proposed Road Through Serengeti Park in Tanzania

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Proposed Serengeti Highway Is Lined With Prospects and Fears'' (news article, Oct. 31): 
I first visited the Serengeti in 1997, and it remains one of the most thrilling experiences of my life. The national park where we can visit the most diverse group of animals in their natural habitat, it is home to the rhino, cheetah, elephant, leopard, hippo, cape buffalo, lion, gazelle and crocodile. I was fortunate enough to see a cheetah attack a Thompson's gazelle, and serve lunch to her four hungry cubs.
Building a road through this wondrous kingdom would be a monstrous crime. Poaching would increase, and the precarious balance of predator and prey would be destroyed beyond repair.
I saw poverty in Tanzania. But endangering its wildlife would be utterly self-defeating, since tourism represents much of Tanzania's income. A way must be found to stimulate the country's economy that does not condemn one of our planet's greatest wonders.
The world's nations must assist Tanzania (through the World Bank, perhaps), to enable this magnificent treasure to continue to thrive.

HEADLINE: Plan for Electric Cable To Grid Nears Deadline

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
A deadline looms to save a project, years in the planning, that would involve digging under the Hudson River to connect New Jersey and Manhattan, but government officials cannot agree on how to share the costs. Sound familiar?
But this project is not the commuter rail tunnel that New Jersey's governor, Chris Christie, scrapped late last month. It is a proposed seven-mile-long cable that would hook New York City to the main electric power grid west of the Hudson. The project was developed to avert power shortages in the city.
But the city, which had supported the project, is now holding out for better rates on the electricity, and the planners say there is no more time for negotiating. 
The chief executive of the New York Power Authority, Richard M. Kessel, called the cable a must-do project that within a few years ''is going to be needed to keep the lights on in the city.''
And unless city officials reach an agreement with the authority in the next week, Mr. Kessel said, ''the project will go away.''
The developer, Hudson Transmission Partners, has cleared almost all of the regulatory hurdles for its plan to draw power from the regional grid in Ridgefield, N.J., and transmit it to a Con Edison substation at the west end of 49th Street in Manhattan, at a total cost estimated at $850 million.
The plan received environmental permits and permission from the New York State Public Service Commission to start construction next year.
Hudson Transmission can do the underwater work only in the summer and early fall, said Edward M. Stern, president of PowerBridge, the developer's parent company. If it is delayed beyond 2011, he said, some of the developer's other agreements, with investors and property owners, are likely to fall apart, he said.
The board of the Power Authority, a state-owned utility that supplies electricity to the New York City Housing Authority and other city agencies, made a commitment to pay more than $165 million for necessary improvements to the power grid.
But that guarantee is scheduled to expire next Monday, and the authority's trustees have said they will not approve another extension.
''We are at the end of the rope and the project will be gone forever,'' Mr. Stern said. ''The project needs to move ahead now, and it can't wait for the political process to finish up at its customary pace.''
City officials said they would not agree to pay more than what they thought was fair just to save the project.
''At the right price and under the right conditions, this would be a good deal,'' said Seth W. Pinsky, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation.
Mr. Pinsky and the other city officials involved in the long-running negotiations describe the project in less than urgent terms. They said it would reduce the chances of power shortages or failures. Still, they said, the city has time to find alternatives if the cable from New Jersey does not work out.
The cable would carry as much as 660 megawatts of power within a few blocks of Times Square. That would cover most of the growth in demand that is projected over the next decade: Con Edison's latest long-term forecast estimated that the city's peak demand for electricity will rise by 760 megawatts in 10 years to about 14,000 megawatts.
Con Edison has vouched for the project. In a letter to the state's Public Service Commission in April, a Con Ed executive said that without the cable, ''a future electric system emergency'' could force the utility to overload parts of its transmission network and jeopardize the reliability of the overall system.
The project could also benefit homes and businesses in the city with lower costs for electricity, since power imported from the grid in New Jersey is cheaper.
Mr. Kessel said the savings could add up to $2 billion over 20 years. But those projections are based on assumptions of a wide spread between the market prices for electricity in the city and in the states served by the regional grid.
Since the recession set in and reduced demand for power, the gap between those prices has shrunk, making imported electricity less attractive.
The narrowed spread has also changed the tune of city officials.
Just five months ago, the Economic Development Corporation expressed support for the cable project, saying it should lower electricity prices and reduce the city's reliance on older generators that produce more pollution.
At the time, though, the project was being monitored by Robert C. Lieber, who was the deputy mayor for economic development; he left the job in June.
Since then, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg recruited Stephen Goldsmith as a deputy mayor. Mr. Goldsmith, who has been looking for ways to cut the city budget, has taken responsibility for the negotiations over the cable project.
''We made a deal to do this project. Then a new guy came in and they want to change the whole thing,'' Mr. Kessel said, referring to city officials. ''It's a shame on all of us if we can't get this project done.''

HEADLINE: Kindness of a Stranger That Still Resonates

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MAAG

 BODY:
CANTON, Ohio -- The event was a reunion for people who were never supposed to meet, commemorating an act of charity that succeeded because it happened in secret.
Helen Palm sat in her wheelchair on the stage of the Palace Theater and read her plea for help, the one she wrote in the depths of the Great Depression to an anonymous stranger who called himself B. Virdot.
''I am writing this because I need clothing,'' Ms. Palm, 90, read aloud on Friday evening. ''And sometimes we run out of food.'' 
Ms. Palm was one of hundreds who responded to an advertisement that appeared Dec. 17, 1933, in The Canton Repository newspaper. A donor using the pseudonym B. Virdot offered modest cash gifts to families in need. His only request: Letters from the struggling people describing their financial troubles and how they hoped to spend the money. The donor promised to keep letter writers' identities secret ''until the very end.''
That end came last week at the city's famed 84-year-old Palace Theater, at a reunion for families of B. Virdot's recipients. About 400 people attended. For the older people, it was a chance to remember the hard times. For relatives of the letter writers, it was a time to hear how the small gifts, in the bleakest winter of the Depression, meant more than money. They buoyed the spirits of an entire city that was beginning to lose hope.
Of the 150 people in Canton who received checks, most for as little as $5, from B. Virdot, Ms. Palm is the only one still alive, and the only one to learn the anonymous donor's true identity. ''I thought about B. Virdot a lot'' in the years after 1933, Ms. Palm said. ''I was really surprised when I learned his real name.''
His secret lasted 75 years. Then, in 2008, a Canton native named Ted Gup received a suitcase stuffed with his late grandfather's papers, including letters addressed to one B. Virdot.
Mr. Gup, an investigative journalist formerly with The Washington Post, discovered that B. Virdot was his grandfather, Samuel J. Stone, who escaped poverty and persecution as a Jew in Romania to build a successful chain of clothing stores in the United States. He created the name B. Virdot by combining the names of his daughters, Barbara, Dorothy and Mr. Gup's mother, Virginia.
Mr. Gup used the letters as the basis for a book, ''A Secret Gift,'' just published by Penguin Press. Relying on newspaper archives and government documents over the last two years, he found and interviewed more than 500 descendants of the letter writers.
Taken together, the letters from families struggling through the Great Depression create a larger story of a city and a nation struggling to accept a new notion: that without help they might not survive, no matter how hard they worked.
''In many cases these were individuals with their backs against the wall, watching their children go hungry every night,'' Mr. Gup said in a phone interview last week.
At a time when accepting charity was seen as a moral failure, Mr. Stone's promise of anonymity shielded the letter writers from shame. An unemployed woman caring for her sick daughter and disabled sister wrote to Mr. Stone, ''If I thought this would be printed in the papers I would rather die of hunger first.''
Kenneth Richards was dumbfounded when Mr. Gup tracked him down to his home outside Canton and told him that his mother, Mattie Richards, had received a check from B. Virdot.
''I really didn't believe him because my mother just wouldn't ever ask anybody for help,'' Mr. Richards, 72, said. ''Here was a woman I never knew.''
The stigma against handouts continues in Canton, once a thriving manufacturing city that spent the last three decades watching factories close. James Macey lost his job as a waiter last month when the restaurant he was working at, Cheeseburger in Paradise, closed. He applied for more than 15 jobs before requesting unemployment assistance on Friday.
''I waited two weeks because I didn't want to apply for unemployment,'' Mr. Macey, 25, said. ''It's embarrassing.''
Canton's tradition of charity continues, too. Mr. Macey's pastor at Cathedral of Life Church offered him $250 to scrub the church's floors. Insisting that was too much money for four hours of work, Mr. Macey requested $100. The pastor, M. Dana Gammill, asked him to accept $150.
Many people need such help in Canton. More than half the city's children live below the federal poverty line, according to the Census Bureau, up from 38 percent in 2008. More than 3,000 people called the United Way for help in October, a 33 percent increase over last year, the agency said.
Frustration over 10.4 percent unemployment in surrounding Stark County has caused more political instability than Canton has known in generations. John Boccieri, a conservative Democrat, won the seat in Congress from the local district in 2008, only to lose to Jim Renacci, a Republican, last week. ''People are scared,'' said David B. Cohen, a political scientist at the University of Akron. ''When the economy is bad, the party in power gets punished.''
In 1933, the fear was visceral. J. L. White, father of seven children, wrote in his thank-you note to B. Virdot that he was considering suicide just before he received the gift.
For other families, Mr. Stone's gift provided the only holiday cheer that bleak winter. Olive Hillman used the $5 check to buy her 8-year-old daughter a doll with a porcelain face and leather arms.
''I was thrilled to get it,'' said the daughter, Geraldine Hillman Fry, now 85. ''It really was the only doll that I ever had in my life, so it meant a lot to me.''
At Friday's reunion, people talked about how Mr. Stone's example of generosity resonates today.
''I think there's a message here that people in Canton know how to get through the hard times by pulling together,'' Mr. Gup said.
Days before Christmas 1933, with Mr. Stone's gift in hand, Edith May took her 4-year-old daughter Felice to a five-and-dime store and bought her a wooden horse.
Seventy-seven years later, Felice May Dunn owns two farms and 17 Welsh ponies.
''In my life it made a big difference,'' Ms. Dunn, 80, recalled. ''It was my favorite toy.''

HEADLINE: Where Marijuana Is a Point of Pride

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
NEDERLAND, Colo. -- Millions of Americans expressed their feelings about marijuana last week. In Colorado, 24 communities voted to ban or restrict shops selling legal medical marijuana. In California, voters wrestled with the question of legalization for recreational use -- with issues of health, crime and taxes all coming into play -- then voted no.
But here in Nederland, it was just another beautiful day high in the mountains. 
Marijuana has been mainstream in this outpost of the counterculture, 8,000 feet in the Rockies and an hour northwest of Denver, since the days of Bob Marley's cigar-size ''spliffs'' and the jokes of Cheech and Chong.
And to judge by the numbers, things have not changed all that much.
An explosion of medical marijuana sales over the last year in Colorado as well as the District of Columbia and the 13 other states where medical use is allowed has certainly brought a new element into the mix. Dispensaries like Grateful Meds, one of seven medical marijuana providers in Nederland, population 1,400, now have legal compliance lawyers on retainer and sales tax receipts in the cash drawer.
But marijuana is still marijuana, and Nederland's perch overlooking what John Denver immortalized as ''the Colorado Rocky Mountain high'' has not budged.
State records show that by some coincidence, the concentration of medical marijuana patients and dispensaries selling medicinal cannabis is higher here in Colorado's old hippie heartland than in any other corner of the state.
In Gilpin County, for example, which begins at Nederland's doorstep, almost one in 20 residents qualify for cannabis treatment -- the highest level in Colorado and more than three times the statewide average. State law, passed by voter referendum in 2000, allows marijuana treatment for a list of maladies, from cancer to chronic pain, if a doctor verifies the need.
And doctors have obliged. The sick-enough-for-marijuana pattern extends in a broad band from Nederland west through an archipelago of communities that were equally tinctured by tie-dye a generation ago and are now cornerstones of the state's resort and tourism industry.
Summit and Pitkin Counties, home to ski towns like Breckenridge, Keystone and Aspen, pride themselves on a healthy outdoor youth culture, but they also have a disproportionate amount of debilitating pain diagnosed in men in their 20s, state records show.
''Who would think there would be such severe pain among young men in Colorado?'' said Ron Hyman, the state registrar of vital statistics and director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment's medical marijuana program.
Nederland residents like Hal Mobley, 56, who was on his way to get a haircut on a recent morning, asked pretty much the same thing. Marijuana is part of the life here, he said -- no more available, no less, and no different in its use, he thinks, than it has been for decades.
''It's for pain?'' he said, squinting into the bright sun.
Well, it is also good medicine for the Nederland town budget. Tax revenues are way up, in ways that would make many a more buttoned-down town treasurer envious -- partly from more tourists spending money in the restaurants and shops, but even more so from marijuana sales.
In June alone, while many communities around the nation were still sputtering through economic doldrums, sales taxes collected in Nederland came in a robust 54 percent above those of June 2009. Without the tax collected on marijuana, the increase would have been 22 percent.
''It's been here, probably in an illegal capacity, for a long time, but now there's an opportunity for industry,'' said Nederland's mayor, Sumaya Abu-Haidar. ''There's an opportunity for free enterprise, an opportunity for people to make a living in a way that wasn't available before.''
Philip Dyer, 45, a local musician, put it another way. The government, he said, ''has finally gotten smart enough to regulate it and get their piece.''
Supporters of medical marijuana say the pattern -- medical use most predominant in places of historically high recreational use -- is simply a reflection of better knowledge about the drug and its properties. People in communities where marijuana has been accepted, they say, know more about its medical benefits than those in other parts of the state where medical marijuana patients are rare.
Still, residents here say that despite a kind of marijuana status quo on paper, things are changing.
A demographic shift in recent years, with more families, professionals, tech workers and telecommuters moving here, has created tensions, town officials say, over questions of growth, development, tourism -- and marijuana, with many of the newcomers less enthusiastic than the old guard about Nederland's ganja-tinged reputation.
Earlier this year, Nederland became the third community in Colorado to decriminalize recreational marijuana use. But the vote, mostly symbolic because recreational use is still illegal under state and federal law, deeply divided the community. Legalization passed, but by only 41 of the 477 votes cast. A proposal to hold a cannabis festival in town hit a bigger wall of opposition and was voted down.
''When people think of Nederland as this stoner town, if you will, that is not accurate,'' Mayor Abu-Haidar said.
But the town still has a reputation for having good marijuana, a point of pride that the legal compliance lawyer for Grateful Meds, Susan Eisman, was happy to talk about during a tour of the shop. Whereas many dispensaries have perhaps five strains of marijuana to choose from, Grateful Meds has 30, and serves about 300 patients.
''We have patients coming from all over Colorado,'' Ms. Eisman said. ''And a lot of it is the quality and quantity and the selection and the reputation.
''A patient just the other day came all the way from Longmont, an hour away, because he liked a particular strain and he can't get it anywhere else.''

HEADLINE: Putting a Number on Free Agents

BYLINE: By SEAN FORMAN. 
Sean Foreman is the creator of Baseball-Reference.com.

 BODY:
Even before Buster Posey and Brian Wilson embraced on the mound at the end of the World Series last week, the free-agent season was upon us. More than 200 players are now free agents, free to negotiate and sign with teams of their choosing, most often the highest bidder. It may look chaotic from the outside, with one player signing for $8 million over two years and another for $80 million over five years, but spending has followed a fairly consistent pattern.
There has never been a team composed only of minimum-salary (or replacement-level) players, but based on what we have seen from the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Detroit Tigers and the Florida Marlins over the years, it is believed you could win 50 to 55 games with such a roster (for the sake of argument, let's assume it would go 52-110). 
From that assumption, we can estimate the number of wins up for grabs each year. The 30 teams average 81 wins, so there are 29 wins per team (870 total) to be had by signing better than replacement-level players. In 2010, teams spent about $2.4 billion above the league minimum on player salaries, or about $2.7 million per additional win.
That gives us the cost of a win added, but how many wins can a player add? A number of statistics attempt to convert a player's contribution into wins added. I'm going to use Wins Above Replacement (WAR). It takes a player's batting, pitching, fielding and base running; estimates the number of runs added or subtracted from the team total; then converts those runs into a wins added total (typically a 10-run difference equals one win). The Most Valuable Player award winners are usually eight-win players, and most starters are two- to three-win players.
In a truly open market, Evan Longoria, who added eight wins as the Rays' third baseman last year, would probably make as much as anyone in the game. But because he is three years from free agency, the system dictates he will make $2 million next year. Certainly a good payday, but in a system in which all were free agents, he would probably be worth $20 million (eight wins at $2.7 million per win) or more per season.
Younger players like Longoria, Robinson Cano, Clay Buchholz and Ike Davis provide a great deal of value to their teams, and because they are early in their careers, they cost little. In a sense, they produce a surplus of cash. Young talent that adds wins but is inexpensive has great value and is why teams are hesitant to trade prospects for veterans.
The available money is not just pocketed by the owners but is often used to attract free agents. While the average win across the league costs $2.7 million, 2009 free agents received nearly $4.5 million per win added. Analysts like those at Fangraphs and Tom Tango at Inside the Book have found this amount consistent across talent levels.
Last off-season, Matt Holliday, a four-win player, signed for $17 million a year; Jon Garland, a one-and-a-half-win pitcher, signed for $7 million. A rate of $4.5 million a win added is not a hard-and-fast rule, but it is generally in the ballpark.
If we apply this to the current free agents, what sort of contracts might we expect them to sign? First, we need an estimate of how many wins they will add. Player projections are an art, so I'm not going to claim these are state of the art, but projections based on a weighted average of the last three seasons have been shown to be nearly as accurate as more-advanced systems. In the accompanying chart, I weigh the players' 2008-10 WAR totals to estimate their 2011 WAR and multiply by $4.5 million per WAR.
Teams will do far more due diligence than I have done before making an offer, and factors like age, positional need, the economic climate, nonplaying considerations and injury history will weigh heavily on teams' decision-making. Certainly some of these players will be busts and others will look like steals in hindsight, but this is the initial framework the teams begin with when deciding whom to pursue and for how much.

GRAPHIC: CHART: Projected Free-Agent Salaries: One way to measure a player's contribution is with a statistic called Wins above Replacement (WAR). Using estimated 2011 WAR multiplied by $4.5 million, here are projected salaries (in millions) for some members of the 2010 class.

HEADLINE: Hollywood Parties Reach Tentative New Contract

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES - With little fanfare, Hollywood's movie and television production companies and its principal actors unions early on Sunday morning said they had agreed tentatively to a new three-year contract that provides a 6 percent increase in wages over three years, and increases health and benefits contributions by the companies. The agreement comes well in advance of the current contract's expiration, in June 2011, and follows weeks of closed-door bargaining between the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers and both the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Radio and Television Artists. The early settlement points to a new mood in Hollywood labor relations, which have become less confrontational as both companies and unions try to cope with softer economic conditions. In late 2007, movie and television writers began a three-month strike, then members of the Screen Actors Guild worked for months without a contract during a contentious bargaining period. This time around, the actors guild bargained in tandem with a sister guild, the federation, and reached a tentative deal in a relatively trouble-free process. The new contract, which also provides for expanded coverage in the new media area, is subject to approval by members of the two unions. 
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Maneuver Over Copters Is Opposed

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW

 BODY:
The Air Force has taken a beating over its contract process in recent years. But if officials thought a new approach would avoid controversy, they have been disappointed.
As the Air Force tries to speed its purchases, it is considering using an obscure 1932 law to buy at least $1 billion worth of helicopters without competitive bids, government officials say.
Watchdog groups and some industry officials are bristling at the idea, saying it would hand the business to Sikorsky, a unit of United Technologies of Hartford, Conn., without giving other companies a chance to offer what could be substantially lower prices. 
The law, the Economy Act of 1932, was part of Herbert Hoover's efforts to cut purchasing costs in the Depression by letting federal agencies buy equipment from one another without seeking bids from industry. Military analysts say it now eases transfers of fuel and computers, but it has hardly ever been used to buy weapons or aircraft.
Under the proposal, which is being debated in the Pentagon, the Air Force would add its order for as many as 93 Black Hawk helicopters to an Army contract with Sikorsky. The Army would order the extra craft, then sell them to the Air Force.
Air Force officials have said that the new helicopters would replace old Hueys that help secure Western missile silos and can ferry federal officials to safety in a crisis. Most of the Hueys were built during the Vietnam War, and avoiding a bid process could save a year or more in getting the replacements into the field.
But, as top Pentagon officials emphasize the need for more competition to reduce weapon costs, several analysts estimate that the Air Force could save 20 to 40 percent by inviting other manufacturers to bid.
''There are certainly options out there, and the Air Force rationale just seems kind of shaky,'' said Nick Schwellenbach, the director of investigations at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit group in Washington. ''The idea should be to save money by having the companies slug it out.''
Air Force officials declined to be interviewed and released a statement saying, ''All options are under review, and no decisions have been made.''
Richard L. Aboulafia, an analyst at the Teal Group, an aerospace and military consultancy in Fairfax, Va., said Air Force officials had had ''the living tar beaten out of them'' in bid competitions in recent years, with government auditors overturning multibillion-dollar awards for aerial refueling tankers and for other helicopters.
Given those delays in replacing other equipment, ''you can see the appeal of some kind of fast-track, quick remedy,'' he said. Air Force officials might think, ''Just give us the Black Hawks.'' After all, Mr. Aboulafia said, ''everyone else has them.''
But while the Black Hawks are among the most popular military helicopters ever made, they are much larger and more expensive than other helicopters that would also be faster and more efficient than the old Hueys, Mr. Aboulafia said.
He said Black Hawks typically cost the Army $12 million to $13 million each, and the newest model could cost $16 million to $18 million. By contrast, each AugustaWestland AW139 costs $10 million to $12 million, Mr. Aboulafia said.
Eurocopter and Bell Helicopter, which made the Hueys, would also be likely to bid if the Air Force held a competition, he said.
Sikorsky won the Army contract for the Black Hawk through a competition in 1976.
Paul F. Jackson, a Sikorsky spokesman, said that if Air Force officials decided to buy Black Hawks through that contract, they could ''receive deliveries ahead of their schedule and benefit from the cost savings achieved by that agreement.''
Sikorsky's supporters said the Black Hawks, which have been used extensively in war zones, would also need fewer security and safety modifications, which can add to costs and delays.
But Dan Hill, an official of AugustaWestland, a unit of Finmeccanica of Italy, said the Black Hawk ''seems to be a 125 percent or 150 percent solution'' that would also cost much more to operate than his company's helicopter. ''We just need a competition to make that case,'' he said.
Whatever happens, contract lawyers say, the Pentagon would probably rather not mention one fact -- that one of the main precedents for transferring military systems under the Economy Act occurred in the Iran-contra affair in 1986.
Investigators later found that the Defense Department had used the act to transfer missiles to the Central Intelligence Agency, which sold them to Iran to raise money for the Nicaraguan contras.

HEADLINE: For Family of Activist Killed in Gaza, No End in Sight for Case

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER

 BODY:
HAIFA, Israel -- Seven years after an American student, Rachel Corrie, was killed in Gaza by an Israeli military bulldozer she tried to block, becoming a global symbol of the Palestinian struggle, her parents and her older sister sit in an Israeli court in this northern city with two hopes: to confront the men who ran over her and to prove that the army investigation into her death was flawed.
On both counts, it has been a frustrating effort. To guard their identities, the bulldozer operators are called only by their initials and testify behind a screen, disembodied voices claiming vague memories. The Corrie lawyer presses them with props: ''Mr. A,'' he said to a commander this past Thursday, arranging a plastic toy bulldozer, an orange lump of putty and a Raggedy Ann doll, ''Where was she when you saw her?'' 
Mr. A's answer differed markedly from that of Mr. Y, the driver of the bulldozer who testified two weeks earlier, although both denied seeing her before she was crushed under their vehicle. The army said Ms. Corrie's death was an accident. The Corries believe the drivers either saw Rachel or were so careless toward the protesters as to be criminally negligent.
On the blond wooden benches of the Haifa District Court, the Corries take notes, volunteer translators whispering in their ears. They have mostly been here, away from their Olympia, Wash., home, since their civil case claiming the intentional and unlawful killing of their daughter began in March and there is no end in sight, with sessions already planned for January. They are exhausted but unbent.
''If I killed someone, I would remember that day for the rest of my life,'' Cindy Corrie, Ms. Corrie's mother, said during a break, eyes tearing, voice shaking. ''This is not just about Rachel, but something bigger. What happens to the humanity of soldiers?''
This is indeed about something bigger but just what has been debated since the instant of Ms. Corrie's death. Books, plays, videos and even an aid ship to Gaza have been dedicated to her memory and spirit, her focus on human rights and the plight of the Palestinians. A student at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Ms. Corrie, then 23, joined the International Solidarity Movement, a pro-Palestinian activist group, in January 2003 and moved to Gaza to help prevent house demolitions in the southern border town of Rafah.
It was the height of the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, against Israel, which at the time occupied Gaza. The Israelis say the houses in question were the source of sniper fire and arms-smuggling tunnels. Ms. Corrie, by contrast, wrote e-mails home saying that the families she met were gentle people whose houses had been shot at and whose children were harassed for no reason.
''The count of homes destroyed in Rafah since the beginning of this intifada is up around 600, by and large people with no connection to the resistance but who happen to live along the border,'' she wrote in one e-mail on Feb. 27, 2003. ''I think it is maybe official now that Rafah is the poorest place in the world.''
Rafah was never the poorest place in the world, but Ms. Corrie was writing as an incensed activist, not an economist. For many Israelis, however, the glorification of Ms. Corrie and her activism has amounted to an effort to portray Israel and its army as exceptionally brutal, part of a campaign to delegitimize the state and its security challenges.
The day that Ms. Corrie was killed, her fellow activists sent two photographs of her to news agencies that were then transmitted around the world. The first one showed her standing in an orange jacket with a bullhorn addressing an approaching bulldozer, and the second showed her crumpled on the ground, near death. The clear implication was that the two pictures were sequential, whereas the first was shot hours earlier with a different bulldozer.
The Israeli Army investigation found that the drivers of the bulldozer that killed her did not see Ms. Corrie because she was standing near a high mound of dirt as it approached. The drivers, it said, had limited lines of sight inside their heavily armored vehicle, and that by placing themselves in the bulldozer's path as human shields, the eight activists bore primary responsibility.
But the Corries believe that the army carried out a lackluster investigation filled with internal contradictions and with insufficient care to what orders soldiers received when faced with civilians in their paths. That view, it turns out, was not only that of a grieving family. It won support from the United States government.
Lawrence B. Wilkerson, who was chief of staff to then-Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, wrote to the Corries in his official capacity in June 2004. He referred to their query whether the American government viewed the military's final report ''to have reflected an investigation that was 'thorough, credible and transparent.' I can answer your question without equivocation. No, we do not consider it so.''
Mr. Wilkerson recommended that the Corries pursue the matter in an Israeli court. An observer from the American Embassy in Tel Aviv has attended every session of the case.
Sarah Corrie Simpson, Ms. Corrie's older sister, who is here with her mother and father, Craig, has taken a leading role in bringing attention to the case. Asked what she thought of how her sister was viewed, she said her family did not consider itself anti-Israel and was not responsible for the way in which Ms. Corrie's name had been used by groups and causes.
To the contrary, she said, the family was using Israel's court system to get its army to stand up to the standards it professes, a vote of confidence in the society.
''I don't see this as about Israel's legitimacy,'' she said in an interview. ''My family is not anti-Israel. What Rachel saw when she went to Gaza was extremely troubling and because of what happened to her we are now connected to the Palestinian issue. But Israeli peace activists shared her concern and are helping us with our case. From our family's perspective, this is about human rights for all people and holding governments accountable.''
Cindy Corrie added, ''An Israeli colonel said at this trial that there are no civilians in a war zone. But there are. If that hadn't been the army's attitude, maybe my daughter would still be with us.''

HEADLINE: My Endless New York

BYLINE: By TONY JUDT. 
Tony Judt, who died in August, was the director of the Remarque Institute at New York University. He is the author of the forthcoming collection, ''The Memory Chalet,'' from which this essay is adapted.

 BODY:
I CAME to New York University in 1987 on a whim. The Thatcherite assault on British higher education was just beginning and even in Oxford the prospects were grim. N.Y.U. appealed to me: by no means a recent foundation -- it was established in 1831 -- it is nevertheless the junior of New York City's great universities. Less of a ''city on a hill,'' it is more open to new directions: in contrast to the cloistered collegiate worlds of Oxbridge, it brazenly advertises itself as a ''global'' university at the heart of a world city.
But just what is a ''world city''? Mexico City, at 18 million people, or Sao Paulo at near that, are unmanageable urban sprawls; they are not ''world cities.'' Conversely, Paris -- whose central districts have never exceeded three million inhabitants -- was the capital of the 19th century. 
Is it a function of the number of visitors? In that case, Orlando, Fla., would be a great metropolis. Being the capital of a country guarantees nothing: think of Madrid or Washington (the Brasilia of its time). It may not even be a matter of wealth: within the foreseeable future Shanghai (14 million people) will surely be among the richest places on earth; Singapore already is. Will they be ''world cities''?
I have lived in four such cities. London was the commercial and financial center of the world from the defeat of Napoleon until the rise of Hitler; Paris, its perennial competitor, was an international cultural magnet from the building of Versailles through the death of Albert Camus. Vienna's apogee was perhaps the shortest: its rise and fall coincided with the last years of the Hapsburg Empire, though in intensity it outshone them all. And then came New York.
It has been my mixed fortune to experience these cities at twilight. In their prime they were arrogant and self-assured. In decline, their minor virtues come into focus: people spend less time telling you how fortunate you are to be there. Even at the height of ''Swinging London'' there was something brittle about the city's self-promotion, as though it knew this was but an Indian summer.
Today, the British capital is doubtless geographically central, its awful bling-bloated airport one of the world's busiest. And the city can boast the best theater and a multicolored cosmopolitanism sadly lacking in years past. But it all rests precariously on an unsustainable heap of other peoples' money: the capital of capital.
By the time I got to Paris, most people in the world had stopped speaking French (something the French have been slow to acknowledge). Who now would deliberately reconstruct their city -- as the Romanians did in Bucharest in the late 19th century -- to become ''the Paris of the East,'' complete with grand boulevards like the Calea Victoria? The French have a word for the disposition to look insecurely inward, to be preoccupied with self-interrogation: nombrilisme -- ''navel-gazing.'' They have been doing it for over a century.
I arrived in New York just in time to experience the bittersweet taste of loss. In the arts the city led the world from 1945 through the 1970s. If you wanted to experience modern painting, music or dance, you came to the New York of Clement Greenberg, Leonard Bernstein and George Balanchine. Culture was more than an object of consumption: people thronged to New York to produce it too. Manhattan in those decades was the crossroads where original minds lingered -- drawing others in their wake. Nothing else came close.
Jewish New York too is past its peak. Who now cares what Dissent or Commentary says to the world or each other? In 1977, Woody Allen could count on a wide audience for a joke about the two magazines merging and forming ''Dissentary'' (see ''Annie Hall''). Today? A disproportionate amount of the energy invested in these and certain other small journals goes to the Israel question: perhaps the closest that Americans get to nombrilisme.
The intellectual gangs of New York have folded their knives and gone home to the suburbs -- or else they fight it out in academic departments to the utter indifference of the rest of humanity. The same, of course, is true of the self-referential squabbles of the cultural elites of Russia or Argentina. But that is one reason neither Moscow nor Buenos Aires matters on the world stage. New York intellectuals once did, but most of them have gone the way of Viennese cafe society: they have become a parody of themselves, their institutions and controversies of predominantly local concern.
And yet, New York remains a world city. It is not the great American city -- that will always be Chicago. New York sits at the edge: like Istanbul or Mumbai, it has a distinctive appeal that lies precisely in its cantankerous relationship to the metropolitan territory beyond. It looks outward, and is thus attractive to people who would not feel comfortable further inland. It has never been American in the way that Paris is French: New York has always been about something else as well.
Today I drop my cleaning off with Joseph the tailor and we exchange Yiddishisms and reminiscences (his) of Jewish Russia. Two blocks south I lunch at a place whose Florentine owner disdains credit cards and prepares the best Tuscan food in New York. In a hurry, I can opt instead for a falafel from the Israelis on the next block; I might do even better with the sizzling lamb from the Arab at the corner.
Fifty yards away are my barbers: Giuseppe, Franco and Salvatore, all from Sicily -- their ''English'' echoing Chico Marx. They have been in Greenwich Village forever but never really settled: how should they? They shout at one another all day in Sicilian dialect, drowning out their main source of entertainment and information: a 24-hour Italian-language radio station. On my way home, I enjoy a mille-feuille from a surly Breton patissier who has put his daughter through the London School of Economics, one exquisite eclair at a time.
All this within two square blocks of my apartment -- and I am neglecting the Sikh newsstand, the Hungarian bakery and the Greek diner (actually Albanian but we pretend otherwise). Three streets east and I have Little Hapsburgia: Ukrainian restaurant, Uniate church, Polish grocery and, of course, the long-established Jewish deli serving Eastern European staples under kosher labels. All that is missing is a Viennese cafe -- for this, symptomatically, you must go uptown to the wealthy quarters of the city.
Such variety is doubtless available in London. But the cultures of contemporary London are balkanized by district and income -- Canary Wharf, the financial hub, keeps its distance from the ethnic enclaves at the center. Contrast Wall Street, within easy walking distance of my neighborhood. As for Paris, it has its sequestered quarters where the grandchildren of Algerian guest workers rub shoulders with Senegalese street vendors, while Amsterdam has its Surinamese and Indonesian districts: but these are the backwash of empire, what Europeans now refer to as the ''immigrant question.''
One must not romanticize. I am sure that most of my neighborhood traders and artisans have never met and would have little to say to one another: at night they return home to Queens or New Jersey. If I told Joseph and Sal they had the good fortune to live in a ''world city,'' they would probably snort. But they do -- just as the barrow boys of early 20th-century Hoxton were citizens of the same cosmopolitan London that Keynes memorialized in ''The Economic Consequences of the Peace,'' even though they would have had no idea what he was talking about.
We are experiencing the decline of the American age. But how does national or imperial decay influence the lifecycle of a world city? Modern-day Berlin is a cultural metropolis on the make, despite being the capital of a medium-sized and rather self-absorbed nation. Meanwhile, Paris retained its allure for nearly two centuries after the onset of French national decline.
New York -- a city more at home in the world than in its home country -- may do better still. As a European, I feel more myself in New York than in the European Union's semi-detached British satellite, and I have Brazilian and Arab friends here who share the sentiment.
To be sure, we all have our complaints. And while there is no other city where I could imagine living, there are many places that, for different purposes, I would rather be. But this too is a very New York sentiment. Chance made me an American, but I chose to be a New Yorker. I probably always was.

HEADLINE: Irish Debt Woes Revive Concern About Europe

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
LONDON -- When interest rates soared last week on Irish government bonds, it served as a grim warning to other indebted nations of how difficult and even politically ruinous it could be to roll back decades of public sector largess.
An Irish bond market already in free fall plunged further after Irelandannounced on Thursday that it planned to nearly double its package of spending cuts and tax increases to try to rein in its huge deficit. Investors took it not as a sign of resolve but rather of Ireland's desperation and uncertainty about the true extent of its problems.
The yield on Ireland's 10-year bond climbed to 7.6 percent on Friday, expanding the gap with the 2.5 percent interest rate on comparable bonds issued by Germany, which is emerging most strongly from the European debt crisis.
Borrowing costs in Spain, Portugal and Greece also spiked upward again, as investor concern re-emerged that those countries would be hard-pressed to bring their deficits under control and avoid defaulting on their bonds. 
Even as global stock markets rallied last week, those bond market jitters were a forceful reminder of how wary investors remained after Europe's debt crisis last spring, despite the commitment of a combined 750 billion euros ($1.05 trillion) in bailout funds by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.
''The scale of the deficits are just so big,'' said Philip R. Lane, a professor of international economics at Trinity College in Dublin. ''The issues are political as much as they are economic.''
Prime Minister Brian Cowen's increasingly shaky political standing in Ireland may be threatened by the new deficit reduction measures, which will cut to the heart of the Irish welfare system, including health care.
In Greece, regional elections on Sunday were viewed as a test for the Socialist Party led by Prime Minister George Papandreou, whose government's austerity measures have been wildly unpopular. In a televised address, Mr. Papandreou claimed victory in the elections and viewed the results as support of his economic policies.
International concerns about the high budget deficit in the United States, and Washington's seeming willingness to print money rather than tackle tough debt-cutting measures, help partly explain the recent anti-American criticism from countries as diverse as Brazil, China and Germany. Countering those critics may be one of the biggest tasks for President Obama in Seoul, South Korea, this week at the Group of 20 meeting of the leaders of the world's biggest economies.
Within Europe, though, the more immediate concerns involve Ireland. Its debt woes have stoked fear that it might even need to follow Greece and request a bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. Such a move could do lasting damage to Ireland's credit standing.
For the moment, at least, that outcome seems improbable. Unlike Greece earlier this year, Ireland has enough cash on hand to allow it to finance government operations through June 2011. And it has, at least temporarily, withdrawn from the bond market instead of paying the new, higher interest rates, which Irish officials say do not adequately reflect the country's true economic condition.
To a degree, Irish officials are correct. Market experts concur that the ever widening gap between the interest rates Germany pays on its debt and those of Ireland and other vulnerable euro zone economies is partly a reflection of technical factors, like the tiny number of bonds actually being traded. Low trading volumes mean that every time even a single spooked investor decides to sell an Irish or Greek bond, it can be a market-moving event, causing the price to plummet and the yield to rise.
Still, there is no denying that the recent run-up in interest rates highlights a real concern throughout Europe: that the first round of spending cuts and economic changes put forward by countries that also include France and Britain may not be enough to bring deficits down to the target levels of 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2014.
In this respect, Ireland, where the deficit is currently 32 percent of its G.D.P., is exhibit A.
A year ago, as cascading mortgage defaults brought down the biggest Irish banks, Ireland became the first major developed nation to impose an austerity program. The country was hailed worldwide as an exemplar of probity and national consensus.
But as the full extent of the banking and real estate bust became evident, it was clear that the government of Prime Minister Cowen, which has been in power since the onset of the crisis more than two years ago, had underestimated the cost of fiscal recovery. Now the possibility that he will be forced from office or compelled to call a new election grows by the day.
Last week, the Irish government conceded that it had previously miscalculated the scale of its debt challenge. It announced that the task would require an additional 15 billion euros in savings over four years, bringing the total sum of tax increases and spending cuts to about 30 percent of Ireland's total economic output.
And Ireland's need for cuts and taxes is hardly unique. Whether in Spain, France or Italy, European nations remain saddled with heavy welfare obligations -- ones that inevitably must be curtailed to meet ambitious deficit targets, even as their tax revenue is constrained by low economic growth.
And political pressures are building in Britain, where the government at least has a thin electoral mandate to cut the deficit, and where politically sensitive components of the welfare state, like health care and pensions, so far have largely been spared.
Last week, subway workers, firefighters and BBC journalists went on strike over proposed public sector cutbacks.
The British chancellor, George Osborne, perhaps the keenest deficit hawk among policy makers in the developed nations, was taken to task last week by lawmakers. They accused him of exaggerating the extent of the country's fiscal problems to justify broad cuts in middle-class benefits like universal payments to parents with children.
''How many children will be forced to leave their homes?'' demanded one furious member of Parliament. ''Will the numbers of homeless increase or decrease under your government? Will there be a reduction in special needs education for children in our schools?''
The chancellor replied that he had no choice. Unless the root causes of the British deficit were addressed, he said, the country's credit rating would be jeopardized.
In a report last week, the International Monetary Fund largely reinforced that view, arguing that the increasing debt ratios among advanced nations needed to be addressed. It highlighted the extent to which the debt ratios of all developed nations had exploded since the onset of the financial crisis. The leader is Ireland, whose debt level has almost doubled, to nearly 100 percent of G.D.P.
The monetary fund noted, too, how quickly markets could lose their confidence. It recalled that a year ago the interest rate spread between Greek and German bonds was 1 percentage point. It is now nearly nine times as large -- 11.3 percent for Greek bonds, versus 2.5 percent for those of Germany.
Such signals matter. It was a flare-up in bond yields, after all, that eventually pushed Greece into the arms of the International Monetary Fund in the spring, and sent the euro on a downward spiral against other major currencies from which it has only recently recovered.

HEADLINE: NOW IN POWER, G.O.P. VOWS CUTS IN STATE BUDGETS

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY and MICHAEL LUO; Monica Davey reported from Chicago and Michael Luo from New York.

 BODY:
Republicans who have taken over state capitols across the country are promising to respond to crippling budget deficits with an array of cuts, among them proposals to reduce public workers' benefits in Wisconsin, scale back social services in Maine and sell off state liquor stores in Pennsylvania, endangering the jobs of thousands of state workers.
States face huge deficits, even after several grueling years of them, and just as billions of dollars in stimulus money from Washington is drying up.
With some of these new Republican state leaders having taken the possibility of tax increases off the table in their campaigns, deep cuts in state spending will be needed. These leaders, committed to smaller government, say that is the idea. 
''We're going to do what families and businesses all over this country have already had to do, and that is live within their means,'' said Brian Bosma, a Republican who will soon become the speaker of the Indiana House, alongside a Republican governor, Mitch Daniels, and a supermajority of Republicans in the State Senate.
Mr. Bosma said state revenues next year are expected to reach only the levels of about five years ago, creating an enormous strain. ''We're going to do what is right, and we'll let the politics land where they may,'' he said.
All sorts of candidates make all sorts of promises along campaign trails, but there is a difference after last week's election: in many states, Republicans have gained such control that when they take office in the coming months they will have a much easier time carrying out whatever agenda they choose.
In some cases, that may mean not just greatly changing state policies on taxing and spending, but also loosening regulations facing businesses, restricting access to abortion and rights for illegal immigration, and, perhaps, slowing the Obama administration's health care overhaul.
Republicans gained more than 690 seats in state legislatures (leaving them with numbers last seen more than 80 years ago), at least five more governor seats, and, perhaps most significant, across-the-board power in the legislatures and governor's offices of at least 20 states -- more than twice as many as before the election. Included in that group were Maine and Wisconsin, which the day before the election had been entirely in Democratic hands.
''It's kind of put up or shut up time,'' said Scott Walker, the governor-elect of Wisconsin, which experienced the largest flip in power in memory. Mr. Walker, a Republican, said he intended to navigate a projected $3 billion budget gap with no tax increases. He also said he planned to remove all ''litigation, regulation, excessive cost'' barriers to businesses (declaring Wisconsin, on election night, ''open for business!''), and to put an end to a plan for a federally financed rail project between Milwaukee and Madison that he says would cost too much for the state to operate once it is built.
As for public employees' wages and benefits, Mr. Walker said he hoped to force them ''into line'' with everyone else's. ''Public employees can't be haves, while private sector employees are have-nots,'' he said.
In Pennsylvania, a state not fully controlled by Republicans since 2002, Gov.-elect Tom Corbett must consider both a budget gap that could run as high as $5 billion and his campaign pledge not to raise taxes.
Among the steps Republican leaders there are pondering: privatizing the state's 600-plus liquor stores, a proposal that would potentially bring $2 billion for state coffers, but also layoffs of several thousand state workers.
''That moved up to the top of the agenda,'' Dominic Pileggi, the State Senate majority leader, said of the notion, which had been batted around for years but had faded under Edward G. Rendell, the departing Democratic governor.
Elsewhere, state leaders are expected to consider privatizing services now carried out by public employees as part of their broader examinations of the costs and size of government.
Other cost-cutting measures Mr. Corbett has talked about include slashing the fleet of roughly 16,000 state vehicles and taking away certain perks from lawmakers, like per diem payments.
State workers, education leaders and social service agencies are bracing. Since last week, some have met in various states to prepare counterattacks against what Terry W. Hartle, of the American Council of Education, which represents leaders of colleges and universities, described as the ''eye-popping'' level of ''draconian'' cuts it would take to balance some state budgets without new revenues.
To solve deficits in the last few years, many states have already made drastic cuts and raised taxes (half the states raised taxes in 2009, netting more than $28 billion, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures). And while there are signs that state revenues may be starting to improve, in most places they are not expected to return to pre-recession levels for a while.
Some Democrats, like B. Patrick Bauer, the departing speaker of the Indiana House, say they fear what some of the proposals -- like ones in Indiana to cut unemployment benefits, create an automatic refund mechanism for taxpayers if state reserves reach a certain level, and shrink the size of government -- may ultimately mean for poor people, working people and sick people. ''They ought to all be worried,'' Mr. Bauer said.
Meanwhile, opponents of the Obama administration's health care law, business leaders and conservative groups have begun making plans, too, for what they expect will be a series of welcome openings. Among the possibilities: a new flurry of proposed state prohibitions on abortion, same-sex marriage and illegal immigration.
''I feel like a little boy on Christmas morning -- which package do you open up first?'' said Troy Newman, the leader of Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group. Already, abortion opponents were considering pressing for new regulations in New Mexico, Iowa and Kansas, where Sam Brownback, the Republican governor-elect, follows Democratic governors who vetoed some abortion limits approved by the Republican-controlled Legislature.
For some states, like Arizona, Georgia, North Dakota and Texas, Republican domination in state capitols is not new (though in each of those, the size of Republican margins in legislatures grew in last week's election). And at least four states, including California, Hawaii and Vermont, shifted to one-party Democratic control.
But the larger pattern was Republican, a trend lawmakers said would affect the policy conversation even in states with divided governments.
Issues now likely to come to a debate in New Mexico, for instance, where Republicans won the governorship and made major gains in the House, though Democrats maintained control of both the House and Senate: repeal of a law allowing drivers' licenses for illegal immigrants and revocation of the licenses already issued; a requirement for photo identification cards at the polls; and the rollback of a 2008 environmental regulation dealing with the handling of waste from oil and gas operations
In many of these states, the new federal health care program is now certain to face new efforts to slow or stop it. Some of the newly elected governors have suggested joining a lawsuit, already supported by leaders of other states, opposing it.
Other leaders said they were weighing a series of options, including looking for ways to slow or steer clear of parts of the program (perhaps, the expansion of Medicaid or the creation of insurance exchanges), calling for a statewide referendum on the matter, and lobbying their colleagues in Washington to force a repeal.
In Maine, where a remarkable political transformation occurred, creating a Republican-controlled Capitol (an alignment not seen since the 1960s), there was an added possibility: in December, the Legislature is to pick a secretary of state, a treasurer and an attorney general -- the last of whom might play a role in the legal opposition to the health overhaul.
Paul LePage, the governor-elect there, also faces a projected $1 billion budget shortfall, and has considered abolishing the state's Land Use Regulation Commission, sending planning and licensing duties back to counties.
Tarren Bragdon, a co-chairman of Mr. LePage's transition team, said the new governor would probably also scale back the social safety net to focus on the ''truly needy'' in programs like food stamps, Medicaid and cash assistance, and look to remake the state's health system.
That system, known as ''Dirigo,'' (Maine's motto, which means ''I lead'' in Latin), was enacted several years ago in an effort to provide universal health care coverage for residents.
''Dirigo,'' Mr. Bragdon said, ''will be Diri-gone.''

HEADLINE: Health Care Tech May Still Expand

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The new Republican majority in the House has vowed to undo vast swaths of the Obama administration's agenda for health care reform. But analysts predict that technology projects will be mostly off limits.
''The tech spending is set to go on,'' said Lynne Dunbrack, an analyst in the Health Industry Insights unit for IDC, a technology research company. ''The better use of health care technology to reduce costs and improve care has bipartisan support.''
The latest evidence of the corporate enthusiasm for this market comes from AT&T, which on Thursday is announcing a new division called AT&T ForHealth. 
The new business is the result of 18 months of study and hiring, said Dan Walsh, an AT&T senior vice president. The new division's staff includes 300 sales people and 20 others with medical and computing backgrounds who will work with industry partners, doctors, hospitals and community groups to tailor health technology offerings, he said.
The AT&T move is an effort to increase sales by fine-tuning the company's basic networking and phone service to grab more of a market that appears poised for growth. Several major technology and telecommunications companies have recently created or aggressively enlarged their health technology portfolios, including Verizon, Cisco, General Electric and I.B.M.
The industry's optimism is partly a byproduct of the Obama administration's ambitious plan, backed by $19 billion in incentive payments, to get the nation's doctors and hospitals to adopt electronic health records over the next five years. That funding was in the economic recovery package in early 2009, and not the later health care reform legislation.
Computerized health records are seen as financial pump-priming -- and a technology foundation -- for further investments in health technology. To improve care, patient data must be shared by doctors, hospitals, clinics and labs, if treatments are to be coordinated. So regional and statewide hubs for sharing data, called health information exchanges, must be set up, providing another related market for technology suppliers.
AT&T will offer data-center and hosting technology for these exchanges. It also plans to provide telehealth services for remote diagnosis and treatment, and a wide range of support for preventive and disease management applications on smartphones.
Consumer health applications on iPhones and other smartphones are proliferating to help people monitor diet and exercise and manage chronic conditions like diabetes. That should drive sales of smartphones and data services for AT&T.
''And mobile health applications can remove some of the challenge of people managing their own health as the population ages,'' said Jason Hess, an analyst for KLAS, a research firm.
Mr. Walsh of AT&T said: ''There's a natural fit for us in this business, especially if we get the right partners.''
One of them is Wound Technology Network, which specializes in the care of chronic wounds, defined as those that take 30 days or more to heal. Founded in 2000, the company employs nurse practitioners and physician assistants to treat patients in their homes. They communicate with doctors who are wound experts in a company telehealth center. In the past, the company used first video devices and later laptop videoconferencing in homes.
The home field force now uses specialized HTC Fuze phones, Microsoft software, a mobile videoconferencing application from a start-up called iVisit, and the AT&T network service.
''We've moved it to the smartphone,'' explained George Pollack, chief technology officer of Wound Technology Network. The company estimates that it can reduce the cost of traditional wound care at hospitals and clinics by 80 percent.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Fresh Off Victories, Republicans Share Their Plans

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Rand Paul, the newly elected senator from Kentucky who received ardent Tea Party backing, said Sunday that the movement's success was ''equal parts chastisement'' to Democrats and Republicans, particularly on the issue of the ballooning federal debt.
''You know, Republicans doubled the debt when we were in charge and then Democrats are tripling the debt,'' he said on ''This Week With Christiane Amanpour'' on ABC. 
To rein in annual deficits and cut that debt, he said he would reduce the federal work force and its wages by 10 percent and freeze hiring. He said an average federal worker earns $120,000 in wages and benefits a year, twice what an average worker in the private sector earns.
Congress, he said, should also consider raising the age of eligibility for retirement benefits under Social Security and apportioning those benefits on the basis of a means test. The military budget, he said, should not be spared and such cuts might require an earlier withdrawal from Afghanistan.
''The Tea Party is about the debt,'' he said. ''It is concerned and worried that we're inheriting or passing along this debt to our kids and our grandkids.''
Asked whether the Tea Party was ''co-optable,'' by the culture of Washington, Mr. Paul replied, ''actually the Tea Party is co-opting Washington.''
''We're proud, we're strong, we're loud and we're going to co-opt,'' he said, ''And in fact I think we're already shaping the debate.''
In the wake of the Republicans' decisive showing in the midterm elections, in which the party won control of the House by capturing 60 seats and gained six seats in the Senate, Republicans dominated most of the Sunday television news programs.
Despite post-election talk of working with President Obama, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, took a hard line on one of the most pressing issues facing the government -- whether to extend tax cuts put into effect during the Bush administration for those earning more than $250,000.
Mr. McConnell said rejecting an extension would amount to tax increases in the middle of a recession and would raise taxes on ''750,000 of our most productive small businesses,'' whose payrolls support 25 percent of the American work force.
''Small business is the biggest job generator in America,'' he said on ''Face the Nation'' on CBS.
Nevertheless, he said, Republican leaders are ''happy to talk to the president about that and all the other issues that he has on his mind.'' He did not rule out a temporary extension of the tax cuts for perhaps two years or so.
''We're willing to start talking about getting an extension of some kind so that taxes don't go up on anybody,'' Mr. McConnell said.
Addressing the Obama health care plan, he said his preference was to repeal or replace it, but falling short of that he would consider ways of blocking financing for agencies like the Internal Revenue Service that are charged with enforcing the health care law. Mr. McConnell said the Republicans had ''a commitment to the American people to keep this awful 2,700-page monstrosity that took over one-sixth of our economy from going into effect.''
In an interview broadcast Sunday night on ''60 Minutes'' on CBS, Mr. Obama blamed the tone and rhetoric he adopted with his opponents for disappointing Americans. The president signaled, however, that he was ready ''to have a serious conversation'' with Republicans on issues including the Bush-era tax cuts.
Mr. McConnell, in his ''Face the Nation'' appearance, said the major issues for many Americans were the level of federal spending, the debt and the health care law. The voters, he said, ''wanted to have a midcourse correction.''
''I think he's a good salesman,'' Mr. McConnell said of the president. ''I think his problem was not his sales job. It was the product.''

HEADLINE: The Unready Republicans

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
When a political party suffers two consecutive thrashings at the polls, its supporters can usually look forward to a long period of exile -- a time to lick wounds, settle scores, feud over policy and gradually map out a road back to relevance.
Not so the Obama-era Republicans. They were thumped in 2006 and left for dead after 2008, but all it took was a 9.6 unemployment rate and an unpopular liberal majority to bring them roaring back. The wilderness era lasted all of 22 months: conservatives had barely started arguing about what went wrong during the Bush era before the American public handed them the House of Representatives again. 
To his credit, John Boehner, the presumptive speaker of the House, seems aware of how little the Republicans have done to earn their summons back to power. His rhetoric since last Tuesday's sweep has been self-effacing, and his promises have been limited and largely procedural. Newt Gingrich took power in 1994 claiming a mandate and brandishing a list of legislative priorities, but Boehner has kept his cards closer to the vest. ''It is the president who sets the agenda for our government,'' he told supporters on Tuesday night -- not the kind of statement, to put it mildly, that leading Republicans issued in '94.
The modest Mr. Boehner leads a party with much to be modest about. Gingrich could brandish an agenda because he had an agenda -- a raft of conservative policy proposals, on welfare and crime and taxes, that couldn't get any traction in a Democratic-controlled Congress. Today's Republicans, by contrast, know what they're against (the health care bill, tax increases, cap and trade) but have a world of trouble saying what they might actually be for.
Instead, they tend to fall back on the reassuring story they've been spinning for the last two years, in which they lost to the Democrats only because they failed to hold the line on spending. It's a narrative that flatters conservative self-regard, while absolving Republicans of the obligation to think too deeply about policy. All they need to do is say ''no'' to bigger government, and the rest will take care of itself.
This strategy has worked for them in opposition, thanks to the Democratic Party's haste and hubris. But it isn't a blueprint for governance, and it ducks the real reasons that the Republicans lost their majority. While the Bush administration overspent, it wasn't spending and deficits that turned the country against conservative domestic policy between 2004 and 2008. It was the fact that the Republican majority seemed to have no answers to Middle America's economic struggles, and no appetite for the structural reforms required to keep the United States competitive.
This is even more true today. The United States is facing three overlapping crises -- the short-term challenge of a jobless recovery, the long-term crisis of entitlement spending and, in the medium term, an economy that wasn't delivering for the middle class even before the financial crisis struck. The Democratic Party may have the wrong answers to these problems. But the Republican Party as an institution often seems to have no answers whatsoever.
Some individual Republicans make a better showing. Mitch Daniels, the governor of Indiana, has a proposal for payroll tax relief that might help jump-start economic growth. Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin congressman, has his famous ''roadmap'' to a sustainable entitlement system. Judd Gregg, the outgoing Republican senator from New Hampshire, was collaborating with Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, on tax reform that could attract bipartisan support. And during the health care and financial reform debates, the pages of conservative magazines bristled with plausiblealternatives to the Democratic bills.
Yet the party hasn't united around any of these ideas. And what consensus does exist is insufficient to the nation's challenges. The country needs fundamental tax reform rather than the permanent extension of the Bush tax cuts. It needs a health care overhaul that doesn't merely return the system to the pre-Obamacare status quo. It needs a plan to slow the growth of Social Security and Medicare, not just a discretionary spending freeze.
On many of these fronts, Congressional Republicans will protest that there's nothing to be done so long as Barack Obama occupies the White House. Hence Boehner's calculated attempt to lower expectations; hence Mitch McConnell's insistence that the most important thing Republicans can do is work toward the president's defeat in 2012.
But even if they're right, that's all the more reason to spend the next two years getting serious about policy. It will profit neither conservatism nor the country if Republicans take the White House two Novembers hence, and find themselves as unprepared to govern as they are today.

HEADLINE: Online Security Guard for the U.S.

BYLINE: By NICK BILTON

 BODY:
Vivek Kundra is the chief information officer of the United States. His job is to help shape the use of technology in government and build tools to help the public navigate the incredible amount of data and information available.
Mr. Kundra started his career in government in 2001 as the information technology director for Arlington County, Va., and then went on to work for Gov. Tim Kaine of Virginia. Later, he worked for Mayor Adrian Fenty of the District of Columbia before President Obama appointed him to the White House post in 2009. The following is an edited interview with Mr. Kundra:
What does it mean to be the chief information officer for the United States?
I have four priorities. First is to make sure we effectively manage the $80 billion in information technology funding for the government. Second, we want to optimize where that money is spent, driving efficiency and effectiveness across the entire government. Third is to create an open, transparent and participatory government, creating Web sites like data.gov. Lastly we are focused on cybersecurity, creating a new real-time security posture. 
Can you talk a little about cybersecurity?
We've been pushing really aggressively to change the culture in the government when it comes to cybersecurity. In the old model, the government employees would write reports, which doesn't make sense anymore for the real-time threats we see today.
What do you do differently to attack new threats?
Now we've been moving towards creating red teams and blue teams that can respond to a threat in real time. So we're shifting our focus away from writing reports to actually fix the problems.
What are red teams and blue teams?The red teams work for the Department of Homeland Security, and they are essentially hackers going after our own systems, trying to find vulnerabilities. Then they hand over the threats they find to the blue team. The blue team then goes in and fixes the problem.
So you have hackers working in the government?Yes. We have hackers that are on our side to help protect us from hackers and countries that want to cause harm.
You've put some public sites in the cloud, haven't you? I'm thinking of Recovery.gov, which provides data about government spending on the economic recovery.I've been pushing cloud computing so we can close the technology gap in government. Recovery.gov is a perfect example; we recently moved it to the Amazon cloud. We did the same thing with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the grants portion of the government.
Why do you want to move public Web sites, like Recovery.gov, to cloud computing?Taking advantage of the cloud for consumer services allows us to abstract away from infrastructure investments, where we don't have to buy, build and manage server farms. To help with this consolidation effort, we're moving some of our services into the cloud.
But are there risks to putting government sites in the cloud?There's a huge difference between a government infrastructure in the cloud and putting a Web site like Recovery.gov, a consumer-facing site, in the cloud. By moving Recovery.gov to the Amazon cloud, we saved $750,000 annually. By moving GSA.gov, which is also a consumer site, we saved $1.2 million a year.
What are you doing with data.gov?Well, when we started the site in May of 2009, we had 47 data sets available to the public. Today we have 274,000 data sets available. We're promoting transparency across all facets of government, and making data available is the first step. We're adding hundreds of interesting data points from agencies and on every aspect of government -- from health care to education to product safety and defense.
And what are people doing with these data sets?We've seen some amazing apps from these data sets. One person, for example, created an iPhone app, CPSC Recalls, which stands for the Consumer Product Safety Commission. This app compiles all the product recalls in the United States, and then a citizen can use the camera on their mobile phone to scan a product in a store and see if it's had any recalls or alerts.
It seems that government and citizens are working together with these data sets?Absolutely. We've moved to a model of co-innovation, where the American people can help create value in a way that we've never been able to do before. The recalls app was originally created by a random developer and then we, the government, created a newer version of the app and released it for the Android platform.
Have you had push-back with the amount of data available online?Well, it's been very successful so far. There's a few different lenses to this. There's using data for accountability to make sure money is being distributed appropriately. Then there's the data that can be used to help Americans make the right choices whether it's around health care or transportation. And the third is to create a platform for innovation, in the context of the economy, like creating new economic opportunities.
How do you ensure that the data is secure?Before each data set is added to data.gov, the respective agencies go through it to make sure there isn't any personal information. After a thorough scrub, it's put through de-identification software to make sure there isn't any private information or information that affects national security.
That sounds like an episode of C.S.I.The data.gov platform is huge and very important. We have to ensure that we protect people's privacy, and I've worked very closely with the privacy folks, including the A.C.L.U., to ensure this.
Do you use social networks within government?In the White House, we've been using the social tools available today. For example, we rolled out the 2011 budget through Facebook. That helped us leverage an existing network of millions of people without having to build our own infrastructure. We don't have to spend billions of dollars developing these systems, which would take years; instead we can just put it on Facebook.
Are you the White House geek?I think there are a lot of geeks in the White House. I'm definitely not the most geeky.
Are there days that working in government can be draining?Most days I get into the White House at around 4:30 a.m., and I don't leave until 10 p.m. It's intense, and it's also a lot of fun because we have the ability to deliver real change to Americans' lives.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Obama Says Vote Turned on Economy

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON President Obama said in an interview broadcast Sunday night that he views last week's mid-term Congressional elections as ''a referendum
on the economy'' rather than a referendum on him, his policies or the Democratic Party.
While he said he should be held accountable for the economy as the nation's leader, he did not accept the suggestion that he pursued the wrong agenda over the last two years, and he focused blame on his failure to build public support for what he was doing or to change the way Washington works. 
In a session taped for CBS's ''60 Minutes'' before Mr. Obama left for Asia, the correspondent Steve Kroft pointed out to the president that Republicans view the election as a referendum on him and the Democrats, and asked if he agreed. ''I think first and foremost it was a referendum on the economy,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And the party in power was held responsible for an economy that is still underperforming.''
The interview was Mr. Obama's first since the election and largely tracked the sentiments he expressed at his news conference the day after the vote.
The president's interpretation of the election underscored the contrasting messages the two parties have taken from the elections. Republicans won at least 60 more seats in the House to take control, the largest such gain by either party since 1948, and picked up six more seats in the Senate, putting them close to parity with the Democrats, who maintained a much slimmer majority. Republicans also scored significant victories in governor's and state legislative races.
Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader slated to become speaker, and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican minority leader, have said the election was a clear verdict on Mr. Obama's policies. Mr. Boehner told ABC News last week that the president is experiencing ''some denial'' and Mr. McConnell repeated Sunday that the issue was not the message but the substance.
''I think the president believes that somehow he didn't his product was good but he just didn't sell it well,'' Mr. McConnell said on ''Face the Nation'' on CBS. ''I think he's a good salesman. I think his problem was not his sales job. It was the product. The American people simply did not like what the president and this Congress were doing substantively.''
Surveys of voters at polling places showed that 37 percent said last Tuesday they were casting their votes to express opposition to Mr. Obama's policies, while 24 percent said they were supporting his policies. The rest said he was not the impetus for their vote. Those numbers are almost identical to those in 2006 when voters cast judgment on President George W. Bush's policies and Democrats seized control of Congress in a mid-term election they cast as a referendum on the incumbent president.
Mr. Obama made clear in his interview that he sees the economy as the main source of voter frustration. With unemployment stuck for months at 9.6 percent, no other president in decades has gone into a mid-term election with the jobless rate as high for as long. Nearly 9 in 10 voters last week expressed worry about the direction of the economy; four in 10 said reducing deficits should be the first priority while 4 in 10 said job creation should be a priority.
In his interview, Mr. Obama focused on the latter group, which tended to vote more Democratic than those concerned about deficits. To the notion that voters may have sent a message for smaller, less costly, more accountable government, Mr. Obama responded, ''First and foremost, they want jobs and economic growth in this country.''
Pressed by Mr. Kroft, he then added that voters also care about spending. ''There is no doubt that folks are concerned about debt and deficits,'' he said. ''I think that is absolutely a priority. And by the way, that's a concern that I had before I was even sworn in.''
Echoing comments from his news conference, the president expressed his willingness to negotiate with Mr. Boehner and Mr. McConnell on tax cuts and other issues but gave no specific examples of where he would change his position to build consensus.
The president offered praise for the Republican leaders and expressed regret that at times he had gone too far in his campaign rhetoric attacking the opposition. ''Both John and Mitch are very smart,'' he said. ''They're capable. They have been able to, I think, organize the Republican caucus very effectively in opposition to a lot of the things that we tried to do over the last two years. And that takes real political skill.''
Without mentioning any examples, he said he bore responsibility for some of the tenor of political discourse lately. ''I've been guilty of that. It's not just them,'' he said. ''Part of my promise to the American people when I was elected was to maintain the kind of tone that says we can disagree without being disagreeable. And I think over the course of two years, there have been times where I've slipped on that commitment.''

HEADLINE: Turnout Appears Light in Myanmar's Election

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES; Seth Mydans contributed reporting from Bangkok.

 BODY:
YANGON, MYANMAR -- Polling places appeared nearly empty around Yangon on Sunday as the rest of the city went about its business during the first election in 20 years in this closed and tightly controlled nation.
The process was expected to cement military rule behind a civilian facade but also to open the door slightly to possible shifts in the dynamics of power.
''It was an empty room,'' said one voter who emerged from a polling place where he said he had spoiled his ballot in protest. 
Though the new Constitution guarantees the military a leading role in the state apparatus, this will be the first civilian government in the country, formerly called Burma, since a military coup in 1962. With votes being tabulated locally, it was not known how soon the results would be announced.
In the last election, in 1990, the party headed by the pro-democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi won a decisive victory, but the generals annulled the result.
The appearance of electoral legitimacy and civilian institutions may make it easier for Myanmar's neighbors to embrace what has been a pariah state, but it is unlikely by itself to ease a policy of isolation and economic sanctions among Western nations.
Speaking in Mumbai on Sunday, President Barack Obama of the United States said that the voting was ''neither free nor fair'' and failed to meet internationally accepted standards associated with legitimate elections.
He said the elections ''demonstrate again the regime's continued preference for repression and restriction over inclusion and transparency.''
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who said a few months ago that Washington would try a new policy of engagement, also condemned the election, saying its flaws ''once again expose the abuses of the military junta.''
In an hour's tour of Yangon on Sunday morning, there was very little sign on the streets or at polling places of a police or military presence.
Half a dozen voting centers appeared almost empty, and a resident of the country's second city, Mandalay, said that voting had been light there as well.
''I have several reasons not to vote, but I will tell you just one,'' said Soe Naing Oo, a resident of Magway, a town several hours' drive north of Yangon. ''Auntie Suu told us not to vote.''
He was referring to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, whose party, the National League for Democracy, was not contesting what it called a sham election and had called for a boycott.
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, now 65, has been held under house arrest for most of the past 20 years. Her latest term of detention ends one week after the election, and the junta has hinted that she could be released. It has often made similar hints in the past, and there was no way to know what restrictions might be imposed if she were set free.
Some analysts hold out hope that the election could bring incremental change to Myanmar. In September, Kurt M. Campbell, the United States' assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs, said that it appeared that the vote would lack international legitimacy but that it might create ''new players, new power relationships, new structures inside the country'' that would bear watching.
There were widespread reports of irregularities like marking ballots for voters, advertising the military-backed party at a polling place, and ballot boxes that had been stuffed or tampered with.
There were reports that members of some enterprises and offices had been told they would lose their jobs if they did not vote.
Voters were electing a 665-member, two-chamber national Parliament and 14 regional Parliaments. A total of 25 percent of those seats will be reserved for the military, and several senior military officials resigned to run as civilians. Military officers are to head the top ministries of interior, defense and border affairs, and the commander in chief of the armed forces will have power to take control of the country in times of emergency.
Thirty-seven parties were on the ballot, but the military appeared to have taken pains to assure the victory of parties it supported by severely restricting campaigns, setting high fees for candidacy, censoring political statements, controlling the media, barring outside election monitors and canceling the vote in unstable ethnic minority areas. Hundreds of the strongest potential opposition candidates were in prison or under house arrest.
Each candidate was given 15 minutes on national television, but the censored, pretaped speeches had the feel of confessions at a Stalinist show trial.
The ambassador from North Korea led a government-sponsored tour of selected voting places after the embassies representing European Union countries and the United States declined to participate.
The Sunday elections were the first for a large share of voters. Anyone 37 or younger was not eligible to vote two decades ago. With half of the population of Myanmar 26 or younger, many voters seemed puzzled by how the process actually worked.
A restaurant owner in Bago, the former royal capital 66 kilometers, or 42 miles, north of Yangon, said his staff of about a dozen workers did not fully understand voting procedures. ''I told them you have to tick a box, and that's it,'' the owner said.
For some people, the memory of the stolen election in 1990 was still fresh.
''We have decided not to go the polling station,'' said Nyo Nyo, a 68-year-old retired schoolteacher who said all of her former colleagues and family were choosing not to vote. ''I already gave my vote, in 1990, to the party I believed in,'' she said. ''I don't need to vote again.''
Half an hour from Bago, amid the golden stalks of rice paddies ready for harvest, a family of farmers said they understood the system well after daily broadcasts on state radio instructing them on how to vote. The father knew the voting hours and how many candidates were running.
Concerns about the overall fairness of the elections were widespread. Phone Win, an independent candidate running for a parliamentary seat in Yangon, said a major unknown in the election was the number of people, especially civil servants or police and military, who took part in advance voting.
The actual vote counting was to be done with representatives of each candidate present, but pre-voting takes place out of sight of election officials, Mr. Phone Win said.
He added that many people might stay away from the polls for a familiar reason in Myanmar. ''People are afraid,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Indian Puts Question On Pakistan To Obama

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
MUMBAI, India -- When Michelle Obama, the first lady, introduced her husband to a group of college students here on Sunday, she urged them to ask him ''tough questions.''
They did.
''What is your take or opinion about jihad?'' came the first question for President Obama at a town-hall-style meeting at St. Xavier's College. Next up were queries about spirituality, Gandhi, the American midterm elections and his government's negotiations with the Taliban.
Finally, there was the question Mr. Obama confessed he had been waiting for: Why hasn't the United States labeled Pakistan ''a terrorist state''? 
''Pakistan is an enormous country; it is a strategically important country,'' Mr. Obama began, meandering around to a defense of his administration. He said its policy was to ''work with the Pakistani government in order to eradicate this extremism that we consider a cancer within the country that can potentially engulf the country.''
The diplomatic response about the neighbor that India views with suspicion was indicative of the fine line Mr. Obama has walked on the topic of terrorism while here. On Saturday, his first day here, he faced criticism in the local press when he paid homage to victims and survivors of the 2008 terrorist siege in Mumbai without mentioning that the gunmen were Pakistani or suggesting, that some groups in Pakistan pose a terrorist threat.
While the students at St. Xavier's, a 141-year-old Jesuit institution in this pretty seaside city, were exceedingly polite to Mr. Obama -- in interviews many said they admired him -- they seemed unafraid to get straight to the point, even if Mr. Obama did not always get straight to his.
''Well,'' he said, tackling the question about jihad, ''the phrase jihad has a lot of meanings within Islam and is subject to a lot of different interpretations.''
He carefully avoided saying that he was opposed to jihad -- which has several meanings, including both holy war and a personal quest for self-improvement -- and instead said: ''I think all of us recognize that this great religion in the hands of a few extremists has been distorted to justify violence towards innocent people that is never justified. And so, I think, one of the challenges that we face is, how do we isolate those who have these distorted notions of religious war.''
Sunday's session, in a sunny outdoor courtyard surrounded by Gothic buildings, came on the second day of a 10-day, four-nation swing that will also take Mr. Obama to Indonesia, his boyhood home for four years; South Korea; and Japan. He is spending the longest stretch, three days, in India. He left Mumbai later Sunday for the capital, New Delhi, where he was expected to address Parliament on Monday.
While Mr. Obama was dancing around questions -- figuratively speaking -- on Sunday, he also participated in some literal dancing, showing off some moves that, to the delight of photographers traveling with him, are likely to provide iconic images of his trip. Mr. Obama's short performance came after student dancers doing a show for him implored him to join in.
The White House has cast the Asia trip as an economic mission that will also strengthen American diplomatic ties with emerging democracies and established ones. On Sunday, Mr. Obama toured a small technology show here with the aim of showcasing American partnerships with India in expanding agriculture.
Officials billed the college meeting as a chance for Mr. Obama to connect with average Indians. But for a president still bruised from the trouncing his party took in last week's elections, the appearance was also a chance to come before the kind of sympathetic crowd he now has trouble attracting at home.
''We call him the world king, king of the world,'' said Chetman Rawal, 20, who studies commerce at the college. ''I think he will change the world.''
It seemed a common sentiment. In interviews, students and faculty members here uniformly spoke kindly of Mr. Obama, praising everything from ''his cuteness,'' as one female student said, to his basketball skills, to his respect for ''Gandhian principles.'' On the question of how he applies those principles, Mr. Obama sounded a note of humility.
''I'm often frustrated by how far I fall short of their example,'' he said, referring to Mohandas K. Gandhi, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Abraham Lincoln, all of whom he said he was studying. ''But I do think that at my best what I'm trying to do is to apply principles that fundamentally come down to something shared in all the world's religions, which is to see yourself in other people.''
Indians followed the American elections closely, said the Rev. Lawrie Ferrao, director of the institute of communications at the college. But he said people here were more interested in another election -- the one in which Mr. Obama himself ran in 2008.
''The admiration for him with regard to his campaign, his optimism, his charismatic movement and charismatic leadership, that I think has not faded off yet,'' Father Ferrao said. As to the midterms, he gave an explanation Mr. Obama himself might have offered: ''He was given an economy which was unsustainable.''
The president himself, when questioned at St. Xavier's about the elections, pledged some ''midcourse corrections and adjustments,'' though he was not specific about his plans. But in his commentary on Gandhi, he offered a lesson he had learned, one that perhaps provides some insight into how he might be feeling these days.
''On this journey,'' Mr. Obama said, ''you're going to experience setbacks and you have to be persistent and stubborn, and you just have to keep on going at it. And you'll never roll the boulder all the way up the hill, but you may get it part of the way up.''

HEADLINE: Pentagon Openings Give Obama New Options

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With critical decisions ahead on the war in Afghanistan, President Obama is about to receive an unusual opportunity to reshape the Pentagon's leadership, naming a new defense secretary as well as several top generals and admirals in the next several months.
It is a rare confluence of tenure calendars and personal calculations, coming midway through Mr. Obama's first term and on the heels of an election that challenged his domestic policies. His choices could have lasting consequences for his national security agenda, perhaps strengthening his hand over a military with which he has often clashed, and are likely to have an effect beyond the next election, whether he wins or loses.
That is all the more reason that Mr. Obama's choices are certain to face scrutiny in a narrowly divided Senate, whose Republican leadership has declared itself intent on defeating him.
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has said he plans to retire next year, while the terms of four members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are scheduled to end: Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman; Gen. James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman; Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the Army chief; and Adm. Gary Roughead, the chief of naval operations. 
Andrew J. Bacevich, a retired Army officer who is a professor of history and international relations at Boston University, said this round of replacements, coming after two years of difficult and sometimes intense wrangling over how to carry on the war in Afghanistan, ''is particularly important, and is likely to prove particularly difficult.''
''The challenge facing the president,'' Mr. Bacevich said, ''will be to identify leaders who will provide him with disinterested advice, informed by a concern for the national interest, and, in doing so, to avoid either the appearance or the reality of politicizing the senior leadership.''
At the top of the new pantheon of military power, the president needs a heavyweight to succeed Mr. Gates, an unexpected holdover from the Bush administration who stayed longer than many expected to become perhaps the most influential member of the Obama cabinet.
White House officials say the president is not prepared to announce any decisions on his new slate of Pentagon and military leaders for next year.
But speculation for the top Pentagon job in recent days has included two respected veterans on military matters, both with bipartisan credentials and hands-on experience: John J. Hamre, a deputy defense secretary in the Clinton administration who now leads the Center for Strategic and International Studies while running the Defense Policy Board, an advisory panel to Mr. Gates; and Representative Ike Skelton of Missouri, who lost his seat last week and with it the chairmanship of the House Armed Services Committee.
Another name certain to be on Mr. Obama's list is Michele A. Flournoy, currently the Pentagon's under secretary for policy and one of the foremost national security specialists of the up-and-coming generation. Her appointment would allow Mr. Obama to claim another first in naming a woman to become defense secretary, something he could also accomplish by moving Hillary Rodham Clinton into the job from secretary of state.
Other possible candidates include Ray Mabus, the Navy secretary who formerly served as governor of Mississippi and ambassador to Saudi Arabia; Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, an Army veteran; and Richard J. Danzig, a former Navy secretary.
It also is tricky to pick members of the Joint Chiefs, who are not only the president's senior military advisers on questions of war but also the leaders of the individual military services, at the fulcrum of competing missions and constituencies that are never easy to balance.
A thorough revamping of the high command is especially complex at a time of persistent challenges on so many fronts, like the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the threats from Iran and North Korea and the challenges from Russia and China, all while facing the constant risk of a terrorist attack.
The new military leadership, after years of war and economic crisis, also has to cope with strains on military budgets, while caring for the health and morale of a force that simultaneously must be modernized.
There are lingering strains between top civilian aides to Mr. Obama and the military brass, over issues as diverse as how to fight and wind down the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and how to allow military service by openly gay troops.
Any commander in chief is theoretically free to replace his top civilian and military subordinates whenever he chooses, but it rarely happens all at once.
Traditionally, a new president appoints a new defense secretary and allows the chiefs to serve out their tours, which tend to fall more or less randomly across a president's term in office. Mr. Obama was the first to carry over a defense secretary who had served a president of a different party, and Mr. Gates's expected departure now falls coincidentally along with four members of the six-person Joint Chiefs. (The Marines got a new commandant, Gen. James F. Amos, last month, and the Air Force chief, Gen. Norton A. Schwartz, retires in 2012 unless he is rotated into another senior position, which is possible.)
The changes in 2011 are so unusual, and the national security risks today so significant, that General Cartwright, the vice chairman, offered to retire a year early, so that a new officer would be in place for some continuity, according to Pentagon and administration officials familiar with the discussions.
But General Cartwright -- known for his fluency in nuts-and-bolts issues like missile defense, cyberwarfare and procurement -- has been described as one of the president's favorite officers, and was asked to stay on. He is very likely on the list of those who would be considered for promotion to chairman.
When Mr. Obama had opportunities in recent weeks to replace top members of his White House inner circle, including his chief of staff and his national security adviser, he opted to replace his inaugural ''team of rivals,'' populated by outsiders, by promoting trusted confidants and moving toward creating, in essence, a team of insiders.
So the questions before Mr. Obama include trust and comfort and assurances that his policy decisions will be executed the way he wants.
The expected candidates are all familiar to the White House, and all those on any list of suitable officers have blue-chip resumes but differing temperaments.
One of the first questions the president will have to answer for himself is what to do with Gen. David H. Petraeus, the former Iraq commander asked to rush to Afghanistan when Mr. Obama relieved two commanders there in a row.
Supporters say that General Petraeus has earned the chairman's job by reason of experience, intellect and sacrifice, but that may not satisfy some political advisers around the president, who still resent the officers involved in the Afghanistan-Pakistan review last year. General Petraeus also could remain longer in Afghanistan or could be offered the job of Army chief or that of supreme allied commander in Europe, a post once held by Dwight D. Eisenhower and so hardly a dead end.
In addition to Generals Cartwright and Petraeus, another potential candidate for chairman is Adm. James G. Stavridis, currently the NATO commander and one of the Navy's most intellectual officers; he likewise could be slotted into the job of chief of naval operations.
Three other highly regarded Army officers remain in the hunt for any of the top jobs. They include Gen. Ray Odierno, a three-time Iraq commander now in charge of the military's Joint Forces Command; Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, who had two tours in Iraq before serving as acting commander of American forces in the Middle East and who now oversees Army training and doctrine; and Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, a two-time Iraq commander who is the Army's vice chief of staff, with a focus on improving care for wounded soldiers.

HEADLINE: REUTERS BREAKINGVIEWS; The Lowest Yield On Company Debt

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY SIFERT and ROBERT CYRAN

 BODY:
There's a new game in corporate America: the chief financial officer who pays the lowest yield on his firm's latest debt wins.
On the leaderboard are chief financial officers from blue-chip borrowers like Wal-Mart, Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson. But being the envy of your peers may have some drawbacks.
Superlow interest rates have made it a C.F.O.'s world. Balance sheet repair is easier than ever, and debt investors are plenty and eager. Pity the poor chief executive: sluggish economic growth and unreliable equity markets have hamstrung merger activity. Despite this enforced boardroom conservatism, C.F.O.'s are still raising record amounts of debt capital. Uses of proceeds vary but a main driver is simply its low cost. Perhaps equally important are bragging rights among other financial officers. 
Coke's financial chief, Gary P. Fayard, must have had Wal-Mart in mind last week when the soda company priced a three-year bond with a 0.75 percent coupon. That tied the record low coupon for a three-year note set by the retailer in October. Two weeks ago, Colgate Palmolive's C.F.O., Stephen C. Patrick, probably had Wal-Mart's playbook, too. The company priced a five-year bond at 1.375 percent. Coke and Colgate almost make Wal-Mart, which borrowed at 1.5 percent, look as though it is overpaying.
That may be fitting. After all, Wal-Mart's chief financial officer, Thomas M. Schoewe, was the envy of the corporate world in July when his company priced the lowest coupons ever on 10-year and 30-year bonds. Wal-Mart took over the top spot that Johnson & Johnson held since May 2003, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Johnson & Johnson's finance chief, Dominic J. Caruso, struck back in August, regaining the lead in 10-year and 30-year bonds. Colgate has since matched Johnson & Johnson on the 10-year note. San Diego Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and Microsoft have all tied the 4.5 percent record coupon for a 30-year bond set by Johnson & Johnson in August.
All these piles of cheap cash do have some drawbacks. Chief executives may feel inclined to spend it on frivolous deals. And as savvy bond investors, chief financial officers also know they aren't doing themselves any favors. The lower they push coupons, with the help of the Fed, the lower the expected returns on the pension funds they, themselves, must manage.
Toronto's Caution
If Canada thinks a hole in the ground is a national gem, TMX, which operates the Toronto and Montreal stock exchanges, probably qualifies as a diamond. As a result, TMX is likely to sit out further sector consolidation. That's a shame, as doing a deal with a foreign buyer might help both the exchange and Canada.
Canada's rejection last week of BHP Billiton's bid for the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan has injected uncertainty into foreign bids for any sizable companies, particularly resource groups. The decision has a strong whiff of protectionism.
That is a problem for potential suitors of TMX. Any buyer wishing to acquire more than a 10 percent stake must receive approval from Ontario and Quebec securities regulators, and a foreign buyer seeking control would need a nod from the federal government of Canada.
True, the $2.6 billion company's shares have not suffered immediately from the Potash decision. But that is probably because of a sharp rise in commodities prices after the Federal Reserve's actions last week. If anything, this highlights TMX's attractions as a marketplace for the global mining and natural resources industries.
Yet consolidation is heating up, and TMX could be left behind. Last month, Singapore's exchange agreed to buy its Australian rival. If the deal goes through, it ratchets up the competition for Toronto. The combination of Asian capital with Australian expertise in listing and financing miners creates a potent new rival. That was the clear intention of the two when they announced their merger.
For the moment, Toronto punches above its weight in mining, especially when it comes to small, risky companies. About half the world's mining groups are listed on Toronto's main exchange and its Venture Exchange. Moreover, the city has built up a system of banks, advisers, specialized analysts and investors, lawyers, publicists and accountants around natural resources businesses.
Being part of a global marketplace, whether it's London, the proposed Singapore-Australian nexus or New York might add to this by injecting new technology and tapping further flows of international capital.
Canada may decide otherwise, as it did with Potash. But if the world's finance-hungry mining firms send their listings and capital elsewhere, the country will have only its protectionist leanings to blame.

HEADLINE: 2010: An Aligning Election

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: The 2010 elections were remarkable for their orderliness, tending to reinforce existing political coalitions.

 BODY:
Elections with results as dramatic as this year's are sometimes referred to as "realigning elections." The term -- although somewhat ambiguous and overused -- usually refers to an election in which one party not only gains a significant amount of power, but coalitions also shift, the signature of which is usually that the rising party performs particularly well in certain geographic regions or among certain demographic groups.
The 1980 election, for instance, was arguably the beginning of a long-term shift toward Republicans in America's suburbs, with Jimmy Carter's share of the suburban vote dropping from 53 percent in 1976 to 37 percent in 1980: the 16-point swing against Mr. Carter was about twice the one he suffered in cities or rural areas. Likewise, in 1994, the shift against Democrats was particularly sharp in the South: 19 of the 52 representatives they lost came from that part of the country.
The 2010 elections, by contrast, were remarkable for their orderliness -- and they tended to reinforce, to an almost uncanny degree, existing political coalitions.
Below is a chart that arranges America's 435 Congressional districts from those (on the left) that gave the highest percentage of their vote to Barack Obama in 2008 to those (on the right) that gave the highest share to John McCain; the chart then compares which party each district had elected to the House before and after Tuesday night.
In 2008 -- even though President Obama was on the ballot -- his vote share was only a moderately good predictor of the results of the election to the House. Democrats won 16 seats in which Mr. Obama carried less than 40 percent of the vote, and 50 in which he had less than half of it.
After Tuesday, however -- assuming that current results from the several races that remain uncalled by The Associated Press hold -- Democrats will hold just 12 seats in which Mr. Obama failed to receive a majority of the vote (down from 50!) and just three seats in which he had 40 percent or less (down from 16).
Republicans, meanwhile, will now hold 55 seats in which Mr. Obama carried a majority in 2008 -- up from 28. But mostly, they're in places where Mr. Obama had only a slim majority. They'll hold only 14 seats in which Mr. Obama had at least 55 percent of the vote (up from eight before). And they'll hold just one seat, Illinois's 10th Congressional District, in which Mr. Obama got at least 60 percent of the vote (he received 61 percent there instead); this figure is actually down from four seats before.
The next chart presents this data in a somewhat different way: by means of a logistic regression analysis that predicts the probability of Democrats controlling the seat based on Mr. Obama's vote share. You can see that the regression curve is now much steeper. Whereas, prior to the election, every seat where Mr. Obama had won somewhat from 35 to 62 percent was in at least some reasonable degree of doubt -- each party had at least a 10 percent chance of controlling such a seat -- that range has now been narrowed to seats in which Mr. Obama took from 47 to 62 percent of the vote. (Put another way, Democrats lost almost every incumbent they had in districts where Mr. Obama had less than 47 percent of the vote.)
We can also go beyond the winners and losers to look at the share of the vote that each candidate received. In 2008 -- in districts that were contested by both Democrats and Republicans -- Mr. Obama's vote share explained about 70 percent of the variance in the share of the vote for the Democratic candidate for the House.
In this year's midterms, however, the two variables were brought into somewhat sharper alignment: the vote for Mr. Obama now explains 83 percent of the variance in the Democratic vote for Congress.
Rather than a realigning election, then, 2010 served as more of an aligning election: Congressional districts behaved less independently from one another, and incumbency status mattered less. Instead, they hewed tightly to national trends and the overall partisanship of each district. Most of the House incumbents whose districts had been outliers before (mainly Democrats like Representative Gene Taylor of Mississippi, whose district gave just 31 percent of its vote to Mr. Obama, but also a couple of Republicans like Representative Joseph Cao of Louisiana) were forced into early retirement.
What does this mean for 2012? Democrats -- if they are expecting to do better than they did this time around -- might actually be pleased that elections have become so strongly aligned to partisan orientation. They now have just 12 seats in which Mr. Obama won a minority of the vote to defend -- whereas Republicans have 55 where he took the the majority. So if there is even a fairly modest shift back to Democrats in 2012, and the shift is again fairly uniform, they could be in a position to achieve quite a few gains.
Or, if the economy improves and -- having facilitated a more even balance of power in Washington -- the electorate becomes somewhat less angsty, the incumbent advantage could become stronger again, and the gains that Republicans made could prove to be relatively "sticky" -- as they were, for instance, after 1994. Plus, Republican inroads in governorships and statehouses on Tuesday night should give them more leverage over redistricting, so they'll be able to protect a few of their incumbents who otherwise might lose.
But generally it seems like we have entered a period in which races for Congress have become highly nationalized, and in which few potentially competitive races are conceded by either party and few incumbents are given a free pass. That could mean we'll continue to see some wild swings over the next several election cycles.

HEADLINE: Low Rates Hurt Bonds For Housing

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
It is not just retired savers who are struggling with a sharp reduction in their investment income as interest rates hover near zero. Hundreds of affordable housing projects across the country are feeling the pain, too.
That sets them apart from most borrowers in the municipal bond market, who see today's low rates as a rare spot of cheer amid shrinking tax revenues and rising pension costs.
But this battered collection of public borrowers is learning that low rates can be a two-edged sword -- one that can slice their credit ratings to the bone, as detailed in a report to be released Tuesday by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. 
These borrowers, primarily affordable housing projects across the country that are allowed to raise money in the tax-exempt bond market, had been relying on the interest they earned on their spare cash to help them pay off their outstanding bonds. Like other investors, they are now earning far less on those cash reserves than ever anticipated.
As a result, their bond ratings are being cut sharply, reducing the value of their bonds to investors and potentially making affordable housing less available or more expensive for senior citizens and lower-income families who rely on such projects for shelter.
The magnitude of the pain is clear in the report from Standard & Poor's, one of Wall Street's largest credit-rating agencies, of a sweeping review begun last spring of nearly 600 tax-exempt housing bonds.
The changes are stark. The number of AAA-rated bonds, the blue chips of the bond market, fell by more than half, to 271 from 552. The number of bonds in the ''junk'' category -- too low to be considered investment grade -- rose to 46 from just 9, and the agency said it anticipated that 10 of those issues could default over the next decade.
The ratings for 256 more bond issues were withdrawn, either because they were no longer outstanding or because the issuers did not respond to the agency's request for more information.
''We have seen years of record-low short-term interest rates cause stresses across the housing revenue bond spectrum,'' said Valerie White, senior director of tax-exempt housing at the rating agency. ''We have observed this to be particularly true of bonds whose revenues or cash flows rely on investment earnings from short-term investments such as money market funds.''
As a result, although the mortgages that secure the bonds are federally insured, the projects that issued the bonds are at greater risk of falling short of the cash needed to repay bondholders, the S.& P. analysts said.
One of the most severe downgrades was for the Riverside Plaza apartment project in downtown Minneapolis, a high-rise project once used as the backdrop for ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show.''
For the project, which is home to more than 4,000 people, the AAA rating on its outstanding bonds was cut to CCC, almost as low as a rating can fall unless the bond is on the brink of default. That six-step tumble was the most severe in the final round of S.& P. downgrades, announced in late October, but five other projects in the final round of reviews had their ratings fall at least two steps.
The downgrade for Riverside Plaza came as it was preparing to refinance the affected bonds, explained George Sherman, the president of Sherman Associates, which owns and manages the project, a linchpin in the city's supply of affording housing.
''Just to have the issue off the table,'' he said, his private company ''will step up in December and cover the small interest shortfall'' the project faces, which he estimated at a few thousand dollars. But not every project downgraded has access to that kind of emergency cash.
The new Riverside Plaza bonds will be issued based on ''much more conservative assumptions -- essentially assuming zero investment income,'' Mr. Sherman said.
Moody's Investors Service, another major credit-rating agency, undertook a similar review of its ratings on housing bonds this year, but its downgrades were not as steep or as numerous. According to a summary from that agency in June, more than 80 percent of the roughly 200 reviewed issues kept their original ratings.
But Moody's analysts warned then that ''if interest rates continue to remain at current levels, we would anticipate further downgrades.''
Since so many of the downgraded issues had glittery AAA ratings before the latest review, there has been some grousing in the market that the rating agencies were overreacting to criticism that they were too generous in rating the controversial mortgage-backed bonds that blew up in the financial crisis of 2008.
''Some people say they are like the cat that got burned stepping on the stove and now won't even go back in the kitchen,'' said Bernard Beal, chief executive of M.R. Beal & Company in New York, an investment bank that is an active underwriter of housing revenue bonds.
''But I think they are being legitimately cautious about the opportunities for these housing issues to make a comeback in the short run,'' Mr. Beal said. ''The deals are going to be more difficult to do, and there simply will not be the large-scale issuance we've seen in the past.''
He cited a deal in his own firm's pipeline. ''Three years ago, it would have been a no-brainer. Now, with the very same project, we are finding very, very few lenders for it.''
The tighter rating standards may cause more housing-bond issuers to go to market without a rating -- a step that narrows the market for the bonds and can raise the cost of new housing projects.
''You pay up in a number of ways if you go to market unrated,'' Mr. Beal said. ''But that may be better than having a low rating that can affect your entire portfolio.''

After the review, 46 percent of the issues still had a top-tier AAA rating, down from 93 percent, and the share of unrated issues soared, to 43 percent from zero. The lowered ratings reduce the value of the existing bonds held by investors and can raise future borrowing costs for issuers. (Source: Standard & Poor's) (B4)

HEADLINE: The Crossroads Nation

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Bill Clinton used to talk about building a bridge to the 21st century. President Obama talks about laying down a ''new foundation.'' But Clinton was always vague about what the land on the other side of that bridge was going to look like, and Obama is vague about what edifice is going to go on top of that foundation.
They are vague because nobody is clear about what sort of country America is going to be in 2030 or 2050. Nobody has quite defined America's coming economic identity. 
In thinking about this question, it probably helps to start at the beginning. Five hundred years ago, agriculture was the major economic activity. One hundred years ago, it was industrial production. Now, of course, we're living in an information age. Innovation and creativity are the engines of economic growth.
Howard Gardner of Harvard once put together a composite picture of the extraordinarily creative person: She comes from a little place somewhat removed from the center of power and influence. As an adolescent, she feels herself outgrowing her own small circle. She moves to a metropolis and finds a group of people who share her passions and interests. She gets involved with a team to create something amazing.
Then, at some point, she finds her own problem, which is related to and yet different from the problems that concern others in her group. She breaks off and struggles and finally emerges with some new thing. She brings it back to her circle. It is tested, refined and improved.
The main point in this composite story is that creativity is not a solitary process. It happens within networks. It happens when talented people get together, when idea systems and mentalities merge.
Now imagine you are this creative person in the year 2010, 2025 or 2050. You are living in some small town in Ukraine or Kenya or some other place, foreign or domestic. You long to break out and go to a place where people are gathering to think about the things you are thinking about, creating the things you want to create.
If you are passionate about fashion, maybe you will go to Paris. If it's engineering, maybe it'll be Germany. But if you are passionate about many other spheres, I suspect you'll want to be in America.
You'll want to be in the U.S. because English has become the global language. You'll want to come because American universities lead the world in research and draw many of the best minds from all corners of the earth.
You'll want to be there because American institutions are relatively free from corruption. Intellectual property is protected. Huge venture capital funds already exist.
Moreover, the United States is a universal nation. There are already people there with connections all over the world. A nation of immigrants is more permeable than say, Chinese society.
You also observe that America hosts the right kind of networks -- ones that are flexible and intense. Study after study suggests that America is one of those societies with high social trust. Americans build large, efficient organizations that are not bound by the circles of kinship and clan. Study after study finds that Americans are not hierarchical. American children are raised to challenge their parents. American underlings are relatively free to challenge their bosses. In this country you're less likely to have to submit to authority.
From this story you can see that economic power in the 21st century is not going to look like economic power in the 20th century. The crucial fact about the new epoch is that creativity needs hubs. Information networks need junction points. The nation that can make itself the crossroads to the world will have tremendous economic and political power.
In 2009, Anne-Marie Slaughter, now director of policy planning at the State Department, wrote an essay for Foreign Affairs in which she laid out the logic of this new situation: ''In a networked world, the issue is no longer relative power, but centrality in an increasingly dense global web.''
Slaughter's essay was titled ''America's Edge.'' That is apt. Americans are now in a depressed state of mind. As China and India rise, nearly two-thirds of Americans believe their nation is in decline.
In fact, the U.S. is well situated to be the crossroads nation. It is well situated to be the center of global networks and to nurture the right kinds of networks. Building that America means doing everything possible to thicken connections: finance research to attract scientists; improve infrastructure to ease travel; fix immigration to funnel talent; reform taxes to attract superstars; make study abroad a rite of passage for college students; take advantage of the millions of veterans who have served overseas.
The nation with the thickest and most expansive networks will define the age. There's no reason to be pessimistic about that.

HEADLINE: OBAMA COURTS EMERGENT INDIA AS DEEPER ALLY

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and JIM YARDLEY; Neil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from the United Nations.

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- By endorsing India for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, President Obama on Monday signaled the United States' intention to create a deeper partnership of the world's two largest democracies that would expand commercial ties and check the influence of an increasingly assertive China.
Mr. Obama's announcement, made during a nationally televised address to the Indian Parliament, came at the end of a three-day visit to India that won high marks from an Indian political establishment once uncertain of the president's commitment to the relationship. Even as stark differences remained between the countries on a range of tough issues, including Pakistan, trade policy, climate change and, to some degree, Iran, Mr. Obama spoke of India as an ''indispensable'' partner for the coming century.
''In Asia and around the world, India is not simply emerging,'' he said during his speech in Parliament. ''India has emerged.'' 
Mr. Obama's closer embrace of India prompted a sharp warning from Pakistan, India's rival and an uncertain ally of the United States in the war in Afghanistan, which criticized the two countries for engaging in ''power politics'' that lacked a moral foundation.
It is also likely to set off fresh concerns in Beijing, which has had a contentious relationship with India and has expressed alarm at American efforts to tighten alliances with Asian nations wary of China's rising power.
But warmer ties between the United States and India, in the making for many years, come at a crucial time for Mr. Obama. He and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh are headed to South Korea later this week for a meeting of the Group of 20, apparently in agreement on what is expected to be a significant clash between the world's big powers over the United States Federal Reserve's plan to boost the American economy by pumping $600 billion into it.
China, Brazil and Germany have sharply criticized the move by the independent Fed, which they see as intended to push down the value of the dollar to boost American exports. Germany's finance minister equated the move to currency manipulation ''with the help of their central bank's printing presses.''
But at a Monday news conference, Mr. Obama defended the Fed's move and won backing from Mr. Singh, who spoke about the United States' critical importance to the global economy.
''Anything that would stimulate the underlying growth and policies of entrepreneurship in the United States would help the cause of global prosperity,'' he said.
The good will between Mr. Obama and Mr. Singh, as well as the almost giddy reaction to the president and his wife, Michelle, in the Indian press, lent a glossy sheen to a United States-India relationship that is still evolving.
India remains deeply protective of its sovereignty, while the United States is accustomed to having the upper hand with its foreign partners. On Monday, Mr. Singh emphasized the need for the two countries ''to work as equal partners in a strategic relationship.''
''For India, going back to the earliest days since independence, there has always been a very strong attachment to strategic autonomy,'' said Teresita C. Schaffer, director of the South Asia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''Americans throw around the word 'ally' with gay abandon.''
Mr. Obama arrived in India on Saturday bearing a big gift: his decision to lift longstanding export controls on sensitive technologies, albeit with some of the specifics still unclear. And the president also made several small-bore announcements about new collaborations between the nations on everything from homeland security to education, agriculture and open government.
Many Indian analysts said Mr. Obama had big shoes to fill, given the popularity here of his two predecessors. President George W. Bush is viewed with admiration, largely for his work securing a civil nuclear cooperation pact. And former President Bill Clinton, who in 2000 became the first American president to visit India in two decades, is fondly remembered for his gregarious personality and his own speech in Parliament, credited for reviving the relationship.
The headline moment of the trip was Mr. Obama's announcement on the United Nations seat, even though the endorsement is seemingly as much symbolic as substantive, given the serious political obstacles that have long stalled efforts to reform membership of the Security Council.
All the major powers have said the post-World War II structure of the Security Council, in which the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China have permanent seats with veto power, should be changed to reflect a different balance of power. But it could take years for any changes to be made, partly because there is no agreement on which countries should be promoted to an enlarged Security Council.
The United States has promised to support a promotion for Japan and now India. China is viewed as far less eager for its Asian neighbors to acquire permanent membership in the Council.
But administration officials and independent analysts emphasized the significance of the president's political message.
Ben Rhodes, a top foreign policy adviser to Mr. Obama, said the endorsement was intended to send a strong message ''in terms of how we see India on the world stage.'' Meanwhile, in Washington, even critics who had blamed Mr. Obama for letting the relationship with India drift reacted with praise -- and surprise.
''It's a bold move -- no president has said that before,'' said Richard Fontaine, a former adviser to Senator John McCain who wrote a critical report of Mr. Obama's India policy last month for the Center for New American Security. ''It's a recognition of India's emergence as a global power and the United States' desire to be close to India.''
But any outreach to India is bound to cause problems for Mr. Obama in Pakistan. In Islamabad, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry warned that Mr. Obama's decision would further complicate the process of reforming the Security Council. Pakistan, the ministry said in a statement, hopes the United States ''will take a moral view and not base itself on any temporary expediency or exigencies of power politics.''
For Mr. Obama, the Pakistan-India-United States nexus creates a delicate dance. The Obama administration is selling warplanes to Pakistan, a move viewed with suspicion here.
During his three-day visit, the president faced criticism for being too soft on Pakistan; during a question and answer session with college students, one demanded to know why he had not declared Pakistan a ''terrorist state.'' And even Mr. Singh, standing by the president's side at a joint news conference Monday, reiterated India's position that it could not have meaningful talks with Pakistan until it shut down the ''terror machine'' inside its borders.
But if Mr. Obama's cautious language on Pakistan provoked initial unease, his speech at Parliament seemed to put the matter to rest when he called on the Pakistani government to eradicate ''safe havens'' for terrorism groups and prosecute the perpetrators of the November 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai that killed at least 168 people.
''Indians were keen to listen to two 'p' words,'' said Rajiv Nayan, a strategic affairs analyst in New Delhi. ''Permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council and, second, on Pakistan.''

HEADLINE: The Impossible Dream

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
One of the most frustrating tendencies of mainstream leaders in the United States is their willingness, year after debilitating year, to embrace policies that have no hope of succeeding.
From Lyndon Johnson's mad pursuit of victory in Vietnam to George W. Bush's disastrous invasion of Iraq to today's delusionary deficit zealots, the tragic lure of the impossible dream seems never to subside.
Ronald Reagan told us he could cut taxes, jack up defense spending and balance the budget -- all at the same time. How'd he do? As his biographer Garry Wills tells us, the Gipper ''nearly tripled the deficit in his eight years, and never made a realistic proposal for cutting it.'' 
President Obama is escalating the war in Afghanistan while promising to start bringing our troops home next summer, which is like a heavyweight boxer throwing roundhouse rights while assuring his opponent that he won't fight quite as hard after the eighth or ninth round.
I don't know if it's the drinking water or the rarefied air at the highest reaches of government that makes so many of our leaders go loopy. Whatever it is, we need to put a stop to these self-defeating tendencies. The U.S. is in sad shape, and most of the policy prescriptions being tossed around by the movers and shakers are bad ones.
To get a sense of how deeply entrenched the problems are, consider what passes for good news these days. The economy added 151,000 jobs last month, which was more than most economists had expected. But even at that rate of job growth, it would take 15 to 20 years to get the employment rate back to where it was when the Great Recession began in December 2007.
There is no time to waste on plans that can't succeed.
The deficit hawks want to radically cut budgets and shrink the government, which they assure us will not only get the economy moving again but will eventually bring budgets into balance as neatly as some ideal middle-class family balances its checkbook.
This will somehow be achieved, we're told, without raising taxes. And Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina, a darling of the Tea Party, said on ''Meet the Press'' on Sunday that he was not in favor of cuts in benefits to senior citizens, meaning Social Security and Medicare, or any reductions in veterans' benefits.
You can't have a coherent conversation about deficit reduction if tax increases are off the table and the country is still at war. This is fantasyland economics, the equivalent of believing that John Boehner can fly.
People traveling in the real world understand that the federal budget deficits are sky high because of the Bush-era tax cuts, the costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the spending that was needed to keep the Great Recession from spiraling into another Great Depression.
Even if deficit reduction right now were a good idea -- which it is not, given the sorry state of the economy and the vast legions of the unemployed -- the deficit zealots have no viable plan for getting their misguided mission accomplished.
What's needed now is the same thing that has been needed for the past two years and more, a bold plan to put millions of Americans back to work and paying taxes, and a careful, thoughtful, strategic but unequivocal withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and Iraq.
If we don't engage these two issues effectively, there is little hope of getting to the other enormous challenges facing the country, including the metastasizing presence of poverty, the worsening problems facing already chronically underperforming public schools, and the deteriorating economic and social conditions that have drained the vitality of so many cities, rust-belt communities and rural areas.
The golden doors of opportunity are closing on America's young. The United States, once the world's leader in the percentage of young people with college degrees, is now a sorry 12th among 36 developed nations, according to the College Board.
As a society, we've lost our way, and there is no chance of getting reoriented if we can't find the courage to make some really tough decisions about warfare, taxes, public investment, the crying need to educate all young people, and the paramount importance of gainful employment as the cornerstone of a revitalized America.
Great sacrifices will have to be made if the U.S. is to get its act together, and those sacrifices will have to be shared. We can start now, or we can wait and continue to fantasize about an eventual triumph in Afghanistan, or about cutting budgets with some magic cleaver until they're finally balanced and all's right with the world, or whatever other impossible dream is floated by the chronically dissembling political class to blind us to the real world.

HEADLINE: Thrust Into the Glare by a Race She Wasn't Running In

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
As she rang in 2010, Susan Bysiewicz seemed unstoppable. Polls pointed to her as the favored Democrat to be Connecticut's next governor, a dream since her days at Yale, and she had begun mapping out exactly how she would change the state.
Less than a year later, Ms. Bysiewicz, 49, has fallen from the top of Connecticut's political world to its most uncomfortable depths, becoming fodder for comedians and a favorite chew toy for Republicans. 
As the secretary of state, Ms. Bysiewicz has borne the brunt of the criticism over a series of voting mishaps that turned the election for governor into a national embarrassment.
But she has stood her ground, unwilling to take the blame for confusion over who won the excruciatingly close race. (On Monday, the Republican nominee, Thomas C. Foley, conceded to Dannel P. Malloy, the Democrat.)
As critics complained of missing ballots and possible fraud, Ms. Bysiewicz found herself being compared to another beleaguered secretary of state, Katherine Harris of Florida, who presided over the tumultuous 2000 presidential race recount there.
''This is not Florida,'' Ms. Bysiewicz said in a telephone interview on Monday. ''There are no hanging chads.''
She rejected suggestions that her political career was in peril, saying she planned to remain in public service. Those close to her say she is seriously weighing a bid in 2012 for the United States Senate seat occupied by Joseph I. Lieberman, an independent.
Whatever her plans, Ms. Bysiewicz seems taken aback by her current standing.
She had hopes of rising to higher office this year. In January, she gave up a bid for governor to run for attorney general after Richard Blumenthal, the current attorney general, decided to pursue the Senate seat Christopher J. Dodd intended to vacate.
But in May, four days before the state Democratic convention, Ms. Bysiewicz's plans were foiled when the State Supreme Court ruled that she did not meet the requirements for attorney general because she had not actively practiced law for 10 years.
In one day, her hopes fell apart.
''It was stunning and it was disappointing,'' she said. ''I have moved on. I am looking forward to writing the next chapter.''
The daughter of a potato farmer and of the first tenured female law professor at the University of Connecticut, Ms. Bysiewicz became popular in Connecticut by pairing folksy sensibility with intellectual firepower.
She studied economics and history at Yale and attended law school at Duke. In her free time, she wrote a biography of Ella T. Grasso, the first female governor of Connecticut, published in 1984.
Ms. Bysiewicz cites Ms. Grasso, herself a former Connecticut secretary of state, as her inspiration for entering politics. She once said in an interview that she sometimes winked at a statue of Ms. Grasso outside the office of the secretary of state in Hartford.
Ms. Bysiewicz was elected to the state legislature in 1992 at 31, and six years later became secretary of state, despite the lack of an endorsement from the Democratic establishment.
She tried to place more public records online and crack down on illegal businesses. But wherever she went, she was criticized as overly ambitious and political.
Her enemies seized on that image this year when Ms. Bysiewicz became mired in a scandal over a state database of contact information that was used to send political mailings.
State lawyers ultimately decided not to pursue a criminal investigation into the matter.
.
''There's this unbridled sense of ambition that goes unchecked,'' said Richard Foley Jr., a former state Republican chairman, who is not related to the party's candidate for governor.
Ms. Bysiewicz dismisses the characterization of her as a political opportunist and suggests it is sexist.
''If you're a man and you are confident and you are ambitious and strong, then you are a statesman and a leader,'' she said. ''If you are a woman and you have those qualities, well, they have a not-so-flattering term for that.''
Still, she is not shy about promoting her accomplishments. She has been known to spend hours on the phone with potential donors until she receives a firm commitment. And the biography on the secretary of state's Web site is a nearly 1,400-word homage that lists a lifetime of achievements, including her experience as a trainer of guide dogs for the blind.
Even as her ambition rankled fellow politicians, Ms. Bysiewicz's background seemed to resonate with the public. She was elected secretary of state three times.
But she was again in the spotlight on Election Day after widespread voting problems.
Critics said she made the office of secretary of state appear partisan by calling the governor's race for Mr. Malloy, the Democrat, before all the votes had been counted. And she was blamed for a shortage of ballots in Bridgeport, where poll workers severely underestimated turnout.
Ms. Bysiewicz attributed those troubles to the decentralized nature of the state's elections and said she had no authority to intervene.
But after the swirl of media attention, she acknowledges she may need to rebuild her reputation. It remains to be seen whether she can steer her carefully planned career back on track.
''I was brought up on a farm, and I've learned that every opportunity that I've had in my life has come from hard work and persistence,'' she said. ''Things happen for a reason. We'll have to see how life unfolds.''

HEADLINE: What's Next: Rare Hits And Heaps Of Misses To Pay For

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WADE

 BODY:
Research, in any field of science, is not the risk-free business that might easily be supposed from the confident promises of scientific spokesmen or the daily reports of new advances.
Nature yields her secrets with the greatest unwillingness, and in basic research most experiments contribute little to further progress, as judged by the rarity with which most scientific reports are cited by others.
Basic research, the attempt to understand the fundamental principles of science, is so risky, in fact, that only the federal government is willing to keep pouring money into it. It is a venture that produces far fewer hits than misses. 
Even the pharmaceutical industry, a major beneficiary of biomedical research, does not like to invest too heavily in basic science. Rather, it lets private venture capital support the small biotechnology companies that first try to bring new findings to market, and then buys up the few winners of this harsh winnowing process.
If basic research is fraught with such a high failure rate, why then does it yield such rich economic returns? The answer is that such government financing agencies as the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation are like the managers of a stock index fund: they buy everything in the market, and the few spectacular winners make up for all the disasters.
But just as index fund managers often go astray when they try to improve on the index's performance by overweighting the stocks they favor, the government can go wrong when it tries to pick winners.
This is why it was such a risk for California to earmark $3 billion specifically for stem cell research over the next 10 years. Stem cells are just one of many promising fields of biomedical research. They could yield great advances, or become an exercise in sustained failure, as gene therapy has so far been. By allocating so much money to a single field, California is placing an enormous bet on a single horse, and the chances are substantial that its taxpayers will lose their collective shirt.
Stem cell researchers have created an illusion of progress by claiming regular advances in the 12 years since human embryonic stem cells were first developed. But a notable fraction of these claims have turned out to be wrong or fraudulent, and many others have amounted to yet another new way of getting to square one by finding better methods of deriving human embryonic stem cells.
The major advances in stem cell biology have come from molecular biologists who study transcription factors, the master control switches that govern the cell's operations. The Japanese biologist Shinya Yamanaka showed that with a mere four of these factors, which he cleverly guessed, he could force an ordinary cell to walk back to embryonic state.
But the finding illustrates what stem cell research is really about. It's not about therapies and quick cures, it's about understanding the basic nature of human cells and what makes one type different from another even though all have the identical genome. In other words, it's a basic research program with little likelihood of producing therapeutic gains in the near future. Stem cell scientists, while generally avoiding rash promises themselves, have allowed politicians to portray stem cells as a likely cure for all the major diseases.
Strangely, for a project that is aimed at regenerative medicine, the arbiters of stem cell research have largely neglected the free lesson that nature is offering as to how regenerative medicine could actually work. Many little animals, like newts and zebra fish, do regenerate parts of their bodies. But their recipe is the reverse of that presented by the advocates of stem cell therapy. Instead of taking a stem cell and trying to convert it into a well-behaved adult tissue, animals like the zebra fish start with the adult cell at the wound site, and walk it backward into a stemlike state from which a new limb grows.
For the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine to invest its $3 billion in studying newts, rather than building new science buildings on every state campus, might seem the best way of understanding regeneration, but that would be hard to explain to California's voters, who have been assured stem cell cures are just around the corner. Even if governments do better to avoid picking winners among basic research fields, they can play a necessary role in supporting specific scientific infrastructure that lies beyond the means of individual researchers or universities, like atom-smashers or the human genome project. But even these projects are not guaranteed success. More powerful atom-smashers let physicists explore new ranges of energy, but the expected new atomic particles are not always found there. The HapMap, a catalog of human genetic variation that grew out of the human genome project, was designed to uncover the genetic roots of common diseases and help develop new treatments. The project was well conceived and executed, but nature declined to provide many very useful answers. Still, there is nothing wrong with the National Institutes of Health having tried the experiment. The only shame would be in not having tried.
The same goes for the HapMap's successor, the 1000 Genomes Project, which is an attempt to construct an even larger genetic catalog. It's well worth trying, but success cannot be assumed -- and should be the more applauded if attained.
To take scientific progress for granted is to underestimate the difficulties, professional and otherwise, that scientists must overcome. A researcher spends years in apprenticeship, mastering difficult techniques with a short useful life. He or she then has a few years to strike it lucky and become a lab chief, much of whose time is spent applying for grants and administering the work of the next generation of apprentice scientists.
It's amazing that the system works as well as it does. But its successes are hard won, not the inevitable victories that scientific spokesmen sometimes suggest when on the fund-raising trail.

HEADLINE: In Queens, Small-Business Dreams Die and Blossom

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
Marino & Sons Fish Market opened on 30th Avenue in Astoria, Queens, in 1932, fulfilling the dreams of a scrawny teenager from Sicily who had been peddling fish from woven baskets along the streets of Manhattan.
The fishmonger, Baldasarre Marino, and then a son, a grandson and a great-grandson -- all named Charles -- kept the market alive through the Great Depression, the 1970s fiscal crisis and the blackout of 2006. But the great recession proved to be too much, and the market closed in July, suffering the fate of some neighboring small businesses, like a pub run by a man from Ireland and a carpet store owned by a man from Greece.
''There's no insurance against a bad economy,'' said Charlie Marino, a great-grandson of the fish market's founder.
But along with endings there have been beginnings. Last month, an eyewear shop opened in a spot where rolls of carpets were once stacked. Three doors from the fish market, a Louisiana-style restaurant is set to open soon, while across the street, a shuttered lounge has resurfaced as a Latin restaurant. 
And so this small commercial stretch -- eight blocks of 30th Avenue, bracketed by 31st Street and Steinway Street -- is a microcosm of how small businesses are faring as the economy flails.
A street that has long been an incubator of financial hopes and aspirations for waves of immigrants has fallen victim to high rents and disappearing customers. But this strip also has a resilient streak, a history of newcomers arriving with an entrepreneurial spirit and a willingness to work hard and take a chance.
Wall Street may be the economic lifeblood of New York City, but it is small businesses, places with 100 workers or less, that are the city's backbone, accounting for 98 percent of its roughly 233,000 companies, according to the state's Department of Labor.
Even at the height of the recession in 2008, small businesses provided nearly half of all private-sector jobs available in the city, more than they did in 1990, a study to be released by the Center for an Urban Future, a research institute, found. ''Small businesses are the only ones that have been taking chances,'' said Jonathan Bowles, the center's director.
Still, the struggles of neighborhood businesses are underscored by persistently high retail vacancy rates. Nowhere is the problem more pronounced than in Queens, which logged a vacancy rate of 13 percent in the third quarter of this year, the highest in the city, according to Marcus & Millichap, a national brokerage firm. Manhattan had the lowest vacancy rate, about 7 percent. In the third quarter two years ago, the vacancy rates were 4 percent for Queens and 2.8 percent for Manhattan.
A survey this summer by Representative Anthony D. Weiner painted a dismal picture in several shopping districts in Queens, finding more than one in 5 stores closed along a busy stretch of Jamaica Avenue that runs through Richmond Hill and Woodhaven, and one in 10 stores closed in Glendale. On Woodhaven Boulevard in Rego Park, almost 20 percent of storefronts were closed.
''This is more than an economic indicator,'' Mr. Weiner, a Democrat who represents parts of Queens and Brooklyn, said in an interview. ''It's a sort of psychic barometer of a community.''
In Astoria, about 30 mom-and-pop stores along 30th Avenue have gone out of business in the past two years, in what has been of the most unforgiving financial times for a strip that has experienced booms and busts along with successive waves of immigrants.
Greeks and Italians arrived at the turn of the last century and opened butcher shops and salumerias that sold prosciutto, pancetta and racks of lamb.
Croatians followed, and then Czechs and other Eastern Europeans, who favored travel agencies and hair salons. More recently, Brazilians opened restaurants, and Arabs started jewelry stores. Now, in a reckless gamble or an act of faith, a fresh crop of business owners is trying to make it on the avenue.
For Annie Zhu, 31, and Michelle Ho, 35, friends and partners in the optical shop, Vision Essential, failure would probably mean having to go back to working for someone else.
For Al Lau, 39, and his wife, Michele Addeo, 38, the owners of the Louisiana-style restaurant, Sugarfreak, it would probably mean losing everything they have.
Mr. Lau and Ms. Addeo signed the lease on the 1,000-square-foot space a year ago and have been paying rent ever since, though their landlord agreed to charge them $3,000 a month, half of what they will be paying once the restaurant opens. The discount is welcome, but it does little to lessen their problems.
The couple applied for small-business loans, but banks turned them down, saying that restaurants were too risky, Mr. Lau said.
They have run through their savings -- Mr. Lau is a lawyer and Ms. Addeo is a physical therapist -- and hit the limit on their credit cards to finance their restaurant, which is not yet finished. They spent $150,000 on kitchen equipment and $25,000 on lawyers after a neighborhood group opposed their application for a liquor license. (The restaurant has been granted a provisional license.)
The store's wood floor was rotten, and it took two months to get the necessary permit to replace it, then an additional five months and $20,000 to replace a pipe connecting a water main to the restaurant.
They are now waiting for a final inspection while applying the finishing touches. On a recent morning, their contractor arrived with a big chandelier that will hang over the bar.
''At this point, we're too far into it to turn back,'' Mr. Lau said. ''But we're going to give it a shot.''
''And it's going to work out,'' Ms. Addeo added. ''Hopefully.''
To open their eyewear shop on 30th Avenue, Ms. Zhu and Ms. Ho relied on a loan and a little luck. Because of the poor economy, Prada and Versace, which would ordinarily not do business with a small neighborhood store in Queens, were eager to sell to them. And though the two women quit their jobs to devote themselves full time to their business, their husbands did not.
''Everybody needs eyeglasses,'' said Ms. Ho, who was born in China, grew up in Hong Kong and moved to New York in 1997.
Ms. Zhu, whose parents came from China, added, ''The big question for us is, are people going to buy a $100 frame or a $300 frame?''
Their landlord, George Georgiou, 70, who ran the carpet store for 30 years, had many good years. He bought the building that housed his store -- ground-floor space with apartments above -- and a similar one nearby. He also bought a home in the neighborhood, and he put both his children through law school.
But business eventually slowed so much that it made no sense to stay open.
''Economy hard,'' Mr. Georgiou said. ''More hard and more competition to do business today.''
Mr. Marino, of the fish market, also owns the building where his store was, but for now he is trying to figure out what to do with all the equipment he still has there, while keeping going the wholesale fish business he has had on the side.
The other day, Mr. Georgiou stopped by the grand opening for his tenants' store and offered Ms. Zhu and Ms. Ho simple advice.
''When I come to America, the way to make more money is the business way,'' Mr. Georgiou told them. ''Own your business still good; better than work for somebody else.''

HEADLINE: Foley Concedes to Malloy, Formally Ending Race for Connecticut Governor

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN; Noah Rosenberg contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The Connecticut governor's race is finally over.
Thomas C. Foley, the Republican nominee, conceded on Monday that he had fallen a hair short in his bid to defeat Dannel P. Malloy, his Democratic opponent. And though Mr. Foley said he was still concerned about voting chaos in Bridgeport, the state's largest city, and other possible sites, he and his advisers could not envision a chain of events in which he would be able to make up a gap of about 6,000 votes. 
''The election on Tuesday was a conclusive victory for Dan Malloy, and this result should not be questioned,'' he said in a news conference in Hartford. ''As soon as I am done with this press conference, I will call Dan Malloy and congratulate him and wish him good luck.''
With that, Mr. Foley, flanked by his wife, Leslie, and top aides, formally ended the closest contest for Connecticut governor in more than a half a century -- and certainly one of the strangest.
Since Election Day, residents had watched almost with disbelief as their state became the focus of political jokes thanks to a can-you-top-this stream of mishaps.
First, officials in Bridgeport realized that they had estimated voter turnout so badly that they ran out of ballots a few hours before the polls closed at 8 p.m. A judge, at the urging of Susan Bysiewicz, the secretary of state, ordered voting hours at 12 polling sites in the city extended until 10 p.m.
The next day, Ms. Bysiewicz, a Democrat, declared that Mr. Malloy had won, based on unofficial returns provided by election officials in every town. But Mr. Foley insisted that he had won -- a claim that gained more traction when The Associated Press, which had originally declared Mr. Malloy the winner, withdrew its call, based on more information from New Haven, a Democratic stronghold.
Mr. Foley also went on the radio to chastise Ms. Bysiewicz while she was on the air. Both candidates, meanwhile, gave the impression that they were in a hurry to get to Hartford, announcing the creation of transition teams.
Then, on Friday, after many false starts and an abundance of confusion, Ms. Bysiewicz declared that Mr. Malloy was indeed the official winner. In turn, Mr. Foley promised that he would, with a panel of legal and financial experts from Connecticut and beyond, scrub the results carefully all weekend.
Yet on Monday, Mr. Foley, looking disappointed but composed, said he and his team had found ''no credible evidence of fraudulent voting.'' He also said any legal battle would have been ''disenfranchising'' to voters -- something he did not want.
Mr. Malloy, 55, will be the first Democrat to claim the governor's office since 1986. He will succeed M. Jodi Rell, a Republican who decided not to run for re-election. He will inherit a projected budget deficit of more than $3 billion, as well as deep concerns over the state's economy and education system.

HEADLINE: Mining the Seafloor For Rare-Earth Minerals

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
For decades, entrepreneurs have tried to strike it rich by gathering up ugly potato-size rocks that carpet the global seabed. Known as manganese nodules, the rocks are plentiful in nickel, copper and cobalt, as well as manganese and other elements, but lie miles down in inky darkness. Building giant machines to vacuum them up, despite much study and investment, has never proved to be economic.
Now, the frustrated visionaries are talking excitedly about the possibility of belated success, and perhaps even profits. 
The nodules turn out to contain so-called rare-earth minerals -- elements that have wide commercial and military application but have hit a production roadblock. China, which controls some 95 percent of the world's supply, had blocked shipments, sounding political alarms around the globe and a rush for alternatives. China ended its embargo late last month, but the hunt for other options continues.
So are seabed miners smiling at last?
''People are quite intrigued,'' said James R. Hein, a geologist with the United State Geological Survey who specializes in seabed minerals. Depending on China's behavior and the global reaction, he said, ''rare earths may be the driving force in the near future.''
In October, Dr. Hein and five colleagues from Germany presented a paper on harvesting the nodules for their ''rare and valuable metals.'' They did so at the annual meeting of the Underwater Mining Institute, a professional group based at the University of Hawaii. The paper prompted visions of a fresh start.
''They really do add value,'' Charles L. Morgan, chairman of the institute, said of the rare earths in an interview. The result, he added, is that the nodules have taken on a new luster. ''People are starting to think, 'Well, maybe these things aren't so dumb after all.' ''
Dr. Morgan said he was considering whether to start analyzing a collection he oversees of 5,000 nodule samples from around the globe so as to ascertain their rare-earth content. But he cautioned that the field of seabed mining has a history of ups and downs.
''This new wrinkle may take them over the edge to make them truly economic,'' he said of the nodules. ''But that remains to be seen.''
The elements known as rare earths number 17 in all and range from cerium and dysprosium to thulium and yttrium.
Their unique properties have resulted in their growing use in many technologies of modern life. Applications include magnets, lasers, fiber optics, computer disk drives, fluorescent lamps, rechargeable batteries, catalytic converters, computer memory chips, X-ray tubes, high-temperature superconductors and the liquid-crystal displays of televisions and computer monitors.
The United States Geological Survey calls the rare elements ''essential for hundreds of applications'' and likely candidates in the near future for an ''expanding array'' of high-tech products. Supply shortages that go on for a long time, the agency warns in a fact sheet, ''would force significant changes in many technological aspects of American society.''
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton recently called China's export embargo a ''wake-up call'' for the world to find new resources.
Despite their name, most rare earths are not particularly rare. But their geochemical properties mean they seldom concentrate into economically exploitable ore pockets. During the last two decades, most production has shifted to China because of lower costs there and the country's record of lax regulation of environmental hazards. (The processing of rare earths can create toxic byproducts.)
Scientists have known about rare earths in seabed rocks for decades, seeing them as a curiosity. In 1968, Alan M. Ehrlich, a chemist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote a Ph.D. dissertation titled ''Rare Earth Abundances in Manganese Nodules.''
In an interview, he expressed surprise at the interest of the seabed miners, saying the concentrations were too low to power a nodule renaissance.
The would-be miners agree. But they say rising global prices for the more common metals found in the seabed rocks are increasing the allure. Investors, they add, see the presence of the exotic elements as icing on the cake.
''The global activity is tremendous,'' said Dr. Hein of geological survey, referring to undersea exploration as well as processing assessments on land.
''Right now, rare earths are not the driving force,'' he said. ''But for copper and nickel, the prices are there.''
Dr. Hein said dwindling supplies of terrestrial copper -- a key ingredient of industrialization used in everything from wires and switches to pipes and roofs -- have forced miners on land to go after increasingly low grades of ore and have raised interest in seabed resources.
For instance, ore in the Chilean copper and gold mine that collapsed in August, trapping 33 miners, bears concentrations of copper that measure only a half percent, said Dr. Hein. ''The nodules have 1 percent,'' he added, ''so they're twice as rich.''
The upshot is a new wave of global interest in vacuuming up the seabed nodules -- rare earths and all.
''It's getting more active,'' said Dr. Morgan of the Underwater Mining Institute. ''Industrial people are starting to look at it again.''

HEADLINE: Sticker Shock for Travelers as Airfares Climb in a Recovering Economy

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK

 BODY:
In the 10 years they have been together, Charissa Benjamin and her Serbian husband have always flown from their home in Washington to spend the winter holidays in the warmth of her native Antigua.
But with the lowest economy-class fare this year advertised at about $1,500 -- more than twice the $700 she paid in 2009 -- Ms. Benjamin is considering ringing in 2011 with her husband's family in decidedly chillier Belgrade. Flights there cost half as much as those to the Caribbean.
''It's hard for me to bite the bullet when it's only 1,700 miles,'' from Washington to Antigua, she said. ''That's just under 90 cents per mile.''
As Ms. Benjamin and others have been discovering in recent months, airfares in most of the world are on the rise as the global economy picks up and demand for air travel climbs, particularly for business trips. Airlines, meanwhile, have been reluctant to add more flights to meet that growing demand. That is increasing pressure on ticket prices and making for packed planes and longer standby lines as the year-end travel season approaches. 
This has been a boon, of course, for an industry that is expected to roar back into profit this year, to the tune of $8.9 billion. That comes after airlines collectively lost nearly $26 billion during the previous two years, according to the International Air Transport Association, an airline industry group. Many of the world's leading airlines are reporting that the three-month period ended Sept. 30 was one of their most profitable quarters in years.
The degree of sticker shock varies significantly by region and by class of seat, with fares on some routes still at or below those of a year ago, despite some large increases in traffic.
Average domestic and international fares worldwide are up by less than 4 percent from a year ago, according to figures from the transport association. And while fares may continue rising for some time, industry executives say the increases next year are likely to be smaller.
Travelers in North America have experienced the steepest price gains, particularly for business travel. Average one-way fares for business- and first-class travel within North America have soared this year. They were up a staggering 140 percent from a year earlier, to $676 in August, a peak travel month and the most recent for which the transport association has data available. Economy fares rose 3.6 percent.
Fares between the United States and Europe also rose sharply, especially for economy-class seats. The average one-way fare in August was $455, a rise of 20 percent from a year earlier, while the average premium-class fare was $2,087, an increase of 11 percent.
''It's really hard to find the $600 tickets anymore,'' said Philip Guarino, 40, an American who runs a consulting business in Milan and Boston. ''The basic fare from the East Coast to Europe is closer to $1,000, and most likely closer to $1,200.''
A business-class ticket to Milan costs about $3,400, he said, compared with about $2,400 four years ago. ''The pricing now in business is at my upper limit,'' he said.
Elsewhere, economy-class fares between Europe and Asia have risen 10 percent from 2009, according to the transport association, while those between North and South America have increased about 13 percent.
''All of the airlines have done a good job, as demand has picked up, of not adding very many more seats,'' said Christa Degnan Manning, head of research at American Express Business Travel. ''I expect them to continue to manage that very closely.''
Dan Hodgdon, 44, said he had given up trying to fly between the Bangkok offices of his spa-supply business, which is based in Los Angeles, and his vacation home in southern France because fares on the route had become ''ridiculously'' high.
Referring to the Los Angeles airport, he said, ''It is far less expensive now to fly from LAX to anywhere in Europe than from Bangkok.''
''This was not always the case in early 2009,'' he added.
Travelers in other parts of the world can still find good deals. Within the Asia-Pacific region, for example, the average one-way economy-class fare was $318 in August, a decrease of 0.4 percent from August 2009, while premium-class tickets were nearly 2 percent less expensive, despite a 26 percent jump in traffic on those routes.
But some of the biggest fare declines this year have been in Europe, where economic activity remains sluggish and consumer confidence is weak. Economy-class fares on European routes fell nearly 11 percent in August despite an 8 percent increase in demand. Business-class fares fell even further, dropping 16 percent as the bigger carriers scrambled to keep customers from defecting to low-cost rivals and high-speed trains.
''An awful lot of passengers are trading down from the big carriers like British Airways and Air France to fly with us,'' said Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, the largest European low-cost airline. ''All across Europe, fares are still falling, and we are one of the main reasons for that.''
Ryanair has taken advantage of that trend to raise its average one-way fare to 44 euros, or $62, in the April-September period, up 12 percent from a year earlier, the carrier, based in Dublin, said.
Ms. Manning, of American Express Business Travel, said that in Europe, overall expenses for business travel, including hotels and car rentals, had fallen by about 1 percent in 2010 from a year earlier. But American Express predicted this month that this figure would jump 16 percent in 2011, as travel providers sought to recoup some of their losses of the last two years. Domestic and short-haul European economy-class airfares are likely to rise 4 to 9 percent next year, American Express said, with countries like Britain and Sweden in line for the biggest increases.
Spain, with its economy still deep in crisis, was the only European market where continued declines in ticket prices were expected next year, of 1 to 3 percent.
In other parts of the world, fares are expected to rise as well in 2011, but at a much slower pace than this year.
Because of the increases experienced in 2010, North America is likely to have the smallest fare increases, in the range of 2 to 7 percent, according to American Express, while Latin American fares are likely to rise 3 to 8 percent. In the Middle East, fares should also climb 2 to 9 percent, American Express said.
Fare increases in the fast-growing economies of Asia, meanwhile, are likely to accelerate, especially for premium travel. American Express predicted economy-class ticket prices would rise as much as 13 percent in 2011 in markets including China, India and Singapore, while business-class fares could rise as much as 15 percent. In Japan, where economic growth remains sluggish, prices are likely to be more stable, with increases expected in the low single digits.
Still, many airline executives are expecting this year's growth in yield -- the price paid by one passenger to fly one mile -- to slacken in 2011 as slowing economies combine with accelerating deliveries of new planes to increase the supply of available seats.
A quarterly survey of airline chief financial officers that the transport association published this month showed that while nearly 60 percent expected their carriers to see continued improvements to their profitability during the next 12 months, only 26 percent said they expected yields to increase over the same period -- down from nearly 75 percent from the previous survey in July.
Barring another sharp economic downturn, analysts said, the longer-term trend toward rising fares is likely to continue apace. A wave of recent industry consolidation has given airlines greater visibility over a broader swath of the market, making it easier for them to manage the supply -- and the prices -- of available seats.
''The degree of consolidation that is occurring -- partly through alliances and partly through takeovers -- has to start influencing the balance between supply and demand,'' said Peter Morris, chief economist at Ascend, an airline consulting firm in London.

 BODY:
Scientists can't say what they'll be
discovering 10 years from now. But
they do pay careful attention to the di-
rection in which their fields are mov-
ing, and they have some strong hunch-
es about where they are headed in the
year ahead.
Here are prognostications for sci-
ence in 2011 from 10 leading figures in 
10 widely scattered disciplines, from
genomics to mathematics to earth
science. Regardless of whether they
prove true next year, they offer a
glimpse into the kinds of possibilities
that get scientists excited.

''The Dawn spacecraft will get to orbit
around a very large asteroid called
Vesta in July. It's going to be fascinat-
ing to see what it looks like up close.
We're going to be able to start answer-
ing very broad questions about the his-
tory of asteroids.''
Asteroids first formed at the birth of
the solar system 4.6 billion years ago,
developing into small proto-planets.
The biggest asteroids, like the 330-
mile-wide Vesta, might have even
grown into full-blown planets if not for
the pull of Jupiter's powerful gravita-
tional field. Since then, collisions have
blasted asteroids apart into smaller
bodies. Astronomers want to know
just how planetlike asteroids like Ves-
ta became. It's possible, for example,
that Vesta developed a heavy core and
might even have a magnetic field.
Once the Dawn takes a close look at
Vesta, it will move on to another giant
asteroid, Ceres, which has water-bear-
ing minerals and perhaps even a weak
atmosphere. By comparing the two as-
teroids, astronomers hope to learn
about early planet formation.

''I think this year, the time will come to
get a sense of just how much marine
biodiversity is out there. And that will
be really exciting, because for a long
time we really haven't known. There
hasn't been a sense of what's happen-
ing out there.''
In 2000, an international network of
2,700 scientists began the Census of
Marine Life, the most ambitious at-
tempt in scientific history to catalog
the life dwelling in the world's oceans.
After a decade of trawling the seas
and making 30 million observations,
the project came to an end this year.
The researchers unveiled dazzling
photographs of some of the 6,000 or so
new species they discovered.
Now they are busy crunching the
data to come up with estimates of how
many species of animals and other or-
ganisms are in the oceans. Next year,
they may start to offer rough esti-
mates, as well as hypotheses for why
the diversity is high in some places
and low in others. Dr. Pimm is particu-
larly interested in what the census re-
searchers will discover about how
widespread species are in the ocean.
On land, much of the world's diversity
is made up of species with very small
ranges. Their limited habitats also
make them vulnerable to human dis-
turbances, which is why so many ani-
mals and plants on land are threat-
ened. If the diversity of the oceans is
also built on narrow-range species,
such a finding might raise concern
about the risk of extinction in the
oceans as well.

''We're going to see games tackling

novation, that doctors are going to

In August, the journal Nature pub-
lished a paper on protein folding with
56,000 co-authors. Researchers at the
University of Washington had set up a
program that ran on people's idle com-
puters, using their free computer pow-
er to search for the accurate shape of
proteins. But they eventually realized
that the people who owned the com-
puters themselves could help nudge
the molecules into their proper shape.
The scientists took advantage of this
crowd-sourced intelligence with a
game, called Foldit, that allowed peo-
ple to compete with each other to be-
come championship folders. Foldit's
community of online gamers explod-
ed, and they've driven the science of
protein folding forward accordingly.
The growth of broadband Internet
access and computer speed has made
online games a force to be reckoned
with. The world spends three billion
hours a week on online games, and
that investment is only going to grow.
Many people play war games and me-
dieval adventures, but Dr. McGonigal
predicts that in 2011 unconventional
games with real-world impact will be-
come much more prominent.

''We're going to deploy lots and lots of
new kinds of instruments in the Indian
Ocean that will be out there for dec-
ades. The Indian Ocean has got these
tentacles that reach across the globe,
and the data we're collecting is going to
revolutionize our understanding of the
system.''
The oceans, covering 70 percent of the
planet, remain a barely explored
world. And in that world, the Indian
Ocean has been particularly mysteri-
ous. Early oceanographers paid more
attention to the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans; today, pirates can put some
parts of the Indian Ocean off limits to
research. Nevertheless, ocean scien-
tists have been finding evidence that
the Indian Ocean is a very interesting
place. In fact, the circulation of the
ocean and its changing temperature
can drive major changes in the atmos-
phere that can affect the entire planet.
Every month or two, these fluctua-
tions send up towering clouds that
travel east. Depending on the time of
year, these disturbances can affect the
monsoons over India, the rainfall in
the northwestern United States or
hurricanes forming in the Atlantic.
Known as the Madden-Julian oscilla-
tion, it is so powerful that its winds can
even speed up and slow down the rota-
tion of the Earth.
In October 2011, an international
team of scientists will be converging
on the Indian Ocean for a campaign
called Dynamo (short for Dynamics of
the Madden-Julian Oscillation). De-
ploying sensors across much of the
ocean, they will try to track an oscilla-
tion from its earliest stages. If Dyna-
mo is a success, it will help scientists
understand the conditions that trigger
a new oscillation and how to predict its
effects far and wide.

''We'll get to see whether the climate
models have really improved since the
last set of I.P.C.C. reports. My wager is
that most of the improvements will be
modest, and not represent a quantum
leap in predictive capability.''
Every few years, the Intergovernmen-
tal Panel on Climate Change publishes
reports on the state of climate science
and what we can expect from the cli-
mate in the future. In its latest report,
published in 2007, the group concluded
that most of the observed increase in
global average temperatures since the
mid-20th century is very likely due to
the billions of tons of greenhouse gas-
es that humans have pumped into the
atmosphere.
The panel also made projections
into the future, basing each one on dif-
ferent assumptions about how human
society will change over the next cen-
tury. If the population peaks around
2050 and the world's economies shift
toward information technology and
service industries, the panel projects
that by 2100 the average global tem-
perature will likely rise between 1.1
and 2.9 degrees C. If, on the other
hand, the world continues to rely on
fossil fuels for its economic growth,
the panel projects a likely rise of 2.4 to
6.4 degrees.
The climate models the I.P.C.C.
used in 2007 were substantially more
sophisticated than previous ones. But
climate scientists at the time could see
plenty of room for improvement. The
2007 I.P.C.C. report shied away from
giving an upper boundary for sea level
rise, for example. By the time the 2007
report was published, climate scien-
tists were already developing a new
set of models for the next I.P.C.C. re-
port.

''I expect we will see the physical or-
ganization of a memory within the
brain.''
For decades neuroscientists searched
through the brain, in pursuit of physi-
cal markers of memories. They found
evidence that memories form through
the contact of neurons. They grow new
branches to communicate with other
neurons, and old branches become
stronger or weaker. In just the past
few years, Dr. Fenton and other re-
searchers have discovered that one
molecule present in those branches,
known as PKMzeta, maintains memo-
ries. Block PKMzeta, and the memory
vanishes.
This discovery opens up an exciting
prospect. Scientists could train ani-
mals to perform some simple task and
then compare the brains of the ani-
mals that learned with those of the
ones that didn't. There should be a
unique sprinkling of PKMzeta mol-
ecules in the animals that formed the
new memory. Scientists could then
map all the neurons and their
branches that were required for the
animals to remember what they
learned. For the first time in history,
scientists would be able to see a mem-
ory.

''It seems pretty likely within this
year someone will show how to go
from an adult peripheral blood
draw to pluripotent stem cells. It
means anyone who wants to try to
make stem cells will be able to give
it a whirl.''
The cells in an embryo can give
rise to any kind of tissue in the
adult body. But once they commit
to being muscle cells, neurons or
some other type of cell, there's
usually no going back. A huge
amount of research has gone into
finding a way to induce adult cells
to turn back into so-called plurip-
otent stem cells. Someday it
might be possible to use them to
grow back damaged organs from
a person's own cells.
In September, Derrick J. Rossi
and his colleagues at Harvard
Medical School created artificial
versions of RNA molecules, the
templates that cells use to build
proteins. They bathed human
cells in a cocktail of five kinds of
RNA molecules. The cells took in
the RNA and made proteins that
reprogrammed them into pluripo-
tent stem cells.
Rossi's method has a drawback
as well, however: he and his col-
leagues used a type of cell called a
fibroblast. To gather these cells,
they have to do an invasive biop-
sy and then culture the cells to get
enough fibroblasts for their ex-
periment.
This July, Dr. George Q. Daley
of Harvard Medical School and
his colleagues had success using
a different route: they drew blood
from healthy human donors and
genetically reprogrammed the
cells to become pluripotent stem
cells. Next year, Dr. Carlson pre-
dicts, scientists will combine
these methods: they will draw a
little blood, place it in a cocktail of
RNA and -- voila! --stem cells.
This advance would make pro-
ducing stem cells cheap, fast and
relatively easy. In fact, it may
even be possible for dedicated
amateurs to set up stem cell labs
in their own garage.

''We're going to see scientific results
that are correct, that are predictive,
but are without explanation. We may
be able to do science without insight,
and we may have to learn to live with-
out it. Science will still progress, but
computers will tell us things that are
true, and we won't understand them.''
Computers have been taking over
more and more of the things humans
used to do, including getting driving
directions and operating subway
trains. They've even started making
serious inroads into the heart of sci-
ence. Rather than just churning out
simulations or pretty pie charts, com-
puters can do what scientists have tra-
ditionally done: findmathematical
equations that explain complicated
data. Eureqa, for example, is an ''auto-
mated scientist'' created by a Cornell
engineer, Hod Lipson, and his stu-
dents. In 2009, they reported that sim-
ply by observing a pendulum, Eureqa
can rediscover some of Newton's laws
of physics.
In 2011, automated scientists are
poised to make major contributions to
science. Dr. Lipson and his students
are looking for hidden patterns in the
networks of proteins that break down
food in cells, for example, and they've
set up a Web site where people can
download Eureqa free of charge and
discover laws of nature for them-
selves.

HEADLINE: Census Reports Money Transfers

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
The Census Bureau reported Monday that United States households transferred $11.7 billion to friends and family members abroad in the year that ended August 2008. Of those who transferred, 84 percent were foreign born, the bureau found. The amount of money was far lower than that reported by other organizations like the World Bank, which estimated that transfers from the United States totaled nearly $50 billion in 2008. An analyst with the bureau said the discrepancy stemmed in part from different ways of accounting. Aaron Terrazas of the Migration Policy Institute said illegal immigrants, a large source of money transfers, tended to be undercounted in census surveys.

IMG Worldwide, the sports and entertainment giant, has formed a joint venture with the Brazilian conglomerate EBX Group to develop sports businesses in Brazil, the latest in a series of moves by IMG to push into the world's fastest-growing economies.
Behind the tie-up, expected to be announced Tuesday, are two charismatic billionaires: Ted Forstmann, the owner of IMG, and Eike Batista, pictured, founder of EBX. The two men are looking for opportunities in a country with a vibrant economy. Sports-crazed Brazil is also hosting the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016. 
''Our economy is booming, and we are hosting all these great events,'' Mr. Batista said. ''This makes all the sense in the world.''
For now, details of the joint venture are scant. But it follows a similar deal Mr. Forstmann struck this year with the Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries and its owner, the billionaire Mukesh Ambani. IMG and Reliance are looking to build professional soccer and basketball leagues in India.
In 2008 IMG expanded into China by reaching an agreement with the country's national television broadcaster to develop and market sports events. IMG struck a deal last year to produce an NFL highlights show in China.
Mr. Forstmann, 70, has long been one of Wall Street's biggest personalities. His $750 million acquisition of IMG in 2004, one of his last purchases, has transformed the firm from a talent agency that manages athlete's careers into one that produces and manages thousands of entertainment events, from the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in New York to the Escape From Alcatraz Triathlon.
IMG has become prickly about being labeled a mere talent agency, albeit one that represents Peyton Manning and Roger Federer. In September it issued a release: ''IMG Worldwide is a global sports and media company - it is incorrect to describe IMG as an 'agency.'''
The deal links Mr. Forstmann with Mr. Batista, an oil, mining and ship-building magnate with a net worth of $27 billion, according to Forbes magazine. Mr. Batista, 54, boasts that all of his businesses have the letter X at the end of their names - his mining company is called MMX; his oil business, OGX - to ''symbolize the multiplication of wealth.''
One thing has been decided upon: The joint venture will be called IMGX.
IMG's expansion comes at a time when foreign companies are pouring record amounts of capital into Brazil. Last month, for example, Chinese oil company Sinopec paid $7.1 billion for a stake in the Brazilian unit of Repsol, the Spanish oil giant.
Wealthy Brazilian investors are also buying up assets abroad. In September an investment firm backed by three Brazilian businessmen acquired Burger King Holdings, the fast food chain, for $3.3 billion. Mr. Batista said he invested $100 million in that deal.
Mr. Forstmann first took note of Mr. Batista when he appeared on ''The Charlie Rose Show'' in February. Mr. Batista, who made his money in commodities, predicted in the interview that in five years Brazil would be the world's fifth-largest economy and in 10 years he would be worth $100 million.
''After watching Charlie Rose, I said if we ever do a deal in Brazil, this is the guy I want to go into business with,'' Mr. Forstmann said.
Mr. Forstmann then invited Mr. Batista to his annual conference he hosts in Aspen, Colo. There, Mr. Batista appeared on a panel hosted by Mr. Rose about the so-called BRIC countries -- Brazil, Russia, India and China.
Mr. Forstmann and Mr. Batista then started discussing working together. Two weeks ago, Mr. Forstmann visited Brazil and explored the country with his new business partner, a trip that included a tour of Rio de Janeiro on Mr. Batista's helicopter.
''When you spend time with Eike down there you get a huge feeling of the country's potential,'' Mr. Forstmann said.

HEADLINE: Vicious Economic Circle

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Fast Track to Inequality,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Nov. 2): 
One of the unintended consequences of the ''hyperconcentration of wealth and income'' is that the superrich are unable to generate sufficient demand for products and services to replace the decline in consumer demand resulting from the present period of sustained high unemployment and underemployment in the work force.
Although the recession may technically be over, the end result of this shift in wealth is a vicious circle in which, absent a significant rise in consumer demand, corporations are reluctant to hire, and demand continues to stagnate or decline.
The titans of finance and industry may think that they can continue to pay themselves the obscene salaries and bonuses to which they have become accustomed, but unless they reverse this shift in the distribution of the fruits of the American economy -- growth made possible in no small measure by the increased productivity of the work force -- the crisis will imperil the very foundations on which they have built their corporate empires and megamansions.

HEADLINE: Ads for N.Y.U. Have Their Words in the Clouds

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Every cloud, so they say, has a silver lining. These days, clouds are also lined with words, and a campaign from New York University seeks to take advantage of that.
The campaign, now under way, is for the N.Y.U. School of Continuing and Professional Studies. The ads are centered on word clouds, which express in visual form the contents of Web sites.
The campaign, by Seiter & Miller Advertising in New York, creates fanciful clouds of words and phrases that are meant to bring to life the subjects of the courses that N.Y.U. offers adults seeking continuing education. Images of more than 800 word clouds are being produced for the campaign, the agency and school say.
Appropriately enough, the campaign, with a budget estimated at $3 million, has a significant presence in online media along with more traditional outlets like direct mail, transit posters and print advertisements. There are numerous ads in rich media formats with streaming video. 
The unspoken message behind the media choices is that the School of Continuing and Professional Studies understands how fast change is remaking the fields in which it offers undergraduate and graduate degrees, professional certificates, noncredit courses and public events.
Those fields include global affairs, graphic communications, the hospitality industry, human resources, public relations and corporate communications, real estate, real estate development and sports business.
The campaign is another example of how ardently the purveyors of continuing education have joined the ranks of consumer marketers. A somnolent category has become one of the most free-spending as Americans decide they need additional skills to cope with the shifts in the fields in which they work or, prompted by the economy, seek to switch fields altogether.
Not only are colleges and universities advertising their wares more frequently, so, too, are companies like Capella, DeVry, Kaplan, the University of Phoenix and Walden.
''The nonprofits can never spend the kind of money a University of Phoenix does,'' says Dorothy Durkin, associate dean for strategic development and marketing at the School of Continuing and Professional Studies. ''There's no way.''
As a result, ''we're probably marketing more aggressively than other parts of the university need to,'' she adds.
''The student, as a consumer, is going to look at all the features'' of a school, Ms. Durkin says, ''the brand, the cost, the convenience, the curriculum, the career services.''
''The Internet enables that more so than ever,'' she adds.
As a result, ''upwards of 60 to 65 percent'' of the money being spent on the campaign is being earmarked for digital media, Ms. Durkin says, compared with allocations for previous campaigns of 30 to 40 percent.
Although ''we're still continuing to use direct marketing'' and other nondigital media, she adds, ''there are so many more opportunities opening up'' as a result of the new media because of the ability to more precisely aim ads at intended audiences.
For instance, pitches on LinkedIn can be aimed according to job description, Ms. Durkin says, and ads for those who want to study real estate development can be run in ''in the real estate sections of NYTimes.com or WSJ.com.''
''This enables us to advertise more effectively,'' she adds.
Ms. Durkin praises the idea of the word clouds for its ability to address what appeals most to potential students.
''It underscores the knowledge that shapes the words,'' she adds, ''and reflects the expertise of our people.''
For instance, ads for the Center for Global Affairs use words and phrases like ''human rights,'' ''transnational security,'' ''energy policy,'' ''diplomacy,'' ''real-world context,'' ''climate change'' and ''NGOs,'' for nongovernmental organizations.
Among the words and phrases used in ads for studying tourism management are ''cultural heritage,'' ''capture rates,'' ''destination development,'' ''global citizenship,'' ''events,'' ''arrivals'' and ''health tourism.''
And ads for courses and other offerings in broadcasting, film and video use words and phrases like ''story analysis,'' ''web producing,'' ''green screen,'' ''cinematography,'' ''visual storytelling,'' ''entertainment law,'' ''Steadicam'' and ''Final Cut Pro,'' which is editing software.
All the ads end with the address of the school's Web site.
''In the not-too-distant past, this was a predominantly print and out-of-home campaign,'' says Bob Rose, director for account services at Seiter & Miller. ''Now, the online world is here.''
''The big benefit of digital media is the ability to drill down with more precision,'' he adds, ''and put a message for each industry contextually closer to the people for whom it's most compatible with their career aspirations.''
Livingston Miller, president at Seiter & Miller, credits the idea of the word cloud to a creative director at the agency, Stefan Danielski, who is also an art director.
''He walked in with it and said, 'I think this solves a lot of problems,' '' Mr. Miller recalls, in that the concept could deliver ''specific messaging for individual programs'' as well as have ''all the advertising add up to a message for N.Y.U.''
That is important because the subjects at the School for Continuing and Professional Studies are ''extremely diverse,'' Mr. Miller says, ''so we want the creative to add up to a central message about the mother ship.''
Economic conditions will increase the demand for continuing education, he says he believes, because ''fewer people can afford to send Dick or Jane to four years on a leafy campus.''
And that would mean still more growth in the ranks of ''the nontraditional student,'' he adds.
The word clouds also appear in the streaming videos, which feature faculty members. For example, a clip with Constantine Kontokosta, clinical associate professor of real estate at the N.Y.U. Schack Institute of Real Estate, presents words and phrases like ''land use,'' ''sustainability'' and ''public/private.''
And a video with Bjorn Hanson, divisional dean of the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management, offers a word cloud composed of words and phrases like ''boutique hotels,'' ''demand forecasting'' and ''international brands.''
The word clouds in some ads are general rather than specific, giving an overview of all the jobs and careers covered by the School for Continuing and Professional Studies.
One such ad lists, among others, ''hotel executive,'' ''global talent manager,'' ''diplomatic adviser,'' ''brand architect,'' ''digital producer,'' ''real estate developer,'' ''lead animator,'' ''tourism director'' and ''editor in chief.''
What, no ''writer of advertising e-mail newsletters''?

HEADLINE: Democrats Find Perfect Timing Elusive in Approach to Tax Cut Bill

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When one party controls the White House and Congress, it controls the calendar for what gets done and when. So how is it that Democrats ended up in such a fix over what to do about the expiring Bush-era tax cuts?
That is what many Democrats are asking. 
By dint of calculation and miscalculation, after mixed messages and missed signals, President Obama and Congressional Democratic leaders delayed debate until before the midterm elections. They dared Republicans to fight for extending the tax cuts for the rich and, in so doing, ''hold hostage'' those for the middle class. But it was Democrats who blinked as their ranks splintered in the heat of a worsening electoral climate, and they delayed any vote until after the elections.
Now, with the tax cuts due to expire Dec. 31, the debate finally commences next week in a lame-duck session, with Democrats weakened, Republicans emboldened by the election results and the tepid economy continuing to provide some argument against letting rates rise even for the highest income levels.
For every election since the Bush tax cuts became law in 2001 and 2003, a central plank of Democrats' campaign platforms has been to repeal them for high-income brackets -- to pay for other programs, like expanded health care, or to reduce budget deficits.
By Mr. Obama's election, however, the financial system had nearly collapsed and the economy was in recession. He and Congressional Democrats quietly decided to let the Bush tax cuts remain in place for income above $250,000 for couples, and $200,000 for individuals, until their scheduled expiration at the end of 2010.
The economy's continued slow growth largely explains why ending those tax cuts, which apply to about 2 percent of Americans, proved easier said than done for Democrats. But other factors also explain their vacillation this year, including a crowded legislative agenda, the worsening political headwinds and, perhaps most of all, Democrats' chronic insecurity about dealing with tax issues.
A year ago this month, political and economic advisers at the White House first held a series of meetings on what to do about the tax cuts in the coming year. There was no consensus; advisers would shift positions with time and circumstances.
And a vicious circle took hold, according to interviews over past months with Democrats in the administration and Congress: Mr. Obama largely deferred to Democratic leaders -- the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, was among those in tough re-election races -- while Democrats looked to the president to take the lead and make the case against extending the tax cuts for high incomes.
Mr. Obama's budget early this year called for permanently extending the tax cuts except on high incomes, but administration officials signaled to Democrats that he could support a short-term extension of one or two years. That would reduce deficit projections and, the officials reckoned, provide an impetus for overhauling and simplifying the tax code before the middle-class tax rates expired again.
In February, Democrats believed the issue was effectively settled when they passed and Mr. Obama signed the so-called pay-go law, for ''pay as you go,'' requiring that the cost of new spending or new tax cuts be offset by spending cuts or tax increases of equal value to avoid adding to annual deficits.
Among the law's major exceptions: The tax rates for income up to $250,000 could be extended without offsetting savings, at a cost of roughly $3 trillion over 10 years. Not so for rates on higher income. The fiscally conservative Blue Dog Democrats persuaded liberals to support the pay-go bill partly by arguing that Republicans could not find the $700 billion needed to offset a long-term extension of top rates.
The tax issue remained on a backburner month after month as Democrats were preoccupied with the health care law, the overhaul of financial regulations and other issues. Still, the administration remained confident that the House, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, ultimately would block any extension of the top rates.
But by summer, with the recovery stalled and more of them on handicappers' endangered lists, House Democrats refused to vote on the tax cuts before the Senate did. They feared they would endure Republicans' charge that they had voted to raise taxes on some small businesses, only to see the legislation languish in the Senate like other bills had.
Ms. Pelosi informed the White House of the House Democratic position. At a meeting before Congress recessed for August, to the surprise of others, Mr. Reid assured her and Mr. Obama that the Senate would vote in September to extend only the middle-income rates.
But when Congress returned, party pollsters and consultants battled over the right course, each side interpreting polling data to its advantage.
One camp believed, as Stan Greenberg and James Carville wrote in a Sept. 15 memorandum, that ''Democrats Should Want This Tax Cut Debate.'' They argued that it would define the election as a choice between Democrats for the middle class and deficit reduction, against Republicans for Wall Street and more debt.
Another camp countered that in an already bad year, Democrats were especially vulnerable to the ''tax and spend'' label. As the pollster Mark Mellman summed the argument in an interview, ''An election that's dominated by the tax issue is a bad election for Democrats everywhere, anywhere and always.''
By then several moderate Senate Democrats who were not up for re-election -- Evan Bayh of Indiana, Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Kent Conrad of North Dakota -- had expressed opposition to letting the top rates expire because of the economy's fragility. That suggested Senate Democrats could not muster the 60 votes to overcome a Republican filibuster, further unnerving Democrats struggling for re-election.
Several, including Senators Barbara Boxer of California and Patty Murray of Washington, implored Mr. Reid not to force the debate. He agreed. All three won re-election.
The day after the election, Mr. Obama said he was open to compromise with Republicans.

HEADLINE: Obama Presses to Complete Free-Trade Deal With South Korea

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; Mark McDonald contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The White House is intensifying negotiations with South Korea on revising a free-trade agreement negotiated by the Bush administration, even though the accord still faces opposition from Democratic politicians, labor unions and the Ford Motor Company.
The agreement was signed in 2007 but requires approval by Congress, where Democrats have said they will not support it unless barriers to American exports of automobiles and beef are further reduced. 
On Monday, the United States trade representative, Ron Kirk, and his Korean counterpart, Kim Jong-hoon, met in Seoul, where their aides have been in face-to-face talks since last week.
And as part of his 10-day trip to Asia, President Obama is scheduled to arrive in Seoul on Thursday to meet with President Lee Myung-bak and attend a two-day meeting with other leaders of the Group of 20 economic powers.
''Hopefully, by the time he comes we will have an agreement,'' Mr. Lee said in an interview Saturday in Seoul. ''We will send a very powerful and strong message about maintaining open markets and resist the trend toward protectionism.''
Mr. Lee said the agreement would help cement the 60-year-old alliance between the countries.
At the last G-20 leaders' meeting, held in Toronto in June, Mr. Obama announced a goal of completing the agreement by the Seoul meeting and submitting it to Congress early next year. Mr. Obama, who was critical of such trade agreements when he ran for office, stopped short of calling for the deal to be renegotiated, but called for adjustments in areas like the auto provisions.
The Republican takeover of the House in the midterm elections added momentum to pending trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. Business groups like the United States Chamber of Commerce support the trade agreements, as do financial services companies.
On Sunday, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader in the Senate, said that he had discussed the trade agreements with Mr. Obama, and mentioned them as a possible area of bipartisan cooperation. ''The notion that we're at each other's throats all the time is simply not correct,'' he said on CBS's ''Face the Nation.''
An important exception to corporate support for the agreement is Ford, the only one of the big three Detroit automakers that has not gotten a bailout. On Thursday, Ford ran full-page ads in newspapers stating: ''For every 52 cars Korea ships here, the U.S. can only export one there.''
While the agreement would lower or eliminate tariffs on cars in both countries, other barriers would remain, including emissions, mileage and safety requirements and tax and insurance rules that automakers and the United Automobile Workers union say discriminate against American cars.
''American-made cars can compete and win globally, but we can't afford a future with more closed markets to American exports,'' Ford said in the ad.
Chrysler has reservations about the agreement in its current form. General Motors, which owns a Korean automaker, Daewoo, has remained neutral.
The White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said last week that the negotiators hoped to amend provisions that were ''tilted against auto companies and autoworkers.''
The other major sticking point is beef. Shortly after taking office in 2008, Mr. Lee moved to relax restrictions on imports of American beef, which had been banned since 2003 because of concerns over mad cow disease. That led to protests in Korea, with scores of injuries.
South Korea now permits imports of beef from cattle younger than 30 months, which are the least likely to harbor the agent that causes the disease. But Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees trade, has called for lifting all restrictions on American beef exports.
Democrats have been skeptical of claims that the deal will create jobs. In a joint letter last month to Mr. Obama and Mr. Lee, 20 House members and 35 Korean lawmakers called for strengthening health, labor and environmental standards in the agreement, echoing concerns raised by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. But neither government seems to want to revisit those terms.
Republicans broadly support the deal the Bush administration negotiated. ''Not only does the Korean market offer excellent growth prospects for American firms, but a free-trade agreement with Korea will have huge foreign policy and national security benefits in Asia,'' said Clayton K. Yeutter, who was the trade representative from 1985 to 1989, under President Ronald Reagan.
The United States had a $10.6 billion trade deficit in goods with South Korea last year, and supporters of the agreement say it would help close that gap. South Korea signed a free-trade agreement with the European Union last month, and business groups say the United States should complete the deal to remain competitive.
Han Duk-soo, the South Korean ambassador in Washington, who is trying to build support in Congress for the agreement, said in a recent interview that the imported share of the Korean auto market had risen substantially over the last decade and that the United States enjoyed a sizable trade surplus with his country in agricultural products.

HEADLINE: Unexpectedly, India Endorses Fed Action

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and VIKAS BAJAJ; Sheryl Gay Stolberg reported from New Delhi and Vikas Bajaj reported from Mumbai.

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- When the United States Federal Reserve announced last week that it would buy $600 billion in Treasury bonds to help bolster the economy, it quickly came under attack from Germany, Brazil and China, which said America was trying to devalue the dollar to the detriment of other nations' exports.
On Monday, the Fed's plans earned a hearty endorsement from at least one foreign trade partner -- India. 
''A strong, robust, fast-growing United States is in the interests of the world,'' said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. ''And therefore, anything that would stimulate the underlying growth and policies of entrepreneurship in the United States would help the cause of global prosperity.''
Mr. Singh, an economist by training, made his comments during a joint news conference here with President Barack Obama. The prime minister's support could help the United States deflect criticism of Washington's economic policies at the upcoming Group of 20 meeting in Seoul later this week, which both Mr. Obama and Mr. Singh will attend.
President Obama, perhaps less surprisingly, also voiced support for the Fed policy in his first public comment on the action.
''The worst thing that could happen to the world economy -- not just ours, but the entire world's economy -- is if we end up being stuck with no growth or very limited growth,'' Mr. Obama said. ''I think that's the Fed's concern and that's my concern, as well.''
The two leaders' comments came on the third day of a 10-day Asia swing for President Obama -- a journey the White House is characterizing as an economic mission. China, Germany, Brazil and other nations with big surpluses in exports and their current accounts -- a broad measure of foreign trade and financial dealings -- tend to see the Fed's planned bond purchases as flooding the market with dollars. That cheapens the American currency, critics say, and makes other countries exports less price competitive.
The Fed's action, by lowering American interest rates, can also cause money to flood into other countries as investors seekhigher returns -- which can threaten to overheat those countries' economies.
But in the news conference here, Mr. Obama countered with a not-so veiled criticism of China and other countries with large trade and current account surpluses. He said the world needed a broad rebalancing.
''We can't continue to sustain a situation in which some countries are maintaining massive surpluses, others massive deficits and there never is the kind of adjustment with respect to currency that would lead to a more balanced growth pattern,'' Mr. Obama said.
At the G-20 meeting, the president intends to press other countries to embrace a non-biding target to limit their current account surpluses and deficits to no more than 4 percent, according to an administration official. The administration is also expected to press the International Monetary Fund to take a greater role in monitoring trade patterns and intervening on exchange rate disputes.
With United States unemployment stuck at 9.6 percent, some economists are arguing that the American economy needs an additional spur. But because the Fed's action might lower the value of the dollar, is has led to criticism that the United States government -- which has long complained about China's currency devaluation -- is acting hypocritically.
Mr. Obama and Mr. Singh made their remarks in response to a question about comments made last week by the finance minister of Germany, who in a recent interview with Der Spiegel called the Fed's decision ''undermining the credibility of U.S. financial policy.''
The minister, Wolfgang Schauble, went on to say, ''It doesn't add up when the Americans accuse the Chinese of currency manipulation and then, with the help of their central bank's printing presses, artificially lower the value of the dollar.''
Privately, American officials say they were miffed by Mr. Schauble's comments, saying it was a breach of protocol for the foreign minister of one country to criticize the central banker of another.
Still, there was more criticism from finance ministries on Monday. In Beijing, the vice finance minister, Zhu Guangyao, told reporters on Monday that America ''did not recognize its responsibility to stabilize global markets and did not think about the impact of excessive liquidity on emerging markets.''
Mr. Singh appears to have taken a different tack by supporting Mr. Obama and the Fed in part because India is not as dependent on exports as China, Germany and Brazil. India's currency, the rupee, has also appreciated less in relation to the dollar than others like the Brazilian real.
''Of all the various countries in the G-20, the one that is least dependent on export-led growth is probably India,'' said Suman Bery, director general of the National Council of Applied Economic Research in New Delhi. ''India has more to gain by reactivation of the U.S. economy than it has to lose from a depreciation of the U.S. dollar.''
Furthermore, India, unlike other developing nations like Brazil and Thailand, has generally welcomed foreign capital that has flooded into emerging markets in search of higher-yielding assets. India needs foreign investment to help fund its large current account deficit -- more than 3 percent of its gross domestic product. Foreign money pushed up the stock market here to a new record high last week and it has driven up the rupee nearly 6 percent since August.

HEADLINE: Scratching Under the Vinyl Era

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO

 BODY:
The images have been scattered about in dusty and moldy warehouses, relics of the pre-Internet age when photography was integral to selling music, and the photographers -- names like Irving Penn, Annie Leibovitz, Lee Friedlander and Robert Mapplethorpe -- went on to become nearly as famous as the subjects they captured and defined.
''Every day is like, what am I going to find today?'' said Grayson Dantzic, the archivist for Atlantic Records in New York. With colleagues at Warner Music Group, Atlantic's parent, he is part of an ambitious project to recover the company's story -- and a good chunk of American cultural history as well -- by excavating the contents of nearly 100,000 boxes from warehouses around the globe, whose accumulated photographs and other memorabilia track popular music from the Edwardian and Victorian ages to disco and jazz, from Beethoven to Miles Davis.
In an industry whose product is now compressed into tidy digital bits, the project is an exercise in record-keeping that is partly motivated by the urgencies of economics. The material is potentially quite valuable, and the company is searching for ways to make money from it, through high-end art books, sales to collectors and applications for iPads. 
The project is also a story of what media companies have left behind as they increasingly move to digital formats, a reconfiguring that has upended the economics of the business.
''I wanted to take an inventory of what we had,'' said Edgar Bronfman Jr., the chairman and chief executive of the Warner Music Group. ''We thought it was important from an artistic standpoint, from a corporate culture standpoint and potentially from a consumer standpoint.''
Mr. Bronfman, who calls the project ''Sight of Sound,'' added: ''I think there's the potential to make money. It's indefinable.''
The archive project may also be instructive for reintegrating visual art into music marketing.
''Visual art has historically been a powerful component that deepens fans' music experience,'' said Will Tanous, an executive vice president at Warner who is overseeing the project. ''We lost that in recent years. But with today's emerging digital platforms, we have the opportunity to inspire a renaissance in visual art associated with music.''
After Mr. Bronfman and investors bought the company in 2004 from Time Warner, it took a few years for executives to realize what the company had in storage under Time Warner's name, and they sent lawyers to the former owners to secure permission to release the materials.
In close to a year of digging, the company has only pricked the surface: there are still 14,000 boxes in New Jersey alone that haven't been touched, and tens of thousands more elsewhere in the United States and abroad in places like Brazil, Japan and Australia.
Warner Music traces its corporate lineage back to 1811 through its ownership of the music publisher Warner Chappell, whose business then was selling sheet music and the machines to play it: pianos. Among the finds is a black-and-white photo of a Chappell piano being delivered to Buckingham Palace. Songbooks dating to the 1830s are among the oldest items. More recent materials include drawings by Maurice Sendak, who produced cover art for Elektra Records before he became famous as a children's illustrator; a hand-written history of Atlantic Records by its co-founder Ahmet Ertegun; and recording contracts for some titans of American music.
''Aretha's contract is right there,'' said Mr. Dantzic, referring to Aretha Franklin and pointing to a box on a shelf above his computer. In another box is Ray Charles's original recording contract, signed with an 'X.' In a separate office is a piano from the 1920s that George Gershwin played, come upon in a cluttered storage area.
A photocopy of a letter from Beethoven to a former pupil recommending Chappell as a music publisher, dated 1819, has sent Warner's archivists digging for the valuable original.
But the bulk of the delights -- of potential value to high-end collectors -- are the rock and jazz photographs, including a series of unpublished black-and-white shots of Led Zeppelin in the studio in 1969 by Jim Cummins. The intimate collection by Mr. Cummins, who was an Atlantic photographer, portrays a group of young rockers before they became hugely famous and includes a rare image of Robert Plant, the band's singer, playing the acoustic guitar.
''There was a real sense of documentation back then,'' said Bob Kaus, an Atlantic executive who is involved in the project. ''Music and art really go together.''
Among other images Mr. Dantzic displayed recently were platinum palladium prints Penn took of Miles Davis; New Orleans jazz photos from the 1950s by Mr. Friedlander, whose work is currently on display at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York; a contact sheet of Ms. Leibovitz's images of Ms. Franklin at the Fillmore West in 1971, as well as a collection of shots of the same event taken by Jim Marshall, the rock photographer who died this year. (Photography aficionados will enjoy an image Mr. Marshall took of Ms. Leibovitz.) Materials related to some of Mapplethorpe's early days as a photographer for Elektra in the 1970s -- he shot at least one album cover for the band Television -- are being sought in an archive on the West Coast.
Before the Internet, photography was so much a part of selling music that record companies spared little expense to hire photographers to shoot album covers and document a band's work, on the road and in the studio. Today that documentation occurs, but often by the bands themselves, with flip cameras and mobile phones. The vinyl record, in effect, provided a large canvas for a photographer -- a surface made smaller with the advent of the compact disc, and virtually non-existent in today's world of digital downloads.
''I've had my ego stroked a lot,'' said Mr. Cummins, who recalled entering record stores and seeing his work on giant displays. ''You were definitely an integral part of what was done.''
Jac Holzman, who founded Warner's Elektra Records 60 years ago, was a pioneer in integrating visual art and popular music -- and documenting the artistic process at every stage, including the marketing and business aspects. When the company placed a billboard for the Doors on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles in the 1960s, the Doors were on hand, and Mr. Holzman made sure it was all photographed.
''We were all adept at photography,'' Mr. Holzman said. ''Any employee who would be at a session was given a camera. I never went to a session without a camera.''
These days ''you don't have the canvas to show your work,'' said Neal Preston, a photographer who worked for Atlantic in the 1970s and whose own images of Led Zeppelin and others from that era have been uncovered in the archive project. ''There is a deep connection for a lot of us in terms of what an album cover means to us emotionally,'' he said. ''It goes hand in hand with the music. At least it used to.''
Mr. Preston spent years on the road with bands, photographing fly-on-the-wall moments at the behest of Atlantic Records.
''These jobs aren't given out anymore,'' he said. ''Bands and labels don't want to spend the money.''
Lisa Tanner was hired as a photographer by Atlantic in the late 1970s when she was just 17, and hit the road with bands like the Rolling Stones, Foreigner and Yes.
''You just sort of hung out,'' she said, ''and waited for a moment to happen.'' .

HEADLINE: First Lady's Dance Moves Woo Indian Crowds

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- While President Obama is wooing India with promises of increased trade and United Nations clout, his wife's charm offensive has included serial hugs and a talent for Indian dance.
The combination has been an unexpected success.
An Indian public and news media that were lukewarm before the official three-day visit began on Saturday have since become exuberant Michelle Obama fans. 
''Dancing Queen Rocks India,'' The Times of India, the world's largest-circulation English language newspaper, trumpeted on its front page Monday. Mrs. Obama ''demonstrated she could swing to desi beats with the best of them,'' the paper said, referring to Indian beats. It lavished praise on her ''matkas and jhatkas,'' or dance moves involving swaying hips.
Mrs. Obama's relaxed manner and enthusiasm also won her high praise. ''She hugged me twice, very warmly, and held my hand,'' said Baljit Kaur, a female village leader from the state of Punjab, who accompanied schoolgirls to New Delhi to see Mrs. Obama on Monday.
Carefully planned events have enabled Mrs. Obama to interact casually with children, albeit near a scrum of photographers and reporters. She offered advice about staying in school, shook a tambourine and encouraged a group of pig-tailed girls to believe in ''women power.''
While Mrs. Obama's thoughts on education have been politely received, many foreign politicians' wives have come bearing the same message. As many as 60 percent of children live in poverty in India, overall literacy rates hover at 65 percent and female literacy rates are as low as 33 percent in some areas of the country.
Not all of the politicians' wives have danced, though. In India, where everyone from teenage boys to septuagenarian aunts dance at weddings, a reticence to join the dance floor is seen as a troubling sign of a possible character flaw -- one that Mrs. Obama certainly does not exhibit.
On Saturday, Mrs. Obama met with 33 orphaned and runaway children who are being taught English by Make a Difference, a nonprofit group. She played hopscotch and word games, and then picked up a tambourine and danced with the children to a theme song from a Bollywood movie.
Then she offered a little advice. ''I didn't grow up with a lot of money,'' she told the children. ''I never even imagined being the first lady of the United States. But because I had an education, when the time came to do this, I was ready.''
When there were no questions, Mrs. Obama suggested the group dance again, and was quickly surrounded by a bouncing circle of girls throwing their arms up in the air. The boys nearby jumped up and down.
On Sunday, Mr. and Mrs. Obama visited students at Mumbai's Holy Name High School, then joined them as they danced to a folk song. One video clip from that event is winging its way around the Internet, inspiring as much commentary on the grace of Mrs. Obama as the seeming left-footedness of her husband.
On Monday, she went on a tour of a craft museum in New Delhi with about 20 young girls, many among the first generation in their families to get an education. Mrs. Obama held their hands and put her arms protectively around them as they walked, admiring statues of Durga, a Hindu goddess, and antique scrolls.
After the tour Mrs. Obama, seated outdoors under a canopy of pink bougainvillea vines, told the girls to keep studying, they recalled later.
One of the girls, Manpreet Kaur, 14, took an overnight train from her village in the Punjab to meet Mrs. Obama. She said she asked Mrs. Obama, ''If you have a fight with your husband, who apologized first?'' Mrs. Obama replied that ''the president has to say he is sorry first,'' Manpreet said, to giggles.
While Indian designers bemoaned her decision not to wear a sari, Mrs. Obama's covered-up, simple and discreet outfits here were also praised. ''What she is wearing is reflective of her deep sense of respect for the Indian culture, and she has opted for colors and designs which do not attract attention to her,'' designer Rina Dhaka told the Economic Times.
The Obamas leave India on Monday for Indonesia, the next leg of their Asian tour. There, Mrs. Obama will also tour cultural sites and meet with Peace Corps volunteers, an aide said Monday.

HEADLINE: A New Bush, a Lot Like the Old One

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
He said he still felt sickened that no weapons of mass destruction were ever found in Iraq. Yet former President George W. Bush said that his worst moment in the Oval Office came when the rap star Kanye West claimed that the president didn't care about black people.
''The suggestion that I was racist because of the response to Katrina represented an all-time low,'' Mr. Bush told a surprised Matt Lauer on NBC on Monday night. 
''I didn't appreciate it then; I don't appreciate it now,'' he added fiercely. ''I resent it, it's not true, and it was one of the most disgusting moments in my presidency.''
There was something jarring about suddenly seeing George W. Bush on screen again and it wasn't just deja vu. It was more like running into a former spouse after many years: no matter how bitter or amicable the separation, that first reunion is disconcerting -- the ex seems both eerily the same and weirdly diminished. Two years ago he left office with two wars raging and an economy in free fall, an embattled commander in chief with the lowest approval ratings of any modern president. Now Mr. Bush is offering himself up as a chatty president emeritus, sometimes defiant and other times cheerful, on a media blitz to promote his memoir, ''Decision Points.''
It was a fascinating, at times disarming, performance, but also a confusing one: a plea for understanding from a president who says he doesn't give a fig about popularity. At one point, Mr. Bush boasted that when an acquaintance told him his approval ratings were up, he retorted, ''Who cares?''
In the hourlong NBC News special, Mr. Bush talked about himself with the blend of candor and self-serving boilerplate that almost all book-promoting celebrities master on a publicity tour.
He told the very personal story of how as a teenager he drove his mother to the hospital after she suffered a miscarriage, and discovered how ''straightforward'' she was when she showed him the remains of the fetus in a jar.
He also gave an example of how out of control he could be before he gave up drinking. ''So, I'm drunk at the dinner table at Mother and Dad's house in Maine. And my brothers and sister are there, Laura's there. And I'm sitting next to a beautiful woman, friend of Mother and Dad's. And I said to her out loud, 'What is sex like after 50?' ''
When Mr. Lauer pressed him about his more critical decisions in office, Mr. Bush was both forthcoming and maddeningly opaque. He scoffed at the notion that he cared that critics viewed him as a puppet manipulated by his strong-willed vice president, Dick Cheney, then kept underscoring ways he had defied his No. 2, including by refusing to grant Mr. Cheney's chief of staff, I. Lewis Libby Jr., a pardon after Mr. Libby was convicted of lying during the investigation into the unmasking of a C.I.A. operative. (Instead, Mr. Bush commuted his sentence.)
Mr. Bush ruefully acknowledged that he mishandled the Hurricane Katrina crisis, even writing a new script for his first trip to the disaster area. ''I should have touched down in Baton Rouge, met with the governor, and, you know, walked out and said, 'I hear you,' '' he said. ''And then got back on a flight up to Washington. I did not do that. And paid a price for it.''
But he refused to apply hindsight to the invasion of Iraq. Mr. Lauer asked him whether he would do the same thing again if he had known then what he knows now. Mr. Bush replied: ''I, first of all, didn't have that luxury. You just don't have the luxury when you're president.''
He added, ''I will say definitely the world is better off without Saddam Hussein in power, as are 25 million people who now have a chance to live in freedom.''
It was a curious form of hedging from a president who prides on himself plain speaking.
There were other moments when Mr. Bush was defensive, but for the most part he looked more relaxed and unguarded than that at any time in his presidency, even chuckling about history's final verdict. (''I hope I'm judged a success, but I'm going to be dead, Matt, when they finally figure it out.'') Throughout his tumultuous two terms, Mr. Bush rarely looked comfortable in formal interviews and news conferences.
This new book-tour persona harks back to his days as a presidential candidate, before the attacks of Sept. 11 and other crises curbed his breezy confidence and stiffened his demeanor.
Mr. Bush, who in the coming days will sit down with Oprah Winfrey and many other celebrity interviewers, says he wrote his book to give readers -- and future historians -- a sense of what his days in the White House were really like. Mostly, however, the NBC interview offered viewers a visceral reminder of what Mr. Bush was like before he entered the Oval Office.

HEADLINE: Bank Chiefs Say Growth In Economies Is Still Uneven

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
BASEL, Switzerland -- Central bank chiefs warned Monday that economic growth remained uneven, especially in industrial countries, as new data reinforced fears of a slowdown in Germany, Europe's biggest economy. 
''There is a degree of uncertainty which is the mark of the present time,'' the European Central Bank president, Jean-Claude Trichet, said in a news conference after a meeting of central bankers, held under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements. ''Colleagues share this sentiment that we have to accept we are in a universe where there are risks.''
Mr. Trichet, serving as spokesman for the group, did not refer to any specific countries but said there was a divergence between the advanced economies and ''impressive'' growth in emerging markets.
In Europe, Germany's export strength has been helping to lift growth across the Continent and compensate for the negative effects of the sovereign debt crisis. Data released Monday, however, showed that German industrial production fell 0.8 percent in September from August, as a decline in manufacturing outweighed gains in construction and energy.
At the same time, German exports, which include services and financial transfers as well as manufactured goods, rose 3 percent from August, the Federal Statistical Office said.
''The upswing in industry has clearly lost considerable momentum in the past few months,'' Ralph Solveen, an economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said in a note. ''The growth rates of the first half of the year are unlikely to be achieved again that quickly.''
Rolf Schneider, an economist at the insurer Allianz, noted, however, that while the upswing might have ''come off the boil'' recently, ''this does not alter the still positive economic outlook.''
During his news conference here, Mr. Trichet avoided criticizing the decision by the Federal Reserve last week to pump more liquidity into the United States economy by purchasing hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Treasury securities.
Other countries have complained that the move will push the dollar lower and stoke inflation. Wolfgang Schauble, the German finance minister, last week called the policy ''clueless.''
But Mr. Trichet, while declining to discuss any specific country, said central bankers agreed on the need to hold inflation below 2 percent.
''All central bankers in the world have a unity of purpose in terms of anchoring inflation expectations in line with their definition of price stability,'' he said.
''The word 'currency wars' was not pronounced at all,'' Mr. Trichet added. ''Absolutely no country mentioned they were pursuing weak currency policies.''
Mr. Trichet seemed to put little stock in a call by Robert Zoellick, president of the World Bank, for a return to a modified gold standard as a way to control currency movements. Mr. Zoellick made the comments in an article written for The Financial Times on Monday.
Mr. Trichet noted that such proposals had been made for decades. ''We did not discuss the reintroduction of the gold standard,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Support Grows for Wider Climate Treaty

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With energy legislation shelved in the United States and little hope for a global climate change agreement this year, some policy experts are proposing a novel approach to curbing global warming: including greenhouse gases under an existing and highly successful international treaty ratified more than 20 years ago.
The treaty, the Montreal Protocol, was adopted in 1987 for a completely different purpose, to eliminate aerosols and other chemicals that were blowing a hole in the Earth's protective ozone layer. 
But as the signers of the protocol convened the 22nd annual meeting in Bangkok on Monday, negotiators are considering a proposed expansion in the ozone treaty to phase out the production and use of the industrial chemicals known as hydrofluorocarbons or HFCs The chemicals have thousands of times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide, the most prevalent greenhouse gas.
HFCs are used as refrigerants in air-conditioners and cooling systems. They are manufactured mostly in China and India, but appliances containing the substance are in use in every corner of the world. HFCs replaced even more dangerous ozone-depleting chemicals known as HCFCs, themselves a substitute for the chlorofluorocarbons that were the first big target of the Montreal process.
''Eliminating HFCs under the Montreal Protocol is the single biggest chunk of climate protection we can get in the next few years,'' said Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, a nongovernment organization based in Washington. He noted that the ozone protection effort had begun under former President Ronald Reagan and continues to enjoy bipartisan support.
The United States has thrown its support behind the proposal and negotiators said there was a strong current of support for the move at the meeting on Monday. All the signatories to the Montreal Protocol would have to agree to the expansion, but no further approval from Congress would be needed. So far, there has been no Congressional or industry opposition to the idea.
But the plan is not expected to be adopted this year. Large developing countries, including China, India and Brazil, object that the timetable is too rapid and that payments for eliminating the refrigerant are not high enough.
One advantage to using the Montreal protocol as a vehicle, supporters say, is that negotiations over the treaty have been utterly unlike the contentious United Nations climate talks that foundered in Copenhagen last year. Negotiators say that without legislative action on curbing greenhouse gases by the United States, little progress will be made when countries gather in Cancun, Mexico, late this month for another round of climate talks.
In a post-election news conference, President Obama noted that it was doubtful that Congress would do anything to address global warming ''this year or next year or the year after.''
Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, the Montreal treaty has been signed by all nations. They conduct their business with little drama and with broad scientific and technical input from governments and industry. The financing mechanisms, while occasionally contentious, are generally quickly resolved and seen as equitable.
The ozone treaty was unanimously ratified in 1988 by the United States Senate, which a decade later unanimously voted against adopting the Kyoto Protocol to address climate change. Montreal's pollution reduction targets are mandatory, universally accepted and readily measurable. None of that is true of the climate process.
The Montreal Protocol has phased out nearly 97 percent of 100 ozone-depleting chemicals, some of which are also potent climate-altering gases. The net effect has been the elimination of the equivalent of more than 200 billion metric tons of global-warming gases, five years' worth of total global emissions, far more than has been accomplished by the Kyoto process.
It has been, according to the former United Nations secretary general Kofi Annan, ''perhaps the most successful international agreement to date.''
The proposal to eliminate HFCs was advanced several years ago by the tiny island nation of Micronesia, one of the places on Earth most vulnerable to sea-level rise and other global warming effects.
The United States quickly signed on. Along with Mexico and Canada, the Obama administration has proposed a rapid series of steps to reduce HFC production, with rich countries meeting a faster timetable than developing nations and helping to pay the poorer countries to find substitutes. But the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that adopting the HFC proposal could eliminate the equivalent of 88 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide by 2050, and slow global warming by a decade.
Daniel A. Reifsnyder, the deputy assistant secretary of state for environment and the nation's chief Montreal Protocol negotiator, said that it might take several years to persuade the ozone treaty countries to back the plan.
In addition to pace and cost issues, some countries say that HFCs have little impact on the ozone layer and thus should be handled under the United Nations climate change talks. Mr. Reifsnyder dismissed that as a legalistic argument and said that the ozone treaty could and should be used to achieve broader environmental objectives.
''What we've found is that the Montreal Protocol has been a very effective instrument for addressing global environmental problems,'' Mr. Reifsnyder said in an interview. ''It was created to deal with the ozone layer, but it also has tremendous ability to solve the climate problem if people are willing to use it that way.''
Mario Molina, the Mexican scientist who shared the Nobel Prize in chemistry for his groundbreaking work in identifying the role of chlorofluorocarbon gases in the breach of the stratospheric ozone layer, said that it might take two or three years for other countries to see the virtues of the HFC reduction.
''My hope is that everybody will agree with this proposal from the United States and Mexico and a few other countries because the Montreal Protocol has been so successful at controlling these industrial chemicals,'' he said in an interview from his institute in Mexico City.
Dr. Molina said that extending the protocol to include HFCs could reduce the threat of climate change by several times what the Kyoto Protocol proposes. He noted that the climate treaty had fallen far short of its goals, and that there was no agreement on what should replace it when its major provisions expired in 2012.
''We understand it's a stretch to use an international agreement designed for another purpose,'' he said. ''But dealing with these chemicals and using this treaty to protect the planet makes a lot of sense.''

HEADLINE: Poll: The Economy Trumps Health Care

BYLINE: REED ABELSON


HIGHLIGHT: A Kaiser Foundation survey showed the health care came in fourth as a reason for voting in the midterm elections.

 BODY:
It's not health care, stupid, it's the economy. 
Despite the Republicans' reading of the midterm elections as a call to arms to repeal or roll back the new health care law, a poll released on Tuesday by the Kaiser Family Foundation suggests people were not thinking first and foremost about health care when they cast their vote last week. 
In contrast to exit polls taken after the election, Kaiser asked voters to explain why they voted the way they did and what factors influenced their decision. While voters cited a variety of factors, ranging from the economy and jobs to voting against a candidate from a specific party, health care ranked fourth on list, with 17 percent citing health care or reform as one of the top factors in how they cast their vote. Those exit polls also indicated the economy, by far, played a critical role in the election, according to a story last week by our colleagues on the results, Which is not to say health care was a plus for those Democratic candidates who supported the legislation. "To the extent people were thinking about health reform at the voting booth, it appears the law's opponents had an advantage over its supporters," according to the Kaiser analysis. Almost six of ten people who thought health reform was one of the factors determining their vote supported a Republican candidate for Congress.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Fuels a Rise in Wages in Manhattan

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: Higher wages in the financial services field, but for now, fewer people making them.

 BODY:
Illustrating just how much faster Wall Street rebounded from the recession than the rest of New York City's economy did, the federal Department of Labor reported Tuesday that wages rose by nearly 12 percent in Manhattan at the beginning of the year, even as they fell in every other borough. (See report here.)
According to a report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average weekly wage in Manhattan - New York County - was $2,404 in the first quarter, up 11.9 percent from the first three months of 2009. That was the biggest increase in any county in the country. The second largest gain, 10.6 percent, came just across the Hudson River in Hudson County, in New Jersey.
The prime beneficiaries in Manhattan worked in financial services, where the average wage was $7,709 a week, up about 23 percent from the first quarter of 2009. Most of that big increase reflects how much bigger year-end bonuses for 2009 were. The big banks pay out bonuses in the first several weeks of the new year, inflating the numbers for the first quarter.
But while the bonus checks were much bigger, there were fewer of them: The number of jobs in financial services in Manhattan declined by about 13,000 from the first quarter of 2009 to the first quarter of this year. Hiring for those high-paying jobs tends to lag behind the recovery in profits.
On Wall Street, "hiring is the last thing you do," said Michael L. Dolfman, the regional commissioner of labor statistics.
And the rising tide of pay on Wall Street did not lift all of the city's workers. While the leisure and hospitality industry added about 4,000 jobs in Manhattan, the average wage those jobs paid declined by almost 2 percent, to $707 a week.
"You have a lot of people looking for work, and this is an industry that people go to," Mr. Dolfman said. "They didn't have to raise wages."
Manhattan retained its place as the American county with the highest average wage. But in each of the other boroughs, pay remained below the national average weekly wage of $889. Pay declined the most in the Bronx, dropping 1.5 percent to $791 a week. In Queens, it fell 1 percent to $812 a week. 
In Brooklyn, where average wages are the lowest in the city, pay declined 1 percent to $718 a week. Brooklyn - Kings County - recorded the biggest increase in employment - and the fourth highest of any large county in the country - at 1.4 percent. But most of those new jobs were in the lower-paying fields of education and health care.
Over all, wages fell by at least 1 percent in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, while they rose 0.8 percent nationally. On Staten Island, they declined by 0.3 percent.

HEADLINE: Bloomingdale's and Penney Join Holiday Ad Throngs

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: With Halloween past and Thanksgiving on the way, Bloomingdale's and J.C. Penney are sharing their plans to woo consumers for the Christmas shopping season.

 BODY:
With Halloween past and Thanksgiving on the way, Bloomingdale's and J.C. Penney are sharing their plans to woo consumers for the Christmas shopping season.
Bloomingdale's is beginning this week to send its holiday catalogs to customers, which reveal the retailer's theme for 2010: "Happy merry peace love hope." And Penney has started running a campaign in the New York area that promotes its store in Manhattan, which opened in July 2009.
The upbeat theme for Bloomingdale's, part of Macy's Inc., reflects how executives at the chain "feel there's optimism out there," said Frank Berman, senior vice president for marketing.
"Certainly it's not the same as it was in 2007," before the financial crisis, he added, "but we're in a better place" than the last couple of holiday seasons.
The Christmas shopping campaign, created internally, is "opulent," Mr. Berman said, but also promotes merchandise "at all different price points," from high to low.
"In this economy of recovery," he added, "we've got a breadth of assortment" and can "present the customer with lots of different gift options." For instance, on a section of the Bloomingdale's Web site (bloomingdales.com/holidaygifts), there are categories for gifts "under $50," "under $100" and "under $250."
The 2010 campaign echoes recent ones with its focus on music and philanthropy. The singer John Legend will be present for the unveiling of the holiday windows at the flagship store on Nov. 18; Tony Bennett did the honors in 2008 and Harry Connick Jr. last year.
The charitable elements this year include fund-raising for an organization called the Child Mind Institute, which is devoted to the mental health of children. For example, there will be an online auction of "ultimate experiences" from Nov. 29 to Dec. 10, and 100 percent of the proceeds will be donated to the institute. And $8 of the $29.95 price of a Gund teddy bear and holiday book, "A Magical Night Before Christmas," will be donated to the institute.
There will be other merchandise on offer with some of the sales donated to organizations like AmeriCares and Autism Speaks.
The Penney campaign for the Manhattan store is being created internally and by Saatchi & Saatchi in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe. The ads include references to familiar New York landmarks and experiences to connect with the target audience, which includes residents of Manhattan as well as commuters who live in other boroughs, Long Island, Connecticut and New Jersey.
One poster declares, "Oh! What fun it is to ride the F train," and another proclaims, "Jingle all the way to 33rd and 6th," the address of the store.
There are also discount offers - $10 off with a purchase of $50 - that will be printed on the backs of MetroCards.
The New York campaign uses a theme - "New list. New gifts. Who knew!" - that will appear in the national Penney holiday campaign. Details about the national campaign are to be disclosed on Wednesday.
Penney also tailored ads for Christmas 2009 to promote the Manhattan store. Like last year, the 2010 campaign will include transit ads, print ads and ads on phone kiosks, taxi cabs and bus shelters, said Michael J. Boylson, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at the J.C. Penney Company in Plano, Tex.
This year, he added, "there will be more wild postings," referring to ads pasted on construction sites, which are popular in Manhattan. The campaign for the Manhattan store will stimulate sales there, Mr. Boylson said, and also provide "a halo effect" in the metropolitan New York market. "And it helps us nationally," he added. "We see Manhattan as kind of our flagship."

HEADLINE: The Diplomacy of Cross-Border Bankruptcy

BYLINE: STEPHEN J. LUBBEN


HIGHLIGHT: If the various corporate pieces of a debtor are spread across several countries, the problems of dueling bankruptcy cases are not easily addressed. 

 BODY:
Provisions within the Dodd-Frank overhaul of financial regulations call for studying the possible creation of an international resolution authority to deal with institutions on the brink of collapse. Just how hard creating such a mechanism would be can be seen by the limited progress in this regard on the corporate bankruptcy side.
Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code, which was enacted in 2005, allows courts in the United States to recognize foreign bankruptcy proceedings, so that, for example, a Swiss bankruptcy trustee can ensure that creditors do not run away with a debtor's American assets.
But Chapter 15 does nothing to address the crucial problem an international enterprise faces upon bankruptcy. Before a bankruptcy, the enterprise might operate seamlessly across borders, but after the filing, each corporation that makes up the enterprise becomes a separate case. When all the constituent corporations are from the United States, for example, these cases are easily consolidated in a single forum with a motion for "joint administration." Thus, all of MGM's 160 bankruptcy cases are pending before a single court in New York.
But if the various corporate pieces of a debtor are spread across several countries, the problems of dueling bankruptcy cases are not easily addressed. Even after the passage of Chapter 15, and the enactment of similar laws in other developed economies, international corporate bankruptcy largely remains a country-by-country affair.
The one arguable exception has beenCanada and the United States, where cases under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act in Canada and Chapter 11 in the United States are routinely coordinated. The result is typically something close to a unified reorganization process.
Which is what made the Chapter 11 filing by TerreStar Networks last month so puzzling. Not only did all parts of the company file Chapter 11 cases in the United States -- including several Canadian subsidiaries -- but all of the entities sought, and received, preliminary recognition of their bankruptcy cases in Canada. This was a rather bold move. Imagine how an American bankruptcy court might react to a petition seeking recognition of a Canadian case involving a Delaware corporation, with operations primarily in the United States.
All of these complications, plus the extra political elements involved with the failure of large financial institutions, await those who will study the possibility of creating an international resolution authority. One hopes the banking and bankruptcy communities can work together on this one, but a good deal of diplomacy will be required.

HEADLINE: IMG in Brazilian Sports Joint Venture

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The alliance in the sports-crazed country will team up Ted Forstmann, a longtime Wall Street deal maker, and Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista. 

 BODY:
IMG Worldwide, the sports and entertainment giant, has formed a joint venture with the Brazilian conglomerate EBX Group to develop sports businesses in Brazil, the latest in a series of moves by IMG to push into the world's fastest-growing economies.
Behind the deal, expected to be announced on Tuesday, are two charismatic billionaires: Ted Forstmann, the owner of IMG, and Eike Batista, pictured, founder of EBX. The two men are looking for opportunities in a country with a vibrant economy. Sports-crazed Brazil is also hosting the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016. 
"Our economy is booming, and we are hosting all these great events," Mr. Batista said. "This makes all the sense in the world."
For now, details of the joint venture are scant. But it follows a similar deal Mr. Forstmann struck this year with the Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries and its owner, the billionaire Mukesh Ambani. IMG and Reliance are looking to build professional soccer and basketball leagues in India.
In 2008, IMG expanded into China by reaching an agreement with the country's national television broadcaster to develop and market sports events. IMG struck a deal last year to produce an NFL highlights show in China.
Mr. Forstmann, 70, has long been one of Wall Street's biggest personalities. His $750 million acquisition of IMG in 2004, one of his last purchases, has transformed the firm from a talent agency that manages athletes' careers into one that produces and manages thousands of entertainment events, from the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in New York to the Escape From Alcatraz Triathlon.
IMG has become prickly about being labeled a mere talent agency, albeit one that represents Peyton Manning and Roger Federer. In September it issued a release: "IMG Worldwide is a global sports and media company - it is incorrect to describe IMG as an 'agency.'"
The deal links Mr. Forstmann with Mr. Batista, an oil, mining and shipbuilding magnate with a net worth of $27 billion, according to Forbes magazine. Mr. Batista, 54, boasts that all of his businesses have the letter X at the end of their names - his mining company is called MMX; his oil business, OGX - to "symbolize the multiplication of wealth."
One thing has been decided upon: The joint venture will be called IMGX.
IMG's expansion comes at a time when foreign companies are pouring record amounts of capital into Brazil. Last month, for example, the Chinese oil company Sinopec paid $7.1 billion for a stake in the Brazilian unit of Repsol, the Spanish oil giant.
Wealthy Brazilian investors are also buying up assets abroad. In September, an investment firm backed by three Brazilian businessmen acquired Burger King Holdings, the fast food chain, for $3.3 billion. Mr. Batista said he had invested $100 billion in that deal.
Mr. Forstmann first took note of Mr. Batista when he appeared on "The Charlie Rose Show" in February. Mr. Batista, who made his money in commodities, predicted in the interview that in five years Brazil would be the world's fifth-largest economy and in 10 years he would be worth $100 billion.
"After watching Charlie Rose, I said if we ever do a deal in Brazil, this is the guy I want to go into business with," Mr. Forstmann said.
Mr. Forstmann then invited Mr. Batista to his annual conference in Aspen, Colo. There, Mr. Batista appeared on a panel hosted by Mr. Rose about the so-called BRIC countries - Brazil, Russia, India and China.
Mr. Forstmann and Mr. Batista then started discussing working together. Two weeks ago, Mr. Forstmann visited Brazil and explored the country with his new business partner, a trip that included a tour of Rio de Janeiro on Mr. Batista's helicopter.
"When you spend time with Eike down there you get a huge feeling of the country's potential," Mr. Forstmann said.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. 
An earlier version of this article misstated how much Mr. Batista said he would be worth in 10 years.

HEADLINE: The Myth Of Gold's Record High

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Washington
''Gold sets record high amid economic fears,'' The Associated Press recently wrote. ''Gold surges to record high,'' CNN said. Gold closed Monday ''at a record $1,402.80 per troy ounce,'' the front page of The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.
It's a good story. Unfortunately, it's not true, at least not in any meaningful sense. 
Gold is at a record only if you fail to adjust for inflation. And you should almost always adjust for inflation. Otherwise, you end up with meaningless records -- Gold reaches record high! Oil reaches record high! Lettuce reaches record high! -- that depend on the fact that a dollar in 2010 does not have the same value as a dollar did in, say, 1980.
More than a month ago, Ryan Chittum of The Columbia Journalism Review noticed the epidemic of supposed gold records and urged those of us in the news media to stop. The actual record was set 30 years ago, when the price of gold, in today's dollars, hit $2,387, or 71 percent higher than it closed on Tuesday.
This isn't simply a question of math. Anyone who says gold is at a record high (or who said oil was several years ago) is getting the story wrong. Why? Because $10 today is not more valuable than $9 a few decades ago. Claiming otherwise is tantamount to saying that 10 rupees is more valuable than $9 because 10 is a bigger number than 9.
The notion that gold is more expensive than ever happens to fit with a larger narrative that also does not square with the facts -- namely, that inflation is an imminent threat. This can be a bit confusing, I realize, because inflation plays two roles in the story: past inflation distorts our view of record highs, while future inflation is the concern of some of those people making a big deal out of gold.
But the story itself is fairly straightforward. In the last week, foreign governments and some economists in this country have criticized the Federal Reserve for announcing that it would try to reduce long-term interest rates. China, Germany, Russia and a couple of other countries say the move is an attempt to bring down the value of the dollar. Inflation worriers in the United States say that the Fed can't keep rates low forever and eventually must wind down its emergency responses to the financial crisis.
On narrow grounds, both groups of critics have a point. The Fed's move will indeed bring down the dollar. And the Fed cannot continue its aggressive policies forever. But forever is a long way off. Right now, the unemployment rate remains near a 30-year high, and inflation is just 1.1 percent, compared with 2.7 percent when the year began. Meanwhile, the United States is running a large trade deficit with China, Germany and Russia, among other countries.
In this situation, the Fed should absolutely be trying to lift economic growth and employment by reducing the cost of borrowing money. Its mistake, in fact, was waiting so long to do so, even after the recovery began losing momentum in the spring. That the Fed's move is also likely to bring down the dollar -- lowering the cost of American exports, raising the cost of imports into this country and thus reducing some of the world's trade imbalances -- is an added benefit.
Remember, the Fed has a dual mandate: maximum employment and stable prices. The country is about nine million jobs shy of full employment today, at the same time that prices are clearly stable. Not only has inflation itself fallen, but people's expectations of future inflation, an important indicator to the Fed, have fallen over the last year, according to surveys by the University of Michigan.
And what evidence is there that consumers are wrong and inflation is about to become a problem?
Well, borrowing rates for the federal government remain exceedingly low, so bond investors don't seem concerned. That leaves gold.
Its price has certainly been rising. It began doing so a decade ago, around the same time that oil prices began rising. Both fell sharply in the 1980s and 1990s, but they began to increase around 2000, partly because rapid economic growth in Asia was lifting demand for all sorts of commodities.
When the financial crisis occurred in 2008, oil and gold both fell, although gold's fall was milder and it soon began rising again. Over the last two years, it has nearly doubled in price. To a lot of people -- from Glenn Beckto George Soros, and many in between -- gold is a refuge in uncertain economic times. No matter what, it will always retain at least some of its value.
But gold is hardly a perfect predictor of inflation. Consider the second half of 1982, when gold jumped even as inflation was falling. Inflation would continue to fall for most of the next 20 years. From 2000 to 2008, gold nearly tripled in price, while inflation was largely quiet.
The recent rise, as Nariman Behravesh of IHS Global Insight notes, has relatively little to do with inflation fears. ''It's not about inflation,'' he said. ''It's a hedge against a weak dollar, not a hedge against inflation.''
Investors who hold a large amount of dollars -- including central banks like China's -- understand that the dollar probably needs to fall in coming years, as today's trade imbalances slowly shrink. So many of those investors are turning to gold.
If investors really were worried about inflation, gold would probably be a lot more expensive than it is. Who knows? It might even hit a record high.

HEADLINE: Attention Shoppers: No More Aisle 3, 4, 5 ...

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
SANTA ANA, Calif. -- A temporary wall slices the Anchor Blue store here in half. On one side are abandoned dressing rooms, a few mannequins and no customers. On the other are racks jammed with clothing and accessories -- and more customers than ever coming into the store.
Tom Shaw, the head of Anchor Blue, a clothing chain for teenagers, looked with approval at the 2,500 square feet of empty space that his company still rents. Foot traffic is up more than 7 percent, the chain says, and sales have increased nearly 23 percent since the trial remodeling last year.
''We don't want a department-store feel,'' Mr. Shaw said. ''With that much product in that much space you can get lost, not know where to go.'' 
Anchor Blue is among a growing number of retailers thinking small -- chopping off big chunks of stores or moving to more efficient spaces. The change reflects two trends in the retail world: Chains looking for new ways to cut costs in the sour economy, and consumers demanding a less sprawling shopping experience as they spend with greater purpose.
''The customer walks in the door, and often sees a huge selection of stuff in a multibrand store, and can't figure out what to buy and ends up buying nothing,'' said Paco Underhill, founder and chief executive of Envirosell, a Manhattan-based company that advises stores on shoppers' behavior. ''We have reached the apogee of the big box, meaning that we can't grow the store or the shopping mall any bigger, or get any more time or money out of somebody's pockets.''
Big chains like Bloomingdale's and Nike are trying smaller stores, as are specialty retailers like Charlotte Russe. Mr. Underhill said most of his clients are exploring the idea, which can require creative thinking.
The new Bloomingdale's in Santa Monica, Calif., for example, saves space with dressing rooms that retract into the ceiling. Charlotte Russe uses free-standing glass walls that can be rearranged. At Nike, the cash registers are wired into movable counters.
The smaller stores help clean retailers' balance sheets. Rents drop, and smaller amounts of inventory cost less. Retailers can also reduce payroll costs because fewer employees are needed. At the Anchor Blue store here in Santa Ana, three employees now work on the floor instead of four.
Retail chains ''saw their lives flash before their eyes in the financial crisis downturn,'' said John D. Morris, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, a financial services provider. ''When you're looking at such a severe slowdown as they were in consumption, you worry about the commitment in real estate.''
Mr. Shaw said he reduced the amount of clothing in the Santa Ana store by about 15 percent, removing many slower-moving items like unpopular sizes -- and increasing profitability. As leases expire on its 118 stores, Anchor Blue is moving into spaces about half their size .
''You're placing a sizable bet when you're buying a lot of inventory and filling up a 6,000-square-foot box,'' he said.
The financial success of many smaller stores is simple, retail analysts and the stores say: Smaller spaces are cheaper, and can be easily changed to carry the most profitable, fastest-selling inventory. The stepped-up foot traffic at the Anchor Blue store in Santa Ana, and the sales increase, for example, are both above the chain's averages.
''It certainly enhances the productivity,'' Mr. Morris said of the smaller spaces.
Bloomingdale's store in Santa Monica, which opened this summer, is about 105,000 square feet on two floors, less than one-eighth the size of the chain's Manhattan flagship store. The developer packaged in the third floor, but Bloomingdale's declined the extra room, said Michael Gould, chairman and chief executive of Bloomingdale's.
Mr. Gould said he wanted a smaller store to move through inventory faster. The Santa Monica store dropped two slower-moving categories, home and children's, that are often found in other Bloomingdale's stores. It has also saved space with innovations like a mobile rack, that resembles those dry cleaners use, on the second floor ceiling that moves mannequins and clothes.
''You have a store that's turning very quickly,'' he said.
In addition, Mr. Gould said, many shoppers have responded to a more focused retail experience -- stores that have been stripped of the distractions and temptations of unwanted merchandise -- as the success of Bloomingdale's smaller Manhattan store in SoHo, opened in 2004, has demonstrated.
''We can be very specific to a customer and to a marketplace, and that's what we need to do,'' he said.
Nike is also looking at flexible layouts as it experiments with smaller stores. The typical Niketown store is more than 50,000 square feet, while its prototype ''brand experience'' store, opened in Santa Monica in August, is just 22,000 square feet. Nike has no plans to open more Niketowns, opting instead for smaller options like the ''brand experience'' store.
The driving force was to make shopping simple, said Tim Hershey, Nike's vice president and general manager of North American retail. ''Customers are always asking us to make it easy,'' he said.
Almost all the elements of the new Nike store can be rearranged at a moment's notice. Each wall contains horizontal slats about six inches apart, and almost every piece of hardware -- the circle of metal that holds a soccer ball, the wire cages that contain socks -- can be hooked into the wall slats. Freestanding tables and locker-compartmentlike display cases are on wheels. A big orange station where the cash registers are housed looks like the only permanent fixture in the store -- but it is not.
''It's wired to be relocated in multiple places,'' Mr. Hershey said. ''We like where it's at but we haven't been through a holiday. Live and learn.''
Charlotte Russe, which has more than 500 outlets nationally, is also experimenting with a new concept store in Santa Monica that is about 25 percent smaller than the norm.
Jenny Ming, the chief executive, ordered freestanding glass walls to distinguish between types of clothes. ''It just makes it more shoppable,'' she said. ''So many stores now, it's just big, you throw everything in there,'' Ms. Ming said.
For maximum versatility and efficiency, each fixture has been designed for multiple purposes. A metal rod that lies perpendicular to the wall can hold shoes on plastic hooks, underwear looped through a leg hole or hangers.
Ms. Ming tried stacking shoe boxes on the selling floor so customers could select their sizes without waiting for a clerk. But that backfired, she said, as boxes were scattered, requiring extra staff (and money) for cleanup.
The boxes are back in the storage area, the experience pointing to an axiom of the new smaller-is-better movement. ''It's building in as much flexibility as possible,'' Ms. Ming said.

HEADLINE: A 24-Karat Safety Net For Investors

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
Think of it as the Tea Party of investments.
The price of gold has been rising as anxious investors cast what amounts to a throw-the-bums-out vote against, well, just about everything.
The weak dollar, the volatile stock market, the lackluster economy, the yawning budget deficit, the accommodative Federal Reserve -- all this and more have people rushing for gold.
The metal touched a high of $1,424 an ounce on Tuesday, although the price remains well below the peak of the early 1980s once inflation is taken into account. 
''It's in effect a protest vote that there's something amiss with current policies,'' said Abhay Deshpande, a portfolio manager with First Eagle Funds and a longtime gold investor.
''People are almost acting as their own central banks because the advantage of gold is that it acts as a hiding place in times of currency turmoil,'' Mr. Deshpande said. A steady drumbeat of higher price targets from Wall Street firms -- as well as recent pronouncements from political leaders -- has buttressed what was already strong investor demand.
Just as the Tea Party has moved from the political fringes to prominence in Washington, so gold has become a touchstone for policy makers and investors alike. On Monday, the president of the World Bank, Robert B. Zoellick, surprised experts when he suggested the price of gold should be considered a financial yardstick, reversing 40 years of relying on paper currencies to store value in the international monetary system.
Deemed intrinsically valuable for thousands of years, gold has traditionally been a hedge against rising inflation and political or economic uncertainty.
But this time around, investors worry that the Fed's move last week to pump $600 billion into the nation's banking system, as well as a surge in borrowing around the world, will undermine paper currencies, making gold a refuge once again.
Over the last two months, the dollar has declined 6 percent against its principal peers, but gold has jumped 17 percent.
At an investor conference in Berlin, whether the worry was inflation, deflation, sovereign debt risk or currency instability, ''market participants looked to gold as a potential answer,'' said Suki Cooper, precious metals analyst for Barclays Capital.
But it is Washington that has prompted the latest surge.
''As the Fed prints money, markets are anticipating that more dollars will be chasing the same supply of commodities, driving prices higher,'' said Daniel Arbess, manager of the Xerion fund at Perella Weinberg Partners in New York.
And while gold is the most obvious example of this trend, other commodities are rising, too. Wheat, copper and cotton all soared on Tuesday.
Nor is gold fever restricted to hedge fund managers wielding billions of dollars. Individual investors have also been clamoring to get in on the trade, scooping up gold coins like one-ounce American Eagles and South African Krugerrands.
''People are coming in to buy 50 or 100 coins at a time, which is pretty hefty for individuals,'' said Mark Oliari, chief executive of CNT Inc., a Massachusetts coin broker. ''It's not just rich people, either. A lot of people are putting 30 to 35 percent of their net worth in gold; they are scared to put money in paper assets.''
Signs of gold's renewed appeal have been building for months, as well-known Wall Street figures like George Soros and John Paulson piled into the metal. JPMorgan Chase even reopened a long-closed vault below the streets of downtown Manhattan to meet investor demand to store the stuff.
And the comments by Mr. Zoellick on Monday only confirm gold's new status.
''The system should also consider employing gold as an international reference point of market expectations about inflation, deflation and future currency values,'' Mr. Zoellick said in an article in The Financial Times . ''Although textbooks may view gold as the old money, markets are using gold as an alternative monetary asset today.''
But in a sign of how volatile gold remains, it closed sharply lower at $1,392.90 on Tuesday, down from the intraday high of $1,424, after comments by the governor of the Bank of Canada, Mark J. Carney, that gold ''has no role to play in the international monetary system,'' according to Reuters.
As gold has become more respectable, it has also become easier to invest in. Some people may still regard bars of gold in a vault as the ultimate insurance policy, but exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.'s, that hold gold have also exploded in popularity.
Besides driving down the dollar's value by sharply increasing the amount of dollars in the system, the Fed's action also helps gold by lowering interest rates. That is because a traditional knock on gold is that it doesn't yield interest payments or dividends, but with short-term rates closing in on zero, there is much less to lose by holding gold.
In addition to the opposition from investors, the Fed's decision to pump $600 billion into the banking system, a policy known as quantitative easing, has met with sharp criticism from several of America's crucial trading partners, including Germany, China and Brazil.
They say flooding the world with unwanted capital at a time when their own economies are already growing at a brisk clip increases the odds of inflation down the road while encouraging one country after another to devalue its currency.
As the dollar has fallen, countries like Thailand, Japan, Brazil and others have taken steps to weaken their own currencies, in what some see as the beginning of a race to the bottom.
''This bears some resemblance to the 1930s and the beggar-thy-neighbor strategy of currency depreciation between the pound, franc, D-mark and dollar,'' said James Steel, chief commodities analyst at HSBC. ''In that period, gold also did very well.''
Since the depths of the financial crisis two years ago, gold has risen 91 percent, and it is nearly a third higher than just one year ago, according to Janney Montgomery Scott.
While gold has touched new records in nominal terms, when adjusted for inflation the price remains 40 percent below its real record high, which was reached in 1980. What is surprising economists is not the rise of gold prices, but the speed of its ascent.
As a result, even longtime gold investors, like Mr. Deshpande, worry that the current rally might be overdone. ''It's beginning to smell a little like the beginning stages of a bubble,'' he said. ''Either inflation has to pick up or currencies have to plunge to justify a continuing rise.''

HEADLINE: States Out of Balance

 BODY:
The Republican Party's most visible triumph last week was in the House of Representatives, but the more lasting -- and possibly more destructive -- result was in statehouses across the country. Republicans won more than 690 new legislative seats, taking back at least 19 state chambers and 10 governor's seats from Democrats. Republicans previously had been in full control of nine states; now they will fully control at least 20.
There is no way that these newly elected Republican lawmakers and governors can follow through on their promises to erase huge deficits without raising taxes -- except by making irresponsibly draconian cuts in critical state services, particularly for the poor and for education. 
The states, like the federal government, need to get control of spending. That may mean dealing with out-of-control pensions. It may mean careful cuts in services combined with, yes, higher taxes. But with millions of people out of work, this is the worst possible time for the states to try to solve all their problems by simply slashing health care spending, spending on higher and elementary education, and services for the elderly and the poor. It would lead to tens of thousands of layoffs and even lower state revenues.
State budget cuts over the last two years have already been deep and painful, the biggest declines in three decades. High-spending states like New York, New Jersey and California can still find waste and fraud in programs like Medicaid. They are among the states that must make an aggressive effort to bring spiraling pension costs down to earth.
Many other states have little left to cut in government services. Nonetheless, as Monica Davey and Michael Luo reported in The Times this week, many newly elected Republican governors say they will balance their budgets that way. In Texas, Gov. Rick Perry and several state lawmakers have even floated the idea of dropping out of the Medicaid program and creating a low-cost insurance program for the poor.
That is an irresponsible, and counterproductive, way to try to close the state's $25 billion deficit. It would mean giving up the federal government's 60 percent share of the Texas program's $40 billion annual cost. And for nearly four million participants, it would reduce the level of health care far below a minimum standard.
No matter what the politicians have promised, there is no sound way to balance budgets, protect the most vulnerable people, and the states' own economies, without some tax increases.
The Republicans' big wins in Washington will make the states' plight even worse. As part of their campaigns, Republican members of Congress have vowed to cut discretionary spending, much of which goes to state capitols. Meanwhile, federal stimulus money -- decried by the Republicans -- is drying up.
The changes in state government will have another long-term effect as states begin the redistricting process to comply with the population changes documented in the 2010 census. This means that Republicans will be in a position to consolidate this year's gains by redrawing Congressional and state legislative district lines to their advantage.
These highly partisan exercises in self-aggrandizement go on every 10 years, but the unusually large number of states with both Republican legislatures and governorships will sharply reduce the ability of Democrats to bring a little balance to the process.
States have long been in the paradoxical position of being closer to the lives of voters than the federal government, while receiving far less scrutiny and attention. But if Republicans begin abusing the privilege they have been handed, imposing unconscionable cuts and claiming an unfair partisan advantage, they may find the public's outrage turning back on them in a hurry.

HEADLINE: A Female Wall St. Financial Chief Avoids Pitfalls That Stymied Others

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
Ruth M. Porat has a knack for escaping unscathed from tough situations.
She joined Morgan Stanley in 1987 just before the stock market crash yet managed to hang onto her job. During the Internet boom she was a technology banker. When that sector blew up she reinvented herself, eventually becoming a financial services banker. The banking industry almost collapsed in 2008, but Ms. Porat's star has continued to rise.
Today, as chief financial officer of Morgan Stanley and being among the highest-ranking women on Wall Street, her survivor skills will come in handy. She is trying to excel not only during difficult times for Morgan Stanley, but also in the face of a horrible track record of women who have made it this far, only to stumble.
''The chief financial role at a global investment bank is an incredibly challenging job; you have to know everything about everything,'' said Glenn Schorr, an analyst with Nomura. 
In Ms. Porat's case, she is often reminded about recent Wall Street history. ''Be careful in everything you do, because we all know how this ended before,'' another stock analyst told her at a cocktail party earlier this year on the 41st floor of Morgan's Stanley's headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, according to attendees.
The comment was a not so subtle reference to the last two female chief financial officers on Wall Street: Erin Callan at Lehman Brothers and Sallie L. Krawcheck at Citigroup. Ms. Callan resigned from Lehman just months before it filed for bankruptcy and is now under investigation by regulators. Ms. Krawcheck struggled as chief financial officer at Citigroup and was publicly demoted in early 2007. (She has since rebounded at Bank of America.)
Morgan Stanley offers another reminder: Its former co-president, Zoe Cruz, was one of the earliest casualties of the credit crisis.
Any chief financial officer -- male or female -- would be facing challenges at Morgan Stanley at the moment. The firm, under its chief executive, James P. Gorman, is trying to transform itself into more of a steady producer than an investment bank susceptible to swings in the market. The transition has been rough sledding: Morgan Stanley had a net loss of $91 million in the third quarter.
The stock has fallen 11 percent so far this year, compared with a flat performance for its chief rival, Goldman Sachs. Some shareholders have been grumbling that Morgan Stanley's turnaround is taking too long. And there has been a noticeable turnover in the share base this year.
For instance, the mutual fund giant Fidelity has recently reduced its stake in a number of firms, according to regulatory filings, but in percentage terms its selling in Morgan is larger than other reductions.
A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman says that other big investors, including Fairholme Capital Management, have been buying the firm's shares.
Until her promotion to chief financial officer, Ms. Porat, 52, was best known as the banker who had been tapped to advise the Treasury Department on the takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. She has kept an intentionally low profile since January and declined to be interviewed for this article.
Ms. Porat is not an accountant and had never worked in the finance department. She has an economics degree from Stanford and a master's degree in business administration from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. She joined Morgan Stanley in 1987.
Six years later, however, she quit to follow the well-known Morgan Stanley banker Robert F. Greenhill to Smith Barney. In a 2009 book titled ''How Remarkable Women Lead,'' she said she regretted the move immediately.
''Oh my God, I've completely messed up my career,'' she said to herself upon landing there, according to the book. ''I want to go back and I won't have that option.''
She did go back, in 1996, but was forced to take a demotion as part of the deal. In 2000, she went to London to lead Morgan Stanley's technology banking team there. Ms. Porat helped take some of the era's biggest names public, including Amazon and Priceline.
During the tech bubble Ms. Porat aligned herself with Mary Meeker, the influential technology analyst. Morgan Stanley, largely through Ms. Porat and Ms. Meeker, vetted more than 750 Internet-related public offerings from 1995 to 2001. In that period, Morgan served as the primary manager on 50 of 597 Internet companies that eventually did go public.
''She is the best banker I have worked with since Quattrone, and while Frank has the tech relationship edge, Ruth has the creative edge,'' wrote Ms. Meeker in her 1999 performance review, released in 2003 as part of a regulatory inquiry.
Mr. Quattrone is perhaps the dot-com era's best-known deal maker, whose career stalled temporarily while he successfully fought civil and criminal charges. He has since started Qatalyst Partners, which has been a busy adviser in a number of tech deals this year.
She soon faced another challenge: In 2001 she was given a diagnosis of breast cancer. She moved back to America for treatment.
Colleagues say Ms. Porat is a tireless worker. In 1992, during the birth of her first son, she was on the phone in the delivery room making client calls. And in her spare time she, along with her husband, a lawyer, renovate and sell New York City apartments.
Ms. Meeker, the godmother to each of Ms. Porat's three sons, remembers one meeting with management at the media company Ziff Davis where Ms. Porat threw her back out. ''Instead of leaving she laid on the boardroom table and continued on with the presentation,'' Ms. Meeker said.
She has been known to go out on a limb for clients; in 2004 she wrote a letter to the court in support of a client and friend, Martha Stewart. That year Ms. Stewart was sentenced to five months in prison after she was convicted of lying to authorities about her 2001 sale of about 4,000 shares of ImClone Systems.
But at times Ms. Porat got caught up the euphoria of the Internet bubble, some co-workers say. In 1999, at a dinner with senior Morgan executives, she and Ms. Meeker tried to convince top brass to buy the brokerage house Charles Schwab; its stock had soared during the Internet boom.
Ms. Meeker says there were a number of strategic ideas discussed at the meeting, including a possible acquisition of Schwab by Morgan, but no one ''was pounding the table'' for such a deal to take place. ''However of the available options, it was the most interesting,'' she added.
After the tech wreck, Ms. Porat began banking more blue-chip companies, and assisted in the initial public offering of a General Electric subsidiary, Genworth Financial Inc. The next year she learned her cancer was back, and underwent treatment again. In 2006 she was tapped to run the financial institutions group, and help take public a number of companies, including the private equity firm Blackstone Group.
Tony James, president of Blackstone, said Ms. Porat was available at all hours to handle issues. ''She never makes you feel like you are disturbing her personal life; I don't even know if she has one.''
He said that unlike many bankers, she was able to quickly tap resources from all corners of Morgan. For instance, she arranged for Mr. Gorman, then head of strategy for Morgan, to speak to Blackstone executives about what it was like to be a public company. ''I would never have even known to have asked for that,'' he said.
In 2008, she and a fellow Morgan banker, Robert Scully, landed one of the most prestigious assignments of the credit crisis, advising the Treasury Department on the takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Lee Sachs, a former senior Treasury worker, dealt frequently with Ms. Porat, saying she had a ''recognition and understanding of the public policy and political implications, positive and negative, of various courses of action.''
Still, Mr. James of Blackstone said he was surprised when he heard that Ms. Porat had been appointed chief financial officer. ''She went from a client-facing job into a job which is totally internal facing and is quite technical,'' he said. ''And beyond that she moved from a role that involved managing one or two people to thousands of people. It was a huge change, and I like Ruth so I wanted it to work out, but I wondered if it would, but so far it seems to be.''

HEADLINE: Stage Set for Showdown on Online Privacy

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT and TANZINA VEGA

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- After ''do not call'' lists became popular, more than 90 percent of people who signed up reported fewer annoying telemarketing calls. Now, privacy advocates are pushing for a similar ''do not track'' feature that would let Internet users tell Web sites to stop surreptitiously tracking their online habits and collecting clues about age, salary, health, location and leisure activities.
That proposal and other ideas to protect online privacy are setting up a confrontation among Internet companies, federal regulators, the Obama administration and Congress over how strict any new rules should be.
In the next few weeks, both the Federal Trade Commission and the Commerce Department are planning to release independent, and possibly conflicting, reports about online privacy. 
Top Commerce officials have indicated that the department favors letting the industry regulate itself, building on the common practice of user agreements where companies post their privacy policies online or consumers check a box agreeing to abide by them.
Top trade commission officials, however, have indicated they are exploring a stricter standard, one that requires a ''do not track'' option on a Web site or browser similar to the ''do not call'' lists.
The two agencies have even tangled over which will release its report first, a decision that could set the tone for the clash to follow. People close to the talks say that, at least for now, the Commerce Department has been given the nod, provided it can complete its report soon.
Consumer advocates worry that the competing agendas of economic policy makers in the Obama administration, who want uniform international standards, and federal regulators, who are trying to balance consumer protection and commercial rights, will neglect the interests of people most affected by the privacy policies. ''I hope they realize that what is good for consumers is ultimately good for business,'' said Susan Grant, director of consumer protection at the Consumer Federation of America.
In addition, the major online companies have the reports in their sights, worried over a raft of potential new regulations. They would prefer that the industry continue to police itself.
''Targeted ads are helpful and ad competition is helpful,'' said Eric E. Schmidt, the chief executive of Google, which owns the online advertising exchange DoubleClick. In a conversation last week at The New York Times, Mr. Schmidt said that the explosion in online consumer monitoring was increasing friction about how strict the privacy limits should be. And, he added, ''it's going to get a lot worse.''
The White House, meanwhile, has broader goals. It set up its own interagency panel that will look at how to protect consumers while also making United States companies more competitive internationally. It also wants to ensure that any restrictions do not impede law enforcement and national security efforts.
Congress also is expected to intervene, and this may be one area where there is bipartisan cooperation. The House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees the trade commission and privacy issues, will soon have a Republican at its head, but members of both parties in the House and Senate have recently called on companies to account for intrusions or breaches of consumer privacy.
Which agency or group leads the debate could go a long way toward determining the result.
''There is going to be a lot of confusion over the competing proposals and which version Congress and the American people should pay attention to,'' said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a consumer advocacy group. ''We especially fear a policy that is designed to advance the competitive positions of U.S. companies and will undermine new pro-consumer protections at the F.T.C.''
Officially, Commerce Department and trade commission officials say they see the two reports as complementary. The commission will most likely address ''privacy by design,'' or how privacy features may be built into browsers or Web sites. It will also encourage greater transparency about when data is being collected and how it will be used, and the need for clearly worded privacy or user notices.
The Commerce Department will focus on global and domestic privacy laws, and will have a broad perspective on privacy issues, officials say. In an address last month at a meeting of privacy commissioners in Jerusalem, Lawrence E. Strickling, an assistant Commerce secretary, said he believed in ''a strong role for voluntary but enforceable codes of conduct.''
Jon Leibowitz, the trade commission's chairman, told Congress in July that the commission was exploring a stronger standard -- whether to propose a ''do not track'' feature. Julie Brill, an F.T.C. commissioner, said she would personally favor such a mechanism.
According to Lee Tien, a senior attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a ''do not track'' system most likely would be built into a Web browser or function as a plug-in. It would send a signal telling a Web site and the content providers and advertisers that the user did not want to be tracked.
That would differ from current browser settings, which can prevent the placement of cookies on a computer. ''It's a policy complication, not a technological complication,'' Mr. Tien said.
Marketers hate the idea. ''You simply can't just turn off tracking,'' said Mike Zaneis, a vice president at the Interactive Advertising Bureau. ''That's the way interconnected systems talk to each other.'' Such a mechanism, he added, would be ''troubling and difficult to implement at a technology level.''
Consumer advocates worry that the Commerce Department will look more after businesses than after consumers, perhaps undermining the ability of the trade commission to enforce the rules, whatever they turn out to be. The Commerce Department announced its intention to conduct its own privacy study in April, roughly six months after the trade commission began its project, leaving consumer advocates thinking that the two bureaucracies didn't see eye to eye.
''The Commerce Department has never been a consumer advocacy agency,'' said Edmund Mierzwinski, consumer program director for the United States Public Interest Research Group. ''They generally take the view of protecting special interests.''
Commerce Department officials say they have planned to address privacy rights since the 2008 presidential campaign. ''In the 1990s, the Commerce Department had an extremely prominent role in developing what we think of as Internet policy, and we are reinvigorating that historical role,'' said Marc Berejka, a senior policy adviser there.
David C. Vladeck, the director of the bureau of consumer protection at the F.T.C., said the agency would keep its focus on enforcing the law. ''Because we have the franchise on policy enforcement, we will undoubtedly retain a leading voice on privacy policy,'' Mr. Vladeck said.
While both agencies say they will propose strengthening privacy protections, the Obama administration is also worried about the prospect of tougher international privacy standards.
Last week, the European Commissioncalled for stronger Internet privacy protections and for an overhaul of the European Union's privacy rules to address social networking and targeted ads. European nations can also draft their own standards.

HEADLINE: The Fed vs. the G-20

 BODY:
When President Obama arrives in Seoul, South Korea, on Thursday for the summit of the Group of 20 leading economies, he will be met by blistering criticism of the Federal Reserve's plan for ''quantitative easing'' -- pumping $600 billion into the weak American economy over the next eight months. 
Many nations are worried that a weaker American dollar would harm their export sectors and overheat their economies as more capital flows in, in search of better returns. Their fears are understandable but shortsighted. The Fed's move is a much-needed attempt to stimulate the American economy and head off deflation here. Prolonged stagnation, or worse, in the United States would turn off one of the main sources of global demand and global growth.
By buying Treasury securities, the Fed aims to lower long-term interest rates and increase expectations of future inflation. This would spur households and businesses to spend and invest rather than hold on to money that will fall in value.
The approach is not ideal. It would be better if fiscal policy were carrying some of the load of economic stimulus. Building new rail links and roads or other large job-creating projects would do more to promote growth than lowering the price of debt, as the Fed is doing. Republican Party leaders in Congress -- for political and ideological reasons, rather than sound economics -- have vowed to block all stimulus spending.
China, eager for someone else to take the heat, is trying to equate the Fed's attempts at stimulus with its own long-term manipulation of its own currency. That may play well in some quarters, but it also makes no sense. Beijing has a policy to cheapen its currency to grow through exports, on the back of other countries' demand, while slowing its own domestic demand. The Fed's policy also weakens the dollar, but its objective is to boost demand at home.
The pain caused by the falling dollar on the export sectors of many economies is real enough. Yet rather than criticize the Fed, the G-20 should focus on working out complementary policies. Washington should back plans by developing countries like Brazil to impose capital controls and slow the inflow of money fleeing low interest rates in rich countries. Europe and Japan, where growth is anemic and inflation virtually nonexistent, could try the same approach as the Fed. They need more stimulus than the United States.
China should take this opportunity to shift course, allow its currency to rise against the dollar and rely more on consumption at home. That will be good for China and good for the global economy.

HEADLINE: Containment-Lite

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Don't believe everything you read in the paper. Take this headline that appeared a couple weeks ago, when I was in New Delhi, in The Hindustan Times: ''U.S. Not Seeking to Contain China: Clinton.'' It was referring to a statement made by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton while on a swing through Asia. No, Washington is not trying to contain China the way we once did the Soviet Union, but President Obama didn't just spend three days in India to improve his yoga.
His visit was intended to let China know that America knows that India knows that Beijing's recent ''aggressiveness,'' as one Indian minister put it to me, has China's neighbors a bit on edge. None of China's neighbors dare mention the C-word -- containment -- in public. Indeed, none of them want to go there at all or intend to promote such a policy. But there's a new whiff of anxiety in the Asian air. 
All of China's neighbors want China to know, as the sign says: ''Don't even think about parking here.'' Don't even think about using your growing economic and military clout to just impose your claims in border disputes and over oil-rich islands in the South China Sea. Because, if you do, all of China's neighbors will be doomed to become America's new best friends -- including India.
That's why each one of China's neighbors is eager to have a picture of their president standing with Secretary Clinton or President Obama -- with the unspoken caption that reads: ''Honestly, China, we don't want to throttle you. We don't want an Asian cold war. We just want to trade and be on good terms. But, please, stay between the white lines. Don't even think about parking in my space because, if you do, I have this friend from Washington, and he's really big. ... And he's got his own tow truck.''
I'd call this ''pre-containment'' or ''containment-lite'' -- triggered in the last year by a sudden upsurge in China's assertion of claims to all of the South China Sea. It marks a stark contrast to the mood in the region just two years ago. As Christian Caryl, a contributing editor at Foreign Policy magazine, noted in an Aug. 4 essay: China for years was being praised by Asian experts for being so shrewd, so clever, so deft, in building cultural and economic ties with all its neighbors -- and outmaneuvering the stupid, oafish Americans. But in just six months, China has cast itself in the role of bully and prompted its neighbors to roll out the red carpets for Uncle Sam.
''In recent months,'' noted Caryl, ''Beijing has elevated its claims to territory in the South China Sea to the level of a 'core national interest' on par with Tibet or Taiwan, and that has sparked considerable anger among the other countries in the region -- including Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam -- that claim ownership of pieces of the sea. ... Then, just in case the Americans and the Southeast Asians still didn't get the message, the Chinese Navy staged large-scale maneuvers in the sea, deploying ships from all three of its fleets. Admirals watched as the ships fired off volleys of missiles at imaginary enemies -- all of it shown in loving detail by Chinese television.''
China has also muscled Vietnam into halting its oil exploration in what Beijing claimed were Chinese territorial waters and forced Japan to release a Chinese fishing boat captain, who was arrested after a collision with two Japanese coast guard vessels near disputed islands in the East China Sea. China got its way with Japan by halting China's exports to Japan of rare earth elements crucial for advanced manufacturing.
''With the Chinese Communist Party increasingly dependent on the military to maintain its monopoly on power and ensure domestic order, senior military officers are overtly influencing foreign policy,'' wrote Brahma Chellaney, a defense analyst at Delhi's Center for Policy Research.
But the Indians, like their fellow Asians, really do not want to go beyond containment-lite with China -- for now. Sure India and China are at odds over borders and Pakistan, but China is now India's largest trading partner.
Also, never forget that Indian foreign policy has a long history of nonalignment. ''Until a year ago, the big Indian debate was how do we deal with American hegemony,'' said the Indian strategist C. Raja Mohan. Many of India's older elites still fear U.S. ''imperialism'' and ''neo-Liberalism.''
And, finally, says the Indian defense analyst Kanti Basu: ''Deep down, the Indians who pay attention in the strategic community sense that the Chinese are rising and the Americans are fading -- and it doesn't look like the Americans are going to fix their problems any time soon.'' So don't bet the silverware on America.
No, India is not going to jump into America's arms. But we're not asking it to. Democracy, geopolitics, geography and economics are all combining to move America and India closer together. And that's a good thing for both. If China plays it smart, Indian-American relations will never go beyond pre-containment. But if China doesn't play it smart, Obama to India could one day become the new Nixon to China: my enemy's enemy is my new best friend.

HEADLINE: China Challenges Role of U.S. On Eve of Economic Meeting

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER; Reporting was contributed by Sewell Chan and Martin Fackler from Seoul, South Korea; Steven Erlanger from Paris; and Michael Wines from Beijing.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Anyone wondering what President Obama will face when he arrives in South Korea on Wednesday for a global financial summit meeting need look no further than an announcement by China's leading state-endorsed rating agency, which downgraded the United States' credit rating on Tuesday -- and provocatively questioned American leadership of the global economy.
The agency cited the Federal Reserve's decision to pump more money into the United States economy and warned of Washington's ''deteriorating debt repayment capability'' and ''the serious defects in the United States economic development and management model,'' which it predicted would lead to ''fundamentally lowering the national solvency.''
In the rest of the world, the United States is still the strongest of credit risks, and the Chinese downgrade is not expected to have much real impact. Nonetheless, the sharply worded attack from the country that is buying billions of dollars in American debt each month was just the latest rhetorical assault on the United States, as officials from China to Germany to Brazil suggest that Washington's addiction to debt has greatly diminished its credibility. 
But those critics, mostly countries that fear that recent American policy will devalue the dollar and undercut their competitiveness, do not appear poised to offer an alternative to an economic order that has been led by the United States since the end of World War II, or to the role the dollar has played for decades as the de facto world gold standard.
The Chinese, who have protested that the Federal Reserve is trying to unilaterally manipulate the dollar for the purpose of creating jobs at home, have been accused of doing exactly that for years -- the root of many of the world's economic tensions today, in the eyes of Mr. Obama and his economic aides.
Germany's blunt-speaking finance minister also accused the United States of Chinese-like currency manipulation. But Germany is one of the few competitive economies in the troubled euro zone, which includes countries like Ireland, Greece and Portugal, that are fighting to stave off national bankruptcy. The euro is hardly poised to become the global alternative to the dollar that many once envisioned.
Even if there is no immediate rival to the United States as a monetary power, American officials acknowledge that Mr. Obama is going to have a far more difficult time winning any kind of consensus strategy out of the Group of 20 than he did during the first such meeting of his presidency, in London in 2009.
''The world is more divided today than it was in London because nations not facing the prospect of a depression have that luxury,'' said Lawrence H. Summers, who leaves the White House next month after two years as the head of the National Economic Council, and as Mr. Obama's top economic adviser. ''Part of a return to normalcy is that nations more strongly and disparately assert their immediate interests.''
A senior administration official said that for all the talk of alternatives to the dollar, it remained the currency of choice. ''People are still willing to loan money to the United States for 4 percent over 30 years,'' the official said. ''Investment choices are choices among alternatives and the United States remains a strong choice.''
The nations gathering in Seoul, South Korea, this week to discuss global economic issues show few signs of sublimating their own interests to some greater good. ''It's become every country for itself,'' said Jeffrey E. Garten of the Yale School of Management, who is participating in a meeting of business leaders in Seoul. ''In letting domestic considerations so completely trump international considerations, the U.S. is reinforcing views in France and China, among others, that the entire monetary system is a political toy of a dysfunctional U.S. political system.''
One hears versions of that around the world. ''It would be more desirable for the U.S. to fix its own industries, fix its structure and become more competitive,'' said Cho Gyeong-lyeob, an economist at the Korea Economic Research Institute, a research organization. ''Instead, it chose the easy way out.''
The ''easy way out'' he referred to was the Federal Reserve's decision last week to flood $600 billion into the economy. The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said the technique was the only tool remaining to push down interest rates and try to build demand, and with it the creation of jobs.
But abroad, the move looks very different. From Europe to Asia, officials have been arguing that the Fed was simply enabling America's dependence on debt-fueled growth, this time at the expense of other nations.
If the Fed's action devalues the dollar, as is widely expected, it will make the products of other countries less competitive.
The emerging economies have some legitimate worries. If rates fall even further in the United States, investment is expected to flow to markets where returns are higher. Brazil and other nations are already warning of ''asset bubbles'' -- rising prices for real estate and other investments -- that could create conditions similar to those that led to the bust in the United States three years ago. They are considering taxes on incoming capital.
''I see more risks and possibilities of global excesses in the decisions that have been made by the Fed than benefits,'' Jean-Claude Junker, the chairman of a group that represents euro-zone finance ministers, said in Paris.
That sentiment appears to be strengthening resistance to the United States as it pushes new solutions to address the financial imbalances that many economists believe threaten the stability of the global economy.
Two weeks ago Mr. Obama's Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, suggested a new way of reducing the yawning gap between countries that are running huge export surpluses and those, including the United States, that run big deficits. He suggested a numerical target: trade surpluses should not exceed 4 percent of a nation's gross domestic product. There was a near rebellion.
The Chinese rejected a firm target. So did Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, who told The Financial Times on Monday that Mr. Geithner's plan was ''too narrowly conceived'' and suggested that the core problem was a lack of competitiveness.
''It's not going to happen,'' one senior European diplomat said of Mr. Geithner's plan on Tuesday, ''and the Americans know it.'' Mr. Geithner still endorses the idea, but he seems to be scaling back.
The lack of alternatives has also led to some novel suggestions, notably from Robert B. Zoellick, the president of the World Bank, who suggested this week that the world go back to tying currencies to gold -- nearly 40 years after President Richard M. Nixon ended that linkage. His suggestion, like Mr. Geithner's, was not exactly welcomed as a solution.
Many economists said they suspected more cynical calculations at work in blaming the United States. China has almost certainly managed to deflect criticism away from its own practices; similarly, the Germans may have distracted European nations dissatisfied with how Germany, the largest European economic power, has dealt with its debt-laden, free-spending euro partners. Part of the problem is that as countries go their own way, they are each arguing that they are acting for the greater global good.
When Britain slashed its budgets recently, its new government said that was the only way to restart growth and bring back the confidence of investors. Others around Europe are doing the same, arguing that a strong Europe is in the interest of the global economy.
The Obama administration has gone in the opposite direction: deficit spending. Mr. Obama argued the other day that his No. 1 priority, for the good of the country and the world, was to restore growth quickly, and that European-style austerity programs would run the risk of putting more people out of work. And the Chinese have refused to let their currency appreciate in value, despite huge trade surpluses, saying they have to worry first about job creation and stability.

HEADLINE: In Global Forecast, China Looms Large as Energy User and Maker of Green Power

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS; Julia Werdigier and Elisabeth Rosenthal contributed reporting.

 BODY:
China's push for rapid economic development will dominate global energy markets and be the single biggest force in spurring higher oil prices and carbon emissions linked to climate change over the next quarter-century, the International Energy Agency reported on Tuesday.
At the same time, however, China is poised to be the driving influence behind the development of renewable energy like wind and solar power, according to the agency's annual energy outlook. 
The agency, which is based in Paris and advises the industrialized nations, predicted that Chinese energy demand would soar 75 percent by 2035, accounting for more than a third of the growth in global consumption. While China today accounts for 17 percent of world demand for energy, it should account for 22 percent in 25 years, at the same time that India and other developing countries also expand their energy use.
The growth in Chinese energy consumption has already been breathtaking, according to the report. Over the last decade, China's energy demand has doubled. While China used only half as much energy as the United States in 2000, it actually surpassed the United States in 2009 as the world's largest energy user.
And given that the average Chinese consumer uses roughly one-third the energy of consumers in industrialized countries of North America or Europe, energy demand is certain to grow as long as the Chinese economy does.
China's thirst for energy is leading it to build not only coal-fired power plants, but also wind farms, at a record pace, and to invest in energy sources around the world, like oil fields in Sudan, hydroelectric power in Burma and natural gas fields in south Texas. Beijing's ability to lift hundreds of millions of people into the middle class over the coming years will be largely based on its ability to produce more energy, and its foreign policies can also be expected to follow its energy interests, energy experts say.
''China's decisions on energy will affect every person in the world,'' Fatih Birol, the agency's chief economist, said in an interview. ''We project them to be the world leaders, producing new capacity in wind, solar, nuclear and advanced coal.''
With China and its 1.3 billion people as a primary engine, the energy agency predicted that world energy demand should grow by more than a third over the next 25 years, as new oil supplies became harder to find.
It also predicted that oil prices would rise to $113 a barrel in 2035, in current dollars, a rise of nearly $30. The agency also predicted that fossil fuels -- oil, natural gas and coal -- would remain primary sources of energy for the world, though renewable energy sources and conservation efforts would increase in importance.
The agency's prognosis for Chinese energy use is challenging for efforts to control climate change, but it is not entirely bleak.
With $735 billion in investment plans over the next decade in nuclear, wind, solar and biomass projects, China is becoming a world leader in low-carbon energy output, according to the report.
''Given the sheer scale of China's domestic market, its push to increase the share of new low-carbon energy technologies could play an important role in driving down their costs through faster rates of technology learning and economies of scale,'' the report said.
On Monday, the German automaker Volkswagen announced plans to build 10,000 electric cars in China starting in 2014. In addition, Nissan Motor, General Motors and Daimler are planning to build electric vehicles in China, which offers subsidies to buyers of such cars to cut oil consumption.
The country is also decreasing the energy intensity of its economic output, in part by lowering subsidies. Last year, the report said, the average retail price for gasoline in China was 40 percent higher than in the United States because of higher taxes, and 32 percent higher for diesel.
''Our projections indicate an improvement in emissions intensity (3.8 percent a year) between 2008 and 2035, which is faster than improvements achieved elsewhere,'' according to the report.
Still, the report said China would remain a crucial anchor in the world coal trade. China's coal consumption between 2000 and 2008 accounted for three-quarters of the global growth in coal demand. With 60 percent of energy demand in China's industrial sector currently coming from coal, it will take years for China to slow its consumption of coal, the most carbon-intensive of fossil fuels.
The report offered many predictions about demand and supply of various fuels around the world, but it also concluded that there were many uncertainties. It wondered whether carbon capture and storage technology would ever become commercially available to clean increasing coal-fired electricity generation. It wondered whether biofuels production from crops like corn could be sustainable for food supplies.
''One point is certain,'' the report concluded. ''The center of gravity of global energy demand growth now lies in the developing world, especially in China and India.''

HEADLINE: Electric Cars of the Future

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Electric Cars Give Japan Big Anxiety'' (Business Day, Nov. 3): 
I believe that by the end of this century, we will be driving electric cars and will refill them at ''battery swap'' filling stations. I also expect that although at first the electricity for recharging will come from the grid, in the long run our energy supply structure will become wireless and will be converted into a more localized mode of electricity generation that depends mostly on distributed local power generation.
At that time, the filling station will have underground, double-walled cryogenic hydrogen storage tanks providing the fuel to fuel cells converting the chemical energy in the liquid or high-pressure hydrogen gas into the electricity needed to charge the depleted batteries of the previously refilled cars, making these batteries ready to be swapped into the cars that are just driving into the station.
This service station design is likely to emerge, because it can refill the cars in a couple of minutes and can allow them to travel at least 100 miles before the next battery swap. I also believe that American expertise can help regain our global leadership and create an economic boom if we become the leaders in developing the ''computer of the 21st century'': the tools of the coming solar-hydrogen economy.

HEADLINE: $25 Billion in Cuts, If the Math Worked

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
Note to the incoming Republican majority in the House: Eliminating government programs that do not exist does not save money. 
Of the few specific cuts that Congressional Republicans have proposed in their promised assault on annual budget deficits, one of the biggest by far would save $25 billion over 10 years, they claim, by ending an emergency welfare fund.
The Republican Study Committee, which includes more than 100 of the most conservative House Republicans, promoted the idea in a statement this week, saying, ''With the national debt quickly approaching $14 trillion, Washington needs to get serious about cutting spending.''
Well, seriously, the fund expired Sept. 30.
At $5 billion, it was part of President Obama's roughly $800 billion, two-year stimulus plan and was created to help states meet the increased demand for welfare assistance and employment programs due to the recession. House Democrats, with support from state and local officials, voted to extend the fund this year given continued high unemployment, but the Senate balked.
House Republicans have calculated the fund's annual cost, $2.5 billion, and multiplied by 10 years, which is the common period for projecting budget costs and savings. The product: savings of $25 billion.
The actual math is simpler: 10 x 0 = 0.
On Wednesday, Representative Jim McDermott, a Democrat from Washington State who sponsored the fund proposal, issued his own statement: ''What's next? Claiming savings for cutting New Deal work programs that were terminated over 70 years ago?''

HEADLINE: New Haven, Trying to Get More Students Into College, Will Pay Tuition

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU; Patrick G. Lee contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Public high school students in New Haven now have another reason to go to college: free tuition.
City and school officials announced on Tuesday that a new program, called New Haven Promise, would offer to pay eligible students' way through any public college or university in Connecticut. The program will also pay up to $2,500 a year to those who attend a private college in the state.
The program -- to cost $4.5 million a year, financed primarily by Yale University -- is open to students who live in the city and have attended its public schools, including charter schools, since at least ninth grade, regardless of family income. Students must also have at least a 3.0 grade point average and a 90 percent attendance rate. 
About 200 of the 1,000 graduates last year would have qualified, city officials said.
''It provides a direct path for students to go to college,'' Mayor John DeStefano Jr. said in a telephone interview on Monday. ''There's a rich universe of colleges in Connecticut that will serve these students well.''
Mr. DeStefano said the program was intended to curb a citywide high school dropout rate of 38 percent and cultivate a college-going culture, as well as to provide an economic incentive for families to move to New Haven. Students will qualify for the financial aid on a sliding scale, with those who started in city schools at kindergarten receiving the most, 100 percent of their tuition. Students who arrived in the ninth grade will receive 65 percent.
The New Haven program is one of a growing number of similar initiatives across the nation.
In New York, the 21,000-student Syracuse school district joined in 2008 with Syracuse University and Say Yes to Education, a nonprofit foundation, to offer free college tuition to students who attend 10th, 11th and 12th grades in one of the city's five public high schools. The students must be admitted to one of a group of more than 80 private and public colleges.
Syracuse school officials said that more than 1,000 students had received free tuition through the program, and that the district's enrollment had increased by 300 students since 2008 as more families moved into the city. But the graduation rate has remained unchanged.
George A. Weiss, a Wall Street financier who founded Say Yes to Education in 1987, said the foundation had paid college tuition for more than 350 students in predominantly poor schools in Hartford; Philadelphia; Cambridge, Mass.; and Harlem in New York City. He said academic enrichment programs, counseling and other services had supplemented the tuition assistance.
''You can't just give them an offer of money,'' Mr. Weiss said. ''They still have their day-to-day issues, and you have to help them. It's made a huge difference.''
In New Haven, Mayor DeStefano said the tuition program was part of a two-year campaign to turn around the city's schools that has included trying to narrow the achievement gap for black and Hispanic students.
Students will have to maintain a grade point average of 2.5 in college to continue receiving the tuition money, valued at up to $8,000 a year for a public college.
The program, which will be phased in beginning with the senior class this year, will be financed for each of the first four years with $4 million from Yale and an additional $500,000 from the Community Foundation for Greater New Haven. Mr. DeStefano said he expected that the program would eventually raise additional money from other sources, including private colleges.
Roland Lemar, a father of two and a Democrat who was recently elected a state representative, said the free tuition program would help make college a reality for many students whose families are struggling.
''I'm still paying off student loans from when I went to college 12 years ago,'' Mr. Lemar, 34, said. ''And to allow an entire generation of New Haven residents to attend college without that burden, my children included, is a wonderful statement of where our priorities are.''

HEADLINE: Close Race Over, Governor-Elect Turns to Connecticut's Fiscal Woes

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

 BODY:
A week into his transition, Dannel P. Malloy can finally, officially, call himself Connecticut's governor-elect. Now, maybe he can remind himself why he wanted the job in the first place.
With backbreaking budget deficits of as much as $4 billion, and a lifeless economy threatening to deepen those shortfalls, experts say the state is mired in its deepest financial hole in decades.
Mr. Malloy's task is particularly daunting because he must try to create jobs in a state that has ranked last in employment growth since 1990. 
''It's never been this bad,'' said Fred V. Carstensen, director of the Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis. ''We're looking at years of deficits, even making heroic assumptions about revenue growth.''
Even worse, most of the usual deficit-closing tricks have already been tried, Democratic and Republican officials say, leaving Mr. Malloy, a Democrat, with little choice but to resort to blunt instruments: tax increases, layoffs or union givebacks, or going deeper into debt.
In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Malloy, 55, a former mayor of Stamford, acknowledged the gloomy forecasts of deficits as large as 20 percent of the state's budget. But he sounded upbeat.
''It's real ugly,'' he said. ''The gimmicks have run out. It falls to the next governor, who happens to be me, to right the ship.''
Mr. Malloy said he planned to squeeze every penny by consolidating state agencies, but acknowledged there would still be plenty of pain to go around. ''I suspect it's going to be something of everything,'' he said. ''I don't have any other options. You can't tax your way out of it. You can't cut your way out of it.''
As a candidate, Mr. Malloy outlined a variety of ideas: cashing in $1 billion in unexploited state tax credits to build new research and manufacturing centers, dispatching teams of local officials and business leaders to recruit out-of-state companies and accelerating economic development at Bradley International Airport, to name a few.
In the interview, he said he would move quickly to change attitudes about Connecticut among business leaders in the state and elsewhere, by working with lawmakers to cut state surcharges on electric bills, among the highest in the nation.
The governor-elect also said he would try to bring ''a sense of reality and normalcy to government,'' most noticeably by adopting generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, in keeping the state's books and preparing its budgets.
Doing so means bringing papered-over problems out into the open, which would make the state's immediate and structural deficits look even larger than they already do, Mr. Malloy said.''People will see we're not going to hide our problems,'' he said.
Political insiders said adopting the more stringent accounting principles could also strengthen Mr. Malloy's hand with union leaders and lawmakers.
''It's the handle of the ax,'' said Richard Foley, a political consultant and former state Republican chairman. ''Honesty can be an expensive hobby. But he might be able to use it as a tool. If you want to have truly honest budgets, we have to do this, and he'll use it as a rationale to raise taxes, cut back some sacred cows and eliminate some positions. It'll buy him cover.''
Mr. Malloy will at least enjoy support in the capital: his party will control both houses of the state legislature and the executive branch for the first time in 20 years.
His narrow victory over the Republican nominee for governor, Thomas C. Foley, also owed much to the state's public-sector unions, which were eager for a Democrat after 20 years of hostilities with Gov. John G. Rowland, who laid off thousands of workers, and Gov. M. Jodi Rell -- both Republicans.
Now, labor leaders say they expect Mr. Malloy will invite them into the cost-cutting process.
''Rowland was very tough on labor,'' said Matt O'Connor, a spokesman for a coalition of 13 state workers unions. ''Rell's attitude was one of condescension. The reason why Governor-elect Malloy's in the best position to bring real change is he's willing to work with partners. He's willing to listen.''
But it may be the union members who wear hard hats who welcome Mr. Malloy's inauguration the loudest. In the interview, he said his biggest job-creation move would be to start evaluating infrastructure projects according to how many jobs and how much tax revenue they would create, and then to set about borrowing quickly to get the best of them off the ground.
Mr. Malloy said Governor Rell had cut capital expenditures in response to the economic downturn. ''I, on the other hand, believe that infrastructure investment is long overdue, it primes the pump, and it puts people back to work,'' he said. ''All eight of the downturns since World War II, we were led out of by construction. Yet we elected people to Washington who don't believe it's an appropriate tool to use.''
''I want to be very clear,'' he added. ''I believe it is.''

HEADLINE: Currency Issues Overshadow South Korea's Plan to Play Mediator at G-20 Meeting

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- The Federal Reserve's decision to pump $600 billion into the American economy has put South Korean government officials in a difficult spot.
As the site of the Group of 20 leaders' summit meeting this week, South Korea had hoped to host efforts to mediate the dispute between the United States and China over exchange-rate policies. But like other fast-growing countries, it is confronting economic worries of its own, a surge of capital seeking higher yields likely to be accelerated by the Fed's move, which is expected to push down American interest rates and the value of the dollar.
With annual economic growth at nearly 5 percent and real estate prices so high that there is talk of a bubble, South Korea announced steps in June to limit the risks arising from sharp reversals in capital flows, a main source of instability during the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis. 
Last Friday, the finance ministry and the central bank moved for the second time in a week to inspect foreign exchange positions, a step seen as an effort to curb speculation. Lawmakers are weighing whether to tax interest income on bonds bought by foreigners.
There is also talk of whether the South Korean currency, the won, should be devalued to stay competitive with Japan, which intervened in foreign-exchange markets in September in a short-lived attempt to stop the devaluation of the yen.
The steps come as institutions like the International Monetary Fund, which has long preached against controls on capital flows, are reassessing their usefulness.
With slow growth in the United States, Japan and other parts of the developed world, South Korea and countries like it have benefited from foreign investment. That compels government to confront ''the challenge of balancing the need for large capital inflows -- especially foreign direct investment -- with ensuring competitiveness, financial sector stability, and low inflation,'' said Vikram Nehru, the World Bank's chief economist for East Asia.
On the eve of the summit meeting, that challenge has been the talk of leading economists here.
''How can the United States tell China and Japan not to intervene when it is doing the same?'' in effect, with its currencies, said Kang Sung-jin, an economist at Korea University.
Shin Min-yong, an economist at LG Economic Research Institute, said the Fed's actions did not match American rhetoric. ''To come up with this monetary easing at such a sensitive time appears to the rest of the world to be at odds with what the United States has said about holding hands to fix the world economy together,'' he said.
In a recent interview, Changyong Rhee, the personal representative to the G-20 for the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, said that South Korea had a distinct role to play as the first emerging-market economy to host the G-20 leaders' meeting, a source of national pride.
Dr. Rhee, a Harvard-trained economist, spoke of bridging the disputes between the United States, its closest ally, and China, its largest trading partner, and of prodding the G-20 to pay more attention to development.
But the escalating currency tensions now threaten to overshadow those efforts.
''Yen, yuan, won -- if one currency goes down, the other nations will react in kind, and with even more extreme measures,'' Cho Gyeong-lyeob, an economist at the Korean Economic Research Institute, a private market research firm, said. ''It would lead to a breakdown of the cooperative mechanism that we have all been aspiring to maintain.''
Some South Korean companies said they were already feeling the bite from the weaker dollar, which has dropped about 8 percent against the won this year. Nam Bok-gyu, president of Young Poong Filltex, a small textiles producer, said his profit margins had been squeezed even before the Fed's easing.
''All of us exporters can only be hurt by this,'' he said of the Fed's action, in an office in an industrial neighborhood in western Seoul, filled with racks of hanging textile samples.

HEADLINE: Jordanians Go to Polls Under Cloud Of a Boycott

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH; Ranya Kadri contributed reporting from Amman, Jordan

 BODY:
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Voters went to the polls in Jordan on Tuesday in a parliamentary election that was boycotted by the country's main opposition group. The vote is likely to bolster allies of the Jordanian monarchy, but it could also deepen alienation from the political process.
The campaign was dominated by widespread anger at the stalled Middle East peace talks and concerns about the rising poverty rate. The pro-American kingdom has struggled for years to balance a measure of democracy with the need to check a powerful Islamist movement and a large, restive Palestinian population. 
The opposition group, the Islamic Action Front, called the boycott to protest the government's failure to redraw its gerrymandered voting districts, in which the cities -- where most of the Islamist voters live -- have less representation in Parliament than rural areas that are inhabited by tribes loyal to King Abdullah II.
Reflecting that imbalance, voting was light in Amman, the capital, many observers said. But by midday the turnout appeared to have picked up, and the Interior Ministry reported that 32 percent of Jordanian voters cast ballots.
In all, 763 candidates ran for 120 seats in the lower house, known as the Chamber of Deputies, where 12 spots are allocated to Christians and other minority groups and 12 others are set aside for women.
The last election, in 2007, took place in the shadow of Gaza's takeover by Hamas, which left the Jordanian government deeply worried about the Islamist influence. That election was marred by widespread accusations of fraud and manipulation of the process by the Jordanian authorities. This time, the government was keen to ease those resentments, and it allowed international monitors to observe an election for the first time.
''There's no doubt that procedures have improved since 2007,'' said Les Campbell, the regional director of the National Democratic Institute, which brought a 61-member observation team. Vote-checking methods have improved; it is easier to file a challenge; and everything is computerized, Mr. Campbell said. But there were accusations of vote-buying, as yet unconfirmed, and it remained ''to be seen whether the improved procedures will result in a better election,'' he said.
King Abdullah dissolved the Chamber of Deputies late last year, and many Jordanians thought he would reform the imbalances in the voting districts, said Renda Habib, a political commentator in Amman. Instead, he left them intact, which led the Islamic Action Front, the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, to shun the election.
''The number of Islamists has grown, but their representation in Parliament has shrunk,'' Ms. Habib said. The government has long been reluctant to enact broader democratic reforms, fearing that Islamists would gain a majority in Parliament, as they did in 1989.
Seven members of the Islamic Action Front ignored the boycott and ran as independents. They have been suspended by the Front, and if they win -- as seems likely -- their victories could bolster the election's legitimacy in the public's eyes.
Economic issues were front and center during the campaign, reflecting the high unemployment rate, steep food prices and a record budget deficit of $2.1 billion. Jordan's economy is heavily dependent on foreign investment, foreign aid and remittances from abroad. It suffered more than most Arab countries in the global economic crisis that began in 2008.
''I voted because it's my national duty,'' said Farah Uktoush, 41, a secretary in Amman, after returning from the polls. ''I don't know the guy, but I hope he'll fix the economic situation.''
Others were less optimistic.
''Why should I vote?'' asked Selma Mahmoud, 31, of Zarqa. ''Promises, promises and then nothing.''

HEADLINE: From Ex-Mental Hospital To a New Mixed-Use Life

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

 BODY:
TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. -- Until it closed in 1989, the Traverse City State Hospital was among the largest employers in this small city in northern Michigan. Two new commercial and residential construction projects are bringing the old asylum, renamed the Village at Grand Traverse Commons, closer to regaining that distinction.
This month carpenters and electricians neared completion of a 13,000-square-foot, $2.3 million restoration of the hospital's former upholstery shop into a modern office building. A local investment advisory firm is moving into a 4,200-square-foot space on the building's first floor. 
And across a central square that includes a new bocce court, construction has begun on a $14 million, 47,000-square-foot conversion of the main hospital building's north wing to 39 units of affordable housing, with rents from $450 to $750 monthly.
When the asylum opened in 1885 it was the largest building in northern Michigan. It was designed by the prominent Detroit architect Gordon W. Lloyd, and the light-filled interior and calming exterior were inspired by Thomas Kirkbride, a Pennsylvania psychiatrist who theorized that beauty, work and nature were the best treatments for serious mental illness.
In the nine years since a local developer, Raymond Minervini, and his family gained ownership of 63 acres, 27 Victorian-Italianate brick buildings, and 750,000 square feet of space on this city's wooded west side, the development has emerged as a steadily expanding retail, office and residential hub.
The biggest investment so far is the $28.7 million that the Minervinis spent from 2003 to 2005 to turn the 125-year-old south wing of the main building into a ground-floor marketplace of 41,000 square feet and 108,500 square feet of commercial and residential space. A warren of basement hallways and arched storage rooms became Trattoria Stella, an Italian restaurant that is considered one of the city's best. The wing now has 39 stores and offices, and 52 residential condominiums.
''When we first started,'' Mr. Minervini said, ''I knew that to be successful it would take a long time for the concept to evolve. This is a small city and only capable of absorbing so much residential and commercial space. We wanted to grow organically, like a real neighborhood. And because we've done that, we've been able to keep going even with the economy the way it is.''
Among the earlier projects was the conversion in 2007 of the former fire station into Pleasanton Brick Oven Bakery. On Tuesday evenings the Minervinis host a party there, inviting residents and workers to make their own pizzas.
''It's been a great fit,'' said Gerard Grabowski, who with his wife, Jan Shireman, moved the bakery in 2007 from alongside their home in Manistee County, 40 miles south of Traverse City. ''The building is small enough to keep rent low, but four times larger than our original location. A big shift for us was being able to provide direct retail sales instead of our old model of wholesale only.''
In all, about a third of the available space has been redeveloped, at a total cost of $44.5 million. Roughly 100 people live in the community's 62 residences, which range in size from 300 to 3,800 square feet. In addition, 331 people are employed at 75 offices, retailers and restaurants. Ultimately, according to Mr. Minervini's original vision, it will be a neighborhood where 800 people live and 1,000 people work.
''It's the largest private development in the area,'' said Russell Soyring, the director of planning in Traverse City, which has about 15,000 residents. ''What's happening now is so much more exciting than what was originally planned for that site. For a long time people saw it as a treatment center, or something along that line. The Minervinis saw a mixed-use compact village that was full of a variety of businesses and housing types.''
Mr. Minervini adopted a number of approaches to try to ensure the project's success.
First, the abundance of available space allowed the Minervinis to break the project into smaller sections that are easier to manage and finance. Mr. Minervini also negotiated an airtight agreement with the local redevelopment board, which owned and managed the property, ensuring that there would be low expenses while empty buildings awaited reconstruction.
The agreement stipulated that Mr. Minervini would gain clear title to the land and buildings for $1 if he developed 20,000 square feet of the main building and put a $1.5 million roof on it, projects he completed years ago.
And Mr. Minervini lobbied hard to gain state-financed redevelopment tax incentives, cleanup grants and other publicly financed economic enhancements that provide financial benefits to anyone who invests, lives or works at the new community.
Last, he formed a development partnership, the Minervini Group, to be the center of a network of family members and vertically integrated companies that will help finance, supply, design, construct, sell, lease, rent, maintain and manage whatever is built. Translation: the Minervini Group is making money on virtually every activity that occurs in the village.
Public investment has played a big role. The project qualified for $2 million in state brownfield cleanup grants, as well as tax increment financing and state business tax credits for developers. The village was named a state renaissance zone, which means residents and businesses pay no state personal or business income taxes or local property taxes until the benefit expires in 2017. Most of the buildings qualify for federal and state historic restoration tax credits.
Mr. Minervini developed suburban chain restaurants in the Detroit region before moving to Traverse City in 1989, the year the state hospital was shut. A builder by trade, Mr. Minervini was perhaps drawn to the craftsmanship involved in laying 11 million bricks while leaving space in three-foot-thick walls for nearly 2,000 windows.
He noted that construction on the massive main building began in 1883 and ended two years later. ''That's the same amount of time,'' he said with a smile, ''that it takes now to get construction permits and financing.''

HEADLINE: Markets Fall for a Second Day as the Dollar Improves

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks were mostly lower on Tuesday for a second straight session as the dollar strengthened and oil prices declined in late trading, eroding earlier gains in the energy sector.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 60.09 points, or 0.53 percent, to 11,346.75. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 9.85 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,213.40. The Nasdaq composite index slid 17.07 points, or 0.66 percent, to 2,562.98.
With oil prices rising and a new deal announced by Chevron that it would acquire Atlas Energy, the energy sector in the broader market was the best performing on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index for much of the day, but then it fell by about 0.3 percent as the dollar strengthened and oil prices declined by about 2 percent, said Brian M. Youngberg, an energy analyst with Edward Jones. 
''Energy still held up a bit better than the overall market,'' said Mr. Youngberg. ''It has been doing very well here lately with oil moving close to a two year high.''
On Tuesday, Chevron, the second largest energy company in the United States, announced that it would acquire Atlas Energy for $4.3 billion, including the assumption of debt. It was the most recent move by an energy company to expand in the natural gas sector. Chevron's larger rival, Exxon Mobil, bet on natural gas in December with its $31 billion acquisition of XTO Energy.
The most active stock in the sector was Exxon Mobil, which was up more than 1 percent during the day, at $70.63. Halliburton, which had risen about 0.7 percent, was down 0.6 percent to close at $33.22. Chevron was down 1.5 percent to $83.56 and Atlas was up 34 percent, to $42.50.
The Chevron deal ''shows that energy companies still see good value out there to make acquisitions,'' Mr. Youngberg said.
Materials and industrials stocks also did well in early trading. ''Some of the more economically sensitive sectors continue to do well and I think that is a reflection that maybe our economy is kind of getting out of this soft patch,'' said Hank Smith, the chief investment officer of equity at Haverford Investments. ''Most of these industrials and basic materials have a great emerging market presence.''
But there was little impetus of the kind that propelled the markets higher last week, when the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve, announced a $600 billion bond-buying program and Congressional elections put Republicans in control of the House of Representatives. New economic indicators also gave shares a push higher last week, including stronger-than-expected manufacturing data and jobs report.
''We had so much data and market moving news, and most of that is behind us now,'' said Michael Church, the president of Addison Capital. ''We are certainly overbought, so a correction would not be shocking.''
On Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that wholesale inventories rose in September for the ninth straight month.
Financial stocks were down more than 2 percent. Citigroup was down more than 3 percent, to $4.30, and Bank of America fell 2.62 percent, to $12.27.
''It looks like both yesterday and today the market is kind of pausing and digesting,'' Mr. Smith said, referring to the big gains in the market since Sept. 1.
In early September, analysts said, the markets generally began to price in expectations that the Fed would announce the plans to buy the additional government securities, a move intended to stimulate the economy, setting off a rally that has pushed indexes to their highest level this year.
Gold, whose price has soared, edged higher through the day. The dollar was up slightly against a weighted basket of currencies. The euro traded slightly lower at $1.3830.
Interest rates were higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 29/32, to 99 23/32, and the yield rose to 2.636 percent from 2.55 percent late Monday.

HEADLINE: Government in the Cheese Business

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''While Warning About Fat, U.S. Pushes Cheese Sales'' (front page, Nov. 7):
Kudos for exposing an intolerable conflict of interest. Government-backed agricultural programs that serve as marketing arms for the meat and dairy industries should be exposed and shut down.
For too long, we have been speaking of public health without addressing the root causes of our nation's most serious health problems. Excessive consumption of cheese and other animal products is a leading contributor to heart disease, cancer, obesity and other afflictions. 
It's time for our government to stop promoting foods that make us sick, and instead to support increased consumption of fruits, vegetables and other whole plant foods that aid our health and well-being rather than damage it.
Gene Baur President and Co-founder Farm Sanctuary College Park, Md., Nov. 8, 2010
To the Editor:
Did we not just finish an election that sent an overwhelming message that big government was not to interfere in the people's business? How else would you describe this blatant promotion of the dairy industry by Dairy Management, an organization supported in large part by our own government?
Our government is apparently making cheese its cause, not the increasing obesity and resulting negative health effects on our nation's children.
Sheila A. Mahoney Co-director, Food Project Princeton Alumni Corps Niantic, Conn., Nov. 7, 2010
To the Editor:
Your article is a long-overdue indictment of the Department of Agriculture regarding obesity. Unfortunately, this conflict of interest is not news. The department has been propping up the dairy industry's fat assembly line for at least the last 60 years through milk subsidies and the low-cost sale of surplus cheese to school lunch programs and poor people.
Other industries have had to modify their products to remain competitive in the global economy. Why should the dairy industry and pizza joints get a pass at the expense of the healthy food choices of all Americans?
Instead of a self-serving, free promotion campaign for Domino's, the Department of Agriculture and Dairy Management should be engaged in developing a first-class public education campaign advising consumers how to eat fewer dairy products and suggesting healthier, low-fat food options.
Pamela Maurath New York, Nov. 7, 2010
To the Editor:
Kudos for pointing out the self-contradictory behavior of the federal government. But these inconsistencies aren't limited to dairy marketing. Although the Agriculture Department has pushed low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets since the first dietary recommendations in 1977, these diets have not been proved by science to prevent disease or promote good health.
While fat is demonized (as well as marketed), highly processed wheat, corn and soy products -- subsidized and endorsed by the U.S.D.A. -- make up the bulk of our diet. Yet science accumulated in the U.S.D.A.'s own Nutrition Evidence Library shows that diets that limit those foods lead to improved health -- more so than diets that limit fat.
Efforts to reverse the epidemics of diabetes and obesity will be an exercise in futility until we take a critical look at our dietary recommendations and question the science (or lack thereof) upon which they are based.
Adele Hite Policy Chairwoman Healthy Nation Coalition Durham, N.C., Nov. 7, 2010
To the Editor:
The Department of Agriculture's use of tax dollars to promote fat-filled dairy products that contribute to obesity, diabetes and heart disease is unconscionable. The agency repeatedly appears to see its role as an advocate and protector of the dairy, meat and egg industries.
It needs to be recognized that dairy factory farms guarantee the proliferation of harm. Cows are severely confined and denied all that is natural to them. Male calves are separated from their mothers shortly after birth, raised for veal -- a byproduct of the dairy industry -- in tiny enclosures where they cannot turn around and slaughtered after a few months. The manure and gases from these animals will pollute the air, water and land and contribute to global warming.
The U.S.D.A. may try to dictate food choices that ignore health and ethics, but consumers have the power to think about the health and moral aspects of what they eat.
Irene Muschel New York, Nov. 8, 2010
To the Editor:
Europe is criticized for the ''butter mountains'' and ''milk lakes'' resulting from its agricultural subsidies. How very American that excess production here is marketed by the government to poor people (free market, anyone?), only adding to their nutritional challenges.
Phil Simon Portland, Me., Nov. 7, 2010

HEADLINE: In Long-Running Coal Battle, a New Round in Virginia

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
BECKLEY, W. Va. -- When advocates for judicial reform point to examples of how money can influence courtroom decisions, they often cite as exhibit A the case of Hugh M. Caperton.
It's not hard to see why. In 2002, a West Virginia jury awarded $50 million to Mr. Caperton after finding that the powerful chairman of Massey Energy, Don L. Blankenship, had set out to financially destroy him and his small coal company. But even as this state's highest court repeatedly threw out that award, controversies emerged over ties between Mr. Blankenship and court judges.
One judge stepped aside in 2008 from the case after photographs emerged showing him vacationing alongside Mr. Blankenship in Monte Carlo, and another judge did so after the United States Supreme Court ruled last year that he should not have ruled on Massey's appeals because Mr. Blankenship had spent $3 million supporting his election.
The machinations in Mr. Caperton's case resembled a plot line in John Grisham's courtroom drama ''The Appeal.'' In March, the West Virginia court voted again to overturn Mr. Caperton's award, holding for the third time that he should have sued Massey in Virginia, not West Virginia. 
On Tuesday, Mr. Caperton followed that suggestion and sued Massey in Virginia. But he and his lawyers also made West Virginia's justice system a part of that filing, charging, among other things, that the ties between Mr. Blankenship and the court justice who had vacationed alongside him, Elliott E. Maynard, had made a mockery of justice.
''I think that anyone can connect the dots and see what happened,'' Mr. Caperton said.
In a statement, Massey Energy, the country's sixth-biggest coal producer, said it had not seen the new lawsuit. But the company said, ''Mr. Caperton's claims have been rejected by the West Virginia court system multiple times, and we hope that his attorneys have not decided to waste more resources by seeking to bring a meritless case back to the Virginia court system.''
For his part, Mr. Maynard, who no longer serves as a judge, said he had not seen the lawsuit and had no comment on it. This month, Mr. Maynard was defeated in his bid to become a United States representative from West Virginia, an effort that received financial backing from Mr. Blankenship.
Kermit Roosevelt, a professor at the School of Law of the University of Pennsylvania, said that while he was not familiar with the specifics of the Massey case, he believed that Mr. Caperton would probably have to reargue his case against Massey before a Virginia judge or jury.
Mr. Caperton's decision to forge ahead with his long-running battle against Mr. Blankenship comes as Massey confronts other issues. For one, federal officials are continuing to investigate the cause of an April explosion at a Massey mine in West Virginia that killed 29 miners, the coal industry's worst disaster in 40 years.
The legal fight has left Mr. Caperton, a tall, soft-spoken man of 55, badly battered. Twelve years after the first lawsuit was filed, he remains unemployed, in debt and barred by the federal government from owning a coal company. When Mr. Blankenship backed out at the last minute from talks to buy Harman Mining, Mr. Caperton's company quickly plunged into bankruptcy, and he defaulted on a bond that the government requires coal companies to post to pay for the cleanup of old mines.
His efforts to find other kinds of work in the coal industry have also failed, he says, because companies fear reprisals from Mr. Blankenship. Mr. Caperton's most recent job interview was with a coal company based in Australia.
''It is all the uncertainty,'' he said, seated on a recent day on the back patio of his rambling home near here. ''I have used up all up my retirement and spent everything on this case.''
The roots of his case stretch to 1997. At the time, Mr. Caperton, who grew up in a family that operated a coal mine in Slab Fork, W. Va., was running Harman, which was based in western Virginia.
The Harman mine produced a very high-grade coal sought by steel makers. And for years, it had sold all its production to another company, Wellmore Coal, which blended it into a coal mixture that it sold to a big steel company, LTV.
When Mr. Caperton learned in late 1997 that Massey had bought Wellmore's parent company, he initially thought that his business would continue as usual. But he would later learn from court proceedings that Mr. Blankenship had a different agenda; he had decided to cut out Harman and force LTV to buy cheaper coal from Massey, court papers show.
When LTV rejected doing so, Mr. Blankenship undertook a series of steps, a jury later found, intended to undercut Mr. Caperton and Harman. Among other things, Massey directed Wellmore Coal to set off a clause in its contract with Harman that voided that agreement, knowing that doing so would put the small company into a financial tailspin.
In addition, Massey bought a strip of land surrounding the Harman mine to make it unattractive to potential buyers. And when Mr. Blankenship entered talks with Mr. Caperton to buy Harman at a deep discount, he told Mr. Caperton that he should never think about suing.
''He said, 'I spend a $1 million a month on attorneys, and I will tie you up in court for years,' '' Mr. Caperton recalled.
In 1998, after Harman filed for bankruptcy, the company sued Wellmore Coal in a Virginia state court for breach of contract, eventually winning a $6 million judgment. But that same year, it also filed a separate action against Massey in a West Virginia court for tortious interference, the action that led to the $50 million award.
Along with the legal setbacks, the last few years have been particularly hard for Mr. Caperton and his family. In 2007, he fell off his house's roof while cleaning gutters, breaking his back and feet. Then, doctors discovered a tumor on his kidney that turned out to be cancerous. In 2008, he underwent surgery at the Cleveland Clinic to have part of his kidney removed.
For his wife, Kathy, Mr. Caperton's legal travails have seeped into every aspect of their family's life. Her husband's case began shortly after the couple's daughter, known as Preston, was born. And last year, Preston, now 13, made her father's lawsuit the subject of a project that she entered into a statewide social studies competition.
''It's been our entire marriage,'' Mrs. Caperton said.
Recently, Mr. Caperton has started traveling around the country to speak about his case and judicial election reform. He found himself not long ago in Washington on a speaker's dais alongside luminaries like Sandra Day O'Connor, former justice of the Supreme Court.
He recently said that he had no expectation that his case would end soon, but one day, he hopes, it will.
''I would love one day to wake up and not think about Don Blankenship and what I've been through,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Once Rivals, Cuomo and Paterson Present a United Front

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
They have been friends, members of New York's political aristocracy and rivals -- sometimes bitter rivals -- for the state's highest office. But on Tuesday, the departing governor, David A. Paterson, and his successor, Andrew M. Cuomo, presented themselves as partners. 
Meeting at Mr. Paterson's office in Manhattan, the two emerged for a mild-mannered news conference, during which they cracked jokes, told tales and discussed the challenges ahead.
Mr. Paterson led off with a story about the time the two men and their families went rafting together in the Adirondacks; he wondered aloud whether Mr. Cuomo had ever imagined that they would both ultimately serve as governor. He also praised Mr. Cuomo for his campaign warnings to New Yorkers that the state would continue to face tough economic challenges in the years ahead.
''Rarely has a statewide candidate for governor or senator or anything such as that been so honest and so pragmatic about the future,'' Mr. Paterson said.
Mr. Cuomo repeatedly called Mr. Paterson a friend and thanked him for his service amid one of the worst economic crises to face the state.
''I thanked him on a personal level, for his hospitality and his courtesy and his professionalism all through this transition,'' Mr. Cuomo told reporters.
He also joked that Mr. Paterson had agreed to find $8 billion or so in extra savings to help balance next year's budget, one of the hardest tasks Mr. Cuomo faces in the months ahead.
''That really exceeded the friendship to the tune of $9 billion,'' Mr. Cuomo said, drawing laughs.
It was a far cry from the tension and jockeying between the two men and their allies this year, when Mr. Paterson planned to run for election in his own right and Mr. Cuomo was widely expected to challenge him in a primary. Mr. Paterson ultimately abandoned his bid, leaving a clear path for Mr. Cuomo to win the Democratic nomination and, ultimately, the election.
Mr. Paterson professed no hard feelings.
''I feel very assured being replaced by someone I think is going to do an excellent job,'' Mr. Paterson said. ''If he had walked in with a baseball bat, I might've thought a little differently. I'm really good with all of it. Really, what I'm thinking about is the privilege it was to serve this state.''
Mr. Cuomo chimed in: ''I don't see myself as replacing Governor Paterson. In public service, you serve at a moment in time.''

HEADLINE: $27 Billion Trade Surplus for China

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China's trade surplus surged to $27.1 billion in October, providing fodder for political tensions a day before the Group of 20 leaders were set to tackle a framework to correct the trade imbalances that economists say threaten the global recovery. 
The rise is in marked contrast to the September figures, when China's trade surplus, down 15.7 percent from the previous month, was at its smallest in nearly half a year.
Exports rose 22.9 percent from a year earlier to $135.98 billion in October, the state-run news agency Xinhua said Wednesday, which was in line with Reuters economists' forecasts of 23.5 percent growth. Imports rose 25.3 percent from a year earlier to $108.83 billion.
As the Group of 20 leaders prepare to meet in Seoul on Thursday and Friday, China's latest trade surplus figures are likely to give more ammunition to critics who say the country doesn't do enough to encourage domestic consumption.
Some analysts partly attributed the larger gap between exports and imports to seasonal fluctuations, and at least one suggested the imbalance could soon improve given signs of stronger domestic consumption.
''After adjusting for seasonality, the level of trade surplus fell in October,'' Yu Song, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note.
''Having said that, with overheating pressures in the domestic economy rising quickly, further policy tightening is likely. This will tend to depress domestic demand growth and imports growth and the underlying trade surplus may be at risks of widening again.''
China's trade surplus with the rest of the world, and with the United States in particular, has raised political hackles in slower-growing regions of the world, where many policy makers argue that the renminbi is artificially weak, giving Chinese exporters an advantage.
Since June, China has allowed its currency to rise around 2 percent against the U.S. dollar. China is reluctant to let the renminbi appreciate faster, fearing that it would hurt its export sector.
While visiting India earlier this week, President Barack Obama criticized countries with large trade and current account surpluses, saying that the world needed a broad rebalancing.
''We can't continue to sustain a situation in which some countries are maintaining massive surpluses, others massive deficits and there never is the kind of adjustment with respect to currency that would lead to a more balanced growth pattern,'' Mr. Obama said.

HEADLINE: Democratic Strategists Say Damage Control Prevented More Election Losses

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As bad as election night was for House Democrats, top party strategists say it could have been far worse.
After sorting through the debris left behind by the Republican wave that swamped them, officials at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said the difficult decision to cut off campaign spending on Democrats whose races had slipped out of reach and then spend the money elsewhere ultimately saved 15 to 20 seats.
As a result, Democrats say they kept the number of seats they will need to pick up in 2012 to regain the House to a more manageable 25 or so rather than the nearly 40 they might have had to win under a worst-case scenario. 
''The margin we are beginning with is significantly lower than it might have been if the roof had been totally blown off and we hadn't contained the damage,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, chairman of the campaign committee.
Mr. Van Hollen acknowledged that his analysis was an effort to find a smidgen of good news in a thorough beating, as Democrats found themselves defending seats in Republican territory during bad economic conditions while facing a backlash from many voters against an aggressive Democratic agenda.
''It was obviously a brutal night for Democrats,'' said Mr. Van Hollen, who is stepping down after two election cycles at the committee responsible for electing Democrats to the House. ''There is no sugarcoating the fact that it was bad.''
But after having had to fight this year to hold seats in dozens of districts carried by President George W. Bush in 2004 and Senator John McCain in 2008, Democrats say the situation could be reversed in 2012.
They count more than 60 House districts that will be held by a Republican in the 112th Congress that were carried by President Obama in 2008. Though Mr. Obama might not have won many of them by much, the fact that he won them at all is evidence of a Democratic presence that, if not enough to help them this time around, Democrats believe they can capitalize on in two years.
Republicans conceded that the Democratic campaign team probably saved some seats that Republicans nearly grabbed. But Republicans also say that Democrats might not have realized the peril some of their candidates faced in states like Illinois, Idaho and New York and did not respond aggressively enough. In the end, Republicans said, Democratic operatives were done in by factors beyond their control.
''Democrats found out that campaign tactics cannot overcome an extremely toxic political environment created by unpopular politicians and their grossly out-of-touch policies,'' said Ken Spain, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee.
Mr. Van Hollen said one of his most difficult jobs was to decide to cut spending in some races and to withdraw almost entirely from the campaigns of nine Democrats who had been in line for substantial infusions of committee money but were shown by polls to have little or no chance of winning. At the same time, Republicans, with the help of deep-pocketed outside groups, were expanding the playing field and stretching Democrats' resources.
By pulling out of races like those of Representatives Betsy Markey of Colorado, Suzanne M. Kosmas of Florida, Debbie Halvorson of Illinois and Harry Teague of New Mexico, the party estimates it saved about $12 million. (Republicans ended up winning each of those seats.)
The Democratic campaign committee then turned around and put more than $10 million into television advertising and ground game efforts in 27 races that had tightened but were deemed winnable. Among the beneficiaries were Representatives Bruce Braley of Iowa, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Ben Chandler of Kentucky, Gerald E. Connolly of Virginia and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico -- all of whom ended up winning close races.
In some cases, the diverted money was added to what the party was already spending, and in others it was new spending altogether in districts where Democrats had hoped to avoid making any investments but found their incumbents suddenly in trouble.
''It required shifting resources that would have been spent in places where, unfortunately, we didn't think we could win,'' Mr. Van Hollen said. ''Just on the triage side, we believe we saved 15-20 seats.''
In the end, Republicans said they ended up spending about $54 million in 90 districts. Mr. Spain said the party won back the majority of suburban districts it had lost in the last election cycles and reclaimed all but 10 districts carried by Mr. McCain.
On the Democratic side, the party said it spent $63 million on television, mail and radio in 74 districts. But its financial edge was erased by the outside groups, which Democrats said spent $74 million in 64 districts.
''There is no doubt,'' Mr. Van Hollen said, ''that all the outside money put a lot of these seats in play and helped Republicans win.''

HEADLINE: Paterson Wants New York To Slash Greenhouse Gases

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
After a 10-month study, Gov. David A. Paterson is leaving his successor an ambitious environmental plan to reduce New York's greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by the middle of the century.
The plan, released in draft form on Tuesday, calls for doubling the state's sources of renewable energy by 2030, setting stricter efficiency standards for all buildings, shifting private transportation toward electric vehicles and supporting the creation of jobs in research on energy technology and in clean energy industries.
The long-term plan, assembled with the help of more than 100 experts from energy companies, utilities and labor and environmental groups, came out of a directive that Mr. Paterson signed in August 2009, setting the 80 percent goal for reductions in emissions in the heat-trapping greenhouse gases. 
Administration officials said they hoped that Governor-elect Andrew M. Cuomo would use it as a guide in promoting a shift to clean energy. The plan is generally in line with the energy policy that Mr. Cuomo laid out during his campaign. Both Mr. Paterson and Mr. Cuomo are Democrats.
The document is a blueprint not just for reducing emissions but also for expanding the state economy, officials said.
''Transitioning to clean energy means more than driving a zero-emission car,'' Mr. Paterson said in remarks prepared for an energy research conference on Tuesday in New York City. ''It also means manufacturing that car right here in New York, employing New York workers, driving the New York economy and building New York's tax base.''
A combination of state policymaking and public and private investment would be needed to halt the rise in emissions in the state -- they rose 2 percent from 1990 to 2008, the report notes -- and to reduce them by 40 percent by 2030 and 80 percent by midcentury.
''What's being released is a very accurate plan to achieve emissions reductions and economic growth,'' said Peter M. Iwanowicz, Mr. Paterson's adviser on the environment and the acting chief of the State Department of Environmental Conservation.
Public comments on the document, at nyclimatechange.us/InterimReport.cfm, are being accepted for 90 days.
The governor's plan contrasts with his recent decisions to significantly cut the budget and staff of the Department of Environmental Conservation. Objections raised by the department's previous chief, Alexander B. Grannis, led to Mr. Grannis's dismissal last month.
The governor has also dipped into a state environmental fund, intended to finance programs to cut emissions, to help close the state's budget deficit.
But administration officials maintain that those actions should not tarnish his environmental credentials.
''We're operating right now in a fiscal crisis like we've never seen before,'' said Morgan Hook, a spokesman for Mr. Paterson. ''What that requires is that everybody makes sacrifices. These are choices the governor had to make, not the choices he wants.''
Robert Moore, executive director of Environmental Advocates of New York, a group based in Albany that helped draft the environmental plan, condemned the budget cuts last month, saying that the Department of Environmental Conservation suffered disproportionately.
Mr. Moore offered praise for the environmental plan, however, suggesting that Mr. Cuomo could draw on the research and goals in the document to draft his own plans for tackling climate change through state regulation and other programs.
''They want to do something that's strong and robust, and that's a real commitment,'' he said of the new administration. ''They can start borrowing from this blueprint immediately.''

HEADLINE: A Big Charge Lowers Profit At Barclays

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
Barclays, the British bank, said Tuesday that its profit fell 76 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, dragged down by an accounting charge at its investment banking unit that overshadowed a stable underlying picture.
The bank, based in London, had a pretax profit of $:327 million, or $528 million, compared to $:1.4 billion a year earlier.
Barclays Capital, the investment banking division, took a charge of $:947 million, sending the unit to a loss of $:182 million despite performing fairly well in a relatively weaker market. The business had a profit of $:369 million in the period a year ago. 
The charge, which is not a cash item, resulted from marking-to-market the prices of debt the company itself had issued. The category is volatile; Barclays had reported a $:953 million gain on its own debt in the second quarter. Without the charge, Barclays' profit would still have been down on a year-to-year basis, but only slightly, at $:1.3 billion.
Barclays Capital revenue, at $:2.8 billion, was in line with analyst expectations. The bank surprised analysts, however, with third-quarter loan impairments of $:1.2 billion, smaller than many had anticipated, Ian Gordon, a banking analyst at Exane BNP Paribas in London, wrote in a note. An impairment is money set aside for a loan that the bank thinks may not be repaid.
Barclays might have been unduly conservative in its previous estimates, he said, and given that the market had been expecting bigger provisions, ''this item may trigger upgrades'' from analysts on Barclays stock, Mr. Gordon said.
The shares closed 4 percent higher Tuesday at $:11.35.
John Varley, who is stepping down as chief executive in 2011, described the bank's income and profit as ''resilient'' in the first nine months of the year, despite a ''subdued economic environment and moderate volumes.''
Mr. Varley will be replaced in March by Robert E. Diamond Jr., the American executive who has led the bank's international expansion. Barclays has been raising its profile overseas since it acquired Lehman Brothers' North American business in 2008.
Mr. Varley said the bank now had a better handle on its loan loss rate and overall impairment charges. ''Our capital, leverage and liquidity ratios remain strong,'' he added. ''We are well equipped to deal with regulatory change as Basel III is implemented between now and 2019.''
Investment banking held up well compared with ''a very strong year in 2009,'' the Barclays finance director, Chris Lucas, said during a conference call. The unit's fixed income, currency and commodities overall income declined 37 percent, while its equities and prime services top-line income fell 23 percent.
The fourth quarter has gotten off to a relatively good start, executives said during the conference call with reporters.
Unlike many of its peers, Barclays did not seek a direct government bailout when the credit crisis hit. It reported a core Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of financial strength, of 10 percent at the end of September, unchanged from the prior quarter.
The company does not break out its net profit on a quarterly basis, but Mr. Lucas said the third-quarter figure would be ''a relatively small number.''
He also noted that Barclays investment banking unit had paid out 43 percent of its third-quarter income in compensation, up from 42 percent in the first half of the year. Asked to justify that number at a time when bank pay is a politically sensitive issue, he said ''it's the markets at play.''
So far in 2010, the bank's 150,000 global employees are on track to receive $:1.3 billion in discretionary cash bonuses, $:300 million in long-term compensation, and $:640 million in payment of deferred compensation from prior years.

HEADLINE: From a Former Rival: Making the Case for Pelosi

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''A New Leader for the Democrats'' (editorial, Nov. 8) argued in favor of replacing Nancy Pelosi as leader of the House Democrats. You were aiming at the wrong target. In football parlance, the problem is the coach, not the quarterback. 
Nancy Pelosi has been one of the strongest, most effective speakers in American history.
She has run the plays exactly as sent in by the coach (President Obama). It is the coach who is making wrong calls and who is out of touch with middle-class America.
Let's look at Ms. Pelosi's record of accomplishment. Her House of Representatives passed economic stimulus legislation, passed health care and passed financial regulatory reform.
Democrats lost the House because of 9.6 percent unemployment and an inadequate focus on righting the economy by the Obama administration, not because of Nancy Pelosi, no matter how much the alpha male G.O.P. sought to demonize her.
It will be a challenge for her to keep the Democratic Caucus united in the minority and to gently move it toward the center while focusing on ways to improve our economy and protecting Social Security, Medicare and health reform. She is clearly up to the task.
Martin Frost Washington, Nov. 8, 2010
The writer was a Democratic member of Congress from the 24th District of Texas from 1979 to 2005 and waged an unsuccessful campaign against Ms. Pelosi for Democratic leader in 2002.

HEADLINE: Obama and China Play Rival Suitors to an Ascendant Indonesia

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

 BODY:
JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Less than a day before President Obama touched down in Jakarta on Tuesday, a high-level Chinese delegation wrapped up a three-day official visit here by announcing that Beijing would invest $6.6 billion in desperately needed infrastructure improvements. The announcement's emphasis on roads, bridges and canals -- not to mention its timing -- laid down a not-so-subtle challenge to Mr. Obama: Show your Indonesian hosts the money.
As the United States and China step up their rivalry in Southeast Asia, Indonesia -- officially hewing to a longstanding foreign policy of nonalignment but leaning closer to Washington -- represents by far the biggest prize in a region caught uneasily between China's rise and America's renewed engagement. 
At a news conference here with his counterpart, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Mr. Obama said the United States was not interested in ''containing'' China. But a day after endorsing India's pursuit of a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council in a move widely seen as an attempt to check China's growing influence, Mr. Obama poured on the charm.
The president, who spent four years as a boy here, sprinkled some Indonesian words in his speech and reminisced about daily life back then. More pointedly, he sought to align Indonesia with the United States on shared values, calling Indonesia a ''critical partner'' in ensuring Asia's prosperity ''primarily because it is a country that has figured out how to create a genuine democracy despite great diversity.''
American and Chinese officials have been pursuing all 10 countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, but none more aggressively than Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, spread out across a strategically important, resource-rich archipelago and now led by a democratically elected government impatient to raise the country's international profile.
The United States will have to contend with challenges, old and new. Despite Indonesia's enduring suspicion of China, Beijing has been making great inroads here, economically, diplomatically and militarily. And a newly confident Indonesia has been reasserting its independent foreign policy, promoting what it now calls a ''dynamic equilibrium'' for the region.
''We want to maintain a strategic space from the rivalry between the United States and China,'' said Juwono Sudarsono, Indonesia's defense minister under Mr. Yudhoyono from 2004 to 2009. ''We can navigate between that rivalry, from time to time giving out signals that both the United States and China are important to us, because if we align ourselves too closely, it would be detrimental to the core values of Indonesia's foreign policy.''
Despite Beijing's efforts, Indonesia, like the rest of Southeast Asia, except Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar, remains closer economically and strategically to the United States, experts say.
''The Indonesians would never align explicitly with the U.S., but they would learn to play the game,'' said Carlyle A. Thayer, a professor at the Australian Defense Force Academy who released a study on the effects of the American-Chinese rivalry on Southeast Asia.
In July, the United States lifted a ban on cooperating with Kopassus, an Indonesian special forces unit implicated in past human rights abuses. That removed the last obstacle to normalizing military ties that had been suspended in the 1990s because of Indonesia's occupation of East Timor. The United States, which has provided Indonesia with $47 million in equipment to bolster maritime security, also was co-host of a nine-nation military exercise with Indonesia last year.
But United States policy in other parts of the Muslim world undercuts its appeal in Indonesia, the country with the world's largest Muslim population.
''As President Obama promised in Cairo more than a year ago, he said he wants to create new relations between the United States and the Muslim world based on mutual understanding and respect,'' said Din Syamsuddin, the chairman of Muhammadiyah, one of Indonesia's two biggest Islamic social and political organizations. ''But many of us, including myself, are still waiting for the materialization of his promises. We maintain our skepticism because the foreign policy of the United States in Afghanistan or Palestine has not really shown any change.''
Meanwhile, Mr. Syamsuddin said, China has been reaching out to Muslim leaders in Southeast Asia. He himself was invited to meet Jia Qinglin, a member of China's ruling circle, in Beijing in May. Prime Minister Wen Jiabao had planned a visit this year, but canceled for domestic reasons.
Because of a failed 1965 Communist coup in Indonesia that is believed to have been backed by Beijing, Indonesia and China had no diplomatic relations until 1989. But trade between the two more than doubled from 2005 to 2009.
Since a Strategic Partnership agreement in 2005, high-level military exchanges have increased, and Indonesian officers have trained in China. Under a series of agreements, China said it would provide Indonesia with technical assistance in building aircraft and ships, as well as help in producing weapons and ammunition.
But there has been almost no follow-through yet on those agreements, which instead allowed Indonesia to use the ''China card'' to press the United States into deepening military ties, said Ian J. Storey, an expert on Southeast Asian military issues at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore.
Still, Indonesia signaled recently that there were limits to how close it would get to the United States. In September, Mr. Yudhoyono conspicuously skipped a meeting in New York between the United States and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, when Mr. Obama was seeking support in pressing China for a resolution to disputes in the South China Sea. Aides said Mr. Yudhoyono was too busy attending to domestic issues, but his absence was interpreted differently here.
''The Indonesian government felt that the U.S. was putting too much pressure on Indonesia and other Asean nations to choose sides,'' said Syamsul Hadi, a political scientist at the University of Indonesia.

HEADLINE: Obama, in Indonesia, Pledges Expanded Ties With Muslim Nations

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
JAKARTA, Indonesia -- President Obama, renewing his call for better relations between the United States and the Muslim world, used a long-awaited homecoming trip to this island nation to make a symbolic visit on Wednesday morning to the largest mosque in southeast Asia -- even as he declared that ''much more work needs to be done'' to fulfill the promise he made 17 months ago in Cairo of a ''new beginning.''
Indonesia is the world's largest majority Muslim nation, and Mr. Obama, on a 10-day, four-country trip through Asia, used his brief stay here to hold it up as an example of diversity, tolerance and democracy.
He closed his remarks at a news conference on Tuesday evening with the Muslim greeting ''salaam aleikum'' and said he intended to reshape American relations with Muslim nations so they were not ''focused solely on security issues,'' but rather on expanded cooperation across a broad range of areas, from science to education. 
In a speech on Wednesday morning to an enthusiastic audience of 6,500 people at the University of Indonesia, he also harked back to his Cairo message.
''I said then, and I will repeat now, that no single speech can eradicate years of mistrust,'' Mr. Obama said. ''But I believed then, and I believe today, that we do have a choice. We can choose to be defined by our differences, and give in to a future of suspicion and mistrust. Or we can choose to do the hard work of forging common ground, and commit ourselves to the steady pursuit of progress.''
Earlier, at the Istiqlal Mosque, Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, followed the Islamic custom of removing their shoes; Mrs. Obama wore a head shawl with beads. They walked along a courtyard on a pale blue carpet escorted by the grand imam, who told Mr. Obama that there was a church next door and that during Christmas parishioners use the mosque's parking lot because the church does not have enough space.
Mr. Obama turned to reporters and said, ''That is an example of the kind of cooperation'' between religions in Indonesia.
For Mr. Obama, who suffered a backlash at home this year when he said he favored the right of Muslims to build a proposed Islamic center in Lower Manhattan -- and whose personal history makes him the target of anti-Muslim sentiment -- the outreach effort is a delicate one. Jakarta is the place that has given rise to many of the myths about Mr. Obama, including the rumor that he is Muslim (he is Christian); that he attended a madrasa that was connected to radical Islam (he attended two schools here, one Roman Catholic and one secular, although most of the students were Muslim); and that he was not born in the United States (he was born in Hawaii).
In his speech, Mr. Obama tried to correct the misperceptions and he spoke about Indonesia's ability to bridge religious and racial divides. ''As a Christian visiting a mosque on this visit,'' he said, ''I found it in the words of a leader who was asked about my visit and said: 'Muslims are also allowed in churches. We are all God's followers.' ''
The last time Mr. Obama was in Indonesia, in 1992, he spent a month holed up in a rented beachside hut in Bali, where he swam each morning and spent afternoons writing ''Dreams From My Father,'' the memoir that later became a best seller. In it, he shared memories of his life here as a boy, ''running barefoot along a paddy field, with my feet sinking into the cool, wet mud, part of a chain of other brown boys chasing after a tattered kite.''
He has chased after a few other things since then -- notably the presidency -- and when he returned here, he got the kind of rock-star welcome he no longer receives in the United States.
When Air Force One touched down on Tuesday in a typical Jakarta afternoon thunderstorm, a huge cheer went up inside the State Palace complex -- not from average Indonesians, but from the local press corps, watching on television. ''Finally, he arrived!'' exulted Glenn Jos, a cameraman.
After descending the steps of his plane, Mr. Obama, in a dark suit, accompanied by his wife walked the red carpet that had been laid out for them and stepped into a black Cadillac limousine. He poked his head out the door to give a short wave.
''Yes!'' the reporters shouted.
Indonesians have prepared three times previously for a visit from the president, only to be disappointed. Last year, the White House hinted that Mr. Obama might tuck in an Indonesia stop on a November trip to Asia, but it did not materialize.
Then, in March, Mr. Obama, his wife and daughters canceled a trip at the last minute so that he could shepherd his health care bill through Congress. In June, another Indonesia trip was canceled, this time so the president could deal with the BP oil spill.
And once Mr. Obama finally arrived, a cloud of volcanic ash played havoc with his schedule, forcing him to leave a few hours earlier than planned on Wednesday so that he could make it to Seoul, South Korea, to attend the Group of 20 conference of economic powers.
Mr. Obama spent four years, from ages 6 to 10, in Indonesia, living here with his mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, and stepfather, Lolo Soetoro. In his memoir he writes richly of the experience. He described the markets: ''the hawkers, the leather workers, the old women chewing betelnut and swatting flies off their fruit with whisk brooms.''
He wrote of his introduction to the food: ''dog meat (tough), snake meat (tougher), and roasted grasshopper (crunchy).'' And the menagerie in his backyard: ''chickens and ducks running every which way, a big yellow dog with a baleful howl, two birds of paradise, a white cockatoo and finally two baby crocodiles.''
Mr. Obama said Tuesday that he had come to ''focus not on the past but the future,'' but Indonesians seemed to have both in mind. At a state dinner, Mr. Obama was served Indonesian dishes he said he loved as a boy. And in a gesture that Mr. Obama said left him ''deeply moved,'' President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono presented him with a gold medal in honor of his mother, who worked here for years as an anthropologist and pioneer in microcredit for the poor.
Jakarta has undergone a transformation since Mr. Obama first moved here in 1967. The tallest building he remembered, a shopping mall, has been eclipsed by skyscrapers. Mr. Obama recalled riding on ''little taxis, but you stood in the back and it was very crowded'' or on bicycle rickshaws.
''Now,'' he lamented, ''as president I can't even see all the traffic, because they block all the streets.''
At the university, Mr. Obama sprinkled his speech with Indonesian phrases, mimicking the sing-song sounds of street vendors. Then, in this country's native tongue, he said, ''I'm home.''

HEADLINE: Hearst Official to Replace Klein at Helm of N.Y. Schools

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
Joel I. Klein, the New York City schools chancellor, is resigning and leaving city government, and will be replaced by Cathleen P. Black, the chairwoman of Hearst Magazines, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced at City Hall Tuesday afternoon.
Mr. Klein, in turn, will become an executive vice president of the News Corporation.
The mayor called Ms. Black ''a superstar manager who has succeeded spectacularly in the private sector'' and added, ''There's no one who knows more about the skills our children will need to succeed in the 21st century economy.'' A former publisher of New York magazine, she went on to become publisher of USA Today, and now heads Hearst Magazines, which publishes Esquire, Cosmopolitan, Seventeen, Good Housekeeping and other titles. 
The developments appeared to take top Department of Education officials by surprise. One senior staff member said that aides were notified just before the press conference, and that Mr. Klein had not said anything to them about wanting a new job. The staff member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that top aides did not know anything about Ms. Black.
At the news conference, the mayor lauded Mr. Klein, whom he appointed in 2002 after gaining control of the city's schools, for turning ''New York City's long-dysfunctional public school system into one that the Obama administration has hailed as a national model.''
''He leaves a legacy of achievement that makes him one of the most important and transformational educational leaders of our time,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''Joel has implemented innovative changes that have made an enormous difference in the lives of millions of children.''
Ms. Black, 66, said she was ''very excited about this incredible opportunity to make a difference in the lives of our young people'' and take over the nation's largest public school system, with about 1.1 million children, 80,000 teachers and more than 1,400 schools.
''Joel brought incredible commitment and energy to this position,'' Ms. Black said. ''His shoes are very big ones to fill.''
Mr. Klein, 64, said his job at News Corporation would be to develop ''strategy to put them in the education marketplace.'' Mr. Klein, the longest serving chancellor in the school system's history, will stay on until around the end of the year to ease the transition, Mr. Bloomberg said.
A former chief executive of the publishing giant Bertelsmann and head of the antitrust division at the Department of Justice, Mr. Klein was handed the school system in 2002 after Mr. Bloomberg got the state Legislature to give him control of it and brought a corporate, top-down structure to an unwieldy multi-headed bureaucracy where important decisions were often left to dozens of local school boards.
Mr. Klein won praise for imposing order even as he was criticized for shutting parents, teachers, principals and district superintendents out of the planning process. He was at the forefront of the national push to make passing standardized tests a focus of educational policies, and under his guidance the schools achieved historic gains, only to see many of them wiped out when the state determined that the bar for passing had been set too low. He also oversaw large gains in high school graduation rates, SAT participation and college enrollment.
''There are things we could have done better and smarter,'' Mr. Klien said at the news conference, but added, ''I look back with enormous pride on the work that we did do.''
Afterward, he explained the circumstances of his departure and his discussions with the mayor.
''We talked about it, probably three or four months ago,'' he said of Mr. Bloomberg. '' I said to him, I'd see him through the election and I wanted to get things in order here and give you some time.
''His reaction is always sort of been, I signed up for two terms, if this was the right time, that would be fine. He made it clear to me he'd like me to stay on,'' he added. ''I'm 64 years old now and want to have the opportunity to do something new that makes sense. He clearly could not have been more supportive of me or more understanding.
In discussing what people would remember of his tenure, Mr. Klein said, ''People will remember me differently. They will remember me as a man who was committed to changing an educational system that was failing vast numbers of people.''
''I would be the first to say there is much more to do. Someone who did not give into traditional orthodoxy and traditional political paralysis and moved the system at multiple levels,'' he added. ''This was the most comprehensive school reform that has happened in this country.''

HEADLINE: Washington Worries About Its New Power Couple

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- At one of those ritualistic Washington dinners where the commander in chief is expected to perform stand-up comedy, President Obama once noted that he had an affinity for Representative John A. Boehner, the Republican leader.
''After all,'' Mr. Obama joked, ''we have a lot in common. He is a person of color -- although not a color that appears in the natural world.''
The audience roared at the poke at Mr. Boehner's famously perpetual tan, but the line also struck a chord because rarely, in fact, have two men reached the pinnacle in Washington with so little in common. With Mr. Boehner about to become the speaker of the House, the nation's two most powerful leaders open this new era with little connection other than a shared fondness for golf and a weakness for cigarettes.
One is the son of an African exchange student and was raised in the Pacific, educated at Harvard and transplanted to the big city. The other, who was one of 12 children of a Midwestern bar owner, built his own business before becoming a national power broker. The gulf in background, temperament, personality and philosophy make for an uncertain two years as they try to figure out whether they can work together. 
The contrast between the men undercuts the popular comparison to the dynamic in 1994, when the Republicans swept to power and, led by the new speaker, Newt Gingrich, challenged the Democratic president, Bill Clinton. Despite their partisan differences, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gingrich had much in common: both came from broken families in the South, grew up to be professors and ultimately became the political visionaries of their generation. Even as they clashed, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gingrich understood each other in a way that defined the politics of the 1990s.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gingrich could spend hours in policy discussions. In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan and Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. shared evening drinks and Irish storytelling. So far, at least, Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner have spent virtually no time together and have made little effort to forge a bond. Aides said they could not recall a single one-on-one meeting or substantive phone call.
''I'm surprised Obama hasn't done more to develop a relationship with Boehner,'' said Steve Elmendorf, a House Democratic official during the 1990s. ''They both like to play golf. I'd invite him four times a year to play golf. You may not get a lot of big things done, but there's going to be the debt limit, some foreign policy thing. There's going to be times when you're going to need him.''
As a result, it may be hard for Mr. Obama to reach out to the emboldened House Republicans. ''This is the price President Obama is going to pay for a while for completely ignoring the Republican leadership in the House and Senate in the first two years,'' said Rich Galen, a Republican strategist who advised Mr. Gingrich.
Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner seem to have been talking past each other since the election last week, with Mr. Boehner claiming a mandate to reverse administration policies and Mr. Obama claiming a mandate to work together. Mr. Boehner said there is ''some denial'' on the president's part.
Their relationship took root in the early days of the Obama presidency. Mr. Obama agreed to speak to the House Republican caucus a week after taking office, but he bristled when he learned on the way to the Capitol that Mr. Boehner had just came out against his economic stimulus package. ''He went up to consult, and arrived and the jury had voted and the verdict had been delivered,'' said David Axelrod, the president's senior adviser.
That moment stuck with Mr. Obama, who recalls it regularly as proof that Mr. Boehner was not genuinely open to discussion. In the end, Mr. Boehner secured unified Republican opposition to Mr. Obama's priorities in his first two years, including the stimulus, health care and financial regulations.
During the fall campaign, Mr. Obama briefly tried to make Mr. Boehner the face of an obstructionist opposition, hammering him repeatedly by name in a speech in Ohio for promoting ''the same philosophy'' that had failed in the past, one that favored corporations over teachers and the police. Mr. Boehner was equally tough on Mr. Obama, accusing him of writing ''the biggest pork-barrel spending bill in American history.''
Michael Steel, Mr. Boehner's spokesman, said his boss did not take it personally. ''What Boehner would tell you at this point is they have a perfectly cordial relationship, but they haven't done anything substantive together,'' Mr. Steel said. ''It's going to very much depend on the president.''
White House aides took note of Mr. Boehner's postelection language, which was muted in comparison with that from his Senate counterpart, Mitch McConnell, who said his top priority was to make Mr. Obama a one-term president. ''There's an imperative to work together,'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''The president's attitude has always been that he wants to work with whoever wants to work with him.''
Mr. Boehner is not the bomb-thrower that Mr. Gingrich was. He has reached across the aisle, most notably with the Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts on education and charity. Yet the politics of his own caucus make that harder today. When he hinted that he might go along with Mr. Obama's plan to extend Bush-era tax cuts for the middle class and not the wealthy, he was pummeled by fellow Republicans.
Likewise, Mr. Obama is not the gregarious politician that Mr. Clinton was. He does not invite political adversaries, or even political allies, to play golf. ''He doesn't really try to get things done through personal relationships,'' said one Democrat who has worked with him. ''He basically tries to overwhelm you with ideas and wherewithal. He's friends with his friends, and with legislators, he tries to pass laws.''
Terry Holt, a former aide to Mr. Boehner, said the two would have to work to bridge their differences. ''These kinds of relationships just don't pop up out of the air or out of necessity,'' he said. ''They require trust, and they take time. You just don't grow that necessary trust and relationship overnight.''
Mr. Axelrod would not rule out a golf outing between the two, although he noted that Mr. Boehner is a much better player. According to Golf Digest, Mr. Boehner had a 6 handicap; Mr. Obama's is ''higher than that,'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''They may play golf,'' he said. ''I doubt it will be for money.''

HEADLINE: Would the South Really Leave?

BYLINE: JAMIE MALANOWSKI


HIGHLIGHT: In newspaper editorials, the South reacts to Lincoln's election and explores the possibility of secession.

 BODY:
Nov. 11, 1860
With nearly half a year to prepare for the possibility of a Lincoln election, the editorial writers of the South had ample time to sharpen their rhetoric, and the arias of wroth and venom unleashed after last Tuesday's decision proved that those months were not idly spent. 
"If we submit now to Lincoln's election," said the Fayetteville North Carolinian, "your homes will be visited by one of the most fearful and horrible butcheries that has cursed the face of the globe." Said the Richmond Semi-Weekly Examiner, "Here [is] a present, living, mischievous fact. The Government of the Union is in the hands of the avowed enemies of one entire section. It is to be directed in hostility to the property of that section." Added The Atlanta Confederacy, even more emphatically, "Let the consequences be what they may - whether the Potomac is crimsoned in human gore, and Pennsylvania Avenue is paved ten fathoms deep with mangled bodies, or whether the last vestige of human liberty is swept from the face of the American continent, the South will never submit to such humiliation and degradation as the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln." Concluded a pithier Augusta Constitutionalist: "The South should arm at once."
Hot words, those, but in South Carolina, there were even hotter deeds: the day after the election, fire-eaters lowered the Stars and Stripes flying above the state capitol, and raised the Palmetto flag. Three days later, the legislature voted to convene in December to decide whether to secede. Southerners, of course, have called this tune before. They threatened to bolt in 1820, floated the divisive theory of nullification in the 1830s, and angrily convened in Nashville in 1850. (The governor of South Carolina, William Gist, even has a brother whose name is States Rights - yes, his actual name is States Rights Gist - who was born during the nullification crisis; Father Gist was evidently a fervent Calhoun man.) 
Whatever the time and whatever the provocation, the story has always been the same: threats, indignation and outrage, followed in the end by placations from the North and reconciliations that left the South wealthier and the institution of slavery more entrenched. Most assume that past will be prologue. The South seceded last year when the Republicans elected William Pennington as Speaker of the House, jibed pro-Lincoln newspaperman Carl Schurz earlier this year. "The South seceded from Congress, went out, took a drink, and came back. When Old Abe gets elected, they'll go out, and this time they'll take two drinks before they come back."
And yet, this time they might really mean it.
Is it all due to Lincoln? Certainly, but his mere election would incite secession is not so obvious. Though an opponent of slavery, he is measurably more moderate than Senator Seward or Senator Chase, rivals for the nomination whom the Republicans, for all their abolitionist ardor, plainly did not prefer. Nearly a month has passed since Lincoln spoke in public about the issue of slavery, and all he did was repeat that he was constitutionally powerless to interfere with the institution of slavery in any state where it existed. "What is it I could say which would quiet alarm?" said Lincoln, his exasperation evident. "Is it that no interference by the government with slaves or slavery within the states is intended? I have said this so often already that a repetition of it is but mockery."
But to the South, Lincoln is but the tip of the spear. "He rides a wave he cannot control or guide," observes a perceptive editorialist for The Atlanta Daily Constitutionalist, who predicts that Lincoln's "very restraint will give new strength to its pent up fury, and it will carry into the same office, four years hence, a man of more revolutionary ideas." 
Republicans come to Washington not just with an eye to stopping the expansion of slavery. Their program also includes lower tariffs, which will increase the power of Northern manufacturers; support for the railroads, which will lead to the settlement of the West and to the creation of who knows how many anti-slavery states between the Mississippi and the Pacific; and unrestrained immigration. Eighty percent of new arrivals settle in the North, swelling its power with their labor and their votes. The Constitution may prevent the Republicans from abolishing slavery now, but Southerners are concerned that the great unsettled Dakota prairies will be carved into a dozen states that will become full of Republican-loving Italians and Poles and Irishmen and escapees from the revolutions of 1848. See what happens then. 
These developments might sit differently if the South felt weak, but in fact, it feels stronger than ever. Cotton production is at an all-time high; perhaps two billion pounds will be produced this year, enough to account for nearly 60 percent of the country's exports. Almost half the crop will go to England, where a fifth of the population of the world's greatest power works in the textile industry. Two years ago Senator James Hammond of South Carolina proclaimed, "The slaveholding South is now the controlling power of the world." With an increasingly abundant cotton crop earning ever-rising prices, no one down south feels obliged to argue, unless it is with the abolitionist who wishes to cast moral aspersions upon him and deny him the labor force that is the underpinning of this ever-increasing wealth.
And so, inevitably, the South thinks of secession - and expansion. The South has long believed that unless slavery keeps expanding, it will die, and take the slave-holding elite with it. As Senator Jefferson Davis of Mississippi recently said, "We of the South are an agricultural people, and we require an extended territory. Slave labor is a wasteful labor, and it therefore requires a still more extended territory than would the same pursuits if they could be prosecuted by the more economical labor of white men." Limiting slave territory, Davis says, would "crowd upon our soil an overgrown black population, until there would not be room in the country for whites and blacks to subsist in, and in this way. . . reduce the whites to the degraded position of the African race." Oddly, Senator Charles Sumner, the ardent abolitionist from Massachusetts, has in a rather different way reached the same conclusion: limiting slavery will kill slavery. And so the slaveholders seek to expand, although whether they can go further north and west is more than a political question; there is much doubt whether the climate and crops of western America would sustain slavery. But all doubts vanish when they turn their backs to the north, and see rimming the Gulf of Mexico verdant lands that could, and have, enriched slaveholding planters. "To the Southern republic bounded on the north by the Mason and Dixon line and on the south by the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, including Cuba and all the other lands on our southern shore," toasted one Texan at a convention in 1856, and that sentiment burns at the heart of many of the fire-eaters now crying secession. 
Don't forget that not very long ago, such sentiments burned brightly in Washington as well. The Polk and Pierce administrations tried to buy Cuba. Just six years ago, the current president, James Buchanan, who was then Minister to Great Britain, was one of the three authors of the Ostend Manifesto, which maintained that if Spain wouldn't sell us Cuba, we would be justified in seizing it. Accompanying these official efforts were unofficially encouraged forays by slaveholder-supported filibusteros to invade Cuba, foment a rebellion and grab the island on behalf of expansionist-minded southerners. 
Expansionists north and south initially supported John Walker's campaigns to seize control of Nicaragua, but it was the southern expansionists who were his true constituency. The south's moral and financial support sustained Walker when he seized Nicaragua's presidency in 1856, and though he governed only briefly, he managed to re-establish the legality of slavery before a coalition of Central American powers defeated his cholera-ravaged army and sent him scampering. Walker made further attempts to conquer Nicaragua, the last of which ended last September in front of a firing squad in Honduras. But southerners backed every one. 
A mere freebooter, Walker nearly succeeded. The ultras dream of what could be accomplished in Nicaragua, and Cuba and northern Mexico and the West Indies if a cotton-rich American government should seek its destiny in commanding a tropical empire that would dominate the world's supply of not only cotton but the staple of sugar as well. 
So here, then, is the South's choice. Does it select a future in which the southern slavocracy is less powerful; more isolated; consistently subjected to moral castigation by northerners for an economic system that profits not just planters but innumerable northern shippers and insurers and mill owners? Or does the South choose to establish a new nation that will sit at the center of a rich and powerful slaveholding empire that will dominate the hemisphere? 
There are plenty of people in the south who oppose disunion and wish to move slowly or not at all. But most of the South's leadership - its money and its political establishment and its opinion-makers - know that the South is at a crossroads, and they mean for it to choose independence.

HEADLINE: Going Korean

BYLINE: MARY H.K. CHOI


HIGHLIGHT: The perils of getting a pedicure when you're Korean, and 30, and unmarried.

 BODY:
Pedicures are disgraceful.
This is not a diatribe on female grooming rituals. I do not resent the hamster wheel of appearing kempt.
This is not a screed on how getting my toes done prickles my aphenphosmphoboia (fear of being touched) or my podophobia (fear of feet).
This is a story about reluctantly thrusting your feet in the face of an older Korean woman when you are Korean and female yourself. And unmarried. And 30. Also, broke. I'm mortified not by ravaged nail beds or metatarsal smashed by hoofing about in fetching heels, but by an anxiety without a term, a spaghetti of issues I can never untangle.
The thing about Koreans, you see, is that our pecking order is defined by age - which means that, for me, visiting a pedicurist of my same nationality feels like I'm pressing a sawbuck into my boss's palm, winking, then demanding he wax my brows. It is insane. Yet I can't flee once I'm spotted by my assigned technician: every salon in New York has glass doors. Were I to spin on my heel and walk out, refusing to look her in the eye as she glared holes in my profile, the insult would only be magnified. By a factor of 1 million.So I suck it up. A polish color is chosen. I kick off shoes and the tub fills with water that, truthfully, is a touch colder than I'd like. Not that I'd say anything. I soak, peer at the halo of graying roots at the crown of my lady's head and think of my mother. And how mad she'd be if she knew what had reminded me of her. I think about her siblings, who moved to Los Angeles from Seoul, and about how my father's family did not.
I was born in Korea and left before my fist birthday. Still, our crew of four didn't stray too far and my formative years were spent in Hong Kong - a stone's-throw flight away. No part of my immigrant's tale includes a tearful, hard-won homecoming after a lifetime of bereft longing. I saw my extended family every summer. We ate melon popsicles and watched un-subtitled soap operas, many of which do include tearful homecomings and bereft longing. They were unfailingly set against the backdrop of monsoon season, and there was always so much rain.
But even in Hong Kong, that speck of an island that is now a part of ever enormous China, where I palled around with European expatriates, my identity was defined by my not-being-Chinese rather than my being something else that had a name. My specific otherness became even more crowded out when my parents moved us to Texas, a state in which they still live, to attend a high school of 4,000 that was dominated by African-Americans and Mexicans. Asians made up less than 1 percent.
Then came New York: there is a joy to being Korean in New York. Before this, I had always gotten lumped into a murky pan-Asian identity. Here, there are enough of us, my us, that we have our own stereotypes, and I confess that I find their very existence thrilling more than insulting. Among the cliches, of course, is that we dominate certain service industries. But this I can testify is true. "Going to the Korean" is as New York a construct as "coffee; regular." In any tri-borough bodega that carries more than one brand of yogurt, there is perfectly serviceable kimchi, the piquantly pickled Napa cabbage packaged in squat, snap-top plastic tubs and priced (extortionately) by weight. Add in the cost of a 20-minutes-or-more chat, in Korean, with the proprietor.
For those not within a block or two of a good deli, there's a fairly simple recipe for the savory side dish in David Chang's cookbook. Those who have or haven't been to his Momofuku restaurants in Manhattan should know that on the subject of this superstar chef, the Koreans are split. Go figure.
Important taste-buds are dazzled by unctuous Berkshire pork stews accented with the bright, tart, scarlet strands of pickled cabbage. Plenty of people delight in the toothsomeness of roasted glutinousrice cakes complemented by the impossibly green taste of scallions cast in this light. But others of us - or our mothers and aunts - have performed such sleights of hand in our own homes. We know that rice cakes are pre-fabricated and sometimes shipped frozen, and that being heralded for adding kimchi to butter is akin to granting a patent for slicing hot dogs atop blue-box mac-and-cheese. 
Me? I like that our most visible New Yorker can make his mark from the service industry, part of the same algorithm as the bodega owner and the pedicurist. 
In the salon, my foot is tapped, a signal to raise it from the suds, pointed so as not fling droplets, and place it on the padded, towel-covered stirrup. A pumice stone is applied to the heel and ball of each foot. This is where a good-sized fall fashion issue comes in handy. I can hug the magazine instead of squirming. There is another tap. Nails are clipped or filed.
By now, I've already fessed up to speaking Korean, because I'd never want to dupe this woman into freely talking smack in the refuge of my perceived ignorance. But that sets in motion the rapid-fire interrogation that, unlike Monty Python and the Spanish Inquisition, you expect every time. Round after round about my education, my apartment, my job, my man, my decision-making skills.
When among acquaintances and casual friends, I am vigilant to string up white lies like police tape around my personal details. But a nod from any woman born earlier than 1970 on our Asian peninsula flanked by the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea, however, awakens pre-programmed behaviors I can't control. I answer every question to the best of my ability, and make my own polite inquiries, always careful to employ deferential syntax, the doily-lined, dustier version of the language that rarely appears in pop songs or the revenge trilogies I stream from the Internet.
As basecoat, polish and topcoat are daubed on, the pedicurist asks me if I brown-bag or buy lunch. I know the right answer but respond honestly and am berated while I crunch the economies of scale were I to make absolutely everything myself. I wonder about this woman's kitchen skills, about the japchae she makes or her jigae. If I were to make kimchi in my apartment with its white floors, it would resemble a murder scene.
At this point, I am held hostage not by the tyranny of manners but by 10 little canvases of wet paint. I'll have abandoned the notion of getting a manicure. It's too ambitious and my nerves are jangled. Plus, this frees my hands to ring my mother. With whom I promptly pick a fight to defuse some of the tension. But I do it quietly, obviously, since I'm surrounded by Korean women and I'm confident they'd take her side. Perhaps there'll be a good cry in it for us. And longing. Maybe some rain.

HEADLINE: In the Case of a Terrier, 'No Pets Allowed' Is Overruled

BYLINE: ANDY NEWMAN


HIGHLIGHT: When it comes to pets and apartments, rules are rules. Except when they aren't.

 BODY:
Charlie the teacup Yorkshire terrier can stay.
So says an appellate court in the case of a woman who kept a three-and-a-half-pound dog in her condominium in Middle Village, Queens, in open defiance of the condo board's "House Rule No. 1," which states, seemingly unambiguously, "Positively no pets are allowed in the building for any reason."
In 2007, Donata Forman, a letter carrier, brought Charlie home to Apartment 3D of the Village View Condominium at 66-15 69th Street, where she had lived since 2000. 
The situation was already fraught. Ms. Forman had kept a dog named Rugby, also in violation of building rules, who had recently died. She asked the board for permission to get a replacement dog. Permission was denied. Ms. Forman brought Charlie home anyway. The board demanded his ouster. Papers were filed.
Other than the board, Charlie did not bother anyone. 
"It is undisputed that the defendant transports the dog through the common areas of the condominium in a shoulder bag, and the Board has conceded that no one outside of the defendant's apartment has heard the dog bark when he is inside the apartment," the four-judge panel of the appellate division of State Supreme Court noted in its decision. 
"He's not one of those yapping little dogs," Ms. Forman told the New York Law Journal, which reported the case Wednesday morning. "I would get rid of him if he was."
Still, the board pressed for removal.
But Ms. Forman's lawyer, Michael A. Mauro, argued that Rule No. 1 was unenforceable. The appellate panel agreed. Condominiums, the judges noted, are governed by their bylaws, and at Village View, changes to the bylaws must be approved by 80 percent of the unit owners. The no-pets rule was imposed by the board without the owners' approval, the judges wrote, therefore it is invalid.
A lawyer for Village View did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
The Charlie decision comes nipping at the heels, more or less, of another dog-related decision in favor of a resident, in the Bronx, in which a tenant being seen entering an apartment with a dog was not considered sufficient proof that the tenants kept a dog.
In that decision, the landlords at 1514 Townsend Avenue in Mount Eden had tried to evict Aida Correa after, according to court papers, the super saw her son "walking into the subject premises with a dog, which upon information and belief, is believed to be white and brown in color and is believed to be a beagle." The landlords noted that tenants were not allowed to have "kept or harbored a dog."
A Civil Court judge, however, ruled last month that one sighting does not a harborage make, noting that harbor means "to give shelter or refuge to" or "to be the home or habitat of."
"The sole allegation of a dog being seen entering the apartment on one occasion is not sufficient to support a claim of a substantial breach of the terms of the lease herein," Judge Verna L. Saunders ruled.

HEADLINE: The Ritholtz Uncertainty Principle

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Do markets really hate uncertainty? The stock market doesn't seem to suggest so.

 BODY:
Barry Ritholtz has a nice column on Bloomberg:"The markets hate uncertainty."...
The problem with these supposed truisms is they are no more accurate than the flip of a coin. A closer look at this uncertainty meme reveals it to be a false-ism -- one of those emotionally appealing phrases that ping around trading desks. The lack of evidence supporting their premise seems to matter very little....
When we discuss uncertainty, what we are really discussing is risk. All unknown outcomes contain risk, and therein lies the possibility of loss. Risk is inherent in the concept of uncertainty. However, anyone looking for performance must embrace risk, for without it, there can be no reward.
Uncertainty is what makes alpha, or market-beating gains, possible. Smart traders know that uncertainty is where the money is. No uncertainty, no risk; no risk, no possibility of outperformance.
Since July, when the Era of Uncertainty began, the Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index -- those businesses most closely tied to this uncertain economy -- is up 26 percent.
Want some certainty? Go buy yourself Treasuries. You can pick up a very lovely two-year bond yielding 0.41 percent. (Good luck charging two and 20 on that!)The unusual degree of uncertainty about the economy's health in the aftermath of a financial crisis really is a problem for business trying to decide whether to expand -- and, by extension, for workers waiting to get hired. But Mr. Ritholtz makes a fine point here. Uncertainty benefits many investors. Since the stock market hit its low point on March 9, 2009, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up almost 80 percent.

HEADLINE: Judge Rebukes State Agency Over Atlantic Yards Timetable

BYLINE: ANDY NEWMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A judge finds that agency made "totally incomplete representations" regarding the length of time it would take to build the Brooklyn project.

 BODY:
It comes too late to halt construction, but a judge has issued a stinging rebuke to the state agency overseeing the $5 billion Atlantic Yards project in Brooklyn, finding that it made "totally incomplete representations" in legal papers about how long it would take the project to get built, in "what appears to be yet another failure of transparency." 
The judge, Marcy S. Friedman of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, ordered the agency, the Empire State Development Corporation, to justify its decision to require only a 10-year environmental impact statement. The agency's own agreement with the developer, Forest City Ratner, allows 25 years for construction of the project, which includes a basketball arena, currently being built, and 16 residential and commercial towers. Forest City Ratner officials have acknowledged that the 10-year timetable was a best-case scenario.
The ruling, reported by Atlantic Yards Report, came in a challenge by opponents of the project to the agency's approval of Forest City Ratner's plan.
Justice Friedman wrote that if the agency concludes that a 10-year timetable continues to be reasonable "and that it need not examine environmental impacts of construction over a 25-year period on neighborhood character, air quality, noise and traffic, among other issues, then it must expressly make such findings and provide a detailed, reasoned basis for the findings."

HEADLINE: Other Cities Eye Green Carts

BYLINE: STEPHANIE STROM


HIGHLIGHT: Philadelphia and Chicago have been eying New York's vegetable and fruit cart program.

 BODY:
Every philanthropist dreams of financing a model program that proves successful enough that others want to replicate it.
But Laurie M. Tisch had no idea that she would pave the way for other cities when she offered to donate $250,000 to help get a nutrition program off the ground.
Ms. Tisch, daughter of Preston Robert Tisch, who together with his brother Laurence, built the Loews Corporation, had just started a new foundation, the Illumination Fund, when she got a call from the mayor's office asking her to attend a news conference about regulating food carts in the city.
Almost two years and $1.5 million later, the NYC Green Carts program is attracting attention from other philanthropists and food organizations. Even the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation considered it as a potential economic stimulus program in Philadelphia.
"It's attractive because of the success it has on multiple levels," said Jim Slama, president of FamilyFarmed.org, which works to expand the production and distribution of locally grown foods in the Chicago area. "Not only does it address the problem of food access successfully, its success in stimulating economic development and job creation has been significant."
Fitting Green Carts into a Chicago setting, however, is challenging. Street food is not a part of Chicago's culture the way it is in New York or Los Angeles, in large part because the city has tough rules on regulating the sale of food on its streets. "The bottom line is that there are enough regulatory issues that the city would have to be a major stakeholder before anything could even begin to happen," Mr. Slama said.
For that reason, his organization is looking into permutations of the street cart model, like the installation of kiosks in corner stores that could be replenished every day.

HEADLINE: Liars' Club

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: The G.O.P.'s success may depend on how the party handles its fact-challenged members.

 BODY:
If common sense were currency Michele Bachmann would be broke, and holding a tin can by the roadside just now. Alas, because we live in an age where hyperbole is gold, Bachmann is rich. 
She was on CNN the other day, a rare departure from the in-house fawning of Fox "News," expressing outrage that President Obama's trip to India was going to cost $200 million a day and involve nearly three dozen warships.
Anderson Cooper did what no Fox host would ever do: he asked the preternaturally nutty congresswoman from Minnesota where she got her figures, suggesting that "this idea that it's $200 million or whatever is simply made up."
In fact, it was made up. The White House said it was preposterous, and a Pentagon spokesman called the warship claim "absolutely absurd" and "comical." What happened next was encouraging to everyone in the reality-based community. The emerging Republican leadership indicated they may snub Bachmann in her attempt to join the major players who will guide G.O.P. policy in the House.Now that they have to govern, Republicans are grappling with a tough initial challenge: how to detach themselves from an influential wing of their party that has never been interested in arguing facts. On a daily basis, these people bemoan, detest and feign outrage over utter fantasies. Some of the loudest voices are elected representatives; others are professional provocateurs interested in keeping their lecture fees high and their base in a lather.
Bachmann's disastrous turn outside the Fox bubble was instructive, for it showed how the liars' club works. The $200 million figure originated in India, attributed to an anonymous foreign bureaucrat, and quickly went to the Drudge Report. On Fox and Rush Limbaugh's radio rant, the absurdity that the United States would spend more on a presidential trip than the daily cost to prosecute the Afghanistan war quickly became gospel. Did these people ever call the White House or the Pentagon to check the facts before going ballistic? Perish the thought. 
Glenn Beck went nuts (a redundancy). And while acknowledging that he didn't know if the figures were accurate, he felt comfortable enough to cite "a report that has made the rounds on the Internet." A commentator on Fox business "news" and the Republican fundraiser and Fox host Sean Hannity followed their scripts and Beck. 
But this particular lie prompted a minor civil conflict in Rupert Murdoch's empire. The Murdoch employee Mike Huckabee challenged fellow Murdoch employees on their outrage over a made-up figure. 
At the same time, The Wall Street Journal, Murdoch's crown jewel, went after another Murdoch employee, Sarah Palin, on one of her errors, which appear on a regular basis from her Twitter feed or in speeches. Palin attacked the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, which is about as far over her head as she ever wants to get, and showed profound ignorance on inflation. She said anyone who'd gone shopping lately would know that "grocery prices have risen significantly over the past year." A Journal blogger then noted that food and beverage inflation was practically nonexistent for the past year - the lowest on record - and that Palin was having some trouble with reading comprehension. 
Huckabee wants to be president, and to be taken seriously. The Wall Street Journal needs credibility on basic economic facts in order to survive. And that takes us to the incoming Republican leadership, which will succeed or fail based on whether they are able to legislate with the truth in mind, or follow the crazies. 
Republicans caught a break when Sharron Angle lost her bid to unseat Senator Harry Reid of Nevada. Angle's most preposterous claim was that Shariah, or Islamic law, existed in the good old U.S. of A. Why, just now, two cities - Dearborn, Mich., and Frankford, Tex. - were under the dreaded jihadist rule, she said. 
"I don't know how that happened in the United States," said Angle. Nor does anyone else, because it didn't happen, and couldn't under our Constitution, which separates church (and mosque) from state. Frankford no longer exists as a town, though a reporter for CNN did find a small church and a cemetery within its confines. The mayor of Dearborn, Jack O'Reilly, said Muslims and Christians have been living peacefully with each other for decades. 
Would it surprise you that Palin was Angle's most prominent supporter? And that Palin's other big political pick in the Southwest was Arizona's Gov. Jan Brewer, who famously claimed that "our law enforcement agencies have found bodies in the desert, either buried or just lying out there, that have been beheaded." Sounds like Shariah again. Except in this case the lie was used to make people afraid of Mexicans. Brewer finally backed off when she was unable to cite a single instance of a headless body in the treeless desert.
Palin no longer has to govern, since quitting halfway through her term in Alaska. Relying on her singular, God-given inability to properly digest facts, she's free to make stuff up without consequence. She was awarded the 2009 "lie of the year" by Politifact.com for inventing "death panels" in the health care bill. That site, along with factcheck.org, attempt to referee the whoppers in public policy debates, and are worth a visit for anyone trying to follow the news. But they hardly seem to matter to Palin.
Other Republicans, as they move legislation through Congress, will be held to higher standards. Is global warming real? Will extending tax cuts on the richest two percent dramatically increase the deficit? Is the surge in Afghanistan doing any good, or just prolonging a winless war? Big questions, big issues. Keeping Bachmann isolated in the make-believe studios of Fox would be a good start.

HEADLINE: For Morgan Stanley C.F.O., a Hard Road Ahead

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG


HIGHLIGHT: Ruth Porat is trying to excel not only during difficult times for Morgan Stanley, but also in the face of a terrible track record for top women on Wall Street.

 BODY:
Ruth M. Porat has a knack for escaping unscathed from tough situations.
She joined Morgan Stanley in 1987 just before the stock market crash yet managed to hang onto her job. During the Internet boom she was a technology banker. When that sector blew up she reinvented herself, eventually becoming a financial services banker. The banking industry almost collapsed in 2008, but Ms. Porat's star has continued to rise.
Today, as chief financial officer of Morgan Stanley and being among the highest-ranking women on Wall Street, her survivor skills will come in handy. She is trying to excel not only during difficult times for Morgan Stanley, but also in the face of a horrible track record of women who have made it this far, only to stumble.
"The chief financial role at a global investment bank is an incredibly challenging job; you have to know everything about everything," said Glenn Schorr, an analyst with Nomura.
In Ms. Porat's case, she is often reminded about recent Wall Street history. "Be careful in everything you do, because we all know how this ended before," another stock analyst told her at a cocktail party earlier this year on the 41st floor of Morgan's Stanley's headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, according to attendees.
The comment was a not so subtle reference to the last two female chief financial officers on Wall Street: Erin Callan at Lehman Brothers and Sallie L. Krawcheck at Citigroup. Ms. Callan resigned from Lehman just months before it filed for bankruptcy and is now under investigation by regulators. Ms. Krawcheck struggled as chief financial officer at Citigroup and was publicly demoted in early 2007. (She has since rebounded at Bank of America.)
Morgan Stanley offers another reminder: Its former co-president, Zoe Cruz, was one of the earliest casualties of the credit crisis.
Any chief financial officer - male or female - would be facing challenges at Morgan Stanley at the moment. The firm, under its chief executive, James P. Gorman, is trying to transform itself into more of a steady producer than an investment bank susceptible to swings in the market. The transition has been rough sledding: Morgan Stanley had a net loss of $91 million in the third quarter.
The stock has fallen 11 percent so far this year, compared with a flat performance for its chief rival, Goldman Sachs. Some shareholders have been grumbling that Morgan Stanley's turnaround is taking too long. And there has been a noticeable turnover in the share base this year.
For instance, the mutual fund giant Fidelity has recently reduced its stake in a number of firms, according to regulatory filings, but in percentage terms its selling in Morgan is larger than other reductions.
A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman says that other big investors, including Fairholme Capital Management, have been buying the firm's shares.
Until her promotion to chief financial officer, Ms. Porat, 52, was best known as the banker who had been tapped to advise the Treasury Department on the takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. She has kept an intentionally low profile since January and declined to be interviewed for this article.
Ms. Porat is not an accountant and had never worked in the finance department. She has an economics degree from Stanford and a master's degree in business administration from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. She joined Morgan Stanley in 1987.
Six years later, however, she quit to follow the well-known Morgan Stanley banker Robert F. Greenhill to Smith Barney. In a 2009 book titled "How Remarkable Women Lead," she said she regretted the move immediately.
"Oh my God, I've completely messed up my career," she said to herself upon landing there, according to the book. "I want to go back and I won't have that option."
She did go back, in 1996, but was forced to take a demotion as part of the deal. In 2000, she went to London to lead Morgan Stanley's technology banking team there. Ms. Porat helped take some of the era's biggest names public, including Amazon and Priceline.
During the tech bubble Ms. Porat aligned herself with Mary Meeker, the influential technology analyst. Morgan Stanley, largely through Ms. Porat and Ms. Meeker, vetted more than 750 Internet-related public offerings from 1995 to 2001. In that period, Morgan served as the primary manager on 50 of 597 Internet companies that eventually did go public.
"She is the best banker I have worked with since Quattrone, and while Frank has the tech relationship edge, Ruth has the creative edge," wrote Ms. Meeker in her 1999 performance review, released in 2003 as part of a regulatory inquiry.
Mr. Quattrone is perhaps the dot-com era's best-known deal maker, whose career stalled temporarily while he successfully fought civil and criminal charges. He has since started Qatalyst Partners, which has been a busy adviser in a number of tech deals this year.
She soon faced another challenge: In 2001 she was given a diagnosis of breast cancer. She moved back to America for treatment.
Colleagues say Ms. Porat is a tireless worker. In 1992, during the birth of her first son, she was on the phone in the delivery room making client calls. And in her spare time she, along with her husband, a lawyer, renovate and sell New York City apartments.
Ms. Meeker, the godmother to each of Ms. Porat's three sons, remembers one meeting with management at the media company Ziff Davis where Ms. Porat threw her back out. "Instead of leaving she laid on the boardroom table and continued on with the presentation," Ms. Meeker said.
She has been known to go out on a limb for clients; in 2004 she wrote a letter to the court in support of a client and friend, Martha Stewart. That year Ms. Stewart was sentenced to five months in prison after she was convicted of lying to authorities about her 2001 sale of about 4,000 shares of ImClone Systems.
But at times Ms. Porat got caught up the euphoria of the Internet bubble, some co-workers say. In 1999, at a dinner with senior Morgan executives, she and Ms. Meeker tried to convince top brass to buy the brokerage house Charles Schwab; its stock had soared during the Internet boom.
Ms. Meeker says there were a number of strategic ideas discussed at the meeting, including a possible acquisition of Schwab by Morgan, but no one "was pounding the table" for such a deal to take place. "However, of the available options, it was the most interesting," she added.
After the tech wreck, Ms. Porat began banking more blue-chip companies, and assisted in the initial public offering of a General Electric subsidiary, Genworth Financial Inc. The next year she learned her cancer was back, and underwent treatment again. In 2006 she was tapped to run the financial institutions group, and help take public a number of companies, including the private equity firm Blackstone Group.
Tony James, president of Blackstone, said Ms. Porat was available at all hours to handle issues. "She never makes you feel like you are disturbing her personal life; I don't even know if she has one."
He said that unlike many bankers, she was able to quickly tap resources from all corners of Morgan. For instance, she arranged for Mr. Gorman, then head of strategy for Morgan, to speak to Blackstone executives about what it was like to be a public company. "I would never have even known to have asked for that," he said.
In 2008, she and a fellow Morgan banker, Robert Scully, landed one of the most prestigious assignments of the credit crisis, advising the Treasury Department on the takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Lee Sachs, a former senior Treasury worker, dealt frequently with Ms. Porat, saying she had a "recognition and understanding of the public policy and political implications, positive and negative, of various courses of action."
Still, Mr. James of Blackstone said he was surprised when he heard that Ms. Porat had been appointed chief financial officer. 
"She went from a client-facing job into a job which is totally internal facing and is quite technical," he said. "And beyond that she moved from a role that involved managing one or two people to thousands of people. It was a huge change, and I like Ruth so I wanted it to work out, but I wondered if it would, but so far it seems to be."

HEADLINE: Letting the Estate Tax Die

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: The federal estate tax is extreme in the size of its exemptions and its marginal tax rates and could be replaced by a tiny increase in payroll or income taxes, an economist writes.

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago.
The Obama administration's proposal for the estate tax has all of the ingredients of a damaging tax - large exemptions and loopholes, confiscatory marginal tax rates and little revenue potential. The best reason for having such a tax, if there is one, is to tap into any punish-the-rich sentiment that may be in the electorate.
The Obama administration has proposed an estate tax for 2011 and later years that is much like the one that was in place before to 2010. Writing in favor of the proposal, Prof. Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago acknowledged that the marginal estate tax rate "sounds high, almost confiscatory." He then notes the $7 million exemption available last year, says that with it in place only 3 estates in 1,000 would have to pay an estate tax and adds that those with big-enough estates could afford a good lawyer to help them further increase the effective size of their exemption.
But the huge potential for avoidance behavior is exactly why the proposal is so damaging from an economic point of view.
Taxes affect behavior, because taxpayers take stepse dollar from a to pay less tax. As a result, every tax dollar brought into the public treasuries harms the private sector more than a dollar, and the amount of extra harm depends on the marginal tax rate. (That's not to say that taxation ought to be zero -- the private sector could benefit much more than ondollar of government spending.)
Telephone-service taxes offer an example of a basic principle that applies to taxes on estates and just about everything else: the higher the rate of taxation, the more households and businesses that take steps to reduce their tax liability.Consider a business with, say, 1,000 telephone calls a day and no telephone tax. If the government began to assess a penny tax on each call the business pays for -- outgoing, incoming 800 and collect calls -- and the business did nothing in response, the business would owe $10 a day in telephone tax.
But the business would probably consider alternative means of communicating with customers and suppliers and might soon no longer have 1,000 calls a day. It might, for example, switch some or all of its calling to an Internet-based system. Or it might give customers additional incentives to place orders or make inquiries on its Web site, rather than call using its toll-free number.
These actions might reduce taxed calling to, say, 800 a day, from 1,000, and thereby reduce the telephone tax bill by $2 a day (see the middle column of the table below). But those actions would be costly to other parts of the business; some customers might be lost because they were not called, or revenue might be reduced through the incentives given to get customers to use the Web. Those additional costs would be roughly $1 a day.
Ultimately this telephone tax brings $8 a day to the public treasury, but it costs the company $9: $8 sent to the treasury and $1 in tax-avoidance behavior. The taxpayer is harmed more than the amount received by the public treasury, because the taxpayer took costly actions to make sure that the tax liability was not even higher.
Economists agree that taxes have an excess burden beyond the revenue surrendered to the treasury by taxpayers, even if they do not agree about the exact amounts. Examples of excess burdens include health insurance plans that are excessively expensive in part because of their special personal income tax treatment, and corporate debt burdens that are excessive in part because of the special treatment of interest payments by the corporate tax.
All together, the excess burden of taxes in the United States is more than a trillion dollars a year. Of course, government spending may have great benefits, and that spending would be worthwhile if it exceeded all of the costs to the taxpayer (namely, the taxes they pay and the excess burden they bear).
With the telephone tax, the amount by which calling is reduced by a tax, and thereby the excess burden of that tax, depends on the rate of taxation on those last 200 calls: a penny a call in my example.
This business propensity to avoid the tax by seeking other communication means would be the same if the tax law provided a tax exemption for the first, say, 400 calls a day, because reducing calls from 1,000 to 800 would still result in a tax saving of $2 per day. The only difference is that public treasury would get less revenue with the tax exemption in place: $4 per day rather than $8. And the tax exemption means that each $8 brought the treasury costs the taxpayer $10 rather than $9 (with the exemption it takes two days to get $8 in revenue, rather than one day).
So tax exemptions and other loopholes reduce revenue collected without necessarily affecting the marginal tax rate. In this way, tax exemptions and loopholes raise the excess burden per dollar of revenue and thereby the ultimate cost to taxpayers of bringing any given amount of revenue into the Treasury.
Economists' opinions on tax exemptions and loopholes generally derive from the arithmetic of excess burdens. Exemptions and loopholes raise the marginal tax rates - the creators of excess burden - required to maintain treasury revenue. So if you want the government to get its revenue with a minimum of economic harm, smaller exemptions, loopholes and marginal tax rates are the way to go.
The federal estate tax -- sometimes called the "death tax" by its critics -- is remarkably extreme in terms of the size of its exemptions and marginal tax rates. The estate tax brings in only about $20 billion a year (with no revenue this year) despite marginal tax rates that have varied from 45 to 55 percent, because of its large exemptions and many loopholes. And some of its excess burdens are evident: an entire estate-planning industry would be largely unnecessary if marginal estate-tax rates weren't so high. Planning is part of the reason that many estates do not pay tax, and planning is part of the excess burden.
Alternatives to President Obama's plan include elimination of the estate tax, sharply reducing its rates or integrating it with the capital-gains part of the personal income tax. If necessary, the small revenue loss could be recovered with a tiny increase in the rates of a broader-based tax, like the taxes on payroll or personal income.
Professor Thaler explained how that eliminating the estate tax would "make sure heiresses like Paris Hilton have the proper attire for trips to St.-Tropez." I agree that the estate tax's best attributes do not derive from economic efficiency, but rather its contribution to the sport of envying some of the love-to-hate members of America's rich.

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Issues Guidance on New Emissions Rules

BYLINE: JOHN M. BRODER


HIGHLIGHT: Cost and technical feasibility will be considered in requiring changes to plants' operations, the agency says.

 BODY:
Seeking to reassure major power plant and factory owners that impending regulation of climate-altering gases will not be too burdensome, the Environmental Protection Agency emphasized on Wednesday that future permitting decisions would take cost and technical feasibility into account.
Industry groups have argued that meeting the new requirements will be so costly and time-consuming that they constitute a de facto moratorium on construction of new plants or major expansions of existing ones.
The new guidance allows for the substitution of biomass - wood waste, switchgrass or other agricultural products - for fossil fuels as a way to meet the new air quality rules. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said that would generate new income opportunities for American farmers and forestry companies while reducing global warming emissions.
Environmental advocates generally praised the new guidance because it allows companies and states flexibility in meeting the new greenhouse gas standards.
"Energy efficiency is one of the best ways to reduce pollution and save money, particularly in the manufacturing sector," said Mark MacLeod, director of special projects at Environmental Defense Fund. "Today's guidance will prepare companies for the permitting process and help them find ways to cut pollution while saving money for themselves and their customers."
William Becker, executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies, a collection of state air pollution regulators, said in a statement: "E.P.A.'s guidance will provide industry greater certainty, quicker permitting decisions and a smoother path toward greenhouse gas implementation. This should put to rest the exaggerated claims of some stakeholders that greenhouse gas permitting will have disastrous economic consequences." 
"The E.P.A. is railroading job killing regulations onto states, localities and America's businesses, during a time of uncertain economic recovery, without giving those affected adequate time to review, provide comments, or even implement the new regulations," said Howard Feldman, the oil lobby's director of regulatory and scientific affairs. "EPA's regulations take effect January 2, 2011, but it's already November and EPA is just now releasing guidance documents for permitting."
Mr. Feldman added that President Obama had said that he would rather see legislation setting limits on greenhouse gases than have the executive branch impose regulations. "There is consensus among many people, including President Obama, that E.P.A.'s regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act may not be the proper path forward for climate change policy. Many governors around the country have expressed alarm about the consequences of this regulation on the economy and jobs given the current economic environment."
Senator James Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, also blasted the new guidance requiring companies to adopt the "best available control technology," or BACT. 
"Employers were looking for a clear path forward that would inspire confidence that permits would be granted, and in a timely manner. They won't find it here," said Senator Inhofe, the most outspoken climate change skeptic in Congress. 
"Make no mistake: this is an important part of the Obama Administration's backdoor cap-and-trade agenda, which seeks to impose the very rules and regulations that will make electricity more expensive, jobs more scarce, and keep the economy mired in stagnation," he added. "And these are the very rules and regulations that can't pass Congress, and that the voters, especially those most impacted by them, resoundingly rejected." 
Senator Jay Rockefeller, Democrat of West Virginia, also criticized the E.P.A. move, saying that it gave companies too little time to comply and too little certainty about how to obtain permits.
"Such an unstable regulatory environment prevents companies from making long range investment decisions that will put West Virginians back to work," Mr. Rockefeller said. "That is why the Senate needs to pass my legislation to suspend E.P.A.'s ability to regulate greenhouse gases."

HEADLINE: A Girl, a School and Hope

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
Given today's economic difficulties, I thought I'd come to Pakistan to find Osama bin Laden, lug him back home in my duffel bag and declare him at American customs to pick up the $27 million reward.
More on that mission in a moment. First, another conundrum here in Pakistan: 
The United States has provided $18 billion to Pakistan in aid since 9/11, yet Pakistan's government shelters the Afghan Taliban as it kills American soldiers and drains the American Treasury. Meanwhile, only 8 percent of Pakistanis have confidence in President Obama, according to the Pew Research Center. That's not even half as many as express confidence in bin Laden.
Meanwhile, Pakistan seeks postflood aid from Western taxpayers, yet barely taxes its own affluent citizens at home. And its feudal landholders have historically opposed good schools, for fear that poor Pakistanis -- if educated -- would object to oppression.
One reason Pakistan is sometimes called the most dangerous country in the world is this: a kindergarten child in this country has only a 1 percent chance of reaching the 12th grade, according to the Pakistan Education Task Force, an official panel. The average Pakistani child is significantly less likely to be schooled than the average child in sub-Saharan Africa.
American myopia historically has played a role. We've propped up generals but not the lawyers' movement for democracy. We've allocated billions of dollars for Pakistan's army but not for schools. And the U.S. has never been willing to take the single most important step: open our markets wide to Pakistani garment exports, so as to provide jobs and strengthen the business sector.
Now let's break for a ray of hope.
This is my first trip to Pakistan in years in which the country's downhill slide seems to have been arrested -- and that's notwithstanding the floods that ravaged the country recently.
It helps that the United States has approved the Kerry-Lugar-Berman package to provide civilian aid, earning the U.S. a dose of goodwill in Pakistan. But most important, members of Pakistan's emerging middle class are stepping up to the plate.
They are enraged at the terrorists who have been tearing apart their country, they're appalled by corruption and illiteracy, and they want peace so that their children can become educated and live a better life. Their obsession is college, not Kashmir.
Partly because of middle-class influence, ordinary Pakistanis are increasingly focused on education. About one-fourth of Pakistani children, even from poor families, now attend private schools, simply because the public schools are so wretched.
These days the middle class is not only eclipsing the feudal landowners but also rejects the old feudal contempt for the masses. One reflection of the middle-class engagement is the rise of the Citizens Foundation, a terrific aid group started by a group of businessmen frustrated by their country's appalling schools.
Today, T.C.F. runs 660 excellent schools for the poorest citizens. I visited several of these schools on this trip -- and, wow!
T.C.F. spends 40 percent less per pupil than state schools do, but manages to provide incomparably better education. Here in the most-populous province of Punjab, for example, nearly 100 percent of Citizens Foundation pupils pass government exams, while over the last four years state schools have averaged a 44 percent pass rate.
The most inspiring Pakistani I met on this trip wasn't a prominent official but a 17-year-old girl.
Zahida Sardar, an ebullient teenager with braids and a radiant smile, used to languish in an execrable state school in Minhala outside Lahore. ''A teacher might come only twice a month,'' Zahida recalled.
In such a school, Zahida despaired that she would have no chance to become a doctor or teacher. She began to pester her parents to send her to a T.C.F. school so she could actually get an education, but her parents are illiterate and worried about school fees.
''My father said, 'I'm not going to pay. Why should we spend money on education?' '' Zahida recalled. So Zahida tormented her mother, begging her just to find out if a transfer might be possible.
''For three months, I pestered and insisted,'' Zahida recalled. She tried everything she could think of, including a daily torrent of tears.
I met Zahida's mother, Sardara, who told me that the girl was impossible and just wouldn't take a ''no.'' ''She just wore me down,'' Sardara said. Timidly, Sardara visited the T.C.F. school, and the principal agreed to test Zahida and, when she performed brilliantly, accept her at much reduced fees of 50 cents a month.
So Zahida is now is a star in the 11th grade -- speaking to me comfortably in English.
Oh, and bin Laden? Well, maybe I'll get lucky on my next trip. But in Zahida and other educated young Pakistanis, I've found those who will vanquish him.

HEADLINE: Countries See Hazards In Free Flow Of Capital

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
LONDON -- In China and Taiwan, regulators are imposing fresh restrictions on stock market investments by foreigners. In Brazil, officials have twice raised taxes on foreign investors. Even in South Korea, host to this week's Group of 20 meeting, pressure is building on the government to take similar steps.
As the leaders of the 20 major economic powers gather in Seoul, an increasing number of them have either imposed curbs or are in the process of doing so to slow the torrent of hot money into their markets. 
Over the years, foreign capital flowing into emerging markets has played a crucial role in helping finance roads in India, factories in China and buyers of luxury cars in Brazil.
But as the sums have compounded and led to more market volatility, fast-growing countries have begun to worry that short-term investment will push up the value of their currencies, make their goods less competitive in the global market, and lead to asset bubbles that will be painful to deflate.
Once a core policy commandment of the so-called Washington consensus and held dear by the United States Treasury, the International Monetary Fund and global investment banks, the belief that unfettered capital flows are a boon for everyone -- including the country on the receiving end -- has been dealt a major blow.
Short-term investment is now increasingly viewed as something that needs to be controlled.
''The world has learned about the perils of free market finance -- global financial liberalization just does not work as advertised,'' said Dani Rodrik, a political economy professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. ''Just as John Maynard Keynes said in 1945 -- capital controls are now orthodox.''
Still, the risk remains that as capital controls are adopted by more countries, a result will be a series of competitive devaluations, which could drive away overseas investors and lead to a rout of once-buoyant stock markets.
Many countries are discussing additional steps because they fear that the Federal Reserve's latest bid to revive the United States economy by pumping an additional $600 billion into the banking system will further weaken the dollar and send more money into fast-growing markets.
The latest restrictions are as various as taxes on bond and equity flows and extended rules on how quickly short-term capital may be repatriated.
Emerging markets have been grappling all year with the consequences of a flight of investor capital from rock-bottom interest rates in Western countries in search of higher yields. Short-term capital investment in emerging markets -- largely in stock markets, which are at an all-time high -- is expected to hit $458 billion this year, the highest figure since 2007 when $784 billion flowed into these markets, according to the Institute of International Finance.
Abandoning its earlier stand, the I.M.F. now recognizes capital controls as a viable policy tool. Likewise, the United States has expressed sympathy and support for the actions taken by countries with overvalued currencies, like Brazil.
''Capital controls are now part of the emerging-market investor consensus,'' said Gary N. Kleiman of Kleiman International, an emerging-markets consulting firm based in Washington. ''But if there is ever a correction, you will get a harsher view.''
Under what conditions countries should impose controls on investment is a matter of some dispute. The United States, with its big budget deficit, aggressive monetary easing and weakening currency, may struggle to be the arbiter.
A new study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics offers a suggestion. It argues that policy makers need to distinguish between types of capital controls. There are the ones deployed by countries like China and a few other Asian export powerhouses intended to keep their currencies artificially low. They contrast with those being applied by Brazil and others that are intended to avoid asset bubbles and prevent their currencies from rising too quickly.
China, which the authors estimate encourages its renminbi to remain at least 20 percent undervalued against the dollar, and Singapore, where the undervaluation is even steeper at 33 percent, are ''violating their international obligation'' to avoid competitive devaluations, the institute concluded.
As for fast-growing economies like Brazil and Turkey, where currencies are now overvalued against the dollar by an estimated 9 percent and 16 percent, respectively, the paper concludes that they are justified in raising selective barriers.
What gives the study an extra bite is that one of its authors is John Williamson, an international economist who conceived the original notion of the Washington consensus in 1989.
Broadly defined, that long-held view was that developing nations must absorb 10 policies, like balancing their budgets, privatizing state-owned enterprises and opening their markets to foreign investors, to achieve lasting economic success.
Although there is no mention in the original 10 principles of the importance of the free flow of capital, such a view came to be associated with a promarket stance that such flows, along with fiscal discipline and open markets, were crucial for emerging markets to succeed.
''The term took on a life of its own and became associated with free market fundamentalism,'' said Mr. Rodrik, who added that an apogee was reached in the mid-1990s when the I.M.F. tried to include the free flow of capital as one of its articles of agreement.
After the Asian crisis in 1997 and the Russian market collapse in 1998, the notion that such flows were an unquestioned good began to be challenged. Of course, at the time, many countries were concerned mostly about capital flight and its effect, not inflows.
Despite China's success in maintaining tight control over its currency and the recent actions of Taiwan, Brazil and others, not all emerging markets are erecting barriers.
In India, where a record-breaking stock market has lured billions of dollars, officials have said that they do not intend to impose new restrictions.
Similarly, policy makers in booming Turkey say they will not impose controls, despite calls for action from some of the country's exporters.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan even went so far as to say that a strong currency was a source of pride for Turks.
''I think there has been a bit of exaggeration in this need for capital controls,'' said William R. Cline, the co-author of the Peterson Institute report.
Mr. Cline notes that of the countries with trade deficits, only Brazil has set up capital controls, with others preferring to intervene selectively in exchange markets. ''This is a rapidly changing situation, and a lot depends on what happens to U.S. interest rates and the stock market.''

HEADLINE: Question for Doctors, and Juries

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
Judith Graves, a 67-year-old retired investigator for the United States Army, developed a rare medical condition called jawbone death after taking Fosamax, a drug used by millions of American women with thinning bones.
In a civil trial now under way in Manhattan, Mrs. Graves is suing Merck, the maker of Fosamax. Her lawyer, Timothy M. O'Brien, told the jury that Fosamax had caused such debilitating jawbone deterioration that Mrs. Graves required five major operations, including a lengthy surgery to replace her broken jaw with bone from her left arm.
Merck has argued that Fosamax is not the culprit. In its defense, Merck contends that Mrs. Graves took other prescriptions -- like steroids to treat rheumatoid arthritis -- that weakened her immune system, leading to her jaw infection and healing problems, said Paul F. Strain, outside counsel for the company.
The lawsuit is one of a handful of bellwether cases against Merck representing litigation involving about 1,400 people across the country who say they developed jawbone ailments after taking Fosamax, Mr. O'Brien said. Merck won an earlier case; but in another, a judge proposed to reduce a plaintiff's jury award to $1.5 million from $8 million (both sides plan to appeal). 
In Mrs. Graves's case, the trial is providing a palpable backdrop for a broadening debate among many doctors and researchers who are rethinking Fosamax and similar bone medications known as oral bisphosphonates, particularly as a treatment for women who have not yet developed osteoporosis.
An advisory issued last month by the Food and Drug Administration, which first approved Fosamax in the 1990s to treat and prevent osteoporosis, along with reports in medical journals linking bisphosphonates with some rare medical problems including unusual thigh fractures, has heightened scrutiny of the long-term use of these medications.
While the F.D.A. cautioned that it was not clear that oral bisphosphonates had caused the rare thigh breaks, it said these kinds of bone fractures might be related to lengthy treatments with the drugs. The agency will now require the labels on Fosamax, Actonel, Boniva, Reclast and Atelvia and generic alternatives to state that the optimal period for using the drugs is unknown.
That uncertainty has shadowed the debate over how and when to prescribe these bone drugs, especially because they have been successful, by most accounts, in significantly reducing fractures over several years in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. From 1999 to 2009, Fosamax and a newer drug, Fosamax Plus D, had worldwide sales of more than $23.8 billion, according to IMS Health, a health information company that tracks drug sales.
But the drugs' popularity and effectiveness for generally healthy women without osteoporosis or broken bones have become a source of increasing argument in doctors' offices and in courtrooms.
Doctors had already started to review the unlimited use of oral bisphosphonates, said Dr. Elizabeth Shane, a professor of medicine at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. Fifteen years ago, she said, the medical community hoped that if women took the drugs before they developed osteoporosis, they would be protected from breaking bones later in life. But doctors have begun waiting longer before prescribing the drugs, she added.
''We are moving much more to targeting people later in the development of osteoporosis when they are at high risk of fracture, since we're not entirely clear yet how long is the most appropriate length of time to treat a person,'' said Dr. Shane, who has received research grants from Merck, Eli Lilly and Novartis.
Adults generally lose bone mass as they age. But the process accelerates in menopause when cells called osteoclasts start breaking down a larger amount of older bone than can be replaced by other cells, called osteoblasts. Bisphosphonates work by inhibiting that breakdown, thereby conserving bone density.
In one arm of a study called the Fracture Intervention Trial, or FIT, sponsored by Merck and involving about 2,000 women ages 55 to 81 with an existing vertebral fracture, Fosamax cut the risk of a new vertebral fracture by about half compared with a placebo.
''Before these drugs came on the market, we really had nothing,'' said Dr. Margaret Seton, a rheumatologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. ''When you have no drug and you've seen a patient and watched their spine crumble, that's heartbreaking.''
But for those whose bones have not thinned enough to be classified as having osteoporosis, potential treatments are in real flux.
In the FIT trial, for example, Fosamax significantly reduced the risk of clinical fractures in women with osteoporosis but not among those with higher bone mineral density, according to an analysis published in 1998. In a separate analysis of the FIT data that year, Anthony Mucci, a statistical reviewer at the F.D.A. wrote that, for women without osteoporosis, there was no measurable benefit shown ''for any category of fracture.''
Karen Riley, a spokeswoman for the F.D.A., said that the subgroup of women without osteoporosis in the FIT trial was too small to produce significant results, and that the Mucci report was one document in a much larger effort by the agency to assess the drug. She added that the F.D.A. approved Fosamax to prevent osteoporosis because it proved to conserve bone mineral density and had previously shown it could avert breaks.
Dr. Michael Rosenblatt, the chief medical officer at Merck and a former dean of Tufts University School of Medicine, pointed to the real goal: preventing osteoporosis, which carries a high risk of serious fractures, among people with thinning bones and stopping their progression from pre-osteoporosis, also known as osteopenia.
Dr. Shane of Columbia disputed the blanket use among patients without osteoporosis.
The drugs may indeed be appropriate, she said, for those with pre-osteoporosis who have other risk factors, like a broken bone, or a family history of hip fractures, or those taking steroids that can thin bones, or who are in their 70s. But the clinical benefit for a 51-year-old woman with osteopenia and no other risk factors cannot be assured, she said.
''As the field has evolved, we have learned that bisphosphonates don't seem to reduce the fracture risk in people who are not at high risk for fracture,'' Dr. Shane said.
As for long-term use of the drugs in light of some recent reports in medical journals about rare problems like jawbone death and unusual thigh fractures, Dr. Rosenblatt of Merck said there was not enough evidence to conclude that the drugs caused the conditions.
In a courtroom in Lower Manhattan, Mrs. Graves argues otherwise. In an interview, she said she did not have osteoporosis when her doctor prescribed Fosamax in 2001. After a tooth extraction in 2003, the left side of her lower jaw began to deteriorate.
She underwent several operations to replace her jaw, first with a titanium implant and bone from her left arm, and then, when that broke, with further implants. Now, she said, she can eat only soft foods, and only on the right side of her mouth.
In a statement, Merck said that Fosamax did not cause Mrs. Graves's illnesses. The company said Mrs. Graves had other medical conditions that can impair the jaw, and listed other prescription drugs she took that can suppress the body's immune system and inhibit wound healing.
For Dr. Seton of Massachusetts General, who is not involved in any of the lawsuits, the unusual jaw and thigh conditions pose a mystery. She theorized that perhaps these rare cases might be occurring in a small subset of patients whose bodies absorb the drugs in a different way or whose bones have unique qualities that increase their risk for such problems. Two of her patients on bisphosphonates suffered the atypical thigh bone breaks, she said.
''While I think the benefits outweigh the risks in the elderly population being treated for osteoporosis, I'm not sure that that is so clear for a younger person or those with osteopenia,'' Dr. Seton said, adding that she takes postmenopausal patients off the drugs after three to five years.
''I have great humility for what we don't know,'' Dr. Seton said. ''And I don't know that more bisphosphonates will prevent more fractures.''

HEADLINE: In-Flight Fire Endangers Delivery Date for Boeing 787

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW

 BODY:
Boeing halted test flights on Wednesday of its 787 Dreamliner, a day after an onboard fire forced an emergency landing, reinforcing expectations that the long-awaited plane faced more delays.
Several analysts said they doubted that Boeing, which is counting on the jet to vault it past Airbus in total sales, would meet its plan to deliver the first 787 by February.
The plane, the first passenger jet made substantially with lightweight carbon composites that are supposed to greatly cut fuel costs, is already running nearly three years late. And given other recent problems with suppliers and a test engine, some analysts said, Boeing might be able to deliver only about two dozen of the planes next year, down from earlier estimates of 40 to 50 or more. 
''There will be another delay,'' said Richard L. Aboulafia, vice president for analysis at the Teal Group, an aviation consulting firm in Fairfax, Va.
Even if the fire had not occurred on the test plane, ''there would still be another delay,'' he said. ''There are still too many unknowns.''
Boeing said Wednesday that it was evaluating what had gone wrong on the test flight and had suspended flights for its six test planes.
Company officials said smoke entered the cabin from an electronics compartment in the rear of the plane, forcing an emergency landing in Laredo, Tex. Forty-two engineers and crew members were aboard. One suffered minor injuries in evacuating by slide.
Boeing has been counting heavily on the Dreamliner, which has attracted more advance orders -- 847 -- than any plane in history. Its shares fell 3.2 percent, to $67.07 a share, in trading on Wednesday.
Boeing said in a statement that it appeared that a power control panel in the electronics compartment would need to be replaced, and other repairs might be necessary. It said it would take several days to analyze data from the test flight to determine the severity of the problem. Boeing added that it ''cannot determine the impact of this event on the overall program schedule until we have worked our way through the data.''
The Federal Aviation Administration, which must certify new planes as safe, is also investigating what caused the fire.
Hans J. Weber, an independent safety consultant, said if the fire stemmed from a flaw in basic electrical components, the problem could be relatively easy to fix. But if it were linked to more advanced electrical controls that help the Dreamliner save fuel, that could require more time-consuming changes. The plane's development has been marred by persistent problems with Boeing's far-flung supply network. Company executives have acknowledged that they farmed out too much design and production work and did not initially keep close enough tabs on suppliers.
But even though they have made an all-out push to meet their latest delivery schedule, more problems have cropped up over the last several months.
A Rolls-Royce engine meant to be used in one of the 787 test planes failed in a test plant in Britain in August, spewing out debris.
Boeing cited that engine problem in saying it would push back delivery of the first Dreamliner for the fifth time, from late this year to February 2011. Rolls-Royce has said it is confident it can fix the engine by that date.
Rolls-Royce also said this week that the problem on the engine for Boeing did not seem to be related to the failure last week of another Rolls-Royce engine on an Airbus A380 jumbo jet. That engine jettisoned debris while the plane, operated by Qantas Airways, was in flight.
Boeing has had to tell suppliers around the world to halt parts deliveries three times this year because Alenia Aeronautica, a unit of Finmeccanica of Italy, could not deliver the 787's horizontal tails on time. The latest parts delay occurred in late October. Boeing officials have said that poor workmanship by Alenia and other suppliers forced Boeing to rework many parts, further slowing its production line.
Alenia agreed last week to fix the problems by year-end.
Mr. Aboulafia, the Teal Group analyst, said he doubted that Boeing would be ready to deliver the first Dreamliner before the second quarter of 2011. Robert Spingarn, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said that before the fire broke out on the test plane, he had also concluded that the first delivery was not likely until April. With all the reworking of parts, he said, ''the aircraft, at this point, is being hand-built.'' He said Boeing knew there was ''an important statement to be made'' in delivering that first plane as soon as possible.
But he said that Boeing still had so many fixes to make on the next 20 to 25 planes that it would be hard pressed to deliver more than 27 planes next year.
Robert Stallard, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said in a research note earlier this week that Boeing executives told him on Monday that assembly of many of the first 30 aircraft would take longer than expected. Mr. Stallard said he now expected Boeing to deliver only 24 of the planes in 2011.
He said Boeing's chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr., who was at the meeting, believed that the company would probably need to build 40 to 50 Dreamliners before overcoming all the potential problems.
Still, investors have been patient with Boeing over the delays. It still has a two- to three-year edge over Airbus in building more fuel-efficient carbon planes, and the demand for new planes is strong as airlines emerge from the recession.

HEADLINE: What Everything Means

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
I can't stop thinking about the elections. Last weekend I saw ''127 Hours,'' and all I could think about was that this was a metaphor for the lame-duck session of Congress.
''127 Hours'' is the hot new movie about Aron Ralston, a real-life hiker who went for a jaunt through the Utah wilderness and fell into a hole, where his arm was pinned under an 800-pound boulder for, um, 127 hours. Then he sawed off his arm with a really, really dull knife, rappelled 60 feet to the canyon floor and walked several miles in the midday desert sun before being found by a family of Dutch tourists, who gave him water and two Oreo cookies.
So I just sat there free-associating about politics. The boulder was the deficit, and the arm was the Bush tax cut for the wealthy. While he was trapped, Ralston was tortured by a lot of buzzing, stinging and biting insects, all of whom resembled Mitch McConnell. 
If you get obsessive enough, everything you hear carries a postelection message. The Carnival Cruise ship is adrift! And isn't America exactly like a boat full of vacationers who thought they were on a luxury trip to the Mexican Riviera? Then, all of a sudden, they're standing in line for Spam and hoping somebody will tow them back to San Diego. No wonder Ohio turned red.
The moral of the George W. Bush TV interview this week with Matt Lauer involves the fact that it got terrible ratings. This could mean that the public wants to forget all about the first eight years of the 21st century and just blame Barack Obama for wrecking the economy. Or that while the country is divided in so many ways, we're still one big family when it comes to our national exhaustion with the previous president.
Although if people had known he was going to tell that story about how his mother put the miscarried fetus in a jar and made him look at it, perhaps more viewers would have tuned in.
Or maybe not.
The whole interview was confusing. When the first George Bush was president, the White House seemed to go out of its way to drop hints that Barbara Bush was pro-choice. Did they know about the fetus jar story?
Also, didn't it seem as if George W. was way more upset about Kanye West calling him a racist during Katrina than the fact that he invaded the wrong country?
And did you notice that Bush kept calling Kanye ''Conway?''
But I digress. To be honest, the interview did not get bad ratings because of the national malaise. It got bad ratings because it was up against ''Dancing With the Stars.''
In which Bristol Palin has made it to the final four. Once again, traditional Republicans were run over by the grizzly contingent. Bristol is not very good as a performer, but, as her mother put it, ''She's never danced before, and here she's learning the steps really quickly.''
Bristol is up against Jennifer Grey of ''Dirty Dancing'' fame, who's been doing great even though she's 50 with a bad knee and a plate and four screws in her neck. If Bristol wins I think we can take the whole thing as a metaphor for Russ Feingold's Senate race in Wisconsin.
Finally, when popular culture can't explain what's befallen us, there's always historic reference.
David Kennedy of Stanford University theorized in a postelection Op-Ed in The Times that we're reliving the late 19th-century Gilded Age, when all the presidents proved to be hapless, Congress switched back and forth madly as voters threw the bums out over and over again, and the country experienced a raft of critical problems and impending crises, combined with ''abject political paralysis.''
The Gilded Age also happened to be the time when the media was wildly fragmented, with thousands of small, underfinanced local newspapers all yapping frantically to try to make an impression. This produced a climate of semihysterical sensationalism, along with some of my all-time favorite headlines. One about Gov. Oliver Morton read: ''A Few of the Hellish Liaisons of, and Attempted Seductions by, Indiana's Favorite Stud-Horse.''
This sounds so familiar that I am pretty sure Professor Kennedy is right. So the message is that we should hunker down and wait for the next Teddy Roosevelt to come to our rescue. And then it will almost be time for Prohibition.
On the other hand, the Gilded Age had Mark Twain and Eugene Debs and Lillian Russell, who exemplified a beauty standard that extolled fleshy women. A Virginia City man writing to a friend about a tightrope walker named Ella LaRue said admiringly: ''Great 'shape' -- more of it than I ever saw in any female. Immense across the hips -- huge thighs.''
Maybe it won't be so bad after all.

HEADLINE: Some Fiscal Reality

 BODY:
The draft proposal by the chairmen of President Obama's deficit-reduction commission was a welcome antidote to the low-minded debate that dominated the midterm elections, in which politicians all vowed to reduce the deficit but offered no credible plans.
The proposal, released Wednesday, comes from Erskine Bowles, formerly the chief of staff for President Bill Clinton, and Alan Simpson, the former Republican senator from Wyoming. It frankly acknowledges what most politicians are too cowardly to admit -- that deficit reduction will require shared sacrifice. 
It lays out sensible principles, prominent among them that deficit reduction should start gradually, beginning in 2012, to avoid disrupting the fragile economic recovery. It also affirms the need to protect the most vulnerable Americans and to invest in education, infrastructure and research and development.
Then it does what any successful deficit reduction plan must do: It puts everything on the table, including tax reform to raise revenue and cuts in spending on health care and defense. It even dares to mention the need to find significant savings in Social Security, Medicare and other mandatory programs.
In a misguided provision, it assumes that spending and revenues should not exceed 21 percent of gross domestic product -- a numeric limit that could make it impossible to meet future national needs. In all, however, the proposal is both broad and deep.
It is not clear what the commission's final report will say. It is even doubtful that this plan would garner the 14 votes from the 18-member commission that are required to send the package to Congress for a vote in December.
At a time when good ideas are depressingly scarce in the political and economic debate, and bipartisan agreement even scarcer, this is a commendable start.
Some first impressions:
TAXES The proposal includes three options for tax reform, two of which would simplify the code by reducing income tax rates while modifying or repealing many tax deductions and other tax breaks. The third calls on Congress to undertake tax reform, while putting in place automatic tax increases if it fails to act by 2013.
The sensible aim is to raise more money -- roughly $1 trillion over 10 years -- than under the current system. We wish the co-chairmen had come right out and said directly that the country needs to raise taxes. Instead, the proposal says coyly that the tax changes would ''reduce the deficit.''
Tax simplification is a benefit in itself. A tax code that is easier to understand is also one that is more likely to be perceived as fair, without which it would be impossible to get public support for reform.
The reforms should go farther. Raising enough revenue in a global economy driven by trade, finance, services and spending will require new sources, such as energy taxes, a financial transactions tax or a value-added tax. A value-added tax that doesn't fall most heavily on lower-income Americans could be a significant spur to growth, because it doesn't tax savings.
THE MILITARY The Pentagon, which accounts for half of all discretionary spending, got virtually all it wanted after 9/11. Since the recession, Defense Secretary Robert Gates has cut back several dozen unneeded weapons programs for a long-term savings of $330 billion. He has called for $100 billion in administrative cuts and efficiencies over five years. But he would plow the savings into troops and weapons modernization, maintaining modest growth in overall spending.
The new proposal would go far beyond that, anticipating $100 billion in military budget cuts in 2015 alone -- and would put the savings into deficit reduction.
It calls for freezing salaries and bonuses for the Pentagon's civilian work force and noncombat military pay, cutting weapons procurement by 15 percent and slashing military personnel at bases in Europe and Asia by one-third. All ideas well worth debating.
The most politically volatile suggestion may be to tackle military health care costs, which rose from $19 billion to an unsustainable $50 billion over the last decade. The commission blueprint would raise premiums and co-payments on military retirees who now pay no premiums and very low deductibles. Many of these retirees work in the private sector but opt for much cheaper government health insurance. Their employers would be required to reimburse the government for the employer share of the retiree's health cost, eliminating what the chairmen say is a government subsidy for a normal business expense.
SOCIAL SECURITY To ensure the system's solvency over 75 years, the proposal would reduce benefits to most future retirees. It would also subject higher levels of income to the payroll taxes that support the program, while building in safeguards for both low-income and long-lived beneficiaries.
The cuts to middle-class benefits are too large -- a function of the fact that the proposal tilts too heavily toward cuts in benefits rather than increases in revenue.
What is important is that the proposal preserves the system's basic character and successful design: the young support the old via payroll taxes and the rich help the poor via a benefits formula that favors the neediest.
HEALTH CARE The proposals for reducing federal health care costs include some worthy ideas that are usually ducked or weakened because of political or interest-group opposition.
In some cases, the chairmen would go beyond the new health care reform law by strengthening some of the most important cost-cutting provisions that were watered down in the struggle to pass the legislation. It would strengthen a Medicare payment advisory board and cap tax exclusions for employer-sponsored plans at a lower level than the law does.
The chairmen would spread the pain in both ideological directions. They propose caps on malpractice awards that can drive up costs, which is anathema to Democratic-leaning trial lawyers, and, if costs rise faster than targets, they back the introduction of a public plan on the new insurance exchanges, which is anathema to Republicans. All of this is described so sketchily that it is hard to predict the impact.
As we read the chairmen's proposal, we had one very strong reaction: We hoped the Republicans would pause long enough in their gleeful planning of President Obama's final defeat, and the Democrats would stop wringing their hands, long enough to read this important document -- and then act on it.

HEADLINE: As Millions Seek Work, an Overhaul in Retraining

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
TALK to a displaced worker who has just finished a retraining program, and chances are you're talking to someone who still doesn't have a job.
Lured by promises of seamless re-employment in glamorous careers, many of America's 14.8 million unemployed have enrolled in expensive adult retraining programs, only to graduate with mountains of debt and credentials no employer cares about.
In some cases, these hapless workers are the victims of fly-by-night operations. But others have been through well-intentioned community college programs that simply did not have the resources or structure to devise curriculums that actually prepare students for jobs. 
Enter Skills for America's Future, an initiative started by the Obama administration and housed in the Aspen Institute, a nonprofit research organization in Washington.
The program, announced by the White House on Oct. 4, is an attempt to broaden and duplicate the most successful programs around the United States.
''The goal is to encourage community colleges to work in close partnership with employers, to design a curriculum of some kind where they actually want to hire the people coming out of these programs,'' said Austan Goolsbee, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers.
The Aspen Institute has appointed a new director to head the program and is hiring more staff using $250,000 in seed money from a private foundation. The new program will build on previous efforts by the institute to identify the most successful public-private retraining partnerships around the country and figure out the best practices for other colleges interested in developing similar programs.
Internships, curriculum development and mentoring programs will be among the components that Skills for America's Future will study and make recommendations on.
Indeed, there are shining examples of small, well-devised retraining programs around the United States that have strong records of placing low-income, at-risk workers in employment, in good economic times and bad.
One is Training Futures, which educates and grooms about 100 low-income people annually in the Virginia suburbs of Washington for administrative and medical office jobs.
It is run in partnership with the Northern Virginia Community College system, a local nonprofit called the Northern Virginia Family Service and employers throughout the area. Founded in 1996, the program has an 89 percent job placement rate within six months of graduation, said Bill Browning, the program's liaison at the college.
High job placement rates at public-private partnerships like Training Futures -- or a respected automotive technician program at Shoreline Community College in Washington State, or a medical training program at Austin Community College in Texas -- seem to be the exception, rather than the rule in the retraining sphere. Many of these model programs are small, with intense one-on-one mentoring, and subsist through an uneven stream of private donations and taxpayer support.
The challenge for Skills for America's Future will be to break down data from different schools and employers to figure out how to reproduce these unusual successes quickly and efficiently, given how many workers across the country are yearning for similar results.
The Aspen Institute has already been working with Training Futures to statistically analyze that program's structure and enrollment for clues about what has made it effective.
For example, the institute is interested in the structure of the internship that occurs toward the end of the 25-week program. This internship process, and in particular the active role that Training Futures takes in screening and matching students to offices where they might be well suited, may be one replicable, vital element to more permanent job placement.
''It takes a lot of time to train someone who is not experienced,'' said Ingrid Tomney, a practice administrator with Pediatric Cardiology Associates, a medical office in Fairfax, Va., that is a partner with Training Futures and recently hired one of its graduates after a successful internship. ''Training Futures has been good about trying to tailor things to our practice and what our needs are, like giving us people who are comfortable speaking on the phone with patients and making calls.''
There is also interest in the softer skills that the program helps teach to troubled students, like self-confidence and an understanding of proper business attire. In addition to traditional courses like typing, filing and medical terminology, for example, Training Futures also provides a Toastmasters course to help students with public speaking, and each day of the program opens with a discussion of an inspirational quotation.
''It wasn't just training you on your skills, but also training you to be a better person altogether and to look at life differently,'' said Jae Om, 27, of Herndon, Va. A single mother who had her son while in high school, she had been in and out of work in recent years, and got a job at the Dulles Regional Chamber of Commerce after interning there through Training Futures. Before enrolling in Training Futures last spring, she had been unemployed for nearly two years.
The Skills for America's Future program at the Aspen Institute will be paired with a federal advisory board, which will include officials from the Labor Department, Education Department and other federal departments and agencies that have a stake in retraining American workers.
Penny Pritzker, a Chicago business executive and Obama fund-raiser who sits on the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, will be the chairwoman for the Skills for America's Future board. Her family foundation, the Pritzker Traubert Family Foundation, donated the seed money for the project, and she said she was trying to shore up donations from other foundations interested in poverty, labor and related initiatives.
Ms. Pritzker said the board would also have representatives from the private sector, labor unions and other stakeholders. A number of large American companies, including Gap Inc., Accenture, the United Technologies Corporation and McDonald's, have agreed to serve as partners to the program.
These companies were recruited in part because they have existing retraining programs, often with at-risk populations.
The Pacific Gas and Electric Company, for example, has already been working with community colleges in places like Fresno and Modesto, Calif., to help devise curriculums for jobs related to clean energy and skilled crafts. It has committed to provide $1.5 million in in-kind support for each of the next three years to community colleges, including equipment donations, curriculum setup and student field visits, according to Tamar Sarkissian, a company spokeswoman.

HEADLINE: Gap, With Tepid Sales at Home, Looks to the Emerging Consumer in China

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- With sales in the United States sluggish, one of America's best-known apparel brands -- Gap Inc. -- is joining the rush to enter China's fast-growing consumer market.
The retailer plans to open a flagship store here on Thursday, followed this month by three other large outlets in Shanghai and Beijing, two of China's wealthiest cities. The company also expects to eventually add its other brands, like Old Navy and Banana Republic. 
Some multinationals already have a huge presence in China, like McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble. But American retailers are just beginning their push into this country as consumption is on the rise and an investment boom is resulting in scores of new upscale malls and shopping districts.
''The timing is right,'' John Ermatinger, Gap's president for the Asia-Pacific region, said Wednesday, while touring the flagship store here as workers folded shirts and spruced up the interior. ''We've declared that 12 percent to 25 percent of our revenue will come from the international market by 2013. And I think we can do that.''
Chinese consumers are legendary for their saving habits. But analysts say China's consumer market is likely to storm ahead in the next decade, and pass the United States. Retail sales grew by about 15 percent in China last year.
The streets of Shanghai and Beijing look increasingly like New York City, Chicago or San Francisco, with Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Nike, Starbucks and Apple all seeking to entice shoppers. A report released in January by Credit Suisse predicted that by 2020 China would account for nearly a quarter of the world's private consumption.
''It is likely to provide a badly needed source of spending for the rest of the world,'' the report said.
The Chinese government is backing the spending spree, trying to raise salaries and encourage more consumption as part of its long-term plan to restructure the economy and create more balanced and sustainable growth.
Global brands are hoping to profit from the shift. In the 1990s, Western corporations came to set up factories, and also contracted with local manufacturers to have products made here. Long before setting up its retail operations here, Gap had much of its clothing manufactured in China.
Now Gap and other retailers want to market to China's nouveau riche and the emerging middle class. With its first store, a bright and sleek 12,000-square-foot outlet in the city's upscale Hong Kong Plaza area, Gap hopes to promote its classic 1969 jeans, winter clothing and also its baby and Gap Kids clothing lines.
''We're talking to a lot of companies that are saying, 'I'm ready. How do I come?' '' said Max Magni, head of the consumer practice for greater China at McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm.
But retailing experts warn it will not be easy. The country's consumer market is still in the early stages of development, with consumption in smaller cities lagging far behind larger ones.
National distribution is complex; marketing and television advertising is largely local; pricing is fiercely competitive; and counterfeiting is widespread, the analysts said.
Wal-Mart has 189 stores in China and reported sales of about $7.5 billion last year, according to Euromonitor International, a market research firm. But of America's 100 biggest retailers by revenue, only about a dozen operate independent stores in China.
Business experts cite the challenges and high cost of doing business in China. Mr. Magni at McKinsey said that initially many brands entered China through department stores, which they considered less costly and therefore less risky.
Until several years ago, there were government restrictions on foreign companies operating retail outlets, but even when those disappeared, retailers still worried about how to make sense of a complex marketplace and how to appeal to local tastes.
''Some brands entered late because with clothes, you need to follow the trends and styles,'' said Chen Yuxin, a professor of marketing at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. ''But now, this is changing. People want to be fashionable. And they like foreign brands.''
Many global retailers are scrambling to find good locations in China's biggest cities. European retailers like Carrefour, Tesco and Metro A.G. are opening big supermarkets. Luxury brands say that in the next few years China should overtake Japan as the world's biggest market for luxury goods.
And midrange apparel retailers like H&M, Zara and Uniqlo of Japan have gotten off to a strong start with new outlets in Shanghai -- sometimes with long waiting lines just to enter the stores.
After a lengthy study, Gap is starting off with four stores, an e-commerce site and a China advertising campaign that features photographs taken by Annie Leibovitz. Gap executives say they hope to build on the success the company had with over 100 stores it operates in Japan. They would not disclose the cost of the new China venture.
Gap will market goods ranging from children to adults, while placing most of its emphasis on consumers in their mid- to late 20s. Prices in the China stores are expected to be comparable to those in the United States, meaning Gap's initial strategy does not seem aimed at charging premiums. Still, in a country with a per capita income that is far below that in the United States, Gap will be a premium brand here.
Gap Inc., based in San Francisco, is coming off a tough 2009, when the company's global revenues declined. This year, the company's American growth has been anemic. But like most global retailers in China, the company says it is ''extremely bullish'' on its prospects here.
''We believe the best is yet to come in China,'' said Mr. Ermatinger, the Gap executive.

HEADLINE: As Donors Retrench, Challenges for Universities

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
AS the stock market soared for two decades, college and university endowments swelled with gifts. Over the last 10 years, contributions to higher education have risen an average of 4.1 percent a year, despite the downturn.
These endowments allowed many public universities to help offset declines in government contributions and let many private universities increase financial aid to a widening number of families that could not afford the high costs of education.
But in 2009, giving to 1,027 universities and colleges plummeted 11.9 percent, to $27.85 billion, according to data compiled by the Council for Aid to Education, the greatest single annual decline since the Depression. Fund-raising advisers and experts anticipate a slow recovery. 
Indicators are that overall giving for fiscal 2010 may be flat; data for the year, which generally ended June 30, is not available yet. A handful of institutions have already released their numbers. At Harvard, for example, giving was down 1 percent, to $596 million, and Yale also had a slight decline. Chicago was up 1 percent, and for the University of Texas, Austin, giving rose more than 3 percent.
Behind those numbers are changes in giving styles that make the job of fund-raisers even more difficult. ''I have been in the business for 40 years, and I have never seen such a tough environment,'' said William P. McGoldrick, a partner at Washburn & McGoldrick in Latham, N.Y., which advises higher education institutions on how to raise money.
He added: ''Whether you are supporting a child who does not have a job or benefits, or worrying about imminent changes in the tax law, people are very cautious. Donors, especially major donors, ask tougher questions about institutions than they did when they trusted leadership throughout society.''
In the past, donors were often willing to make gifts that were paid over a number of years, but fund-raisers are finding a reluctance to commit for more than one year.
''Instead of a donor pledging a gift for $500,000 over five years, they will give $100,000 and wait and see about the rest,'' said Trish Jackson, vice president for development at Smith College.
For the University of Texas, Austin, about 30 percent of donors who make a bequest decline to put a value on the amount of the gift because they are unsure of what it will be worth, said Kevin Hegarty, vice president and chief financial officer.
John Lippincott, president of the Council for Advancement and Support to Education, which provides services in alumni relations, said: ''The greatest impact of the recession, aside from the impact on people's net worth, is that it has created great uncertainty. In that atmosphere, people are reluctant to make long-term commitments.''
Long-term gifts are extremely important to institutions because they provide certainty that a specific amount of money is guaranteed to come into the endowment in subsequent years, whatever the economic situation.
As the gap between the superwealthy and others has increased, fund-raisers have come under pressure to court the superrich. ''It used to be that 20 percent of your donors provided 80 percent of your revenue,'' said Tom Farrell, vice president for alumni relations at the University of Chicago. ''Today, 5 to 10 percent of your donors generate 80 percent to 90 percent of your revenue.''
At Yale, for example, $3.2 billion has been raised toward its $3.5 billion capital campaign. ''According to our analysis, one-half of 1 percent of the donors have given 75 percent of the total,'' said Inge Reichenbach, vice president for development.
As a result, some universities have been honing their skills at courting the wealthiest donors. Institutions have developed programs to reach out to donors who can give major gifts, which for some start at $1 million and for others, $5 million, said Tim Rippinger, senior associate vice president for development at Marquette University in Milwaukee.
At Columbia, which is completing a $4 billion campaign that started six years ago, Lee Bollinger, the president, said, ''Big ideas attract big gifts, because people of big wealth respond to opportunities for major institutional advancement and big opportunities for growth.''
Columbia is planning a second business school campus in Manhattanville, to which the financier Henry R. Kravis has pledged $100 million. The late John Werner Kluge, who built the Metromedia broadcast empire, pledged $400 million for financial aid.
In 2009, gifts to the 20 universities that raised the largest amounts of money accounted for 26.2 percent of all giving. Among them were Stanford, Harvard, Cornell, and the Universities of Michigan, North Carolina at Chapel Hill and California at Berkeley and at San Francisco.
The slowdown in giving comes at a crucial time for American colleges, as state governments continue to cut financing. Mr. Hegarty said that in the mid-1980s, the University of Texas, Austin, received roughly 50 percent of its financing from the government. Today it is 14 percent.
''And the tuition is controlled by the government,'' he added. That means the university cannot raise tuition to meet any shortfall.
At Stanford, Martin Shell, vice president for development, said that despite the increase in support that came with the stimulus, in real terms, government financing has been declining, so the university is increasing its emphasis on fund-raising, particularly for gifts that can be used for general budget purposes, as opposed to restricted gifts.
Some colleges report an increase in anonymous giving. ''Out of our top gifts over $1 million, probably about 30 percent are anonymous,'' Mr. Rippinger of Marquette said. ''It used to be a rarity. Now people want to be charitable, but they don't want to advertise. They think it will bring an unfavorable light on them, because in a bizarre way, they think it might look flashy, or people worry that others will seek them out to donate to their list of things.''
Mr. Shell said that he, too, was finding more interest in anonymous giving. ''Now, some of our donors are saying that we can use their names privately with other people, but they do not want any publicity about their gifts.''
Perilously for some colleges, including the University of Texas, Austin, as budgets are cut, so are fund-raising operations.
The good news for Stanford, at least, is that though giving was down last year, the number of donors rose. ''People want to help, and they are participating,'' Mr. Shell said.

HEADLINE: No Room in This Town for Change Brought by an Inn

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

 BODY:
SALISBURY, Conn.
In this tidy bastion of exurban propriety in Litchfield County, people are still trying to figure out what happened on Election Day. No, not all that, which has pretty much been picked over. Instead, the talk is the sudden closing of the venerable White Hart Inn, which started around 1806 as a small tavern and evolved into a primal slice of mythic New England.
While the outside world changed, the inn sat primly at the town green, a faded painting by the entrance in the Olde English style featuring a captured white hart, the archaic word for a mature stag. It's where residents, whether local E.M.T.'s or Wall Street weekenders, came for July beers and February martinis in front of the fireplace and where prep school parents from the Hotchkiss and the Salisbury Schools booked rooms. It was the site of town Christmas tree lightings, chili cook-offs and ice sculptures. 
And then, poof, just five months after a $5 million renovation, the 15-room inn was closed and put up for sale. People are still chattering and scratching their heads.
Actually, there's not much mystery to the closing. The message on the door from Scott Bok, 51, the head of a Manhattan investment firm, who owned the inn with his wife, Roxanne, began: ''We have owned the inn for over 12 years. While much of that time was a pleasure, it was also a heavy responsibility and time commitment.''
It wasn't hard to deduce that if much of the time was a pleasure, a fair amount of it was probably a pain in the posterior. Running a beloved local institution is like being in elected office but having to pay the bills yourself. Everyone has an opinion. Mr. Bok, who owns a house and farm in the area but lives during the week in New York, bought the inn for less than the outstanding debt in 1998, more to keep it open than as a business decision.
Mr. Bok declined to comment, but Patricia Best, the listing agent, said the $5 million modernization included both makeovers of the rooms and long overdue roof, insulation, heating, siding, soundproofing and fire-safety work.
There was praise for the renovation, but the higher prices and especially the new locavore food menu went over with a leaden thud. Many felt that duck and Cracker Jack salad and shiitake mushroom and chocolate soup weren't quite the fit for this change-averse part of the world. One comment on a well-read local Web site, Rural Intelligence, said: ''Hint to the next owner: The reason why NW CT remains unique from its surrounding regions is that we have not given into change for the sake of change. Most of us like life the way it was and is now.''
Others felt the problem wasn't so much that the menu was too adventurous and expensive, but that the food just wasn't very good. An uncharacteristically cutting review in the local Lakeville Journal summed up the criticism. It appears that Mr. Bok figured life's too short and put the inn up for sale. The asking price is $5 million.
''Change comes hard to New Englanders,'' Ms. Best said. ''But I disagree with people in town saying, 'Isn't this sad?' I think it's great -- great for the Boks because they get their life back and great because it will be bought by someone who's excited about the business.''
There's a lot of selective memory at work. No one thought the inn's old New England comfort food was all that good, and, legend or not, the White Hart, once owned by Edsel Ford, had struggled for decades. It closed for a time in the late 1980s while a new buyer was found.
This closing is a particularly tough blow. Despite its picture-postcard charm and famous residents over the years like Meryl Streep, Jill Clayburgh, Rip Torn, Laura Linney and many others, Salisbury has become economically stagnant, its business district dependent largely on a few moneyed types who keep it afloat. Once, Millerton, N.Y., just to the west, was a poor relation and dried-up farming town. Now it's full of new shops and youthful bustle while Salisbury struggles.
Anyway, Election Day was more than a week ago, but perhaps some lessons have been learned. If you're promising change, you had better do it right. What people want is often what they have, had or thought they had. Sometimes you need to invest in the future, even if it doesn't pay off on your watch. If you're dependent on the largess of people with money, it doesn't come with a lifetime guarantee. Today's top dog can be tomorrow's scalded dog. There are probably some lessons in the voting, too.

HEADLINE: Cuomo, at Sing Sing and a Psychiatric Center, Speaks of Tight Money and Services

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE and ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

 BODY:
It was, some might argue, an apt dry run for the New York governor-elect.
Andrew M. Cuomo visited a state prison and a state-run mental ward on Wednesday, the first stops in what aides billed as a postelection tour of the state government that Mr. Cuomo has pledged to tame and revive after he takes office.
The visits -- first to the Sing Sing Correctional Facility in Ossining, N.Y., then to the Manhattan Psychiatric Center on Wards Island -- marked the second day of formal transition activities for Mr. Cuomo, who also released a video in which he thanked New Yorkers for voting for him and pledged to make state government less secretive. 
While there were no jokes about corrupt officials or the madhouse atmosphere that has prevailed in Albany in recent years, the visits were rich with practical and symbolic significance for Mr. Cuomo, the state attorney general and a Democrat.
Sing Sing was the scene of the first major test faced by Mr. Cuomo's father, Mario M. Cuomo, after being elected governor almost three decades ago: In 1983, shortly after Mr. Cuomo took office, inmates rioted and held 17 guards hostage for two days. Governor Cuomo was intimately involved in the negotiations, and the hostages emerged without serious injury.
''In some ways, this comes full circle for me; when I first started in state government, I was working for a fellow named Mario Cuomo,'' Mr. Cuomo, who served as an adviser to his father at the time, said at a news conference on Wednesday outside the prison.
''This was the first incident, first episode,'' Mr. Cuomo added.
''He'd just been governor literally a few days, and this was the nightmare scenario,'' he explained. ''It was very frightening.''
The agencies that run prisons and mental health facilities also employ the largest number of state workers of any departments of government under direct control of the governor, part of a work force that Mr. Cuomo may be forced to trim, or demand significant concessions from, to plug the state's projected $8 billion deficit for next year.
Mr. Cuomo used his visit to lay out some of the budget challenges that he will face in the months ahead, particularly when it comes to the billions of dollars a year that New York spends to run its own operations, a major component of the state budget.
More prisons were opened under Mr. Cuomo's father than under any other governor in New York history, as high crime rates and 1970s-era mandatory sentencing laws drove significant growth in the state prison population. On Wednesday, Governor-elect Cuomo argued that with the prison population now shrinking, it was time to think about shrinking the number of prisons, too.
''On the prison side, the census is dropping; that's good news,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''We are locking up fewer people. But then you need fewer facilities. And the shrinkage of that system is going to be something that has to be thought through and managed.''
He said the state could not afford to have on its payroll state workers who have no real duties.
''I understand the economic consequences of losing state jobs,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''The answer can't be we are going to employ state workers who literally have no function.''
Govs. David A. Paterson, whom Mr. Cuomo met with on Tuesday, and Eliot Spitzer tried, with mixed success, to close correctional facilities, which provide much-needed jobs in some rural, upstate counties.
Robert Gangi, executive director of the Correctional Association of New York, a prisoners' advocacy organization, said he would welcome a new push by Mr. Cuomo to reduce spending on prisons, especially in the wake of legislation passed last year that reduced sentences for many nonviolent drug offenders.
''My guess is, those kinds of efficiencies are available,'' Mr. Gangi said. ''He can really accomplish something for the state both in terms of improving the criminal justice system and in bringing down the costs.''
Mr. Cuomo used his later appearance, at the psychiatric center, to strike a different note. Standing directly underneath the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge, Mr. Cuomo said the state must balance the reality of scarce state dollars against the need to provide services, like mental health care, to the most vulnerable New Yorkers.
Balancing the budget is ''a priority for me,'' he said, but ''the flip side of that equation is balancing that budget with the very necessary, important services that the state is providing, the services where you are literally taking care of human beings.''

HEADLINE: Boston Museum Grows by Casting a Wide Net

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI

 BODY:
ABOUT four years ago, at the suggestion of a mutual friend, Ronald C. Wornick paid a call on Malcolm A. Rogers, the director of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, looking for a home for the contemporary decorative art that he and his wife, Anita, collect.
''I had a long list of questions, and I had a list of other museums we were considering,'' Mr. Wornick said. ''At the end of meeting, I threw out the list of museums and practically jumped into his lap. He said all of the things I wanted to hear in the most earnest way.''
Since then, the Wornicks, who live in San Francisco, have promised to give the museum about $5 million worth of art and have donated more than $2.5 million in cash to endow a curatorial position.
Mr. Rogers and the museum have charmed a lot of people like the Wornicks lately. In a seven-year campaign that ended in 2008 -- for a new wing, the endowment and operating expenses -- the museum pulled in $504 million plus $165 million worth of art. After one slow year, it followed that with donations of $57 million, including art, in the year to June 30, and another $40 million, all told, since July 1. 
Nearly a third of the donors are new to the museum, and many live outside Boston and New England. They include New Yorkers like Leonard A. Lauder, chairman emeritus of Estee Lauder; Leslie J. Garfield, the real estate broker; Arnold Scaasi, the fashion designer; and Simone and Alan Hartman, the art dealers. In addition, there are Carol and Terry D. Wall, founder of a medical equipment company in New Jersey; Candace and Michael Humphrey, an investor in San Antonio; the Sumitomo Foundation, of Japan; and the Art Mentor Foundation Lucerne, of Switzerland.
Those numbers, and names, are extraordinary for Boston, where giving levels rarely approach those of New York, and the museum does not even have an annual benefit (its last was in 1997). By comparison, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art began a $450 million campaign in 2004 and has raised $324 million, drawing from a hometown population six times that of Boston. In Chicago, more than four times Boston's size, the Art Institute took eight years to raise $412 million to build its new wing.
''A number of people have come up to me and said, 'We never thought you'd do it,' '' said Mr. Rogers. Even some trustees had doubts.
But on Saturday night, to celebrate the opening of the new Art of the Americas wing, 1,500 donors from near and far will be eating Nantucket bay scallops in black truffle vinaigrette, followed by cognac-and-clove cotton candy, and dancing to a 16-piece orchestra, at $1,000 each.
They will be dazzled by a ''guest as artist'' wall exhibit that projects rotating, 18 feet by 24 feet images of those brave enough to step up to a camera. The Brazilian Girls will perform. It is all being orchestrated by Bryan Rafanelli, the events planner who oversaw Chelsea Clinton's wedding last summer.
Just how the museum managed this feat provides a tough lesson for these difficult times, when giving is sluggish. The pitch, Mr. Rogers says, was never need. It was vision. ''It's how do you transform into a vision the needs of an institution and make it one that people want to invest in. It's important to think of donors as investors who'll think that you'll use their donations efficiently.''
That is why, in the years before the campaign, Mr. Rogers worked hard to turn around the museum, which was bleeding red ink when he arrived in 1994. He made cuts, reorganized the staff and mounted an ambitious exhibition program, ending each year since 1996 with a surplus. He extended hours, reopened the museum's historic grand entrances and organized exhibitions of objects like guitars and cars that had popular appeal.
''My vision is to open the museum to as many people as possible, to give to as many opportunities for close encounters with art to as many people as possible,'' he said.
Only then did the museum begin soliciting in earnest.
''I always say,'' Mr. Rogers explained, ''don't go to people and say, 'We really need your money because we have a leaky roof.' Go and say, 'We want the very best roof in America because this is a very great institution.' ''
The economic timing was good when, in July 2001, the museum began the ''quiet phase'' of its campaign, seeking major gifts from trustees, patrons and new donors, mostly from Boston and New England. Among them: Penny and Jeffrey N. Vinik, a onetime manager of Fidelity Investments' Magellan Fund. In 2000, Ms. Vinik was invited to be an M.F.A. overseer, an advisory post below trustee. As she grew more involved, Mr. Vinik decided to surprise her with a birthday gift -- a multimillion-dollar donation that will put their names on a gallery in the new wing.
Ms. Vinik is now a trustee and heads the museum's Fashion Council, a new group focused on adding 20th- and 21st-century fashion to the M.F.A.'s trove of historic costumes -- and, eventually, to emulate the Metropolitan Museum's Costume Institute gala, which raised $9 million last spring.
But the museum always knew it had to go beyond its environs, and Mr. Rogers said he looked to Boston's status as a college town. ''We began to think, does the M.F.A. have alumni? No, but it does have people who went to college here and first learned about art at the M.F.A.'' Or people who grew up in Boston but later left, like the Wornicks. Using traditional tactics, like introductions from trustees, the museum cultivated donors like Ms. Wall, who graduated from Tufts University nearby.
Mr. Rogers has always been the fund-raising linchpin, and he delivered in many ways. Donors say he always comes with knowledge of their interests, intent on engaging them more deeply with the museum. He so enjoys entertaining -- unlike many nonprofit executives -- that he built a special ''great room,'' decorated with his collection of 16th- and 17th-century British portraits, at his Chestnut Hill home. ''It almost transports you to an English country house,'' said Patricia B. Jacoby, the museum's deputy director and head of fund-raising. (Mr. Rogers, who moved from Britain to take this job, is now an American citizen.)
Ms. Jacoby figures that Mr. Rogers has entertained about 400 people a year for the museum for the last seven years, giving about 10 dinner parties and three cocktail events a year. And his involvement went deeper than playing host. He helped determine when people should be invited to his home, who else should be there and the seating arrangements. ''Some people you invite to say thank you, and others to bring nearer, and always to meet people,'' he said.
His efforts have not always gone smoothly. The museum has given exhibitions of collections owned by many potential donors: English silver owned by the Hartmans; decorative arts from the Wornicks; paintings, sculpture, even boating trophies and a yacht from William I. Koch, the billionaire investor, among them.
Some museum experts frown on the practice -- unless the collection has been promised to the museum -- on the theory that an exhibition adds value to it. And when the Hartmans auctioned off a collection of Chinese jades about two years after an M.F.A. exhibition, raising millions, controversy flared.
But Mr. Rogers said most American museums mount collector shows. He branded as ''nonsense'' the idea that an exhibition adds to a collection's value in any category except contemporary art. ''We do not do vanity exhibitions here,'' he said, ''but we bring art held in private collections into public view.''
In any case, the idea of quid pro quo deals between donors and the museum falters with two examples: a display of contemporary works owned by Eli and Edythe Broad, who live in Los Angeles, yielded no donation. Nor did an exhibition of vintage cars owned by the New Yorker Ralph Lauren. Were they asked? ''What do you think?'' Mr. Rogers replied.
The museum's reputation for openness was critical to Mr. Lauder, a major arts patron in New York with no ties to Boston. In 2002, seeking a museum for a collection of 20,000 postcards made by early 20th-century Japanese artists, he called the Freer and Sackler Galleries in Washington, the Metropolitan Museum and the M.F.A. The Freer said, ''We'll get back to you,'' he said, and the Met took a long time to find someone to respond, but ''the M.F.A. was down with a couple of curators within minutes.''
Since then, he has promised to donate another 100,000 postcards, along with monetary support to catalog, digitize, publish and exhibit the postcards, and he endowed the Leonard A. Lauder curator of visual culture position -- a total exceeding seven figures.
''It was love at first sight for the whole thing,'' said Mr. Lauder, who declined to comment on future gifts. ''Anything is possible,'' he said. ''Malcolm is irresistible as a fund-raiser.''

HEADLINE: Women's Group Cites 12 Districts in Title IX Complaint

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

 BODY:
A women's legal group filed complaints Wednesday with the federal education department alleging that 12 school districts nationwide -- including New York, Chicago and Houston -- are violating federal law by failing to offer equal opportunities to boys and girls who play high school sports.
The group, the National Women's Law Center, sent the complaints to the education department's Office for Civil Rights, which is charged with enforcing the federal gender-equity law known as Title IX. The center relied on data that school districts reported to the education department in 2006, the most recent year that the data was available. The data, they said, showed in many cases a participation gap of more than 10 percentage points. Proportionality is one of the three ways schools can show compliance with Title IX. 
Nationwide, the center said, about 41 percent of high school athletes are girls, although they make up about half of school enrollment.
''These schools are just the tip of the iceberg,'' said Marcia Greenberger, co-president of the center, which is based in Washington.
Greenberger said that the districts were selected to be representative of the nation as a whole, with a mix of geographic regions and large and smaller districts.
Justin Hamilton, a spokesman for the education department, said that the office was looking into the complaints.
In the case of New York, the center found that the gender gap in city high schools averaged 7.9 percentage points in 2006.
In Chicago, the gap was much larger, at an average of 33 percentage points. In 2004, the gap in was 7.9 percentage points.
The center noted that some data submitted by New York and Chicago appeared to be inaccurate and asked the Office for Civil Rights to take a closer look. Monique Bond, a spokeswoman for the Chicago public schools, said that officials had not had a chance to review the complaint, but that ''we continue to be encouraged by our efforts to increase programming for female student-athletes.''
The New York City schools released a statement saying officials had not received the complaint, but that the New York City Public Schools Athletic League, which operates competitive high school sports, offered a variety of varsity sports for girls.
Marmion Dambrino, the athletic director for the Houston Independent School District, said she was surprised to hear that it was the target of a complaint. ''If the district is found to be out of compliance, we'll work with O.C.R. to bring the district into compliance,'' she said. The average gender gap in Houston high schools was 11.9 percent in 2006, according to the center.
The decision to single out high school participation rates reflects an increasing focus from colleges to high schools, where many advocates say gender imbalances are less visible. However, some of those who advocate reform of the Title IX law say they fear that high schools will react by eliminating sports for boys, especially in a troubling economic climate.
''This isn't a secret that there's a gender imbalance,'' said Eric Pearson, chairman of the College Sports Council, which advocates reform of the Title IX law. ''The question is how schools are going to comply, and inevitably it will lead to a shrinking down of participation numbers on the men's side.''
Greenberger said that no one wants to cut opportunities for boys, and suggested that schools look to the community for help..

HEADLINE: Not a 'Banana Republic'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Our Banana Republic,'' by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, Nov. 7): 
In an otherwise excellent column about inequality in the United States, Mr. Kristof refers to Venezuela as a ''banana republic.'' Besides the problem of using such a degrading term -- not to mention one so closely linked to foreign imperialism -- it does not apply to Venezuela.
The term ''banana republic'' was coined to refer to small countries largely dependent on agricultural goods, ruled by a small and unaccountable elite and generally servile to American corporate interests.
Venezuela does not fit this billing. Known more for its oil than its agricultural goods, Venezuela is a vibrant democracy, unlike many of the traditional ''banana republics'' Mr. Kristof may have been thinking of.
On the issue of inequality, though, Venezuela may prove to be an example for the United States. Over the last decade, social programs begun by President Hugo Chavez have brought needed services like education and health to underserved sectors of the population.
Beyond a dramatic drop in poverty from 49 percent to 27 percent from 1999 to 2008, Venezuela has also seen inequality diminish, so much so that the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean ranked it highest for inequality reduction among 12 neighboring countries in the region.

HEADLINE: Grandparents' Role Grows As the Economy Struggles

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The recession continued to batter families this year, with the number of stay-at-home mothers declining and a sharp rise in the number of children living with their grandparents, according to a new Census Bureau report. 
The number of children living in their grandparents' home increased by 8 percent compared with 2009, the second such rise in two years, and an indication that the recession is rearranging how people live.
Over all, 6.5 percent of children in the United States lived with their grandparents, a 20-year high and double the rate in 1970, said Andrew Cherlin, a professor of sociology and public policy at Johns Hopkins University, who analyzed the data.
''That's a story that says grandparents are helping out as their adult children are losing their jobs,'' Mr. Cherlin said.
Of the 7.5 million children who lived with a grandparent in 2010, more than a fifth did not have a parent present in the household, the report said.
The recession may also have been a factor in reducing the number of stay-at-home mothers, which dropped slightly to 23 percent in 2010, down one percentage point from 2007, when the economic downturn began.
The report also highlighted increases in the marriage age for men and women, a long-term trend that began in the 1950s. This year, the median age for men to marry for the first time was 28, up from 26 in 2000. The age for women was 26, up from 25 a decade ago.
Americans were marrying at their youngest in the 1950s, when half of all women were married by their early 20s, Mr. Cherlin said. But the age has been rising since then, and it is now the highest since the government began to track the data in the 1890s, he said.
In all, 54 percent of adults were married in 2010, down from 57 percent in 2000, the report said. At the same time, the number of one-person households rose to 27 percent over the past decade, up from 25 percent in 2000. That is more than double the number of one-person households in 1960, the report said.
The report also noted an increase in the average size of households headed by Americans without a high school degree. There are a number of possible reasons, Mr. Cherlin said, including an increase in the overall number of immigrants, who tend to be less educated and have larger families, or doubling up within households.

HEADLINE: Markets Manage a Small Gain Despite Debt Concerns

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks closed modestly higher Wednesday amid caution about a meeting of world leaders and as Europe continues to grapple with government debt problems.
Major indexes pared some of their early losses as technology stocks recovered and energy companies rose along with crude oil prices. Chevron and ConocoPhillips were among oil companies that gained more than 1 percent.
Not even an unexpectedly sharp drop in first-time claims for unemployment benefits, announced before the start of trading, was enough to give the market much of a lift. 
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 10.29 points, or 0.1 percent, to 11,357.04.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 5.31 points, or 0.44 percent, to 1,218.71.
The Nasdaq composite index, which is primarily made up of technology stocks, was up 15.80 points, or 0.62 percent, to 2,578.78. All three indexes had been lower in the morning.
Enthusiasm was kept in check ahead of a crucial meeting by world leaders. Members of the Group of 20will be meeting on Thursday and Friday in South Korea.
The gathering comes as countries like the United States and Japan try to stimulate economic growth, taking measures that have weakened their currencies. A global economic recovery has been slow, and many developed countries like the United States have struggled to expand at a pace that will cut high unemployment.
Major European indexes all slid as worries grew about debt problems in Ireland. The euro slipped below $1.38 and the dollar rose against other major currencies. Concerns about mounting government debt in many European countries have occasionally dragged down stocks around the world throughout the year. Countries like Ireland and Greece are facing rising debt with little signs of growth.
The dollar had been weakening against other currencies in recent weeks because of the program by the Federal Reserve to buy Treasury securities in an effort to drive interest rates lower and ignite spending and lending.
A weaker currency makes a country's exports cheaper and more attractive overseas. Japan has been especially active in trying to weaken its currency because its economy is so reliant on companies like Sony and Toyota that rely on exports.
Bond yields were marginally lower. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ended at 2.63 percent, down from 2.64 Tuesday.
The FTSE 100 in Britain closed 1 percent lower, as did the DAX index in Germany. The CAC 40 of France fell 1.5 percent.
In Asia, China's Shanghai composite index fell 0.6 percent, to 3,115.36, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng slumped 0.85 percent, to 24,500.61.
The declines in Asia and Europe came after China's central bank announced it would raise the amount of cash that banks need to hold in reserve. Also, China's leading credit rating agencylowered its view of United States debt in the wake of the Federal Reserve's latest effort to revive the economy.
The artificially low level of China's currency, the renminbi, is likely to be one of the main topics of discussion during the two-day G-20 meeting.
Investors are concerned that the decision by the People's Bank of China to raise the reserve-ratio requirements of banks by half a percentage point -- to cool lending, particularly in the overheated real estate market -- beginning next Monday will be the first in a series of tightening measures.
A day ahead of a report on inflation in China and the G-20 meeting, there were growing concerns in the markets that China is preparing to tighten policy further to dampen down on price pressures and rein in sky-high growth levels.
''The timing may well be an indication of plans for more substantial tightening in an attempt to slow economic growth,'' said Derek Halpenny, an analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average was the best performer in Asia, closing up 136.03, or 1.4 percent, at 9,830.52 as the dollar rose to near 82 yen, giving exporters some respite from a strong Japanese currency.

HEADLINE: No Bridge Too Far: Agents Move To Brooklyn

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
When David Black contemplated moving his 21-year-old literary agency to a new office space this summer, he had one nagging worry: the East River.
''Would that be a problem?'' Mr. Black said, pointing to the river from his 27th-floor office window, which boasts sweeping views of the Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan skyline. ''Is water a barrier to clients? Is it a barrier to the business? That was really the question.''
Mr. Black, 51, has taken his literary agency to Brooklyn, a move across the river that few literary agents in the Manhattan-centric publishing industry have dared to make. 
His nine-person agency, which represents heavy hitters like Mitch Albom, Jimmy Breslin and Erik Larson, set up shop in July across the street from Borough Hall in downtown Brooklyn.
Mr. Black has joined a few other literary-agent refugees from Manhattan, along with tiny boutique agencies that were founded in Brooklyn, not to mention the scores of writers, new independent bookstores and small but renowned publishers that are based there.
Susan Golomb, the agent to Jonathan Franzen and William T. Vollmann, moved her agency to Brooklyn in August after 20 years in Manhattan. ''My clients don't care where my office is,'' she said. ''At this point, if you're established enough, it's really about your list and your reputation.''
These days Brooklyn has enough writers and publishing professionals to inspire a ''Brooklyn Literary 100'' list in The New York Observer, or to be called Manhattan's Left Bank in The Economist.
''There's an inexorable drift toward Brooklyn,'' said Elyse Cheney, a literary agent who, for now, is based in SoHo. ''That's where writers are and where so many publishers live. And as the profits of the business may change through the advent of e-books, the profit margins in this industry are becoming narrower, so I would imagine that it makes both financial and artistic sense to move there.''
It used to be unthinkable that a decent literary agent would work anywhere but Manhattan. The publishing business was concentrated in fancy Midtown office towers until the 1980s, when many publishers moved to lofts and landmark buildings downtown, in SoHo, Chelsea and the Flatiron district. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, one of the publishing pioneers in Union Square, used to warn employees not to walk across the park after dark.)
''When I first started out in this business, you had to be a Manhattan agent,'' said Howard Morhaim, whose two-person agency works out of a brownstone in Brooklyn Heights. ''It didn't matter where. You just had to have a Manhattan office. Agents who were outside of Manhattan were considered second class.''
When Mr. Black founded his agency in 1990, he found office space near Madison Square, then later moved a few blocks downtown, where even more publishers and agents had relocated.
But last year, while out for a run in Red Hook, he was hit by a car, an accident that left him with a concussion, a broken thumb and a broken leg. While he was recovering, he traveled to work in a car instead of the usual subway.
''In not taking trains for a month, I realized how much more relaxed I was,'' Mr. Black said. ''So I said, let's look in Brooklyn. Let's see if we can make this work.''
The lease in his Manhattan office was up at the end of June, so he began hunting for office space in Brooklyn, a short walk from his home in Cobble Hill. The rent in a high-rise in downtown Brooklyn was slightly less expensive than in Manhattan. And the city offered him tax incentives: $3,000 per employee annually, for 12 years.
Three of Mr. Black's employees already lived in Brooklyn, so they were thrilled to make the move. A couple of others, who live in the Bronx and Jersey City, were not as happy. (Mr. Black usually takes a silver Razor scooter to work, an easy feat on uncrowded Brooklyn sidewalks.)
So far the extra distance from Manhattan has not affected his clients, many of whom live outside of New York anyway.
''I thought that ultimately, this would be a good thing for my business,'' Mr. Black said. ''It's a little bit different. Hopefully some people look at it and say, 'Hey, that's kind of cool.' ''

HEADLINE: Charities Wrestle With Tax Uncertainty

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
A GROWING number of charities are persuading donors to create a little-known kind of endowment as the troubled economy and this year's hiatus from the estate tax create problems for charities that depend on major lifetime gifts and on bequests.
Charities report that executors of some estates are showing reluctance to hand over bequests until next year, while others say they are in negotiations or even litigation over planned gifts from people who died this year without adjusting their wills to take into account the one-year suspension of the estate tax.
Meanwhile, some donors are deferring their annual gifts to next year, professional fund-raisers said, because top income tax rates may be higher, lowering the net cost of charitable gifts.
Another troubling issue for some donors is a subtle but potentially costly problem for those who created charitable remainder trusts through their wills, should they die this year. That issue could turn tax deductions into tax bills, two estate tax lawyers warned. 
All these complications come as Congress wrestles over whether to extend the Bush tax cuts and as the number of wealthy Americans who are dying and leaving significant charitable bequests is smaller because of the low birthrate in the Depression era. That will continue for some years as the even smaller group born during World War II begins running out of time.
The uncertainties about tax policy and the economy mean ''this is a time when extreme creativity is needed in philanthropy,'' said Robert F. Sharpe Jr., president of the Sharpe Group, a philanthropic planning firm based in Memphis.
Mr. Sharpe has been promoting a different kind of endowment to charities since the early 1990s. Called virtual or flexible endowments, they enable donors to hold onto their fortunes during their lifetimes while providing their causes with the same annual cash that an actual endowment would generate. Mr. Sharpe and another fund-raising expert, David R. Dunlop, who was instrumental in promoting the concept, said another advantage was that donors who were successful business owners were likely to increase the value of their assets more during the remainder of their lifetimes than a charity would.
In a traditional endowment, an individual, family or company makes a gift of assets to a charity and receives an income tax deduction.
Typically, the charity spends 5 percent of the endowment each year. An endowed chair at a university with an annual cost of $200,000 for salary, benefits, research assistants and travel would typically require an endowment gift of $4 million.
Many endowments are funded as bequests, in part because people are often unwilling to part with good chunks of their wealth during life.
Since 2000, bequests to charity from people leaving taxable estates of $20 million or more have been trending downward, Internal Revenue Service data shows. Measured in 2009 dollars, the average charitable bequest from the largest estates hit a low of $10.7 million in 2009, compared with $14.6 million in 2000.
Paul G. Schervish, director of the Center on Wealth and Philanthropy at Boston College, said the decline in bequests was accompanied by a sharp rise in lifetime giving to foundations by wealthy Americans that began in 1995. When lifetime gifts and bequests from the wealthiest Americans are combined, he says, donations show a net gain.
Virtual endowments aim to capture gifts from wealthy Americans during their lifetimes, said Mr. Dunlop, who arranged more than 40 such gifts before he retired from Cornell in 1997.
In a virtual endowment, the donor retains her or his assets instead of giving them away during life. The donor and the charity agree on a virtual endowment sum, say $4 million.
The donor then makes a gift equal to the payout that sum would provide if it were in an actual endowment. The charity tells the donor what its endowment earned so future gifts can be adjusted as spending from an actual endowment would be, he said.
For example, a university that earns a 10 percent return on a $4 million investment and spends only 5 percent would expect a check for $200,000 the first year, followed by $210,000 the second year, $220,500 the next year and so on. Mr. Dunlop said that a virtual-endowment agreement recognized that a donor's ability to give might not grow and might even diminish, so such agreements ''should be written not in legal language but in the form of a friendly letter, because the donor is your friend.''
Formal pledges are legally enforceable contracts. That has caused some problems this year.
At least three cases before probate judges concern donors who made a planned gift with language that assumed the estate tax would be in effect when they died. Typically, the language in wills of such donors provides that any ''residue'' in their estate beyond the amount exempt from the estate tax goes to a named charity. In a year when there is no estate tax, there is no residue.
In a case in Florida, said Andrew Fussner, vice president for estate settlement at the American Heart Association, ''the donor, whose will made reference to the exemption level set in the 1980s, never updated the document.'' That's a common problem, fund-raising experts and estate lawyers say.
When a donor has written to a charity and to family members indicating an intent to give a specific amount to heirs or to the charity, the charity probably has a duty to pursue the money, Mr. Fussner and others said.
''We feel that there is a certain fiduciary duty to make sure the donor's wishes are followed,'' Mr. Fussner said.
He and other charitable-giving experts said probate court judges generally told heirs and charities to negotiate settlements -- and by delaying payouts, can push both sides to reach an accord.
Executors of wills have also shown some reluctance to turn over charitable gifts this year because Congress could enact an estate tax retroactive to Jan. 1, 2010. While it is widely believed that taxes cannot be retroactive, Congress in 2006 enacted a law retroactively raising taxes on teenagers who had worked or had taxable income in an investment account to pay for college.
The Supreme Court in a 1994 case involving an heiress to the Keck oil fortune upheld a retroactive levy. The estate's lawyer, Jerry W. Carlton of O'Melveny & Myers in Los Angeles, said he had no doubt the court would uphold a retroactive reinstatement of the estate tax for 2010.
With the midterm election results, a retroactive tax on estates for 2010 seems less likely. Still, Carleen K. Rhodes, president of both the Minnesota Community Foundation and the St. Paul Foundation, said executors of two estates had recently paid out only about $3.5 million of $10 million the foundations were expecting, evidently out of concern about a retroactive tax.
Ms. Rhodes said that her foundations, with assets of nearly $1.1 billion and gifts last year of $68.5 million, had not become embroiled in any litigation over bequests because of the estate tax. However, she added, ''there are some conversations we are having'' with executors, heirs and others.
Ms. Rhodes, like other executives of charities that offered donor-advised funds, said there had been an increase in creation of funds and additions to existing funds as the stock market has recovered from its lows in the two previous years.
Jill S. Dodd, a partner at Manatt, Phelps & Phillips in San Francisco and Jane Peebles of Karlin & Peebles in Beverly Hills, Calif., identified one potential problem that might ensnare donors who created charitable remainder trusts in their wills.
In such a trust, the donor or a designee receives tax-favored income for life. Whatever remains in the trust then goes to a charity. There are tens of thousands of such trusts.
The way these trusts are created when someone dies ''is defined in the law, gifts have to be deductible and this year there is no charitable deduction for estates,'' Ms. Dodd said.
Ms. Peebles said she was surprised that the problem had been ignored, except on some specialized blogs for estate-tax lawyers, given the costly consequences. She characterized the problem as one of the ''totally unintended results'' from the wording of the 2001 Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act sponsored by the president at the time, George W. Bush.
The problem can be resolved in several ways, but both lawyers said anyone whose will established a charitable remainder trust or had one that would shift income to an heir, should contact their lawyer immediately, Ms. Dodd and Ms. Peebles said.

HEADLINE: Helping Veterans Find Civilian Jobs

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
MANY veterans are finding that jobs in this difficult economy require skills and training they do not have. Government data shows a higher unemployment rate for recent veterans than for the general population.
A number of companies, including Microsoft, Wal-Mart, J. C. Penney and Activision Blizzard, which makes Guitar Hero and other video games, have stepped up with millions of dollars for programs that provide computer skills, green expertise and health care training. Many gifts were announced this week, tied to Veterans Day.
Microsoft is giving $2 million in cash and about $4 million in software to programs that help former military members with technology skills, career counseling and job placement. 
Ross Janson, 30, who recently left the Navy after nine years, signed up for computer courses at Veterans Inc., a nonprofit group based in Worcester, Mass., after he could not find a job using the aircraft-maintenance expertise he acquired on active duty.
''I couldn't find anything as a mechanic, so I tried for just about anything else -- fast food, copy places, you name it,'' he said. He moved from the Virginia Beach area in September and found Veterans Inc., which provided him with transitional housing at a group residence and is helping him get on his feet professionally.
Mr. Janson acknowledged that he needed ''to put new skills into my bag of tricks'' if he were going to find work.
Microsoft awarded Veterans Inc. $200,000 and software to help train Mr. Janson and about 170 other vets, including some who served in the National Guard or the Reserves. Denis Leary, the group's executive director, said the grant would allow it to add more computer courses.
''We are trying to package our offerings so these vets will have a safe, affordable place to live and basic computer or other skills, so they can go out and get work to sustain themselves,'' he said.
Microsoft began its veterans initiative this year. In March, unemployment among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans was 14.7 percent, before dropping to 10.2 percent in September, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The national unemployment rate was 9 percent that month.
Microsoft chose six nonprofit groups this week, including Per Scholas Inc. in New York, for its Elevate America grants for veterans, which include transitional assistance to spouses and families.
But placing retrained veterans in jobs may be growing tougher.
Veterans Inc. had an 89 percent placement rate in the fiscal year ended in June, said Allison Alaimo, its director of finance and development, but in the three months starting in August, the rate fell by one-third, to 56 percent, in the ''extremely challenging job market.''
To help reintegrate veterans, the Wal-Mart Foundation is providing $10 million over five years to nonprofit groups, focusing on job readiness and training and higher education.
Two years ago, it donated $3.6 million to colleges and nonprofit groups, including $750,000 to a group in Denver, Veterans Green Jobs, which trains returning veterans for green industry jobs.
Josh Kemp, 30, an Army intelligence officer for eight years, including two tours in Iraq, was one beneficiary. After leaving the military, he earned a degree in psychology from Wichita State University in Kansas. But when he started looking for work in social services, he found that ''in this economy it's hard to find work with a bachelor's degree, so I searched for entry-level work in other areas, but I had no luck.''
Mr. Kemp found Veterans Green Jobs on the Internet and applied in January, moved to Colorado and trained for four months. He found work as a technician weatherizing people's homes and in July was promoted to energy auditor. Now he reviews homes of people receiving state assistance to pay their energy bills and recommends energy-saving measures.
Through partnerships with state and local agencies, and grants, the group has created about 100 jobs, said William Doe, its chief executive.
The number of unemployed veterans persuaded Robert Kotick, chief executive of Activision Blizzard, to create a $1 million foundation to help them. The company, based in Santa Monica, Calif., last week announced a second $1 million gift.
This year, the company's Call of Duty Endowment helped 1,000 veterans, he said. Other groups around the country that help veterans with career placement and transitions include Hire Heroes USA in Georgia and Pragmatic Works in Florida.
In October, J. C. Penney and the clothing brand Joseph Abboud combined for a $1 million gift for about 5,000 military veterans to buy business attire for the civilian workplace.
Another unusual, smaller effort is the Farmer-Veteran Coalition, in Davis, Calif., which tries to recruit, train and place veterans in organic and other farming.
Michael O'Gorman, its executive director, said federal data showed that 16 percent of Americans lived in rural communities, while 45 percent of the military members were from rural areas -- and faced high levels of unemployment there if they returned.
A former farmer and farm manager, Mr. O'Gorman gathered $220,000 in financing, including $50,000 from the comedian Lewis Black, to help veterans interested in farming. The coalition hosts five farming retreats, introducing around 20 veterans each session to agriculture as varied as raising organic fruits and vegetables, poultry, sheep and goats, to maintaining orchards and vineyards. It also lists farming jobs on its Web site.
After some false starts, Aaron Newsom, who spent six years in the Marine Corps, including a tour in Afghanistan, as an aircraft recovery specialist, found the Farmer-Veteran Coalition and learned of a retreat near his home in the Santa Cruz area.
''We stopped by a large garden, then an orchard with apple and pear trees, and an organic food stand,'' said Mr. Newsom, 27. ''I knew then I wanted to know the biology of it all.'' He is now studying for a horticulture degree at a community college.
''It's a kind of healing,'' said Mr. O'Gorman of veterans who decide on farming, ''and it's an income.''

HEADLINE: The Rich Are Different From You and Me. They Give More.

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
AT the top of the economic ladder, many Americans are generous with their wealth and time, supporting efforts to meet basic human needs, education, the arts, religion, the environment, animal welfare and more.
More than 98 percent of the nation's richest households give. Those in the top 3.1 percent are responsible for 60 to 75 percent of the $360 billion given for charitable work last year, said Claire Costello, national foundation executive for philanthropic management at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Her data comes from the company's 2010 Study of High Net Worth Philanthropy, which was released Tuesday. It was conducted by the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University. 
Just under 40 percent of wealthy Americans volunteered more than 200 hours last year, up from just over a quarter two years ago, said Una O. Osili, director of research at the center, who said the study was the largest of its kind.
Because it followed strict academic criteria, she said, the results were a statistically valid random sample of households nationwide with annual income of greater than $200,000 or net worth of at least $1 million, excluding primary residences.
Dr. Osili said wealthy people who volunteered also gave significantly more than those who did not in 2009. Those who did not volunteer gave an average of $46,414; those who volunteered more than 200 hours gave $75,662.
The more people identify with what they care about, Ms. Costello said, the more the cause becomes a focal point of their lives, and they encourage their children and grandchildren to be philanthropic, as well. ''It is no longer just giving what is left'' after meeting their families' needs, she said.
Still, she said, giving had declined ''in the tough economic environment'' of 2009. High-net-worth households gave a median of 3.4 percent of their income to charity, down from 3.7 percent two years earlier; the average gift declined to 9.1 percent of income from 11.1 percent.
Ms. Costello also said that when a disaster like the Haitian earthquake occurs, people give spontaneously in addition to their planned gifts. Tax deductions, while welcome, were not the driving force in philanthropy, she said.
The new study (the third the university center has done for the bank, with the previous two in 2005 and 2007), does far more to explore attitudes and motivation than its predecessors, looking at ''not only the demographics, but also the psychographics,'' Ms. Costello said.
''I spend a lot of time with clients on grants, grant requirements, monitoring payouts,'' she said. ''I work with clients every day. Their question is always, 'What is everybody else doing?' That is the viral part of giving.''
Among the survey's findings are:
When couples give, 41 percent confer and decide on their gifts together; 26 percent confer but one makes the decisions; for 16 percent, one makes the decisions for both, and for another 16 percent each person makes his or her own decision.
Philanthropists are far more willing to take risks with their personal investments than with the money they have invested for charity through private foundations, donor-advised funds and trusts. With personal assets, 35 percent were willing to take substantial or above-average risk, while only 23 percent would do so with philanthropic assets. Twenty-six percent would take no risk with the philanthropic funds, compared with 10 percent on personal holdings.
Wealthy people expressed far more confidence in nonprofit organizations' ability to solve societal or global problems than in the ability of individuals, businesses or government to solve such problems. Just under 95 percent expressed some or a great deal of confidence in nonprofit organizations, compared with 89 percent voicing confidence in individuals, 68 percent in corporations, 58 percent in the federal government and 32 percent in Congress.
The top motivation for deciding where to give money, cited by 72 percent, was the belief that their gift would ''make a difference,'' followed by feeling financially secure themselves and the belief that an organization was efficiently run, each with 71 percent. More than half the donors cited political or philosophical beliefs for giving, 39 percent religious beliefs and just under 5 percent business interests.
Big donors generally sought advice from one or more professionals, with 68 percent turning to accountants, 41 percent to lawyers, 39 percent to wealth advisers and 12 percent to bank or trust company staff.
Last year, 35 percent stopped supporting one organization they had previously supported, 27 percent two organizations and 38 percent three or more. Just over one-third decided to support other organizations, while 29 percent said household circumstances had changed.
But the biggest reason for discontinuing support, cited by 59 percent, was ''too frequent solicitation.''

HEADLINE: In Case of Disaster, Carriers Stand Ready to Airlift Aid

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
WAYNE YANKOVICH was at his home in Indianapolis on his day off when he heard that an earthquake had just struck Haiti. His wife, Louise, was downstairs watching CNN and immediately relayed the news.
Mr. Yankovich, who works as a loadmaster in FedEx's charter division, knew he might be asked to fly soon. So he called his boss, Walter Hooker, at the company's headquarters in Memphis and volunteered for any relief missions. Within a few hours, he was told to get to Miami in 48 hours to meet an MD-11 airliner arriving from Denver that was filled with relief supplies collected by World Vision, a Christian group dedicated to eradicating poverty.
Because the airport in Port-au-Prince could not handle so large a plane, the airliner crew flew to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic, from where the supplies would be trucked into Haiti. The crew then flew to Panama to pick up another load of supplies at an American Red Cross warehouse and brought it back to Santo Domingo.
The relief mission was one of hundreds that FedEx, U.P.S., D.H.L. and other carriers and airlines fly every year. The airlines pick up supplies around the United States, and from countries like Denmark and Dubai, and carry them to places as diverse as Haiti, Chile, Pakistan and the Gulf Coast. 
In most cases, the airlines transport the supplies free, part of a growing pool of in-kind donations they make each year. Each year, FedEx sets aside space for as much as four million pounds of charitable shipping. Last year, the airline helped 172 organizations ship 107 tons of relief goods.
Jumping on a plane for a whirlwind trip to three countries was nothing new for Mr. Yankovich. But the mission this time was more meaningful. ''It sure is different because you know you're doing something good, and you know that the items you're bringing in are going to be used for a different purpose, to help human beings,'' said Mr. Yankovich, who has worked at FedEx for 22 years. ''At the end of the day, you come back and say, 'I really think I've helped someone.' ''
This year, FedEx has donated more than $1.9 million in cash and in-kind transportation for relief and recovery in Haiti, moving more than 1.5 million pounds of supplies. After the earthquake in Sichuan, China, in 2008, FedEx delivered $1.5 million worth of relief supplies from Heart to Heart, a development organization. The airline shipped two million pounds of relief products to the Gulf Coast during the 2005 hurricane season.
In all, charitable giving (including cash and in-kind donations) came to 1.5 percent of pretax profits last fiscal year, excluding one-time charges, up from 1.1 percent in fiscal year 2008.
On average, American corporations donate 0.9 percent of their pretax profits. The growing in-kind giving by airlines and other companies helped offset a 3.6 percent decline in overall giving in 2009, according to GivingUSA, which tracks philanthropy.
In the last three years, U.P.S. has shipped hundreds of tons of relief supplies to Myanmar, China, Zimbabwe and Haiti, as well as to states affected by flooding and hurricanes. To Haiti, U.P.S. delivered more then three million pounds of materials, including water, water purification systems, medical supplies, generators and tents.
American Airlines made more than $34 million in in-kind donations to nonprofit groups in 2009. After the earthquake in Haiti, American and American Eagle flew in 400,000 pounds of aid and evacuated more than 700 people on 30 humanitarian flights.
American Airlines, which has been in Haiti for about 40 years, also helped rebuild Toussaint L'Ouverture International Airport, which had been recertified by the F.A.A. American also converted its cargo terminal into an international arrivals building.
''This is getting into the fiber of the country and picking it up with your hands,'' said Art Torno, who ran the Caribbean region for American Airlines when the earthquake hit. ''We're not just an airline, but an economic engine that powers cargo and people.''
In years past, relief efforts were organized ad hoc. After disaster struck, charities would call the airlines asking them to carry supplies to those in need. It could take days to sort out whether the relief supplies were needed in the disaster zone and getting the supplies to the airport and distributed.
But shipping relief supplies from Point A to Point B has become far more orderly, with entire staffs working with charities, finding planes and crews to transport the supplies and ensuring that the right goods get to those who need them most.
FedEx has perhaps the most extensive system for accepting and shipping relief supplies. To reduce confusion, the carrier has selected five primary charities -- the American Red Cross, the Salvation Army, Water Missions, Direct Relief and Heart to Heart International.
''It's better to figure out what FedEx is doing rather than recreate the wheel,'' said Brett Williams, the director of disaster response at Direct Relief International. ''FedEx pushes us to think bigger because they operate on a global scale.''
FedEx has 15 meteorologists and other staff members who monitor news and weather reports -- a useful early warning system in the event of emergencies. When disaster strikes, flight operations managers assign crew members, who typically volunteer to fly charter flights when needed. (Crews are paid, but sometimes give up their vacation days.) Sometimes, they fight through red tape to get landing and fly-through rights.
On charter flights to places where FedEx does not have operations, including Port-au-Prince, loadmasters like Mr. Yankovich tally the cargo, load and unload it and handle customs issues.
''We're the 911 line for FedEx,'' said Paul Tronsor, the managing director for the FedEx Global Operations Control, which is responsible for all FedEx aircraft and large vehicles. ''There are very few things that we've not seen and had a plan for.''
FedEx, for example, ships supplies from Heart to Heart's warehouse to disaster areas anywhere in the world within one to three days. In 2007, FedEx helped move $107 million in medical supplies for the group, which has sent disaster relief to countries from China to Honduras. Heart to Heart is now building storage at FedEx hubs in France and China to further speed up the shipment of relief supplies.
''When you have products stored in these other facilities, it expedites it even further,'' said Andre T. Butler, the chief executive of Heart to Heart, whose headquarters is in Olathe, Kan. ''They'll send it free of charge. If we had to go purchase that, we wouldn't exist.''
During the last two decades, companies have systemized their in-kind giving to satisfy shareholders who want charitable giving to have a positive impact on their bottom line, according to Dwight F. Burlingame, the associate executive director of the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University.
For airlines and other companies, helping people in need in less developed countries is not just for tax breaks and good P.R., but also a way to build bonds in fast-growing markets where they hope to expand.
At home, airlines and other logistics companies are also helping charities streamline their operations so they can become more efficient at all times. U.P.S., for instance, has helped the Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere, known as CARE, install software that tracks supplies in all its warehouses.
''In many corporations, they look at doing a little of this and a little of that,'' said Helene D. Gayle, the chief executive of CARE. ''They were able to help us so we could get help to people quicker.''

HEADLINE: China Still Bans Rare Earths for Japan, Executives Say

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Hiroko Tabuchi contributed reporting from Tokyo.

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The Chinese government is continuing to block shipments of crucial strategic minerals to Japan, according to industry executives, analysts and a Japanese official.
The blocked shipments of minerals known as rare earths, despite previous signals that China was lifting the ban, could increase tensions at the meeting of the Group of 20 leading economic powers, now under way in Seoul, South Korea. And it could place China at odds with Germany, which has been an outspoken critic of the rare earths policy but has recently been an ally of China's on a separate matter that is a hot topic for the G-20 -- the weak United States dollar.
The continuation of China's unannounced embargo against Japan highlights the delicate balance that Beijing officials are trying to strike as world leaders converge on Seoul. Chinese customs and port officials have been blocking exports of raw rare earths to Japan for seven weeks, despite suggesting in late October that they were about to allow a resumption of shipments.
Rare earth shipments to the United States and Europe did resume, after a brief suspension in October. 
But for Japan, ''as far as we're aware, that temporary ban, although still unofficial, remains in place,'' Dudley Kingsnorth, an Australian rare earths consultant, said in a speech in Hong Kong on Wednesday morning. Mr. Kingsnorth and many executives in the rare earth industry spoke at the annual industry conference here organized by two British companies, Roskill Information Services and Metal Events Ltd.
Rare earths are essential for a wide variety of products, including wind turbines and smartphones, gasoline-electric hybrid cars, oil refining and the tiny electric motors that control the guidance fins on missiles and smart bombs.
Beijing officials have sought this autumn to assert their country's interests more fully within Asia, across a range of issues. They successfully demanded the return of a Chinese fishing captain detained by Japan near Japanese-controlled islands, and they have insisted on sovereignty over much of the South China Sea, to the dismay of countries like Vietnam and the Philippines.
But they have also been seeking international allies to confront the United States on currency policy. A result has been a sometimes contradictory set of positions, with China aligning itself with Germany in particular on some issues and against Germany on others.
The German government and a broad range of German companies have led international calls for the Group of 20 to discuss China's broad restrictions this year on all exports of rare earths, not just to Japan. A wide range of German manufacturers depend on rare earths, and China produces 95 percent of the world's supply.
But at the same time, Germany and China have been among the most vocal critics of the Federal Reserve's recent decision to buy more long-term Treasury bonds. The Fed's so-called quantitative easing could cause a decline in the dollar in currency markets, which by making American exports cheaper could eventually erode both Germany's and China's large trade surpluses.
After blocking all shipments of rare earth minerals to Japan since Sept. 21, and some shipments to the United States and Europe as well beginning in mid-October, Chinese customs officials abruptly began granting approval on Oct. 28 for most exports to resume.
But a day later, Chinese port officials quietly began blocking the loading of ships with containers of rare earths destined for Japan. That reversal came after high-level China-Japan talks in Hanoi on Oct. 29 failed to produce a thaw in bilateral relations, industry executives and analysts said.
Several industry executives said that they had initially interpreted the port difficulties as a minor logistical problem and a coincidence. This week, though, they say it appears to be a continuation of a ban that began seven weeks ago.
Normal shipments have resumed to the United States and Europe, three rare earth industry executives said in interviews on the sidelines of the industry conference here, which began on Wednesday and ends on Thursday. And Chinese customs officials have been more willing to process the paperwork for shipments to Japan in the past week, executives said, even as the actual loading of vessels is now suspended.
Japan had no official confirmation that rare earth shipments from China resumed even briefly at the end of October, a senior Trade Ministry official said in Tokyo. The official, who demanded anonymity, said that rare earth shipments to Japan continued to be held up at Chinese ports and that the Japanese government had not seen any signs that trade would be normalized in recent weeks.
Japan, the biggest importer of rare earths, is still asking China to clarify and correct the situation, the official said. He added that it was Japan's understanding that the United States shared its concern over China's action, and would continue to seek opportunities to discuss and cooperate on the issue.
He said that ministry officials expected the issue to be raised by Prime Minister Naoto Kan of Japan at two conferences this week by heads of state: the G-20 session in Seoul on Thursday and Friday, and a weekend meeting in Yokohama, Japan, under the auspices of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.
Mark A. Smith, the chief executive of Molycorp, which owns and is trying to reopen the main American rare earths mine at Mountain Pass, Calif., said at the conference in Hong Kong that he had been working with White House officials on rare earth issues in connection with President Obama's trip to Asia. It is ''highly likely'' that Mr. Obama will raise the issue with President Hu Jintao of China when the two meet in Seoul, Mr. Smith said.
China's commerce ministry has denied repeatedly that a regulatory ban on exports has been imposed.
Most rare earths are not actually rare. But China dominates world production because the rare earths in its major ore deposits are unusually easy to extract for geological reasons. China has also been more willing than other countries until recent months to accept the environmental damage that often accompanies rare earth mining.
Prices have surged up to ninefold this year for some rare earths, as China sharply reduced its export quotas in July and then began blocking companies in late September from using their export quotas for shipments to Japan. Mr. Kingsnorth and Roskill Information Services predicted in their annual market forecast, released at the industry meeting Wednesday, that rare earth demand would grow a little less quickly in the next five years than previously predicted.
Users of rechargeable batteries, including automakers with hybrid cars like the Toyota Prius, are responding to high prices and shortages by accelerating a shift to lithium ion batteries instead of nickel-metal-hydride batteries, which require lanthanum, a rare earth. But demand for rare earths is still accelerating for clean energy industries like wind turbines, Mr. Kingsnorth said.
George Bauk, the managing director of Northern Uranium of Australia, said that after his company announced last winter that it had located a rare earth deposit in Australia, a Chinese state-owned company made an offer in August to buy 51 percent of Northern Uranium. The Australian company declined the offer as its share prices rose, but a Chinese mining magnate then bought 13.5 percent of its stock on the open market in September, Mr. Bauk said.
The same Chinese state-owned company, East China Exploration, did buy 25 percent of Arafura, another Australian rare earths company, in a deal last year. Another Chinese state-owned company reached a deal last year to buy nearly 52 percent of Lynas Corporation, which plans to open a large rare earths mine in central Australia next year, but the Australian government blocked that deal on national security grounds.
Chinese state-owned companies have also made three unsuccessful approaches in the past five years to acquire the Mountain Pass mine in California. By contrast, the Chinese government does not allow any foreign purchases of minority or majority stakes in its rare earth mining sector.

HEADLINE: After 92 Days of No Lights, Seeing One at End of Tunnel

BYLINE: By JUSTIN G. SULLIVAN

 BODY:
Though it has been the site of some hard times, Cherry DeLeon's Harlem apartment feels warm and inviting. Soft R&B plays on the stereo. The walls are covered in bright colors and decorative touches. On the bedroom wall hang two framed portraits of a younger Ms. DeLeon, with crimped, bleached hair and a style straight from the 1980s.
''That was my heyday,'' she says, smiling as she recalls those early days in New York, when the city was filled with friends and nights were spent dancing at the Garage, the legendary club where Madonna got her start. 
It was a hopeful time. Ms. DeLeon, 43, had immigrated to New York from Jamaica in 1983, after friends told her about the opportunities here. ''But,'' she added with a sigh, ''stress changes things.''
She has had her share. In 2006, she was laid off from her full-time job as the executive receptionist at a Wall Street law firm. She was able to make ends meet with the income from her second job, a part-time position at another law firm. But medical problems, including diabetes, chronic back pain and insomnia, made keeping up with her bills a struggle. And then the lights went out.
It was not the first problem with her mentally unstable upstairs neighbor. Ms. DeLeon said the man whose apartment was directly above hers had held his girlfriend hostage in his closet the previous year. Then in 2008, he barricaded himself inside his apartment, turned on all the faucets and left the stove running for hours. By the time the police removed him, the building's electrical system had shorted out, and Ms. DeLeon's kitchen, bathroom and bedroom closet were under two inches of water.
The blackout lasted 92 days. ''It was devastating,'' she said. The building was dark for the holidays, and repairs were sporadic.
Unable to cook at home, Ms. DeLeon was paying more for food. Tenants were expected to pay full rent -- a class action lawsuit was filed in April against the owner of her building -- and Ms. DeLeon's was $745 per month. Her part-time job paid about $1,000 a month, and she received $200 a month in food stamps. The cost of her co-pay for doctor visits and her prescription drug bills made for a balancing act. After surgery in 2009, the bills became unmanageable.
''I have a lot of respect for myself and I lead a very simple life,'' she said. ''But it just felt hopeless. So, I began reaching out.''
Ms. DeLeon contacted the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of seven beneficiaries of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. With a grant of $581.98 from the fund, she was able to begin to manage her finances.
Today, the apartment is bright, and Ms. DeLeon smiles easily. But recent events have taken a toll. In June, she was laid off from her part-time job of 11 years -- by phone. ''I took a lot of pride in my job and was very loyal,'' she said quietly. ''So that has been rough.''
She is living off her savings, unemployment insurance of $332 per week and her Medicaid coverage. Still, hope pervades. ''At least I'm able to sit here and smile,'' she said.
She said she found solace in her daily workouts and keeping up with her doctor appointments.
Looking at the pictures on her wall, Ms. DeLeon spoke of a return to the dance floor.
''My spirits are picking up,'' she said. And while the electricity still occasionally shorts out, Ms. DeLeon is hopeful that the worst of the darkness is behind her.
HOW TO HELP: Checks payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund may be sent to 4 Chase Metrotech Center, 7th Floor East, Lockbox 5193, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11245.
