HEADLINE: Latecomers, Flocking to the Party

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
AFTER long spurning the bull market for fear of being burned again, investors have finally given in this year. They have abandoned their aversion to stock funds, pouring more money into them in January than in any other month ever.
The $65.5 billion of net investment in equity mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that month appeared to give the market fresh momentum, culminating in a first-quarter gain of 10 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. That benchmark ended the quarter at a record high, topping the previous peak of October 2007.
Strong fund flows, however, often herald significant bear markets. In fact, history's second-biggest month for net investment in stock funds was February 2000, just before the technology bubble crashed. Today's inflows may well be a bearish signal, too, though many investment advisers say stocks have two things going for them that they didn't have then, or even when the S.& P. 500 last set a record. Valuations are more reasonable than in the first instance, they say, and economic and financial fundamentals sounder than in the second. 
Some analysts express surprise at the suddenness and steepness of the current rally. While they find the backdrop more benign than before the financial crisis, they note that the economy isn't exactly sizzling. And they point out that the new converts to stocks would have fared better by not waiting for the market to double from its 2009 low before jumping in. Still, there is a widespread belief that the advance has further to go.
''I think it's justified on a couple of levels,'' said Gene L. Needles Jr., the chief executive of American Beacon Advisors. ''The fundamentals favor equities over alternative asset classes, and the S.& P. 500, compared to its history, is neither underpriced nor overpriced. The market has a long way to run before investors become concerned.''
Mr. Needles added that the affection for stocks bore the hallmarks of a mature relationship more than a giggly teenage crush.
''Investors are ignoring short-term headlines and looking longer term,'' he said. ''They're behaving more like investors and less like traders. In the past they didn't have the emotional mind-set to do that.''
Bob Turner, chairman and chief investment officer of Turner Investments, agreed. Whether it is a matter of common sense or desensitization, investors seem to him less prone to react to every piece of news coming out of places like Washington and Europe.
''We always have these crises that cause the stock market to go down -- the U.S. debt downgrade in 2011, then Europe last year,'' he said. ''It just feels as if these macroeconomic issues are becoming less important.''
THERE were plenty such issues to consider in the first quarter. The so-called fiscal cliff was averted in January, but a majority of taxpayers were still hit with higher rates, mainly on payroll taxes. A package of federal spending reductions, known as the sequestration and approved in 2011, took effect. Europe sank deeper into recession. And in late March, the latest chapter in the euro zone crisis played out as Cyprus was rescued, but only after an agreement to make large bank depositors pay part of the cost.
Throughout the quarter, as for much of the market's run from its 2009 low, the Federal Reserve continued to pump money into the economy, aiming to buttress it. The market's remaining skeptics might say that this is good reason to mark this rally with an asterisk -- and that there will be a price to pay for it sooner or later.
Mr. Turner suspects that investors have been focusing instead on the steady growth of corporate profits. Standard & Poor's estimates that operating earnings per share for the S.& P. 500 companies reached $96.83 in 2012, a record high, and analysts predict a figure of $111.14 for this year.
What becomes more important than politics and other outside developments ''is whether companies can report good earnings,'' he said, adding: ''Profit growth is impressive and should persist. Companies had to go through two recessions in a decade. They've gotten very focused; they de-emphasized lines of business that they didn't have opportunities in and accumulated massive cash holdings. That's really the driver, this corporate profit story.''
Saira Malik, head of equity research at TIAA-CREF, highlights a related subplot: a gradually improving economic backdrop that is not fully factored into stock valuations.
''There are a lot of great underpinnings for the stock market, such as strong housing prices, a pretty healthy labor market'' and readings of manufacturing activity that are ''a good sign of economic expansion,'' she said. ''How do we know this isn't priced in? The S.& P. 500 price-earnings ratio remains below the median of the past couple of decades.''
The run to new highs in the first quarter produced a 9.9 percent average return for general domestic stock funds in Morningstar's database. Portfolios that focus on health care, cyclical industrial companies and energy and consumer industries fared best. Other natural-resource and communications funds lagged.
The average bond fund produced an underwhelming gain of 0.8 percent in the period, as the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond edged up to 1.85 percent from 1.76 percent.
The increase in yields is also related to the reduced fear in the markets. Charles de Vaulx, chief investment officer at International Value Advisers, said investors were aware last year that bond yields were so low that they were bound to go up, reducing prices. They bought them anyway because they thought stocks would fare even worse.
''People would rather have lost money than buy equities,'' he said. ''That became absurd, so we have seen institutions and individuals stop putting as much money into bonds and putting more into equities.''
Investors may have put their concerns to one side during the quarter, but the problems didn't vanish. Ms. Malik cautioned that any of several troublesome factors could return to occupy center stage.
''A lot of things could cause uncertainty,'' she said. ''Consumer spending has been very strong, but we think consumers dipped into their savings in the quarter. Spending could slow, and that could hurt the stock market.''
Geopolitical threats could pop up, perhaps related to Iran or North Korea, she warned. The risk remains of a significant slowdown in China. In Europe, meanwhile, ''the issue is they take one step forward and we're not sure if they're taking two steps back,'' she said. ''They continue to hobble along on crutches.''
Many foreign stock markets limped through the first quarter, holding back international stock funds; the average one was up 3.5 percent. Europe portfolios gained 2 percent, and emerging-market funds lost 0.1 percent. Japan was a bright spot, with an average gain of 15.2 percent.
The comparative strength of American stocks has occurred even though net mutual fund investment was nearly twice as great for international portfolios as for domestic ones in the first two months of 2013, the latest period for which Morningstar had compiled data.
The public's fascination with international markets ''has been a curse, not a blessing, for investors,'' said William Smead, chief executive and chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management. ''The people who are doing well are domestically oriented and optimistic about the American economy for the next five years.''
Mr. Smead, whose Smead Value fund gets Morningstar's top rating of five stars, is one of those. He expects rebounds in housing and auto sales to help propel a broad-based recovery that will include an acceleration of job creation.
He says he advises owning shares of large companies with strong brands and ''addicted customers'' -- companies like Disney, McDonald's, Comcast and Starbucks. Other favorites include banks with big domestic customer bases, including Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, and drug makers like Amgen, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer and Merck.
Mr. Smead says he is avoiding the energy, materials and heavy-industrial sectors ''because they all suckle on China.''
BIG drug makers also appeal to Ms. Malik. They are defensive holdings, but their strong pipelines of new drugs make them good choices for investors who want to play offense, too, in her view. Her other preferred sectors include global auto manufacturing and chemicals.
Mr. Turner is another who emphasizes assets tied to continued economic expansion. He favors stocks over bonds generally, and especially likes technology, financial services and cyclical industrial companies.
Tech is ''as undervalued as it has ever been,'' he said. He pointed to a major shift in the marketplace, away from personal computers and toward cloud computing and mobile devices. That could give an edge to companies like Google, Samsung and Qualcomm, he predicted, at the expense of Microsoft, Dell and Intel.
Mr. De Vaulx said he was ''defensive, but I still feel a desire to own equities.'' That desire is tempered with skepticism about how long inflation and interest rates can remain well-behaved.
Concern about an inflation resurgence has steered him into industries -- like freight forwarding, catering and advertising -- where companies can raise prices easily and expand without having to invest a lot of capital. As for the broad market, he likes it but isn't ready to fall in love with it.
''This is the best of all possible worlds as long as interest rates stay low,'' he said. ''But I'm old enough to feel unease and suspicion that this rosy environment we live in is too good to be true and may not last forever. I'm not willing to be fully invested.''

HEADLINE: Beneath the Kilt, a Modern Scotland

BYLINE: By GRAHAM FULLER

 BODY:
In the new comedy ''The Angels' Share'' four young unemployed Glaswegians dressed in kilts set out on a journey into the Scottish Highlands. The soundtrack even features the infectious anthem ''I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)'' by their countrymen the Proclaimers. But these miscreants could not belong less to the mountains and glens north of the Highland line.
No, this is a Ken Loach film, and though it's sympathetic to the plight of the unemployed, one of the director's long-running concerns, ''The Angels' Share'' is also a fish-out-of-water satire about Scots in Scotland. And that, as it turns out, has also been one of Mr. Loach's longtime themes, albeit one seldom noted during his five decades of making movies.
In the film Robbie (Paul Brannigan) has renounced violence and is desperate for work. Sentenced to community service for a transgression, he befriends the fellow scofflaws Albert, Mo and Rhino. 
When their community-service supervisor, Harry (John Henshaw), gives his crew members a break by taking them on a tour of a distillery and subsequently to a tasting in Edinburgh, Robbie discovers he has a connoisseur's nose for whisky. He and his friends hatch a harebrained plan to steal a cask of Malt Mill (named for an Islay distillery that closed in 1962) that's expected to sell for £1 million at an auction.
To allay suspicion on their Highland trek the four disguise themselves in kilts as ''whisky train-spotters.'' It takes a French tourist to tell Rhino he is wearing his backward. Albert's sporran (the pouch that hangs over a kilt-wearer's groin) bruises his private parts. A close-up suggests Robbie is awed by a vista of a loch. The gormless Albert is confused by his first sight of Edinburgh Castle.
''The point was to show that the Sir Walter Scott image of kilts and sporrans bears no reality to the lives of ordinary Scottish people,'' Mr. Loach said in a telephone interview from London. ''The Highlands are a force of nature not to be parodied, but the use of Highland scenes and tartan on shortbread tins and of Edinburgh Castle on millions of postcards is largely an invention of the tourist industry.''
''The Angels' Share,'' an IFC film opening in Manhattan on Friday, is the 10th full-length film that the English Mr. Loach has made with the Scottish screenwriter Paul Laverty, and the fifth they have made in Mr. Laverty's homeland. ''There's a quaint view of Scotland -- all kilts, bagpipes, whisky, misty mountains and clear streams,'' Mr. Laverty said recently. ''The kids in the film take advantage of all that through their wit and streetwiseness.''
In preparation Mr. Laverty talked with community-service workers and learned that ''all of them drank cheap supermarket alcohol, but few had tasted Scotland's national drink,'' which is promoted internationally by a £4 billion industry. And few had visited the romantic parts of the Highlands and islands, where whisky is distilled.
Jonathan Murray, who teaches film at Edinburgh College of Art, noted that ''The Angels' Share'' is not the first Loach and Laverty film to place modern city dwellers on the rural terrain of Scotland's semi-mythical past.
''The idea that there is a heritage version of Scotland that exists for the delectation of tourists, not locals, is a consistent refrain within their Scottish-set work,'' Mr. Murray said in an e-mail. In their 1996 film, ''Carla's Song,'' a bus driver ''literally gets mired when he transplants his double-decker from the mean streets of Glasgow to the country lanes of Loch Lomond.''
David Archibald, who teaches film at Glasgow University, is studying ''The Angels' Share.'' ''Kilts and tartan are the objects that have been picked up and spat back, in some ways, at Scottish culture,'' he said. ''Loach and Laverty subvert them but also show the disconnect that exists between them and people at the bottom of Scottish society.''
He cited a scene in ''My Name Is Joe'' (1998) that shows how these two filmmakers juxtaposed images of stereotypical Scottishness with impoverished Scots ''to call into question precisely the touristic image which is broadcast abroad.''
The title character, a recovering alcoholic returning to Glasgow from a drug deal, stops to buy tea from a van parked in Glencoe, famous for its gloomy beauty and the 1692 clan MacDonald massacre by a British regiment. Irked by a bagpiper playing to Japanese tourists there, Joe and the tea vendor wryly remark on the piper's knowing only three songs, all heritage anthems. ''I'll lay odds he sells shortbread,'' Joe deadpans.
In ''The Angels' Share'' Mr. Loach reveals a documentarian's reverence for the artisanal craft of whisky distilling (''angels' share'' is a distillers' term for the 2 percent of whisky that vaporizes annually as it matures), but he draws a line at the motives of top-end buyers. ''The production is based on the subtlety, fine judgment and toil of working people,'' he said. ''Yet nobody's taste buds are that refined that they can justify spending a million pounds on a few mouthfuls of a drink. It's not related to the taste or the quality; it's related to the status of owning it.''
Now in the 51st year of his career Mr. Loach, Britain's most resolute left-wing filmmaker, would not concede that Robbie and his friends' Robin Hood-like acquisition of some whisky amounts to a socialist redistribution of wealth. ''It's just a little tale,'' he said, allowing that their larceny ''exposes the hypocrisy of the man who's spending the money.''
His new documentary, ''The Spirit of '45,'' which opened in Britain in March, can be connected thematically to ''The Angels' Share.'' It celebrates the 1945-51 Labour government's creation of the welfare state and its nationalization policy, which created thousands of jobs. It also traces how Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government dismantled public ownership through privatization, leading to the highest unemployment since the 1930s.
In Mr. Loach's view, had Scottish mines, shipyards and factories not suffered widespread closures during the Thatcher years, the generation represented by Robbie might have prospered.
''They are the second generation of unemployed victims from the 1980s,'' Mr. Loach said. ''Industries successful in one period will inevitably not succeed in another, but the problem was that there was no plan to bring work in. It was just left to the marketplace, which failed, leading to mass unemployment.''
''Now capitalism invades every part of life,'' he added, regretfully.

HEADLINE: How Texas Became Texas And Why It Matters

BYLINE: By BRYAN BURROUGH

 BODY:
AS a Texas-raised journalist, I can tell you two things with confidence about my native state. One, its economy has been humming nicely for years. Two, this appears to greatly offend a certain breed of Northern writer, several of whom have descended on the state in an attempt to rebut stories of a ''Texas miracle.'' Their reports, Erica Grieder writes, have contributed to ''a widespread impression that Texas is corrupt, callous, racist, theocratic, stupid, belligerent, and most of all, dangerous.''
This is nothing new, as most any Texan will tell you. But Ms. Grieder, a onetime correspondent for The Economist who now works at Texas Monthly, and a Texan herself, has written a smart little book that counters much of this silliness, and explains why the Texas economy is thriving. It's called ''Big, Hot, Cheap and Right: What America Can Learn from the Strange Genius of Texas'' (PublicAffairs, $26.99). The sad truth, alas, is that it's probably a lot easier to understand the successes of Texas than it would be to duplicate them. 
What might be copied, Ms. Grieder indicates, is the so-called Texas model -- that is, a weak state government with few taxes and fewer regulations and services. It would be far harder to replicate the state's civic DNA, which features traits that can be traced to its decade, beginning in 1836, as a stand-alone nation (independent, suspicious of Washington), the late-1800s cowboy era (self-reliant, fraternal) and the 20th-century introduction of oil and entrepreneurialism (pro-business, skeptical of government). Those values, Ms. Grieder says, created a populace ideal for economic growth: ''pragmatic, fiscally conservative, socially moderate and slightly disengaged.''
This is a refreshing book on many levels. Outside writers have been regularly caricaturing the state since the novelist Edna Ferber introduced America to postwar Texas with ''Giant'' in 1952. The canon ranges from ''The Super-Americans,'' by John Bainbridge (1961), to ''As Texas Goes ... : How the Lone Star State Hijacked the American Agenda,'' by Gail Collins, a New York Times columnist (2012). Ms. Grieder's is the rare book that takes stock of the Texas model without ridiculing many of its traditions and politicians.
I tend to look askance at an analysis that attributes a company's or a state's success to events two centuries ago, but Ms. Grieder's history lessons are persuasive. Texas's laissez-faire mix of weak government, low taxes and scant regulations is deeply rooted in its 1876 Constitution, which was an attempt to vehemently dismantle an oppressive post-Civil War government of radical reconstructionists. Texas business interests flourished after turn-of-the-century legislators passed an early antitrust law, which kept much of its oil and natural resources squarely under local control.
Historically, Ms. Grieder writes: ''Texas wasn't a straightforward pro-business state. It was (and is) pro-Texas business.''
More recently, the state's economic boom has been a mix of luck and good planning. Strict lending laws allowed Texas to dodge the worst of the housing collapse, while the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement was a boon to the state's export sector.
But ''the secret ingredient,'' Ms. Grieder writes, has been the industrial policy of Gov. Rick Perry, offering a generous broth of subsidies and incentives that Texas has used to attract hundreds of businesses that have richly diversified its traditional energy-based economy. This has had the added benefit of insulating Texas from the ups and downs of oil prices.
''The Texas model isn't an accident, in other words, even if the state Constitution does call for a very stark version of it,'' Ms. Grieder says. ''Texas has a long tradition of looking outside the government for support -- and often finding it. That predates the Texas revolution and was reinforced by the rise of the cattle kingdom and the oil booms.''
Systems and laws aside, Ms. Grieder emphasizes, the crucial component in the Texas boom has been its people, who tend -- forget stereotypes -- to be tolerant, optimistic and results-oriented. It's no accident that Houston, a city sometimes caricatured as a haven for obnoxious right-wingers, in 2009 became the country's largest city to elect an openly gay mayor. The state has benefited from waves of immigration, beginning after the Civil War and persisting to this day.
As outsiders, successful immigrants tend to be hard-working and self-sufficient, and the state's pro-business culture has made their jobs easier at every turn. Non-Texans tend to look at glib right-wing Texas politicians like Governor Perry -- and many others -- and assume that the Texas electorate must be similar.
In fact, Ms. Grieder demonstrates, Texas voters are notoriously ambivalent about politics, in large part because the state Constitution gives politicians so little power. As a result, even the worst Texas leaders tend to do little damage.
''Texans are, ultimately, a pragmatic people,'' she writes. ''Politicians and their excesses can be justified by the economy alone. And that's one area where no one's been disappointed. So maybe it doesn't matter if the state's leaders breathe fire, pray for rain, turn up at Tea Party rallies and spend all day suing the federal government. How crazy is that, really? Texas is a pretty good place to live; that's why several million people have moved here since the beginning of this century.''
This is a good book, and Ms. Grieder's clear, vivid writing makes it downable in a single afternoon. I have only one bone to pick. Ms. Grieder has graciously mentioned a book of mine in her footnotes. Unfortunately, she misspells my last name. And my first. But one can overlook minor errors. This is a promising debut from a promising young author.

HEADLINE: The Superhero Who Leapt Color Lines

BYLINE: By DANA JENNINGS

 BODY:
Watching the movie ''42'' brings to mind the ending to John Ford's fine 1962 western, ''The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.'' A newspaperman (and the viewer) has learned from James Stewart the truth about who really gunned down the evil Valance years before. But rather than run with the story, the newsman rips it up and flings it into the stove. His reason? ''When the legend becomes fact,'' he says, ''print the legend.''
While ''Valance'' is pure fiction, it raises the hard question that faces any maker of a biopic: Do I print the legend or print the fact?
The makers of ''42,'' about Jackie Robinson's breaking Major League Baseball's color barrier in 1947 with the Brooklyn Dodgers, tipped their hand well before the movie's scheduled release this Friday. A movie billboard in Midtown Manhattan reads, ''The true story of an American legend.'' 
There's nothing wrong in playing the legend card. But legends, by their very nature, are two-dimensional, and Robinson was a complicated, multifaceted man.
What unfolds in ''42'' -- written and directed by Brian Helgeland, who won a screenwriting Oscar for ''L.A. Confidential'' (1997) -- is a mostly Rockwellian portrait that feels like an old-fashioned Hollywood movie: ''Mr. Robinson Goes to the Major Leagues.'' Harrison Ford's Branch Rickey, the white baseball executive who brought Robinson to the majors, is gruff and avuncular. Chadwick Boseman's Jackie Robinson is fierce and noble as he simmers and silently faces down the racists and the skeptics.
The movie closes on a resounding upbeat. Led by their brave black rookie, who played in 151 games and batted a sturdy .297 to start his Hall of Fame career, the Dodgers win the 1947 National League pennant by five games over the second-place St. Louis Cardinals and earn the right to face the Yankees, winners of the American League pennant, in the World Series.
In the film we don't get to see the Dodgers play the Yankees in that Series. But listen to Robinson, in his 1972 autobiography, ''I Never Had It Made,'' as he writes about Game 1 at Yankee Stadium:
''Today as I look back on that opening game of my first World Series, I must tell you that it was Mr. Rickey's drama, and that I was only a principal actor. As I write this 20 years later, I cannot stand and sing the anthem. I cannot salute the flag; I know that I am a black man in a white world. In 1972, in 1947, at my birth in 1919, I know that I never had it made.''
Those are not the words of a Hollywood hero, but of a complex and ambivalent man.
Robinson's words bring us up short because, culturally, we want his legend -- a cross-pollination of proud American mythology and exceptionalism -- to be true because it makes us feel good about ourselves, about baseball, about our perceived progress on race relations.
But as I listened to the hip-hop bravado of Jay-Z's ''Brooklyn We Go Hard'' on a ''42'' movie trailer, I wondered whether he knew that Robinson was a committed Republican who campaigned for Richard M. Nixon in the 1960 presidential election.
Complicated.
As with many movies about sports, which tend toward the legend model, ''42'' runs the risk of making more out of ballplayers and baseball executives than what's there. At heart Robinson was a four-sport star at U.C.L.A. (where he was a very good football running back) who wanted to play ball and earn a living. Rickey was a career baseball man who wanted to win games and make money. They needed each other.
Yes, Robinson was a symbol, a lightning rod for both black and white America. But it's important to remember he was also all athlete, a feral ballplayer, a professional who played his chosen game hard. As he wrote in his book, ''I believed in fierce competition and swift retaliation for mistreatment.''
Because Robinson's breakthrough came in the United States of America, it's also a tale complicated by its sense of keen economic opportunity: you know, money. And ''42'' doesn't shy from that fact. Mr. Ford's Rickey says, ''Dollar's aren't black and white,'' and the Dodger manager Leo Durocher, played by Christopher Meloni, states, ''We're playing for money here, Mr. Rickey.''
But Robinson was blunter in his book. ''Money is America's God,'' he wrote, ''and business people can dig black power if it coincides with green power.'' And on his teammates: ''They hadn't changed because they liked me any better; they had changed because I could help fill their wallets.''
George Vecsey, the writer and columnist for The New York Times, gets at Robinson's ability to help and to raise up others in his 2006 history, ''Baseball,'' when he writes, ''Every black politician, every black rap singer, every black athlete of today, every black citizen vaguely getting by, comes through Jackie Robinson, but without the incredible stress that wore Robinson down before his time.'' Robinson died in 1972, just 53 years old.
''42'' isn't the first film to portray Robinson as legend. In the 1950 ''Jackie Robinson Story'' Robinson played himself in a movie billed as ''a rich, compelling saga of the American game.'' It starred Ruby Dee as Robinson's wife, Rae, and Louise Beavers, a classic Hollywood maid-mammy, as his mother, and it is so feel-good you could almost imagine James Stewart, in a shrewd bit of casting against type, as Robinson.
In a sense, as comic-book and action-movie fans await the reboot of the Superman franchise on June 14 with the release of ''Man of Steel,'' ''42'' is the season's first major superhero movie. (Coincidentally Mr. Meloni is in each film.)
Think about it. Robinson's No. 42, so revered that Major League Baseball has retired it for all teams, is about as distinctive as Superman's ''S.'' Both Robinson and Superman were abandoned by their fathers, then found adoptive dads in Rickey and Pa Kent. Robinson has larger-than-life villains to deal with, like the Phillies' racist manager, Ben Chapman. And Robinson, to survive and thrive, had to build his own kind of Fortress of Solitude.
While Superman comes from the planet Krypton, Robinson, who was born in rural Georgia and grew up in Pasadena, Calif., also has a secret origin. It wasn't just his skin color that made him different from most major leaguers. He was also a former college student and Army officer -- a rare combination in baseball in 1947.
And judging from the ''Man of Steel'' trailers there's dialogue in each movie that would fit comfortably in the other. Guess in which film these lines are spoken:
1) ''He was convinced that the world wasn't ready. What do you think?''
2) ''I don't know who he is, or where he is, but he's coming.''
3) ''You just have to decide what kind of man you want to grow up to be, .... Whoever that man is, is going to change the world.''
4) ''You have to keep this side of yourself a secret.''
5) ''Your enemy will be out in force, but you cannot meet him on his own low ground.''
(''Man of Steel,'' ''42,'' ''Man of Steel,'' ''Man of Steel,'' ''42.'')
But despite their common thread the most intriguing thing is what sets these two movies apart: It appears that ''Man of Steel'' wants to try to humanize the comic-book legend, while ''42'' makes a legend of the very human Jack Roosevelt Robinson.

HEADLINE: Trading in the Dark

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
Stocks dropped on Friday, after the dismal employment report for March forced investors to rethink the recent rally. Stock prices have been driven up by easy money from the Federal Reserve, but the jobs picture indicates that little of the Fed's largess has made its way to Main Street, where unemployment remains high. 
And those are not the only sobering realities. Trading in today's market has increasingly migrated away from public exchanges, like the New York Stock Exchange, to private trading venues, mostly operated by big banks, as recently reported by Nathaniel Popper in The Times. Off-exchange platforms include ''dark pools'' that let traders post orders that are hidden from the rest of the market. They also have ''internalizers,'' including firms like Citigroup, which pay retail brokers for the opportunity to handle trades before the orders reach a public exchange.
Off-exchange trading can make sense for institutional investors whose block trades might move market prices. It also appeals to investors who have been shocked by technological mishaps on public exchanges. But with some 40 percent of stock trades now occurring off-exchange, there is mounting evidence that the shift is obscuring the true prices of stocks, raising the cost of trading and, by extension, damaging investor confidence.
Yet the response from American regulators largely has been to watch and wait. The inaction is in contrast to recent moves by Canada and Australia to limit dark trading. Under new Canadian rules, brokers can fill customers' orders through dark pools only if the prices are much better than those on a public exchange. Since the rules took effect last fall, it appears that dark pool trading in Canada has dropped sharply.
There is also concern that banks that operate off-exchange venues may be giving advance word to the banks' own traders or selected clients about how dark-pool customers trade. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the industry self-regulator, has been looking into possible breaches but has not yet determined if information was improperly shared.
Potential interactions between the off-exchange venues and the high-speed, computer-driven trading that now dominates the stock market are also cause for worry, because increasingly complex systems can malfunction in unexpected and catastrophic ways.
The market cannot be efficient if many orders never see the light of day. An inefficient market is neither fair nor stable, which makes a strong regulatory response to protect investors imperative.

HEADLINE: Shifting Our Saving Into Automatic

BYLINE: By RICHARD H. THALER. 
Richard H. Thaler is a professor of economics and behavioral science at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago. He has informally advised the Obama administration.

 BODY:
MANY problems are so complex that even if we had the money to fix them, we wouldn't know how to do it. Fixing inner-city schools, reducing obesity, creating peace in the Middle East are just a few examples.
But some problems are frustrating in another way: we know how to fix them and we can afford to fix them, but we drop the ball. That's the situation with a crisis facing many Americans: saving enough for retirement. 
Here is one measure of the problem: A Boston College economist, Alicia H. Munnell, and her colleagues have estimated that more than half of Americans are saving too little to support an adequate lifestyle if they plan to retire at 65. Why is the situation so serious? One reason is that traditional pension plans -- in which employees have almost no decisions to make -- are being supplanted by defined-contribution plans like 401(k)'s. In these plans, employees have to decide for themselves how much to save and how to invest their money. For many people, being asked to solve their own retirement savings problems is like being asked to build their own cars.
To fix this, we need to do two things. First, make payroll retirement savings plans available to everyone. Then, add empirically proven design features to them, making it easier for workers to make good choices. In other words, improve the plans' choice architecture.
Payroll savings plans are vital because they are essentially the only way that middle-class Americans reliably save for retirement. Your grandmother probably knew that the best way to save is to put money aside before you have a chance to spend it. That approach has always worked -- and is a core idea embedded in these plans.
In the past, homeowners used another form of forced saving, building home equity by paying off their mortgages. But the ease of refinancing has eroded the norm that people should pay off these loans by the time they reach retirement age. Among households with someone over 60, mortgage debt has grown drastically in recent decades. (Here's a savings tip: If you are over 45, use today's low interest rates to refinance with a 15-year mortgage.)
Given the importance of payroll savings, it's alarming that only about half of the American work force has access to a retirement savings plan in the workplace -- and that number falls to 42 percent in the private sector, according to Boston College research.
The Obama administration has proposed a simple solution to this problem: the automatic I.R.A. This plan, originally proposed by scholars at the Brookings Institution, would require any employer that doesn't offer its own plan to enroll workers automatically into individual retirement accounts, with the option to opt out. The burden on employers would be tiny, and the benefit to workers could be life-changing.
The concept puts to work part of what we behavioral economists, along with industry experts, have learned about effective 401(k) retirement plans over the past couple of decades. The operative word common to many best practices is ''automatic.''
When employees are first eligible for a retirement savings plan, they should be enrolled unless they choose to opt out. This solves the procrastination problem that keeps roughly a fifth of workers who are eligible for a plan from joining, even when the employer is matching some of their contributions. Companies that adopt automatic enrollment find that few employees opt out initially, or later.
But we should move beyond automatic enrollment alone. That's because most companies set a low default savings rate for new enrollees, often at just 3 percent of their income. Of course, employees can choose a different, higher rate, but many just accept the default percentage and stay with it indefinitely.
My colleague Shlomo Benartzi, a business professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and I devised a successful solution to this problem that we call Save More Tomorrow. Under it, a worker can join a plan in which their savings contributions are increased, say, one to two percentage points a year, each time the employee gets a raise. In the first company that tried this plan, the savings rate more than tripled in three years.
Some companies find that linking savings increases to pay increases puts a burden on their payroll and human resource departments. Such companies can avoid this problem by using a generic version of the plan, called automatic escalation, that steps up savings rates each year until the employee hits a predetermined maximum.
In a recent report in Science magazine, Professor Benartzi and I estimated more than four million people were using some form of automatic escalation, and had collectively increased annual savings in the United States by over $7 billion a year. This is significant progress, but we could do much better.
Many employees don't know that their workplace has such an option, and finding out how to enroll can be hard. This helps explain why only 11 percent of eligible workers have signed up for it. Promoting automatic escalation and making sign-up easy, or even automatic (with the ability to opt out, of course), could greatly increase enrollment. In our original study, in which a financial adviser was available to explain the plan and, importantly, fill out the appropriate forms, nearly 80 percent of workers who were offered the plan took it.
THE third piece of the automatic plan involves investments. Retirement savers tend to be relatively passive investors, often sticking with whatever asset allocation they selected on the day they joined the plan. But those who do make changes often do so at exactly the wrong time: they buy high and sell low.
Although the stock market has doubled in the past few years, 401(k) investors have collectively been selling stocks to buy bonds during this period. (Note that in January this year, there was a sharp reversal, with investors pouring money into stocks. This might make some trend watchers nervous about future stock market returns!)
A solution to bad market timing is to offer a default investment vehicle, like a target-date mutual fund, that automatically rebalances an investor's portfolio, both cyclically as the market rises and falls, and as the client ages, reducing stock holdings as retirement approaches. Of course, it is essential that these target-date funds have reasonable fees.
For evaluations of how corporate plans stack up, consider the ratings offered by services like BrightScope.com. If you aren't happy with what you find, complain to your company's management. And if you are part of management, get busy.

FEAR ITSELFThe New Deal and the Origins of Our Time
By Ira KatznelsonIllustrated. 706 pp. Liveright Publishing. $29.95.
Ira Katznelson heard his first political argument around the family table a few weeks before the presidential election of 1952. His grandmother started it, as only a grandmother can, by announcing that she wasn't going to vote. Katznelson's parents, who adored Adlai Stevenson, were suitably shocked. But Bubbeh Frima held her ground. ''Since Roosevelt,'' she insisted, ''they are all pygmies.''
It's easy to see why she thought such a thing. From the day in March 1933 when he first took the oath of office until his death in April 1945, Franklin Roosevelt dominated public life in a way no other modern president has matched. There's the litany of policies he put into place -- financial regulation, farm subsidies, public works, mortgage protection, union rights, Social Security, the minimum wage -- that reshaped Americans' relationship to their government. There's the war he directed, which unleashed the nation's power and remade the place of the United States in the world. 
Most of all there's the message Roosevelt delivered. So deep were the crises of the 1930s and 1940s that many observers wondered whether democracies were too weak to handle them. ''The liberal state is destined to perish,'' Benito Mussolini proclaimed in 1932. ''All the political experiments of our day are anti-liberal.'' It took 12 years of innovation and almost four of total war. But in the end Roosevelt proved how wrong the skeptics had been. ''At a time when despair and alienation were prostrating other peoples under the heel of dictatorship, that was no small accomplishment,'' David M. Kennedy says in ''Freedom From Fear,'' his Pulitzer Prize-winning history of the Roosevelt years.
Katznelson, Columbia's Ruggles professor of political science and history, makes precisely the same point in the first few pages of ''Fear Itself.'' Then he gives it a twist. Roosevelt's defense of democracy, he argues, rested in large part on his willingness to work with political forces that had no commitment to democratic ideals. Sometimes the connections were relatively benign, like the New Deal's brief flirtation with quasi-fascist economic planning in 1933. Sometimes they were the lesser of two evils. Only by allying with Joseph Stalin, for instance, could Roosevelt assure victory over Nazi Germany. And only if he had turned on his ally and extended the war beyond Hitler's defeat could he have stopped the Soviets' occupation of Eastern Europe in 1944 and 1945. One connection, though, Katznelson considers utterly Faustian: to push their legislative programs through Congress, the New Dealers sold their souls to the segregated South.
The calculation was simple enough. Thanks to the disfranchisement of blacks and the reign of terror that accompanied it, the South had become solidly Democratic by the beginning of the 20th century, the Deep South exclusively so. One-party rule translated into outsize power on Capitol Hill: when Roosevelt took office, Southerners held almost half the Democrats' Congressional seats and many of the key committee chairmanships. So whatever Roosevelt wanted to put into law had to have Southern approval. And he wouldn't get it if he dared to challenge the region's racial order.
Katznelson spends much of ''Fear Itself'' detailing the dismal results. During his first six years in office -- the New Deal's ''radical moment,'' Katznelson calls it -- Roosevelt repeatedly let the Southern bloc write discriminatory provisions into his programs. When the Tennessee Valley Authority built model communities, Southern congressmen made sure they were strictly segregated. Southerners on the Senate Finance Committee cut farm laborers and domestic servants out of the Social Security Act because it simply wouldn't do to have white families paying taxes on their black maids. They did the same thing to the administration's minimum wage bills. The bloc's power imposed other costs as well. Twice civil rights activists tried to make lynching a federal offense. Twice Southern Democrats blocked them, the second time by filibuster. Each time Roosevelt refused to intervene, though even a small signal of support might have kept the bill alive.
Late in the decade the dynamic shifted. Southern Democrats became Roosevelt's most reliable allies in his fight against isolationism. And once the nation went to war they gave the president their vigorous support. On the home front, though, they began to defy him. Out went Roosevelt's proposal to pack the Supreme Court, defeated by the Southerners' sudden willingness to align themselves with their Republican colleagues. Out went the administration's economic planning programs. Out went its attempt to create a national employment policy. Most important, out went the federal government's unstinting support for the labor movement, which in the late 1930s and early 1940s had become a powerful advocate for racial change.
Roosevelt didn't live to see the full force of the Southerners' campaign. But by the time Harry Truman left office in 1953, Katznelson says, the New Deal had been tamed, its broad vision replaced by endless rounds of interest group politics, its foreign policy driven by a national security state more interested in grand crusades -- and enormous military spending -- than in democratic processes. And in the South, Jim Crow, described by the moral philosopher Avishai Margalit as ''a regime of cruelty and humiliation,'' still stood.
It's a powerful argument, swept along by Katznelson's robust prose and the imposing scholarship that lies behind it. Only at the very end of the book, though, does he acknowledge another side of the story. For all its compromises, the New Deal gave millions of Americans a sense of belonging -- a sense of rights -- they'd never had before. That sense swept through the industrial working class, where union buttons suddenly became badges of honor. It swept through all those ethnic communities that until the 1930s had been treated as not quite American. And despite the racial dynamics Katznelson so ably describes, it swept through African-American communities too.
No doubt that's why Bubbeh Frima saw Roosevelt as such a towering figure, because where she lived up in Washington Heights, America seemed a better place than it had been before he took office. That's also why, just a few years after Roosevelt's death, Jim Crow began to come tumbling down, shattered by a social movement that had been invigorated by the promise, if not necessarily the practice, of the New Deal era. Roosevelt can't be given credit for that extraordinary triumph, of course; that belongs to the men, women and children who risked their lives on the streets of the South. But he played a role, however indirect. And any assessment of his legacy has to set that fact alongside the concessions that marred his administration and blighted our less than perfect union.

SIEGE 13By Tamas Dobozy
339 pp. Milkweed Editions. Paper, $16.
Are you experiencing any of the following: (1) A thirst for palinka? (2) A yearning for Budapest, though the closest you've ever come is the Hungarian Pastry Shop in Manhattan? (3) An urge to deploy diacritical marks over every other vowel? If so, you may be suffering from Hungarophilia. My own case dates to my mid-20s, when I discovered Peter Nadas's novel ''A Book of Memories.'' Its high-Modernist aspirations were just one of the ways this contemporary masterpiece seemed to issue from a more distinguished past. Fascinated, I began reading every living Hungarian novelist I could find in English: Imre Kertesz, Laszlo Krasznahorkai. . . . By the time I got to Peter Esterhazy's ''Celestial Harmonies,'' I, too, was dreaming of ''palaces with swirling towers and flapping banners gazing at their reflections in the mirror of the lake.'' 
Yet to read any of these writers at all closely is to confront something less romantic in the national -- or rather, the human -- character. When they started publishing, in the 1970s and '80s, Hungary may have been ''the happiest barrack in the socialist camp,'' but their books center on police-state paranoia, economic stagnation, and a strain of indigenous authoritarianism that stretches back to the fascism of the early '20s and forward to the current Hungarian government.
To this complicated legacy -- the richness, the violence -- the Canadian short-story writer Tamas Dobozy would seem a natural heir. The son of Hungarian immigrants, he has recalled in interviews his father's anecdotes of life under the fascists and the Communists. Dobozy's first two books, however, were just as likely to indulge in flights of fabulist fancy as in the themes of war and exile. In theory, this should have been a matter of indifference. Feat of memory? Feat of imagination? If the writing is good enough, you stop noticing the difference. But in practice, Dobozy's third collection, ''Siege 13,'' marks not only a turn toward history but also a leap forward in ambition. Individually, its stories alternate between war-torn Budapest and the émigré circles of present-day North America. Together, they seek to do for the Hungarian diaspora what Alice Munro did for the hardscrabble citizens of Huron County, Ontario, or Isaac Babel for the Jews of Odessa.
Those comparisons may sound daunting, but Dobozy has mastered the technical conventions of his craft. Arresting first lines open onto situations rich with dramatic potential. In one story, a heckler trails a celebrated historian around the lecture circuit, claiming to know his secrets. In another, a Rakosi-era spy tracks a Catholic priest. A fabulist streak persists -- the heckler becomes more famous than the professor; the priest keeps a record of miracles that have occurred under Communist rule -- and in lesser hands it might overwhelm the delicate mechanism of the short story. Dobozy handles the most outlandish exposition with aplomb. Even his titles have a classical ring: ''The Encirclement,'' ''The Miracles of Saint Marx.''
More impressive still, because less studied, is Dobozy's prose. His diction is plain-spoken, but the cadences are lovely and swell his sentences to unusual, sinuous length. ''I don't mean to imply that New York was dreary,'' writes the narrator of ''The Atlas of B. Görbe,'' who finds himself far from home. ''Only that it seemed emptied, an abandoned city, which is odd since there were people everywhere -- to the point where I sometimes couldn't move along the sidewalk -- all of them rushing by me as if they knew something I didn't, as if every street and avenue offered a series of doors only they could open.'' Cascading clauses, with their sudden reversals and discontinuities, allow ''Siege 13'' to bend narrative time with a freedom that reminded me of the great stories of Edward P. Jones. We might begin a sentence in 1956 and end it in 1993, or we might go backward. In one memorable instance, the ''wrinkles and lines'' of a character's face offer ''a vision of what the next hundred days would be like.'' Dobozy then compresses into a 168-word catalog the siege that nearly annihilated Budapest in the winter of 1945, the bodies ''half buried in ice, the muck of the river, or the frost that settled on them from their last labored breaths.''
This local plasticity of time enriches the collection as a whole. Its best stories don't subordinate the trauma of war to the trauma of immigration, or vice versa, but treat both as aspects of a continuous present. And isn't this how trauma works? In ''The Beautician,'' a history student in early-'90s Toronto learns that Arpad Hollo, the ''old dissident'' who tends the archives of that city's Szecsenyi Club, was a Communist censor back in Hungary. The discovery has a devastating effect on the club's membership. But Hollo still sees himself as ''one of the many waiting for rescue at the end of the siege, desperate for the arrival of the Red Army, not realizing there would be no end to ruin, they'd been turned into its agents, harnessed to it, dragging its wreckage into the next half-century.''
On the other hand, the looseness that gives Dobozy's sentences their temporal play too often carries them past the point of diminishing returns. It is enough for us to see ''fields littered with broken fuselages and wings and pilots''; by the time those pilots' twisted postures become ''the war's alphabet -- untranslatable into human terms,'' we have escaped the gravity of death for the airy realms of fine writing. Elsewhere, abstraction shades into incoherence: ''He saw it in the way her eyes left him isolated, a lesson on shouldering what he'd done alone rather than lessening the burden by passing it on, by turning it into a secret she had to share.''
The weaknesses in these lines -- portentousness, melodrama and just plain not knowing when to stop -- are also the larger weaknesses of these stories. Too often, Dobozy shackles an already outsize plot to an even more outsize Symbol. We get a ''Homemade Doomsday Machine,'' a set of orphaned chess queens, a starving lion freed from the Budapest Zoo during the siege. Author and characters perform dutiful exegesis. Then, in case we missed the Point, each Symbol becomes the trigger for its story's conclusion. As I made my way through the otherwise stirring ''Sailor's Mouth,'' about a Canadian couple's attempt to adopt a child from Transylvania, I found myself hoping not to encounter again its heavy-handed framing device, the ''Museum of Failed Escapes'' -- cheering from the sidelines, like an ink-stained Bela Karolyi, ''You can do it!'' But Dobozy can't quite stick the landing.
And in a way, the ending of a short story is the short story, the way the punch line of a joke is the joke. No amount of teachable craft can make it work; it's where mastery gives way to mystery. Which is the literary quality the stories in ''Siege 13'' find it hardest to manage.
As a whole, though, the collection transcends its missteps. Patterns emerge: the family we encounter in ''The Restoration of the Villa Where Tibor Kalman Once Lived'' reappears in ''Days of Orphans and Strangers.'' Then, in the haunting, Escherian ''Ghosts of Budapest and Toronto,'' present-day members of that family dream of those in the past, who dream of those in the present. In another cluster of stories, the Szecsenyi Club becomes a proxy for the gossipy, jealous and incurably nostalgic Hungarian ''community.''
And throughout, we keep returning to the titular siege. The recurrence doesn't feel overdetermined. Rather, it is as if the details on the page have made the slow ruin of Budapest real again -- as if ''the delirium of this siege, . . . the constant fear, the boredom, waiting on the clock, the slow erasure of affection'' is still unfolding. This vivid rendering of Hungarian history as a nightmare from which no one quite wants to awake is Dobozy's finest achievement. Writing of the archivist Arpad Hollo, he suggests at one point that ''shelving and cataloging could be acts of war against an enemy whose power resided in limiting what we knew, and, with that, what we could think, imagine and feel.'' In this sense, reading and writing fiction, too, can strike a blow for the forces of light.

THE FIRST MUSLIMThe Story of Muhammad
By Lesley Hazleton320 pp. Riverhead Books. $27.95.
In today's febrile cultural and religious climate, what project could be more fraught than writing a biography of Muhammad? The worldwide protests at ''The Innocence of Muslims,'' 14 minutes of trashy provocation posted on YouTube, are a terrible reminder to the would-be biographer that the life story of the prophet of Islam is not material about which one is free to have a ''take.'' Lesley Hazleton's ''First Muslim'' is a book written by a white woman of dual American and British citizenship, published in America more than a decade after the 9/11 attacks. For many believers it is already -- even before it is read, if it is read at all -- an object of suspicion, something to be defended against, in case it should turn out to be yet another insult, another cruel parody of a story such an author has no business telling. 
To others, of course, this book offers a welcome chance to read that life story in a more familiar and accessible form than the Islamic sources, a window into the parallel world where it is worth killing and dying to preserve the Prophet's aura of holiness. Bigots looking to confirm their prejudices will, by and large, find ''The First Muslim'' a disappointment: Hazleton approaches her subject with scrupulous respect. She blogs as ''the Accidental Theologist,'' where she describes herself as ''a psychologist by training, a Middle East reporter by experience, an agnostic fascinated by the vast and often terrifying arena in which politics and religion intersect.'' In 2010, she gave a TED talk debunking some of the more egregious myths about the Koran, notably the salaciously Orientalist ''72 virgins.'' This is a writer who is working to dispel contradictions, not sharpen them.
Where does this leave the reviewer? Embroiled, unfortunately. A few days after I was assigned this book, the Darul Uloom in Deoband, a conservative Islamic seminary, called for me to be barred from speaking at this year's Jaipur Literature Festival. At last year's event I read an excerpt from ''The Satanic Verses,'' still banned in India, to protest the death threat that had forced Salman Rushdie to cancel his scheduled appearance. I was one of four authors who gave such readings. Lawyers and festival organizers advised us to leave town (and in my case India) immediately. Seven police complaints were subsequently brought against us under Indian laws protecting religious feelings from offense. Since I have, as another Muslim group put it in their own press statement, ''hurt the sentiments of the community,'' some people will find my judgment of this book a priori worthless, or at least suspect. Reader, beware.
The story of Muhammad is undoubtedly extraordinary. Orphaned in childhood in Mecca, an Arabian trading hub, he rose to be the trusted business agent and later husband of Khadija, a wealthy merchant woman. This respectable citizen took to climbing into the mountains overlooking the town, where he would spend nights in solitary meditation. Eventually he received a revelation, in the form of the voice of the angel Gabriel, who began to dictate the verses of the Koran. As the messenger of this radical new form of monotheism, he disrupted the power structure and eventually led his followers out of Mecca to nearby Medina, where he took full political control and began military operations against the rulers of his birthplace. By the time of his death, Islam had been embraced throughout the Arabian Peninsula and was spreading farther afield.
''The First Muslim'' tells this story with a sort of jaunty immediacy. Bardic competitions are ''the sixth-century equivalent of poetry slams.'' The section of the Koran known as the Sura of the Morning has ''an almost environmentalist approach to the natural world.'' Theological ideas and literary tropes are ''memes'' that can go ''viral.'' Readers irritated by such straining for a contemporary tone will find it offset by much useful and fascinating context on everything from the economics of the Meccan caravan trade to the pre-Islamic lineage of prophets called hanifs, who promoted monotheism and rejected idolatry.
In the terms it sets itself, ''The First Muslim'' succeeds. It makes its subject vivid and immediate. It deserves to find readers. However, its terms are those of the popular biography, and this creates a tension the book never quite resolves. Though based on scholarship, it is not a scholarly work. Factual material from eighth- and ninth-century histories is freely mixed with speculation about Muhammad's motives and emotions intended to allow the reader, in the quasi-therapeutic vocabulary that is the default register of so much mainstream contemporary writing, to ''empathize'' or better still, ''identify with'' him. Inevitably, a forest of conditionals surrounds such speculation, as Hazleton tries to intuit what Muhammad ''must have felt'' or ''surely would have'' done. ''For an adolescent trying to cement a life from the shards of loss and displacement,'' we are told, ''the monotheistic idea has to have been immensely powerful.'' One might equally be justified in saying that animism would have made him feel less alone. Elsewhere we are invited to appreciate ''the sheer humanness'' of his terrified reaction to the Koranic revelation. Occasionally a novelistic impulse takes over, as in a passage describing a flash flood where ''you'' ''flail and fall'' and try to pick yourself up because ''the roar of it is on you now.'' Has Hazleton been in such a flood? Is she paraphrasing someone else's account? This is innocent enough as an exercise in style, but it makes one uncertain about the status of more substantial passages.
Muhammad's transition from humble messenger to political leader, and from peaceful preacher to war leader, forms the substance of the story. The factional struggles, political assassinations, night flights and pitched battles that surround it are reminiscent of the experience of another prophet, the Mormon leader Joseph Smith, as is the role of revelation in exonerating sexual impropriety -- in Muhammad's case to allay suspicions of infidelity surrounding his third wife, Aisha. Despite the orthodox Muslim insistence that Muhammad, while possessed of human failings, is irreproachable, some of his actions are deeply troubling. Even Hazleton finds it hard to put a positive spin on the mass beheading of up to 900 surrendered men of the Jewish Qurayza tribe, losers in one round of the factional battles for control of Medina.
However accurate her book, however laudable her intention to bridge the chasm between believers and unbelievers, Hazleton still has to confront the question of the authenticity of religious revelation. Respect is not the same as belief: her interpretation of ''whatever happened up there on Mount Hira'' is to stress Muhammad's ''experience'' of revelation while sidestepping its objective existence. In various places, she hints that the Koran and the Hadith, like other holy books, have a textual history and that certain events in the life of Muhammad are best considered tropes. A fuller examination of these points would have been fascinating, but it would have forced her to embrace the perilous notion that the Koran, instead of being the revealed word of God, might be a text like any other. In evading such material Hazleton clearly hopes to avoid giving offense, but try as she might, she cannot escape the fact that in our time even a well-meaning and fundamentally decent book such as this can never be innocent, because it cannot stand outside our violent recent history.

FDR AND THE JEWSBy Richard Breitman and Allan J. Lichtman
Illustrated. 433 pp. The Belknap Press/Harvard University Press. $29.95.
Franklin Roosevelt enjoyed the overwhelming support of American Jews during his presidency, and the reasons are clear. In his three-plus terms from 1933 to 1945, he led the war against Hitler, supported a Jewish homeland in Palestine, appointed a Jew to the Supreme Court, chose another to be his secretary of the Treasury and surrounded himself with Jewish advisers who helped shape the laws that revolutionized the role of government in American life -- what some critics sneeringly called the ''Jew Deal.'' Then, of course, there was Eleanor Roosevelt, whose concern for minorities fused the bond even tighter. When Roosevelt died in 1945, the Rabbinical Assembly of America described him, almost supernaturally, as an ''immortal leader of humanity and a peerless servant of God.'' 
Born to Protestant wealth and privilege, the Roosevelts were hardly immune to the prejudices of their time. Before entering the White House, Eleanor described the future Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter as ''an interesting little man but very Jew'' and, after attending a function for the Wall Street financier Bernard Baruch, complained: ''The Jew party was appalling. I never wish to hear money, jewels and sables mentioned again.'' Franklin went even further, using anti-Semitic banter to charm world leaders like Joseph Stalin who were known to fear and hate Jews. Indeed, it was the ability of the Roosevelts to set aside these prejudices that seemed to distinguish them from so many others of their class. When it mattered most, their nobler instincts took over.
Times have changed. All presidents are subject to the tides of revisionist history, their legacies constantly in flux. For Roosevelt, the most controversial scholarship concerns a troubling moral question: What, exactly, did he do in his 12 years in office to protect the Jews of Europe from Nazi genocide? And the answer, many now believe, is: Not nearly enough.
Starting in the 1960s, a flood of books appeared with self-evident titles like ''No Haven for the Oppressed'' and ''While Six Million Died.'' But the most influential account by far was David S. Wyman's ''Abandonment of the Jews,'' published in 1984. Wyman, the grandson of two Protestant ministers, considered numerous parties responsible for America's tepid response to the Holocaust, including a badly divided Jewish community, a nest of virulent anti-Semites in the State Department, and a distracted president largely indifferent to humanitarian concerns he felt were beyond his control, no matter how enormous the scope.
''FDR and the Jews,'' by Richard Breitman and Allan J. Lichtman, history professors at American University, is the latest, and most thoughtful, entry into this scholarly minefield. And much like Wyman's book, though with a very different premise, it traces the American roots of this story. Sadly, Roosevelt left behind a rather thin paper trail. He didn't write a memoir or record many White House conversations, and he refused to allow note-taking at his personal meetings. To fill this gap, Breitman and Lichtman have combed the archives of the leading players who did write down their thoughts and recollections, and the result is quite impressive. Even those who disagree with the book's conclusions must acknowledge the mountain of research on which they rest.
And the main conclusion is this: While saving the Jews of Europe was never a high priority for Roosevelt, he did more for them than any other world leader at the time, despite the enormous obstacles he faced at home. It's the ultimate middle-ground approach. Breitman and Lichtman are not shy about pointing out the failures of previous books on the subject, which they claim are either too forgiving of the president or not forgiving enough. ''Our work challenges both extremes in this dispute,'' they write, adding: ''Unlike other authors, we examine F.D.R.'s decision-making as president from the perspective of his life experiences and full political career.''
Assuming office at the height of the Great Depression in 1933, the same year that Adolf Hitler took power in Germany, Roosevelt concentrated naturally on domestic affairs. Bank failures and unemployment dwarfed any concerns about Nazism. Had he wanted to help Europe's Jews at this point, the president might have lobbied to bring more of them to America while they were still free to leave. But this required the will to loosen the nation's strict immigration quotas, a risky political stance. Few Americans would have welcomed more immigrants when jobs were so scarce, and Jews were among the least popular of those seeking admission. Even a modest bill in Congress to admit some Jewish children in 1939 hit a brick wall of prejudice. ''I should prefer to let in 20,000 old Jews who would not multiply,'' a former undersecretary of state told the bill's sponsor. Roosevelt didn't intervene.
By the late 1930s, a new set of problems had emerged. German and Japanese aggression had convinced Roosevelt that war was coming and that the United States would soon be involved. But isolationist sentiment was very strong; Americans, with painful memories of World War I and its aftermath, were wary of repeating past mistakes. As Breitman and Lichtman make clear, the now desperate situation facing Jews in Germany and surrounding lands actually complicated the president's attempt to prepare the nation for war. ''The more Roosevelt risked on initiatives for Jews,'' they note, ''the less he thought he could carry Congress and the public with him on broad issues of foreign policy.'' Appearing too ''pro-Jewish'' could jeopardize the mobilization process. Confronting Nazi tyranny was one thing; fighting to save an unpopular minority from extinction was quite another.
Once war came, Roosevelt's slim interest in the ''Jewish Question'' became slimmer still. Consumed by events on both the European and Pacific fronts, he appeared to wish the question away. According to Breitman and Lichtman, Roosevelt met only once with Jewish leaders during the war ''to discuss what we call the Holocaust.'' When he was pressed on the matter, his reply was always the same: the best way to save the Jews of Europe was to defeat the Nazis as quickly as possible, and that was exactly what he intended to do.
How, then, does this new portrait of Roosevelt differ from the damning one drawn by the revisionists? The answer rests on how one measures the president's gestures and accomplishments against the pressures he faced to do even less. In 1938, for example, Roosevelt recalled his ambassador to Germany to protest Kristallnacht, the Nazi pogrom. It was little more than a symbolic act, but he was the only head of state to do so. Over protests from his notoriously anti-Semitic State Department, moreover, Roosevelt encouraged efforts to settle European Jews in Latin America -- about 40,000 of them made it there from 1938 to 1941 -- and pressed the British to keep Palestine open to Jewish refugees. Most important, perhaps, was his approval of the War Refugee Board in 1943, which, while often ignored and always underfunded, worked with heroes like Raoul Wallenberg throughout Nazi-occupied Europe to save untold thousands of Jews.
As to the most contentious revisionist claim -- that Roosevelt could have blunted Hitler's killing machine by ordering the rail lines to Auschwitz destroyed -- Breitman and Lichtman provide a measured response. There is little doubt, they write, that Allied planes were capable of reaching this destination by mid-1944. Industrial complexes in the area were already being bombed. The problem was that the War Department viewed the project as a diversion from more important military targets. Opposition was such that the matter never appears to have reached the president's desk. How successful the precision bombing of Auschwitz would have been, given the mixed results elsewhere, is a matter of debate. What is undeniable, however, is that close to 250,000 Jews were murdered in the months between the capture of this death camp and the German surrender in May 1945. When it came to the Final Solution, the Nazis were demonically resourceful. They found ways to kill Jews to the very end.
In their conclusion, the authors rightly note the squeamishness of America's modern presidents in dealing with genocide. Woodrow Wilson, a true idealist, virtually ignored Turkey's slaughter of a million or more Armenians, while Jimmy Carter, a human rights crusader, did nothing to prevent Pol Pot from exterminating 20 percent of Cambodia's population. The Clinton administration took several years to respond militarily to the ''ethnic cleansing'' of Muslims in Bosnia, which required only air power, not soldiers on the ground, and it never confronted the mass killings in Rwanda. More recently, Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama employed little more than words to condemn the atrocities in Darfur. Historically speaking, Roosevelt comes off rather well.
Indeed, an even stronger case might be made for him than the one put forth in this eminently sensible book. Roosevelt masterfully prepared a skeptical nation for a war against global tyranny. Always viewing Hitler as his primary enemy, despite the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, he supplied the Soviet Union with much of the matériel it needed to defeat the Nazis on the Eastern front, an extremely controversial move. The American landing in North Africa in 1942, bolstering British troops there, may well have saved that region's Jews from extermination. And the final defeat of Germany, costing hundreds of thousands of American lives, ended the Holocaust for good.
Early in 1945, following the Yalta conference with Churchill and Stalin, the president traveled to the Middle East, saying he'd most likely never ''get over here again.'' Roosevelt had always considered himself a master of persuasion, but his key meeting with the Saudi king Ibn Saud did not go well. Noting that Europe's surviving Jews had suffered ''indescribable horrors,'' he assured the king that allowing them into Palestine would improve the land for Arabs as well as Jews. Ibn Saud was unmoved. Cooperation with Zionists was impossible, he replied; that door was closed. Returning to America, the exhausted president actually apologized to Rabbi Stephen Wise, a prominent Jewish leader, for failing ''your cause.'' Roosevelt died the following month at the Little White House in Warm Springs, Ga. -- sadly aware, one suspects, of the unceasing bloodshed between Jews and Arabs that lay ahead.

 BODY:
THE IDEA FACTORY: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation, by Jon Gertner. (Penguin, $17.) Bell Labs, the onetime research and development wing of AT&T, was behind many of the technological transformations that define modern life, including the transistor, lasers and cellular telephony. Gertner's incisive history is filled with inspiring lessons and asks a critical question: What causes innovation? 
CORAL GLYNN, by Peter Cameron. (Picador, $15.) Set in the English countryside in the spring of 1950, Cameron's novel is a story of love missed and love found among the withdrawn inhabitants of an isolated mansion. At its center are Coral, a young nurse caring for Edith Hart, the terminally ill lady of the house; and Clement Hart, Edith's war-ravaged son.
INDIA BECOMING: A Portrait of Life in Modern India, by Akash Kapur. (Riverhead, $16.) Raised in the southern state of Tamil Nadu and educated in America, Kapur returned to India in 2003. His lucid, balanced account shows how change has brought contrast and contradiction -- despite decades of new opportunities, poverty stubbornly persists; heedless growth despoils the environment -- and weaves the stories of an array of Indians similarly disoriented by the rapid transition.
THE ORCHARDIST, by Amanda Coplin. (Harper Perennial, $15.99.) In a rural stretch of the Pacific Northwest at the turn of the 20th century, Talmadge, the reclusive protagonist of Coplin's first novel, offers sanctuary to two pregnant teenage runaways. But armed men are after the girls, and the tragedy that follows sets Talmadge on an irrevocable course not only to save them but also to reconcile the misfortune of his own troubled past.
THE LIVES OF MARGARET FULLER, by John Matteson. (Norton, $19.95.) (Norton, $19.95.) A fiery social critic known today primarily as a transcendentalist, Fuller (1810-50) was one of the most talented and provocative women of her generation. Matteson's biography stresses Fuller's ''protean character,'' revealing in chapter titles her successive, overlapping ''lives'' -- from ''prodigy'' and ''misfit'' to ''revolutionary'' and ''victim.''
WHAT WE TALK ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ANNE FRANK: Stories, by Nathan Englander. (Vintage International, $15.) Englander insightfully and uproariously tackles questions of morality and history with characters who define themselves largely through their embrace (or rejection) of Jewish tradition. The title story, inspired by Raymond Carver's classic, transposes New Mexico to South Florida but still takes the form of a quiet competition between two couples. Our reviewer, Stacy Schiff, called this collection ''terrific. . . . A kind of hard-won wisdom spills out on every page.''
MYCOPHILIA: Revelations From the Weird World of Mushrooms, by Eugenia Bone. (Rodale, $16.99.) Bone, a food writer and skilled forager, explores all things fungal and offers colorful field notes on mushrooms as culinary delicacies, biofuels, hallucinogens and more.
THE SUGAR FROSTED NUTSACK, by Mark Leyner. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $14.99.) Leyner's antic novel is a self-referential epic of mischievous gods (XOXO, Fast-Cooking Ali, Mogul Magoo) and their chosen one, an unemployed butcher from New Jersey named Ike.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: Tackling Global Warming

 BODY:
Readers urge carbon taxes, lifestyle changes and a new term.
To the Editor:
President Obama has put climate change back on the national agenda, but actually doing something about it is famously difficult. This time will be no different if policy makers let the best become the enemy of the good.
Hoping for the best gets us in trouble in two ways. First, while science can make a strong case for starting now to control carbon dioxide and other gases that lead to climate change, it can't yet say exactly how much to do when. Yet the game will be lost if we require that science nail down every uncertainty.
The second problem is that solving the climate problem requires changing a vast energy infrastructure on a global scale. The scope and scale of this challenge far exceed any other environmental problem we've seen before. It's no surprise that many existing government rules and institutions aren't up to the job of managing climate policy. 
Rather than waiting for settled science and perfected institutions, today's policy should aggressively promote steps that will make useful progress at low cost. Energy efficiency is the prime example; we know that we can use energy more efficiently, yet we don't.
As highlighted by the American Academy report ''Beyond Technology: Strengthening Energy Policy Through Social Science,'' social scientists can help resolve this paradox, and so energy policy makers should incorporate the social sciences into their thinking. It could be as simple as writing a clear energy-efficiency label or as complex as productively engaging local citizens about a fracking project.
But it's also essential to invest in understanding what policies and institutions must come into being to manage the climate problem over the long term. Our scientific establishment should encourage this new and exciting area of research.
ROBERT W. FRI Bethesda, Md., April 1, 2013
The writer is chairman of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences' Alternative Energy Future project and a visiting scholar at Resources for the Future.

The solution to global warming -- the only real solution -- starts and ends with making polluters pay. It does wonders, large and small.
A cap on sulfur dioxide in the 1990s stopped the worst effects of acid rain by removing much of the sulfur dioxide produced by coal-fired power plants. Carbon caps and pricing are helping to decarbonize electricity generation in Europe, California, New Zealand and Australia.
The prices don't have to be high to show effects. A 5-cent surcharge per disposable bag in Washington, D.C., cut bag use 80 percent within a year by some estimates.
Of course, wishing we had a strong cap on carbon won't make it so. That's where decisive, immediate action from President Obama's administration comes in: everything from applying the Clean Air Act to global warming pollution, as instructed by the Supreme Court, to reining in methane leakage from our natural gas system.
Put together, these administrative actions alone could get us a long way toward where we need to be, until Congress finally gets ready to follow the will of the people to tackle global warming pollution.
GERNOT WAGNER Economist Environmental Defense Fund New York, April 3, 2013
The perfect can be the enemy of the good, but here moderation or ''probity'' might turn out to be the enemy of life. In the midst of all the conditionals and uncertainties, one thing that can be said about mainstream climate science is that it has always been behind the curve, always catching up with the moving reality on the ground. The facts have repeatedly aligned with radical predictions, like those of the scientist James Hansen, who is now talking about the oceans boiling off and leaving the earth lifeless.
ROBERT LEVIN Capitola, Calif., April 3, 2013
In any scientific endeavor, the burden is on those who propose a theory to provide the proof. In the case of man-made global warming, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's models have come up short. This is clearly a case where consensus and facts diverge, showing that the former is the realm of politics, not science.
The issue shouldn't be what to do about climate change, but whether we should institute monumental policies based on less than robust theories. Cheap energy is perhaps one of the greatest factors in lifting a society out of poverty. What is the humanitarian and moral price of raising the cost of energy for developing nations based on speculative science?
TIMOTHY NAYLOR Brooklyn, April 3, 2013
Mr. Fri makes two excellent points: We must tackle the climate problem now, and ''many existing government rules and institutions aren't up to the job of managing climate policy.''
However, what is too complex for governments is eminently doable by private enterprise -- if the conditions are right. And in this context, the government's task is quite simple -- impose a financial burden on the causes of global warming, and specifically a tax on emissions of carbon dioxide.
Once an appropriate carbon tax is in place, private industry will have the incentive to improve energy efficiency, develop alternate energy sources, deploy nuclear power, commercialize carbon capture and do that which is most difficult for government -- come up with new approaches to the problem.
Government's role is as facilitator. The market will do the rest.
ZVI J. DORON Pittsburgh, April 3, 2013
The writer is a retired nuclear engineer and co-author of a book (in German) about energy and climate policies.
I agree with Mr. Fri's suggestion of more involvement by the social sciences, but I would also add the psychological sciences.
Our brains are hard-wired to address immediate danger with a fight-or-flight response, but our response for distant risk is more of a hug-and-shrug one, if you will. We need to make the future risks seem more immediate.
We need to appreciate why certain countries, businesses and people may want to play down the risks. Empathize and help them find alternatives.
Names have important psychological implications, as any parent and business knows. ''Global warming'' is benign at best, and ''warming'' will be welcomed by some geographical areas. ''Climate change'' implies either something harmful or beneficial. More psychologically accurate and worrisome would be the term ''climate instability.''
We need an optimal Goldilocks amount of anxiety regarding this issue. Too little leads to apathy. Too much can lead to denial. Those in the psychological sciences can help us find the way to get the right anxiety temperature.
H. STEVEN MOFFIC Milwaukee, April 3, 2013
The writer is a psychiatrist.
Mr. Fri is convincing as he argues that we should ''aggressively promote steps that will make useful progress at low cost.'' But no solution to the issues will be successful without recognition of the depth of our cultural entitlements: the warmed/cooled home, the flights to Bangkok and London, the annual vacation that requires thousands of miles of driving, the apples from New Zealand and asparagus from Ecuador.
We have somehow earned these marks of success, and all require huge quantities of fossil fuels. We are a nation of addicts; no social scientist will change that fact, and no policy will be successful until the addictions are recognized and confronted.
KIRK NEVIN Corvallis, Ore., April 3, 2013
The ''Beyond Technology: Strengthening Energy Policy Through Social Science'' report is fine and good, but as a social scientist, I believe that asking the right questions at the right time is all important. These are some questions I don't see in the report:
¶How can any real progress be made at the governmental level when key actors on the political scene, who are in denial about the environmental challenges, are able to block virtually any legislation or other action that does not fit their mind-set?
¶How can the world respond to the challenges of the environment when the global economy is driven by a quest for short-term private profits by any means possible, regardless of the long-term consequences to society and the environment?
I fear that until such time that the environmental consequences are manifested in ways that we cannot even imagine today, we will continue on largely oblivious to the likely consequences.
DAVID L. ELLIOTT Loudonville, N.Y., April 3, 2013
Mr. Fri puts energy efficiency forward as a target. One step in that direction would be the implementation of a simple 15-word law that I'd like to call Raphaelson's Law: ''No public building shall be kept at a cooler temperature in July than in January.'' Who hasn't wished for a sweater in an over-air-conditioned movie theater in summer or sweltered in a store in winter? What a waste of energy.
Of course, such a law would be hard to enforce. But the principle could be advocated and publicized. Thermostats set three or four degrees lower in winter and higher in summer could save incalculably huge amounts of kilowatt-hours.
JOEL RAPHAELSON Chicago, April 3, 2013
The Writer Responds
These responses bring into sharp focus why dealing with the climate challenge is so thoroughly frustrating. Mr. Wagner is exactly right in saying we know what the most important policy is -- put a price on carbon. And, as Mr. Zoron says, that will unleash the innovation of the private sector, an essential element for solving the problem. Yet, even though they should know what to do, policy makers have failed to act. Unfortunately, as Mr. Levin suggests, inaction only makes the problem harder the longer it lasts. So I think we can agree that if only our leaders would shape up and pass a carbon tax, all would be much better. But it's not going to happen. We can't expect our leaders and institutions to jump overnight from doing the few things that are feasible now to mounting a full-scale -- and very expensive -- onslaught on the climate problem.
That's why I think the problem is less about designing the policies we should adopt over the long run than it is figuring out how to get from here to there. Realistically, it will be a stepwise process, and we need careful thought on how to design the needed steps. We haven't had enough of that kind of thinking.
In the meantime, I'd be happy if we could achieve Dr. Moffic's ''optimal Goldilocks amount of anxiety'' about climate change.

Here's what I'm good at while hanging out at a bar: Sitting. Drinking. Talking. The Big Buck Hunter console at the pub where I work, with its orange plastic shotguns, has never once tempted me. But at certain bars, I've watched someone take charge at the dartboard or the pinball machine and felt a surge of envy and awe. 
For most regulars, bars are places we go to relax, without any compulsion to show off. But some go to bars to unleash hidden talents. Marcia Wigley runs the pool table wherever she goes. Jennifer Holland isn't interested in places where she can't play Ping-Pong. Some people pictured here might arguably be New York's very best at their pastimes: the Jeopardy! champ (and former Weather Underground member) Brian Flanagan could confidently challenge anyone, at any trivia night, anywhere; the dart player Gloria Gutierrez is ranked ninth in the nation; Kristopher Medina doesn't just play pinball with gusto, he founded a competitive league; and Eustace Pilgrim, well, he's just cooler than everyone else.
These are the people who make up my fantasy regulars dream team. If only you could get them all in one place.

HEADLINE: Lean in, Dad

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL. 
Catherine Rampell is an economics reporter for The Times. Adam Davidson is off this week.

 BODY:
I happen to be an educated young woman who loves her job, sometimes gushingly, occasionally annoyingly. And yet, even in this enlightened age, I've had two relationships end -- at least in large part -- thanks to that clammy-palmed discussion in which couples plot hypothetical milestones and life goals. The gentlemen in question said that, somewhere in our semicharted future, they expected me to quit my job. At least for a couple of years, anyway, in order to be the kind of hypothetical mother they wanted to raise their hypothetical kids, if that hypothetical day ever came.
I don't pretend to know how common this situation is, and how many other young women have found themselves in it. But it clarified not only the choices that future mothers must make about their careers, but also how early in their careers they must begin to think about them. And while fairness and feminism may urge us to find better ways for women to balance work and life -- Sheryl Sandberg and Anne-Marie Slaughter have certainly made impassioned cries -- the most convincing argument seems to be an economic one. 
In the United States, women represent not only a majority of college graduates but also a majority of advanced-degree holders. But the lack of policies facilitating the work-life balance -- like paid maternity leave and flexible work hours -- has millions of them underemployed. It's hard to quantify exactly how much human capital is being wasted, but one clue lies in a study by economists at the University of Chicago and Stanford. It estimates that 15 to 20 percent of American productivity growth over the last five decades has come from more efficient allocation of underrepresented groups, like women, into occupations that were largely off-limits, like doctors or lawyers. Even more efficient allocation of women's talents would, presumably, drive further growth, which will become even more critical in the years ahead. By 2050, there are projected to be just 2.6 working-age Americans for every American of retirement age. (In 2008, it was 4.7.)
Other rich countries have figured out ways to keep women in the labor force. While companies like Yahoo and Best Buy bar employees from working from home, the European Union has issued a directive that all member countries must allow parents -- men and women -- to request part-time, flexible or home-based work arrangements in addition to paid leave. Other developed countries also have affordable, high-quality public childcare. In Sweden, some public nurseries are even available 24 hours a day.
Such policies contribute to these countries' swollen welfare states and higher tax burdens, but they do keep women at work. Back in 1990, in a ranking of 22 developed countries, the United States had the 6th-highest share of its prime-working-age women active in the work force. By 2010, it had tumbled to 17th place. A new study from Francine D. Blau and Lawrence M. Kahn, both economists at Cornell, estimates that if the United States had the average of other developed countries' work-life policies, 82 percent of America's prime-working-age women would be in the labor force, instead of the current 75 percent.
But what kind of employment would they have, exactly? New research suggests that, because it's primarily women who take advantage of leave and part-time entitlements, work-life accommodations often paradoxically limit career trajectories. Women in Sweden, Finland and Denmark -- and other countries held up as paragons of gender parity -- are much more likely to end up in traditional pink-collar positions than are their counterparts in the United States. They are certainly much less likely to end up as managers, or in traditionally male professional arenas like law or finance. ''In a regime where anyone can go part time, where it's hard to get rid of people if they do, employers might sort on the front end and not hire people they think are likely to want to go part time, which usually means women,'' said Lawrence F. Katz, an economist at Harvard. ''There may be no way a woman can credibly commit to sticking around and not going part time.'' The U.S., where these policies do not exist, has the smallest gap between women's representation in the labor force and their representation in senior management positions.
In order to prescribe policies that really allow female workers to ''lean in'' at work, social scientists are trying to find ones that recast social norms and encourage male workers to ''lean in'' at home. One area where there seems to be a lot of potential is paternity leave, which still has a stigma in both the United States and Europe. To remedy this bad rap, countries like Sweden and Norway have recently introduced a quota of paid parental leave available only to fathers. If dads don't take it, they're leaving money on the table. In Germany and Portugal, moms get bonus weeks of maternity leave if their husbands take a minimum amount of paternity leave. All these countries have seen gigantic increases in the share of fathers who go on leave.
This might not sound like such a big deal, but social scientists are coming around to the notion that a man spending a few weeks at home with his newborn can help recast expectations and gender roles, at work and home, for a long time. A striking new study by a Cornell graduate student, Ankita Patnaik, based on a new paid paternity-leave quota in Quebec, found that parents' time use changed significantly. Several years after being exposed to the reform, fathers spent more time in child care and domestic work -- particularly ''time-inflexible'' chores, like cooking, that cut into working hours -- than fathers who weren't exposed to the reform. More important, mothers spent considerably more time at work growing their careers and contributing more to the economy, all without any public mandates or shaming.
Paid paternity leave, like paid maternity leave, may sound like a pipe dream, but states (New Jersey, California) and big companies (Ernst & Young, Bank of America) are increasingly offering it and financing it out of their own pocket. They have a vested interest in lobbying Congress to federalize the costs of these accommodations. And that seems only fair. After all, unleashing the full potential of the second sex benefits not only this handful of players but the entire U.S. economy, too.
Deep thoughts this week:
1. The United States is not monetizing the skills of female workers.
2. Progressive solutions seem like the answer.
3. But they're not.
4. Welcome to the Daddy Diaper Duty economy.

HEADLINE: Fast, Good and Good For You

BYLINE: By MARK BITTMAN

 BODY:
When my daughter was a teenager, about a dozen years ago, she went through a vegetarian phase. Back then, the payoff for orthodontist visits was a trip to Taco Bell, where the only thing we could eat were bean burritos and tacos. It wasn't my favorite meal, but the mushy beans in that soft tortilla or crisp shell were kind of soothing, and the sweet ''hot'' sauce made the experience decent enough. I usually polished off two or three. 
I was thinking of those Taco Bell stops during a recent week of travel. I had determined, as a way of avoiding the pitfalls of airport food, to be vegan for the length of the trip. This isn't easy. By the time I got to Terminal C at Dallas/Fort Worth, I couldn't bear another Veggie Delite from Subway, a bad chopped salad on lousy bread. So I wandered up to the Taco Bell Express opposite Gate 14 and optimistically asked the cashier if I could get a bean burrito without cheese or sour cream. He pointed out a corner on the overhead display where the ''fresco'' menu offered pico de gallo in place of dairy, then upsold me on a multilayered ''fresco'' bean burrito for about 3 bucks. As he was talking, the customers to my right and left, both fit, suit-wearing people bearing expressions of hunger and resignation, perked up. They weren't aware of the fresco menu, either. One was trying to ''eat healthy on the road''; the other copped to ''having vegan kids.'' Like me, they were intrigued by a fast-food burrito with about 350 calories, or less than half as many as a Fiesta Taco Salad bowl. It wasn't bad, either.
Twelve years after the publication of ''Fast Food Nation'' and nearly as long since Morgan Spurlock almost ate himself to death, our relationship with fast food has changed. We've gone from the whistle-blowing stage to the higher-expectations stage, and some of those expectations are being met. Various states have passed measures to limit the confinement of farm animals. In-N-Out Burger has demonstrated that you don't have to underpay your employees to be profitable. There are dozens of plant-based alternatives to meat, with more on the way; increasingly, they're pretty good.
The fulfillment of these expectations has led to higher ones. My experience at the airport only confirmed what I'd been hearing for years from analysts in the fast-food industry. After the success of companies like Whole Foods, and healthful (or theoretically healthful) brands like Annie's and Kashi, there's now a market for a fast-food chain that's not only healthful itself, but vegetarian-friendly, sustainable and even humane. And, this being fast food: cheap. ''It is significant, and I do believe it is coming from consumer desire to have choices and more balance,'' says Andy Barish, a restaurant analyst at Jefferies LLC, the investment bank. ''And it's not just the coasts anymore.''
I'm not talking about token gestures, like McDonald's fruit-and-yogurt parfait, whose calories are more than 50 percent sugar. And I don't expect the prices to match those of Taco Bell or McDonald's, where economies of scale and inexpensive ingredients make meals dirt cheap. What I'd like is a place that serves only good options, where you don't have to resist the junk food to order well, and where the food is real -- by which I mean dishes that generally contain few ingredients and are recognizable to everyone, not just food technologists. It's a place where something like a black-bean burger piled with vegetables and baked sweet potato fries -- and, hell, maybe even a vegan shake -- is less than 10 bucks and 800 calories (and way fewer without the shake). If I could order and eat that in 15 minutes, I'd be happy, and I think a lot of others would be, too. You can try my recipes for a fast, low-calorie burger, fries and shake.
In recent years, the fast-food industry has started to heed these new demands. Billions of dollars have been invested in more healthful fast-food options, and the financial incentives justify these expenditures. About half of all the money spent on food in the United States is for meals eaten outside the home. And last year McDonald's earned $5.5 billion in profits on $88 billion in sales. If a competitor offered a more healthful option that was able to capture just a single percent of that market share, it would make $55 million. Chipotle, the best newcomer of the last generation, has beaten that 1 percent handily. Last year, sales approached $3 billion. In the fourth quarter, they grew by 17 percent over the same period in the previous year.
Numbers are tricky to pin down for more healthful options because the fast food industry doesn't yet have a category for ''healthful.'' The industry refers to McDonald's and Burger King as ''quick-serve restaurants''; Chipotle is ''fast casual''; and restaurants where you order at the counter and the food is brought to you are sometimes called ''premium fast casual.'' Restaurants from these various sectors often deny these distinctions, but QSR, an industry trade magazine -- ''Limited-Service, Unlimited Possibilities'' -- spends a good deal of space dissecting them.
However, after decades of eating the stuff, I have my own. First, there are those places that serve junk, no matter what kind of veneer they present. Subway, Taco Bell (I may be partial to them, but really. . .), McDonald's and their ilk make up the Junk Food sector. One step up are places with better ambience and perhaps better ingredients -- Shake Shack, Five Guys, Starbucks, Pret a Manger -- that also peddle unhealthful food but succeed in making diners feel better about eating it, either because it tastes better, is surrounded by some healthful options, the setting is groovier or they use some organic or sustainable ingredients. This is the Nouveau Junk sector.
Chipotle combines the best aspects of Nouveau Junk to create a new category that we might call Improved Fast Food. At Chipotle, the food is fresher and tastes much better than traditional fast food. The sourcing, production and cooking is generally of a higher level; and the overall experience is more pleasant. The guacamole really is made on premises, and the chicken (however tasteless) is cooked before your eyes. It's fairly easy to eat vegan there, but those burritos can pack on the calories. As a competitor told me, ''Several brands had a head start on [the Chipotle founder Steve] Ells, but he kicked their [expletive] with culture and quality. It's not shabby for assembly-line steam-table Mexican food. It might be worth $10 billion right now.'' (It is.)
Chipotle no longer stands alone in the Improved Fast Food world: Chop't, Maoz, Freshii, Zoës Kitchen and several others all have their strong points. And -- like Chipotle -- they all have their limitations, starting with calories and fat. By offering fried chicken and fried onions in addition to organic tofu, Chop't, a salad chain in New York and Washington, tempts customers to turn what might have been a healthful meal into a calorie bomb (to say nothing of the tasteless dressing), and often raises the price to $12 or more. The Netherlands-based Maoz isn't bad, but it's not as good as the mom-and-pop falafel trucks and shops that are all over Manhattan. There are barely any choices, nothing is cooked to order, the pita is a sponge and there is a messy serve-yourself setup that makes a $10 meal seem like a bit of a rip-off.
Despite its flaws, Improved Fast Food is the transitional step to a new category of fast-food restaurant whose practices should be even closer to sustainable and whose meals should be reasonably healthful and good-tasting and inexpensive. (Maybe not McDonald's-inexpensive, but under $10.) This new category is, or will be, Good Fast Food, and there are already a few emerging contenders.
Veggie Grill is a six-year-old Los Angeles--based chain with 18 locations. Technically, it falls into the ''premium fast casual'' category. The restaurants are pleasantly designed and nicely lighted and offer limited service. The food is strictly vegan, though you might not know it at first.
Kevin Boylan and T. K. Pillan, the chain's founders, are vegans themselves. They frequently refer to their food as ''familiar'' and ''American,'' but that's debatable. The ''chickin'' in the ''Santa Fe Crispy Chickin'' sandwich is Gardein, a soy-based product that has become the default for fast-food operators looking for meat substitutes. Although there are better products in the pipeline, Gardein, especially when fried, tastes more or less like a McNugget (which isn't entirely ''real'' chicken itself). The ''cheese'' is Daiya, which is tapioca-based and similar in taste to a pasteurized processed American cheese. The ''steak,'' ''carne asada,'' ''crab cake'' (my favorite) and ''burger'' are also soy, in combination with wheat and pea protein. In terms of animal welfare, environmental damage and resource usage, these products are huge steps in the right direction. They save animals, water, energy and land.
Boylan wanted to make clear to me that his chain isn't about haute cuisine. ''We're not doing sautéed tempeh with a peach reduction da-da-da,'' he said. ''That may be a great menu item, but most people don't know what it is. When we say 'cheeseburger' -- or 'fried chickin' with mashed potatoes with gravy and steamed kale -- everyone knows what we're talking about.'' He's probably right, and the vegetables are pretty good, too. The mashed potatoes are cut with 40 percent cauliflower; the gravy is made from porcini mushrooms and you can get your entree on a bed of kale instead of a bun.
When I first entered a Veggie Grill, I expected a room full of skinny vegans talking about their vegan-ness. Instead, at locations in Hollywood, El Segundo and Westwood, the lines could have been anywhere, even an airport Taco Bell. The diners appeared mixed by class and weight, and sure looked like omnivores, which they mostly are. The company's research shows that about 70 percent of its customers eat meat or fish, a fact that seems both reflected in its menu and its instant success. Veggie Grill won best American restaurant in the 2012 Los Angeles Times readers' poll, and sales are up 16 percent in existing stores compared with last year. The plan is to double those 18 locations every 18 months for the foreseeable future -- ''fast enough to stay ahead of competitors, but not so fast as to lose our cultural DNA,'' Boylan said. In 2011, the founders brought in a new C.E.O., Greg Dollarhyde, who helped Baja Fresh become a national chain before its sale to Wendy's for nearly $300 million.
Veggie Grill is being underwritten partly by Brentwood Associates, a small private-equity firm that's invested in various consumer businesses, including Zoës Kitchen, a chain that offers kebabs, braised beans and roasted vegetables. ''For a firm like us to get involved with a concept like Veggie Grill, we have to believe it's a profitable business model, and we do,'' Brentwood's managing director, Rahul Aggarwal, told me. ''Ten years ago I would've said no vegan restaurant would be successful, but people are looking for different ways to eat and this is a great concept.''
I admire Veggie Grill, but while making ''chickin'' from soy is no crime, it's still far from real food. I have a long-running argument with committed vegan friends, who say that Americans aren't ready for rice and beans, or chickpea-and-spinach stew, and that places like Veggie Grill offer a transition to animal-and-environment-friendlier food. On one level, I agree. Why feed the grain to tortured animals to produce lousy meat when you can process the grain and produce it into ''meat''? On another level, the goal should be fast food that's real food, too.
Much of what I ate at Veggie Grill was fried and dense, and even when I didn't overeat, I felt as heavy afterward as I do after eating at a Junk Food chain. And while that Santa Fe Crispy Chickin sandwich with lettuce, tomato, red onion, avocado and vegan mayo comes in at 550 calories, 200 fewer than Burger King's Tendercrisp chicken sandwich, the ''chickin'' sandwich costs $9. The Tendercrisp costs $5, and that's in Midtown Manhattan.
Future growth should allow Veggie Grill to lower prices, but it may never be possible to spend less than 10 dollars on a meal there. Part of that cost is service: at Veggie Grill, you order, get a number to put on your table and wait for a server. It's a luxury compared with most chains, and a pleasant one, but the combination of the food's being not quite real and the price's being still too high means Veggie Grill hasn't made the leap to Good Fast Food.
During my time in Los Angeles, I also ate at Native Foods Café, a vegan chain similar to Veggie Grill, where you can get a pretty good ''meatball'' sub (made of seitan, a form of wheat gluten), and at Tender Greens, which, though it is cafeteria-style (think Chipotle with a large Euro-Californian menu), flirts with the $20 mark for a meal. It can't really be considered fast food, but it's quite terrific and I'd love to see it put Applebee's and Olive Garden out of business.
In Culver City, I visited Lyfe Kitchen (that's ''Love Your Food Everyday''; I know, but please keep reading). Lyfe has the pedigree, menu, financing, plan and ambition to take on the major chains. The company is trying to build 250 locations in the next five years, and QSR has already wondered whether it will become the ''Whole Foods of fast food.''
At Lyfe, the cookies are dairy-free; the beef comes from grass-fed, humanely raised cows; nothing weighs in at more than 600 calories; and there's no butter, cream, white sugar, white flour, high-fructose corn syrup or trans fats. The concept was the brainchild of the former Gardein executive and investment banker Stephen Sidwell, who quickly enlisted Mike Roberts, the former global president of McDonald's, and Mike Donahue, McDonald's U.S.A.'s chief of corporate communications. These three teamed up with Art Smith, Oprah's former chef, and Tal Ronnen, who I believe to be among the most ambitious and talented vegan chefs in the country.
According to Roberts, Lyfe currently has more than 250 angel investors who ''represent a group of people that are saying, 'We've been waiting for something like this.' '' The Culver City operation opened earlier this year, and two more California locations are scheduled to open before the year is out. New York locations are being actively scouted, and a Chicago franchise is in the works.
When I visited the Culver City operation, shortly before its official opening, I sampled across the menu and came away impressed. There are four small, creative flatbread pizzas under $10; one is vegan, two are vegetarian and one was done with chicken. I tasted terrific salads, like a beet-and-farro one ($9) that could easily pass for a starter at a good restaurant, and breakfast selections, like steel-cut oatmeal with yogurt and real maple syrup ($5) and a tofu wrap ($6.50), were actually delicious.
Lyfe, not unlike life, isn't cheap. The owners claim that an average check is ''around $15'' but one entree (roast salmon, bok choy, shiitake mushrooms, miso, etc.) costs exactly $15. An ''ancient grain'' bowl with Gardein ''beef tips'' costs $12, which seems too much. Still, the salmon is good and the bowl is delicious, as is a squash risotto made with farro that costs $9 -- or the price of a ''chickin'' sandwich at Veggie Grill or a couple of Tendercrisp sandwiches at Burger King.
How in the world, I asked Roberts and Donahue, can they expect to run 250 franchises serving that salmon dish or the risotto or their signature roasted brussels sprouts, which they hope to make into the French fries of the 21st century? Donahue acknowledged that it was going to be a challenge, but nothing that technology couldn't solve. Lyfe will rely on digital order-taking, G.P.S. customer location -- a coaster will tell your server where you're sitting -- online ordering and mobile apps. Programmable, state-of-the-art combination ovens store recipes, cook with moist or dry heat and really do take the guesswork out of cooking. An order-tracking system tells cooks when to start preparing various parts of dishes and requires their input only at the end of each order. Almost all activity is tracked in real time, which helps the managers run things smoothly.
Lyfe isn't vegan, so much as protein-agnostic. You can get a Gardein burger or a grass-fed beef burger, ''unfried'' chicken or Gardein ''chickin.'' You can also get wine (biodynamic), beer (organic) or a better-than-it-sounds banana-kale smoothie. However, I fear that Lyfe's ambition, and its diverse menu, will drive up equipment and labor costs, and that those costs are going to keep the chain from appealing to less-affluent Americans. You can get a lot done in a franchise system, but its main virtues are locating the most popular dishes, focusing on their preparation and streamlining the process. My hope is that Lyfe will evolve, as all businesses do, by a process of trial and error, and be successful enough that they have a real impact on the way we think of fast food.
Veggie Grill, Lyfe Kitchen, Tender Greens and others have solved the challenge of bringing formerly upscale, plant-based foods to more of a mass audience. But the industry seems to be focused on a niche group that you might call the health-aware sector of the population. (If you're reading this article, you're probably in it.) Whole Foods has proved that you can build a publicly traded business, with $16 billion in market capitalization, by appealing to this niche. But fast food is, at its core, a class issue. Many people rely on that Tendercrisp because they need to, and our country's fast-food problem won't be solved -- no matter how much innovation in vegan options or high-tech ovens -- until the prices come down and this niche sector is no longer niche.
It was this idea that led me, a few years ago, to try to start a fast-food chain of my own, modeled after Chipotle. I wanted to focus on Mediterranean food, largely on plant-based options like falafel, hummus, chopped salad, grilled vegetables and maybe a tagine or ratatouille. I wanted to prioritize sustainability, minimize meat and eliminate soda, and I'd treat and pay workers fairly. But after chatting with a few fast-food veterans, I soon recognized just how quixotic my ideas seemed. Anyone with industry experience would want to add more meat, sell Coke and take advantage of both workers and customers to maximize profits. I lost my stomach for the project before I even really began, but recent trends suggest that there may have been hope had I stuck to my guns. Soda consumption is down; meat consumption is down; sales of organic foods are up; more people are expressing concern about G.M.O.s, additives, pesticides and animal welfare. The lines out the door -- first at Chipotle and now at Maoz, Chop't, Tender Greens and Veggie Grill -- don't lie. According to a report in Advertising Age, McDonald's no longer ranks in the top 10 favorite restaurants of Millennials, a group that comprises as many as 80 million people. Vegans looking for a quick fix after the orthodontist have plenty of choices.
Good Fast Food doesn't need to be vegan or even vegetarian; it just ought to be real, whole food. The best word to describe a wise contemporary diet is flexitarian, which is nothing more than intelligent omnivorism. There are probably millions of people who now eat this way, including me. My own style, which has worked for me for six years, is to eat a vegan diet before 6 p.m. and then allow myself pretty much whatever I want for dinner. This flexibility avoids junk and emphasizes plants, and Lyfe Kitchen, which offers both ''chickin'' and chicken -- plus beans, vegetables and grains in their whole forms (all for under 600 calories per dish) -- comes closest to this ideal. But the menu offers too much, the service raises prices too high and speed is going to be an issue. My advice would be to skip the service and the wine, make a limited menu with big flavors and a few treats and keep it as cheap as you can. Of course, there are huge players who could do this almost instantaneously. But the best thing they seem able to come up with is the McWrap or the fresco menu.
In the meantime, I'm throwing out a few recipes to the entire fast-food world to help build a case that it's possible use real ingredients to create relatively inexpensive, low-calorie, meat-free, protein-dense, inexpensive fast food. If anyone with the desire can produce this stuff in a home kitchen, then industry veterans financed by private equity firms should be able to produce it at scale in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the price. You think people won't eat it? There's a lot of evidence that suggests otherwise.

Times reporters working abroad pick their most memorable watering holes.
PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI I still wonder about the German-speaking couple at the hotel bar of the Oloffson in Port-au-Prince. They chatted, joked and flirted, seemingly oblivious to the tensions of another Haiti election. The Oloffson is a mash-up of old French furnishings and voodoo art favored by the owner, an opinionated political insider. It's a bit ragged, as are the visitors. But that's the charm. Unless you don't speak German. Randal Archibold
HANOI, VIETNAM ''If you're coming to Hanoi, would you bring me a bottle of Grey Goose Vodka?'' Bobby Chinn, a celebrity chef, stocks his eponymous restaurant bars, one in Hanoi and one in Ho Chi Minh City, by getting patrons to bring him liquor from duty-free shops. It's tequila from Mexico, bourbon from the United States and single-malt whiskey from practically anywhere else. It may be ''kind of illegal,'' Chinn admits, but everyone drops by for a drink or a meal while handing over a receipt. Keith Bradsher 
LIMA, PERU La Emolienteria serves some of the continent's weirdest drinks. Emoliente is a Peruvian herbal tea (horse tail, flax seeds, barley) sold on street corners. Here a big pot of it steams behind the bar, where it is mixed with pisco, a grape brandy. Steeping in pisco-filled jugs are bark and leaves and small fruits like shriveled eyeballs. You pick your pisco from flavors that include coca leaf, eucalyptus or camu camu (a tart Amazonian fruit). William Neuman
MADRID Juana La Loca is a sliver of a bar, but that's not the only reason it's usually packed. Many in Spain can't afford lavish dinners anymore. Here they have a cheaper option: tapas with flair. There's a good wine list, but the drink of choice is the caña -- a draft beer served ice-cold. It arrives in glasses small enough that you never end up with warm beer. And the tapas are probably the most original in the city. One example: butterfish sashimi with truffle shavings and asparagus. Suzanne Daley
CAIRO In the cosmopolitan Cairo of Egypt's British-backed monarchy, the Greek Club served only Greeks. Today its cavernous dining rooms and leafy terrace are open to anyone who can find it -- near Tahrir Square, through an unmarked door, up flights of dusty stairs. The paint on the ceiling has chipped off in places. Paintings hang askew on the walls. But the club still serves beer and wine far from the disapproving eyes of Cairo's Muslim majority, and that has made it a favorite hangout of expats, artists, intellectuals and, now, revolutionaries. David Kirkpatrick
NOUAKCHOTT, MAURITANIA Four years ago, a friend and I knocked at a green door in the expat district in Nouakchott. A man peered out through a slat. Assured that we were not Mauritanians, he let us inside, where a solitary drinker nursed a glass of wine. No music, no lights -- all hush-hush in this very Islamic capital. Few of the city's restaurants served wine. If they did, you told the waiter ''wine,'' he nodded and came out with a brown milk pitcher. As you drank, men in loose robes sipped tea or soft drinks. They weren't supposed to know. Adam Nossiter
RIO DE JANEIRO Much of Rio de Janeiro may be experiencing the effects of an economic boom, but the city's unkempt neighborhood bars, known as pés-sujos (literally ''dirty feet'') still draw a crowd. The waterfront setting of Bar Urca allows patrons to sip beer on the sea wall as they gaze across Guanabara Bay at the city's granite peaks. The service is lackadaisical, but what you're here for is the view. Simon Romero
ATHENS It's on a gritty street in downtown Athens, under the shadow of the Acropolis. At night, you have to wander through a shuttered flea market to find it. But inside, the Art Foundation, or TAF, is a hidden garden -- a courtyard where trees are strung with lights; an oasis, young and alive. Rachel Donadio
Warsaw The gray marble floor is cracked and the varnish on the bar is peeling, but the equivalent of 5 bucks gets you a shot of vodka, a beer and a hot sausage. Warsaw's Przekaski Zakaski is as good for the worker in overalls as the sequined club girl, one of the few scene-neutral places where a foreign correspondent can toast, mourn and swap conspiracy theories (safe bet: blame Russia) with both in the same night. In this small corner of the 19th-century Hotel Europejski, you always bump into a friend or share shots of Zubrowka Biala vodka with the bow-tied barman, Mr. Roman. Nicholas Kulish
JODHPUR, INDIA Few places recall the era of the maharajahs and their spirited bond with the British as vividly as the bar at Reggie's Camel Camp Osian. Dark wood, mounted horns and pictures of royal hunting parties adorn the walls. Reggie Singh, the noble proprietor, has been known to pass around home-brewed hooch and free bottles of Champagne. The camp is on a few sand dunes, and it is as much castle as camp: there are stone archways, a hilltop pool and camel racetrack. But the heart of the place is its fabulous bar, where Singh makes all of his guests feel like maharajahs. Gardiner Harris
KABUL, AFGHANISTAN Like most Kabul cafes, the Design Center cannot serve alcohol, but it is still intoxicating. Afghan carpets cover the floor, and candles fill the recesses in the mud walls. Overhead, lamps of turquoise, amber and pale green Herati glass give the place a festive air. In winter, sitting on the low couches near the huge bukhari wood stove, you feel as if you were in somebody's living room. Whatever the season, I always order a fresh mint lemonade. It comes in a tall, slender glass, cold and bright green, a perfect balance between tart and sweet. Alissa Rubin
MUCKADILLA, AUSTRALIA Floodwaters can make for strange bedfellows. In 2010, mine were a few barflies and the residents of the Muckadilla Hotel in a town of nine. It was my first real outback pub. A refrigerator truck of kangaroo carcasses sat in the lot. One man -- his jeans held up with bailing twine -- looked at me for 15 minutes before he said, ''You're not from around here, are you?'' Matt Siegel
VIENTIANE, LAOS In Vientiane, the capital of Laos, there's a bar with the unlikely name of I-Beam. It's a sleek refuge for foreign workers from the mining companies, law firms and development banks that are trying to drag this laid-back Southeast Asian country into the 21st century. The owner, Frédéric Dionne-Vachon, a French-Canadian, imports wines from New Zealand and France, serves a decent if overly sweet Manhattan and hires a jazz trio whose members come from Ireland and Madagascar. Jane Perlez
XIAMEN, CHINA I once went to a waterfront bug bar in the port city of Xiamen. Rows of plastic containers were filled with cockroaches (of different varieties), beetles, grasshoppers, bees, ants and spiders. My friend Chris Buckley fancied bugs and ordered flash-fried water roaches, sprinkled with salt and pepper. They arrived looking as perfectly preserved as the exotic insects you might see on pins at the Museum of Natural History. I watched my friend bite into the curved black shells of a half dozen or more roaches and then pick the legs out of his teeth. I opted for a cold Tsingtao beer. Jim Yardley
TOKYO The Old Imperial Bar in the Imperial Hotel is the closest you can come to sharing a drink with Frank Lloyd Wright. While the original hotel designed by the American architect in 1915 is long gone, his aesthetic spirit still occupies the bar, which is hidden on the second floor of the current hotel, completed in 1970. The bar retains the style of the original Wright building, down to the walls of carved stone that look like the work of ancient Mayans, the abstractly hexagon-backed wooden chairs and even the small martini glasses. Completing the prewar atmosphere, the bartenders mix perfectly crafted cocktails in tiny silver shakers, while holding their elbows at precisely the correct angle. Martin Fackler
KABUL, AFGHANISTAN Upstairs was a bad Chinese restaurant. Downstairs was a speakeasy. It was one of many illicit drinking dives in a country that still bans the production, sale and consumption of alcohol, even though the Taliban is no longer in power. There was no secret password to gain entry to this Kabul bar, just a simple ordering code that anyone could crack, including no doubt the Islamic militants who eventually put a rocket-propelled grenade through the front window. Beer appeared on the menu as ''chai,'' or tea, and arrived in a white porcelain Chinese teapot. It was the only hint of adornment in a strictly no-frills drinking hole that always knew its days were numbered. Andrew Higgins

HEADLINE: Going Whole Hog

BYLINE: By MARNIE HANEL

 BODY:
On a recent morning in Portland, Ore., Camas Davis was teaching nine high-school kids how to butcher a pig. A 17-year-old named Mady called dibs on the front trotter, slicing through the skin near the pig's ankle, then using a hand saw to cut through the bone. Nathan, 15, moved up the leg and worked through the hock, while Karina, 16, eyed the shoulder. Pushing up the sleeves of her red cardigan, she placed her blade between the fifth and sixth ribs, scored the flesh, then gave the knife a long pull, separating the shoulder from the carcass, but leaving intact the coppa -- a muscle around the pig's neck -- in case anyone wanted to roast it. 
The kids were wearing aprons over their jeans. When it wasn't their turn to butcher, they gossiped and texted friends photos of the dead pig, which was splayed out on a jigsaw of white cutting boards, its head sitting nearby, gazing on; its eyelids had been sliced off during an inspection for parasites. On a counter, industrial plastic bins were marked: bellies, loin/chops, shoulders/roasts, hams, bones/trotters/hocks. The students took turns removing the pig's feet and breaking the animal down into four ''primals'': shoulder, loin, belly and ham. Then Davis stepped in to show them how to butcher it into the cuts they'd seen at the grocery store and the ones they hadn't. She picked up a leg, peeling off the skin with her blade, removing the ''H-bone,'' and then turned it toward her students. ''Instead of muscling through this,'' she said, ''I'm going to use the tip of my knife to feather through the fascia,'' the pig's connective tissue. Davis held the knife in a butcher's grip and delicately separated the muscle groups to reveal a roast. ''Now it's your turn.''
Butchery is a new course being offered by the Oregon Episcopal School, an independent preparatory academy that prides itself on ''inquiry-based learning.'' Each year, the week before spring break, called Winterim, is reserved for experimental education projects. Some students go dog-sledding in Minnesota. Others play Dungeons & Dragons or opt for an intensive course in the art of hat-making. Recently, an English teacher at the school, Kara Tambellini, read an article about the Portland Meat Collective and proposed a course on butchery.
And so Davis, who has taught butchery to mothers and young professionals, to beer brewers and bike messengers, but never to high schoolers, devised a weeklong curriculum that covered the basics. This included a field trip on a Friday, when she took the students to a local farm to meet and select a pig, whom they named Wilbur and then, realizing she was female, renamed Wilburess.
The next Monday morning, the class met up with Wilburess again at a local slaughterhouse, along with her 30-year-old owner, Bubba King, who had a thick brown beard and bounced a 5-month-old baby named Ulysses on his hip. When the recession hit, King explained, he borrowed some farmland -- though he had no previous farm experience -- to raise pigs. He learned how to butcher them on YouTube. Eventually, he got in touch with Davis, who, through the Meat Collective, gave him a formal lesson. Now her students buy his hogs for their butchery courses. King sells them for $3.25 per pound of hanging weight, which is how much an animal weighs after it has been slaughtered, gutted and drained of its blood. Wilburess, at 171 pounds, earned him $536 -- he gave the students a discount.
In this farm-to-table era, community-supported-agriculture shares -- in which families purchase farm goods through a weekly subscription -- have become increasingly popular. Nowhere is that more true than in Portland, where people take their food ethics, among other things, very seriously. There is a sketch in the first episode of the IFC comedy ''Portlandia'' in which characters played by Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein persistently nudge their waitress for information about the chicken on the menu. After asking if the chicken was raised organically and about the size of its roaming area, they find out that the chicken was named Colin and that it grew up on a farm 30 miles outside Portland; later Armisen is handed the chicken's citizenship papers. (The line between Portland and ''Portlandia'' often blurs; for example, Armisen gave the commencement address to Oregon Episcopal's graduating class.)
Six months before that episode was broadcast, I moved to Portland, and while I was unpacking boxes in my new house, a neighbor stopped by and asked me if I wanted to buy a cow. I went silent for a moment, then asked the only question that came to mind: ''Where would I put it?'' My neighbor, standing in my doorway wearing his bike helmet, handed me a brochure. ''I found two people already, so you'd get one-fourth of the cow,'' he said. He pointed to an address. ''You can visit him here.''
It's not as easy to get farm-to-table meat, however, as it is rhubarb and pattypan squash. Meat regulations are strict, and they dictate that animals must be slaughtered and processed (gutted, cleaned and butchered) at a U.S.D.A.-approved facility before entering the commercial market. There is an exception: If no one is making a profit, and the animal is going to be used only to feed family and friends, it can be slaughtered and processed at the owner's discretion. The loophole was probably intended for cattle ranchers, but city folks can use this exception to purchase a live animal (or a share of it) before it is killed. Meat C.S.A.'s are catching on throughout the country, and Portland -- where its legal to have three or fewer ducks, chickens or pygmy goats on your property without a permit -- is already three steps ahead. What better way to learn about the ethics of your meat than to slaughter and butcher it yourself?
The Portland Meat Collective -- a group of butchers and chefs that offers classes on meat production, butchery, cooking and, yes, slaughter -- was founded by Davis, a self-described ''meat thinker.'' She challenges her students and the larger community to engage with all aspects of meat production, whether that means visiting animals at farms or learning the skills to put them on their plates. The collective gave its first butchery course in 2010 and now holds classes in commercial kitchens, charging $100 to $300 per class. In the last three years, it has educated more than 1,000 students. The collective plans to introduce a Kickstarter campaign to expand the model nationwide. They're considering Seattle and Hood River, Ore., as test markets.
As a result of being a nose-to-tail carnivore, Davis has been called everything from a killer to an anti-feminist by animal activists, who might be surprised to learn she once was a vegetarian herself. (When I asked her why she began eating meat again, she replied, ''I was hungry.'') The organization that leased Davis a commercial kitchen for Winterim asked that we not mention its name, and when Davis initially visited the space, someone asked how she was going to contain the pig's blood. ''What blood?'' she said, and the reply revealed that the owners thought she was going to walk a live pig through the front door and kill it in front of nine teenagers. This ignorance, Davis says, is telling of our relationship to the animals that we eat -- most of us don't know the difference between butchery and slaughter.
Here's how Wilburess actually died. At the slaughterhouse, she walked down a chute into a kill room where Latin dance music was playing. A man applied an electrical prong to the back of her head to stun her senseless. He sent another stun to her heart to induce cardiac arrest. Then he checked her eyes for rapid movements and, finding none, pierced her brachial artery. He moved her body into a vat of scalding water to loosen the hair follicles. Then she was placed on a table to be dehaired. A worker hung her body on a hook, eviscerated it, then cut it down the middle. The students watched it all. No one fainted. No one cried. (Though a few kids admitted to their teachers later that they were considerably shaken.) As for Davis, she said that the first time she witnessed a slaughter, she broke into tears, and nearly every time she visits a slaughterhouse, she gets choked up.
The reasoning underlying the Portland Meat Collective, she says, is that by taking part in the process, we begin to think of how to use the animal differently. ''Once you slaughter a pig, you dehair it, you butcher it, you wrap it and you put it in your freezer, it's so much work you don't want to waste it,'' Davis says. ''It's special.'' Two days after Wilburess's slaughter, Davis cut off the pig's head and started listing its possible uses. ''Once I take the face off, there's a lot I can do with this. I can make my jowl bacon. I can leave the face intact and make porchetta di testa. I can dry the pig ears and give them to a dog. I can make headcheese.'' She pointed to the area just next to the jaw. ''The more a muscle works, the tougher it is, the more flavorful it is. Imagine how much these worked -- the cheeks!'' The students watched in silence. ''They're delicious.''
The first animal Davis ever slaughtered was a chicken. After that, she killed a rabbit. ''I've never figured out how to fully articulate what happens,'' she said. ''I don't feel guilty, and I don't feel bad. It is a pure and intense experience, but it is the most complicated experience you can have in terms of living and dying.''
The way the Portland Meat Collective teaches rabbit slaughter is by having a person sit in a chair with a rabbit at their feet and gently place a broomstick over its neck. When you pull the body, the stick breaks the rabbit's neck. Sometimes, it goes badly. ''This one guy pulled the body so hard, he ripped the head off,'' Davis told me. ''I came home from that class and curled up on a couch and didn't move for a day.'' In a separate incident last year, activists stole 18 rabbits from a breeder who supplies the Meat Collective. Among the group of stolen rabbits was a nursing mother, and because she'd gone missing, several 10-day-old rabbits died. Davis wrote an essay about the incident that was later adapted for the radio program ''This American Life.'' (Again the line between Portland and ''Portlandia'' blurred; it turns out one of the suspected rabbit thieves was an extra on the TV show.)
As a kid, Davis hunted and fished with her family, and one summer she worked in an ''intentional community,'' where bakers consulted their astrological charts before baking bread. As an adult, after working at National Geographic Adventure and Saveur, she moved west in 2006 to become the food editor of Portland Monthly. There, Davis experienced -- and later wrote an article about -- ''the tastiest cut of beef you've never heard of'': bavette. But when she set out to buy it, she was stymied. No butcher carried it or could even tell her where the cut was located on the cow. The chef at the restaurant where she first ate bavette couldn't tell her exactly where on the animal it came from; nor could the guys at the meat shop, who mostly wielded their knives not to butcher an animal but to cut open boxes and pull out ready-made cuts. Eventually, she discovered that the bavette was located between the sirloin and the flank. It is known as ''flap meat'' in the U.S., and typically tossed into the container reserved for grind.
In 2009, in search of a deeper understanding, Davis went to France to study with an American cooking teacher named Kate Hill and to serve as an apprentice with a family of butchers and farmers named the Chapolards. She doesn't speak French, and the Chapolards didn't speak English, so she learned their craft through risk and repetition. She made some costly mistakes, like the time they handed her what she thought was a shoulder primal, and she cubed and skewered it, only to realize it was actually a ham. ''I basically just lost them hundreds of dollars,'' she recalls.
The Chapolards would say, ''Why would you do this thing that's not for beautiful, smart women?'' It wouldn't be the last time she ran up against this question, which often carries the implication that, given her relatively short apprenticeship in the world of butchery, she has traded on her looks to gain fame. She's aware but not concerned about the focus on her unexpected appearance. ''I don't want to capitalize off it,'' she says, ''and I kind of do.''
After a summer in the Chapolards' cutting room, Davis returned to Portland and found a job at a specialty-foods store called Pastaworks, where she tried to bring European butchery to the meat counter. ''Let's not do individual pork chops,'' she suggested. ''Let's put the whole loin in the case so it looks beautiful and we can cut individual chops.'' But the loin was unrecognizable to her customers. ''Is that tuna?'' they asked. So later that year, she decided to start a school that would replicate her experience in France by purchasing whole animals from small farms and teaching people how to butcher them by hand. ''If we gave people the opportunity to try and come up with an alternative system of meat production,'' Davis once wrote in response to an online comment by a vegetarian, ''we'd a) eat a lot less meat, and b) really dedicate ourselves to thinking about what it means to kill an animal for food, thereby c) causing us to recalibrate our respect for the animal world.''
On the last day of butchery class, the students made sausages. They loaded a meat grinder with chunks of pork shoulder, fatback (the layer of hard fat used to make lard) and spices. The grinder returned the pork to the students in ribbons, which they packed into the chamber of a sausage stuffer. Each student fit intestinal casings onto a nozzle and churned a crank with one hand while using the other to coax the cased sausage into a spiral.
I asked Alex, a 17-year-old wearing a fencing-team jacket, how it felt to make sausage out of a pig he knew by name.
''I hate the feeling of raw meat,'' he said.
''Then why'd you take this class?'' asked Sean, a 17-year-old with a side interest in baking cheesecake.
''I felt like I had to know,'' Alex replied.
Another student, Sophia, 19, who showed promising knife skills throughout the week, said that in the dorms, her butchery lessons hadn't been so well received. ''Everyday someone asks, 'What did you kill today?' ''
''It's a slow education,'' Davis said of teaching people the origin of their food. She has received requests from all over the country asking her to start meat collectives in other states. ''Here, it's been pretty easy to create an alternate economy,'' she says, estimating that about one-third of her students go on to purchase meat directly from farmers. But she also points out that in Portland, they're lucky to be so close to sources of livestock. ''We have the Willamette Valley and eastern Oregon that's full of great small farmers.'' Other cities are not so connected, physically and otherwise, to local agriculture. ''I had a woman who wanted to start one in Baltimore, and I was like, 'How far away is a good farm, whatever that means to you?' '' The woman took her best guess. ''She said, 'I don't know, 500 miles or something?' ''
Once the sausages were made, the class poached them, then browned them on a flattop griddle, then arranged them around the edge of a ceramic platter piled with green lentils. I wondered if the students would suddenly balk, preoccupied with the knowledge that, after days of butchering, they were about to eat an animal they'd once seen alive.
When they sat down at the table, they didn't even wait to pass the platter. They reached over one another, spooning heaping servings onto their plates. They scarfed it down and fought over the last links.

THE EPIC UPS AND DOWNS OF PETER GELB
For those of us opera lovers not often able to visit New York City to attend the Met, we are most thankful for Peter Gelb's vision. ''Live in HD'' broadcasts are without doubt the best thing since sliced bread. SIMON ROSENBLUM, Toronto
Those opposed to new productions under Gelb, the Met's general manager, are only nostalgic for producers who respect the intentions of the composers. Gelb says that his ''goal is to hire brilliant directors whose productions are entirely their vision, and [his] job is to support them.'' This approach means there is no artistic leadership at the top. The goal of a production should be to enlighten the composer's intentions, not to submerge them beneath a director's vision. FRANKLIN BLOOMER, Riverside, Conn. 
Now I understand. Peter Gelb, a college dropout, didn't take his history, geography or literature courses. Thus he put Gounod's ''Faust'' where J. Robert Oppenheimer belongs because he doesn't seem to know the difference between Dr. Atomic and Dr. Faustus. Perhaps he hasn't read Hugo's work on which ''Rigoletto'' is based, so he confuses ''Le Roi S'Amuse'' with Las Vegas. BEATRICE WILLIAMS-RUDE, New York
I'm grateful to Gelb for bringing in enthusiastic young audience members, who were there in full force for ''Otello'' recently. It thrilled me to see them among the rest of us ''oldies.'' I say more power to him. JEANNE OMMERLE, New York, posted on nytimes.com
KILLIAN JORNET, ALL-TERRAIN HUMAN
The most striking aspect of your article about Kilian Jornet, arguably the world's best endurance athlete, was the description of his ability as a small child, which suggests that part of his gift is a fortunate genetic variant. Years ago, the Finnish cross-country skier Eero Antero Mäntyranta won seven medals over the course of three Winter Olympics. It was later determined that he carried a rare mutation resulting in an increase in red-blood-cell production. Scientists are discovering more genetic factors that play a role in athletics; it could be said that taking performance-enhancing drugs simply levels the playing field between the mere mortals and their more genetically endowed competitors. Since I do not endorse the use of performance-enhancing drugs, a more ''natural'' approach might be to sponsor events where the Kilian Jornets of the world are asked to compete by carrying extra weight strapped to their backs. H. M. LACHMAN, M.D., Departments of Psychiatry and Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx
OY VEY, CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS
It's flattering to read that certain Christians find our Jewish practices so beautiful as to adopt them for themselves. But bar mitzvahs are embedded in a culture where the Torah, the Hebrew language, the tallit and religious obligations are knitted together with global and intergenerational significance. If Christian bar mitzvahs are another fad, like Christian theme parks, Christian rock and the flirtation with kabbalah, then they're nothing more than a mash-up of cultural memes that cheapen their meaning for everyone. RON MEYERS, New York

HEADLINE: Who Made That? (Ferris Wheel)

BYLINE: By PAGAN KENNEDY

 BODY:
''I leave it to you, ladies and gentlemen, to say if the wheel is still in my head,'' George Ferris called out to a crowd at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. Skeptics had joked that the young engineer would never build the giant whirligig that spun in his imagination. That day, his steel behemoth towered over the fairgrounds, its spokes gleaming in the sunlight; it could accommodate more than 2,000 riders at once. 
A reporter named Robert Graves took a ride in one of its streetcarlike cabins, the windows crisscrossed by wires to prevent suicidal leaps. As the wheel began to move, the floor quivered, setting nerves on edge. But when the cabin floated high over the fairgrounds, passengers forgot their worries and rushed to the windows to admire the river winking in the distance. ''It is an indescribable sensation,'' Graves wrote, ''of revolving through such a vast orbit in a bird cage.'' Many engineers had predicted Ferris's wheel would collapse, killing riders and bystanders. Instead, it performed perfectly. The ''vertical merry-go-round'' worked on the same principle as a bicycle wheel -- each of the spokes pressed into the rim, exerting a force that gave it enormous strength, says Rich Weingardt, a structural engineer who wrote a biography of Ferris. But Ferris's luck soon ran out. Though the wheel brought in $750,000 in ticket sales, the Chicago World's Fair staked a claim to most of the proceeds; Ferris battled them in court -- and lost. Meanwhile, America was hit with a severe recession, and his engineering business lost money. Three years after he started up his wheel, Ferriss was dead at the age of 37 from tuberculosis; the funeral home held onto his ashes because no one paid the balance due. Yet Ferris, Weingardt says, ''probably had more to do with the acceptance of structural steel than anybody alive at his time.'' Today, cities as diverse as Berlin, London and New York compete to build the most elaborate wheels in the world. And many are still inspired by the circle that spun in Ferris's head.
MAN OF STEEL
Erik Larson's nonfiction book, ''The Devil in the White City,'' tells the story of a murderer who stalked the Chicago World's Fair. George Ferris appears as a character.
Did you know anything about George Ferris when you began your book? I never knew that the ''Ferris'' in Ferris wheel was a person. I thought it meant iron -- like ferrous -- that it was a corruption of that word.
What's the strangest part of the Ferris story? That he was allowed to build his wheel in the first place. If you were to try to build an untried amusement today, it would never happen. There would be so many lawyers stepping up and saying, ''I don't want to take a chance on this thing.''
Are you a fan of Ferris wheels? I have zero interest in riding on a Ferris wheel. I'm not fond of heights.

HEADLINE: The Mad Czar of Verdelho

BYLINE: By ROBERT DRAPER

 BODY:
Somewhere in the manicured farmlands of Napa Valley, a 52-year-old winemaker named Abe Schoener stood in a puny and weed-choked tract of land surrounded by 40 gray and contorted barren vines, which he surveyed with paternal satisfaction. ''My view when I started leasing this was, It's 60-year-old-vine sauvignon blanc,'' he said, smiling. ''How bad could it be?''
No other winemaker had been willing to find out. Though it's believed that these could be the oldest sauvignon blanc vines in all of California, their average annual yield -- about 30 gallons of wine, or 14 cases -- is so paltry that investing in this scruffy vineyard, which is owned by the McDowell family, who threaten every year to uproot the vines and replace them with cabernet sauvignon, would hardly seem worth the effort. 
Schoener (pronounced shurner) views this matter, and almost everything else, differently. The most frequently used word in his extensive vocabulary is ''interesting'' -- as in, ''I find it interesting that I have absolutely no desire to own my own winery'' -- and his days seem to be consumed by the desire to evade predictability. ''No one else would want to work in this vineyard, because it's a pain in the ass, but it's perfect for Scholium,'' he said, referring to his one-man winery, the Scholium Project. For the past eight years, Scholium has made sauvignon blanc from the McDowell property, though the wine's label makes no mention of the actual grape, much less the oldness of its vines. Instead, the bottle simply reads, ''Glos,'' a reference to the name of the street that the vineyard is on, as well as the Greek word ''glossa,'' which translates to ''word'' or ''language.'' (In a previous life, Schoener taught classics at St. John's College in Annapolis, Md.) Standing beside him on the McDowell property were three of his interns, all of whom have pruned and harvested the vines: Alex, a former chef at the French Laundry; Brenna, a comprehensively tattooed wine director; and Courtney, a wine journalist who, when I asked her what the wine from this vineyard tasted like, sternly informed me, ''It tastes like Glos.'' (Later I paid $45 for a bottle, which is pale and restrained and unlike any other sauvignon blanc I've encountered. I guess that means it tastes like Glos.)
After showing me the McDowell Vineyard, Schoener drove us a few miles south to another vineyard he leases. We pulled up to the residence of a former refrigerator repairman named John Guman, who does not drink wine or any other kind of alcohol. After parking in the driveway and strolling past a collection of rusted tractors, we arrived in Guman's backyard. There sprawled an oversize garden of 30-year-old chardonnay vines. ''This is an A-plus vineyard,'' Schoener announced. ''Here is a place where one can make ageless wines. All you have to do is not screw it up.''
But it was also ridiculously miniature, producing in some vintages only about 80 gallons of juice, not much more than the McDowell property. For that very reason, the venerable Pahlmeyer winery stopped buying grapes from the Guman site after 2001. Schoener pounced on it. He calls the end product the Sylphs, after a mythological creature. As with Glos, its accompanying label says nothing about chardonnay, which is just as well, given that it doesn't really taste like chardonnay. Schoener has likened its flavor to porcini mushrooms and crushed rocks. At around $80 a bottle (of which there are sometimes as few as a hundred in a given vintage), the Sylphs sells out every year.
While Schoener squinted reverently at the chardonnay vines, Brenna trained adoring eyes on him. She confessed to me, in Schoener's presence, that the experience of working in his winery created ''a feeling that is almost reminiscent of being in love.'' I had seen similar displays of devotion at wine tastings that Schoener held in Brooklyn and San Francisco attended by well-heeled consumers who, while listening to the winemaker hold forth and sampling his unorthodox wines, buzzed among themselves like discoverers of a latter-day Dylan. Though there may be more coveted cult wines than those of the Scholium Project, the charismatic and somewhat quixotic Schoener is possibly America's only winemaker with a cult following of his own.
To some degree, Schoener owes his success to the burgeoning market for culinary adventurism. As his friend and fellow small-scale Napa winemaker Steve Matthiasson told me, ''The millennial generation are getting into position as wine buyers, and just like they're into the local-food movement and choosing between Berkshire pork and Mangalitsa pork, they're also culturally interested in exploring differences in wine.'' But Schoener has tapped into a longing that extends beyond an appreciation of flavors and origins. True, his strange, often wonderful wines express the seasonal eccentricities of both the vineyard and the maker rather than a striving for uniform taste and high Wine Spectator ratings. More broadly, however, Schoener is selling the experience of extreme authenticity, of something pure and irreplicable. The arrangement is almost absurdly harmonious: the classics professor who has gone to the land (not just any land, but land that's forgotten and seemingly irredeemable) and found virtue there, for himself and ultimately for his customers, who by buying his wines are buying into Schoener's vision and thereby becoming something more than just elitist wine collectors. As Javier Martell, a San Francisco-based lawyer and one of Schoener's longtime customers, told me: ''Part of the attraction of his wines is for people like me who practice law for a living and have a forced rigidity in our lives. Abe's wines give us an escape -- I'm going with the flow, and Abe's leading me down it, and it's sort of liberating.''
Liberating and, of course, exclusive. Schoener and his interns (he has no full-time employees) produce about 2,000 cases of wine annually from the Guman, McDowell and about 10 other vineyards (none of which he owns) at the Scholium Project's modest winery space (also leased) in the Suisun Valley, some 17 miles from his (rented) residence in Napa. Because he makes so little wine, Schoener estimates that he now has a customer list of about 600. Around 400 of these are restaurants and retailers, ranging from Per Se on Manhattan's Upper West Side to a wine bar in Oklahoma City. The remainder are mail-order customers, who until recently could purchase his wines on the Scholium Project's Web site at prices ranging from $24 (for a white blend) to $100 (for a cabernet). To help promote his product, the former professor has been traveling cross-country and delivering what he calls a metaphysical lecture series, in which he pours wine for small audiences while speaking on topics like ''Wine and Loss'' and ''Wine and Morality.'' Slots for these lecture-tastings rapidly sell out, as do his wines.
I learned about Schoener's wines a year ago after seeing them listed on a menu in a pricey Palo Alto restaurant and wondering who would be so pretentious as to term their winery a ''project.'' Later that evening, I looked at his Web site and realized I had it backward: ''Scholium'' derives from the Greek word ''scholion,'' as in ''school'' -- which according to the Web site ''signifies a modest project, not a pre-eminent one, undertaken for the sake of learning.'' I decided to order a mixed case. What arrived at my doorstep were a dozen alien creations. Some of them, including a murky golden sauvignon blanc called the Prince in His Caves and a meaty syrah named Androkteinos (Greek for ''slayer of men''), were absolutely delicious. Others -- an oxidized gewürztraminer, a limpid cinsault -- tasted like experiments gone awry. Still, as the Scholium Web site would explain, each wine had its own funky personality and back story -- a long-abandoned vineyard, an impulsive gamble on a little-known grape, a harvest season of biblical freakishness -- that, taken together, characterized the ongoing work of Abe Schoener's life. And so I joined the cult.
''I think I'm still not making money,'' Schoener cheerfully told me as we drove around last month to the various vineyards he leases, often on the basis of a handshake agreement. ''I'm sure at some point my revenue will exceed costs and I'll have a profit. But I don't know yet when that will be.''
I asked what his annual costs were. Schoener said he didn't know. When I asked him to estimate, he paused for a moment before saying, ''Maybe half a million?'' Some of his overhead, Schoener acknowledged, goes to things like ''purchasing a lot of Champagne for wine education'' and hosting dinner parties with customers both at home and in restaurants -- ''and it's demonstrable,'' he said, ''that my entertainment has a value to the business.'' He added, with diminished gusto, ''In the next few days I'll hire a rent-a-C.F.O. to remind me to fill out forms and help with the financial planning.''
Schoener's fuzzy-headed business acumen is, of course, thoroughly in keeping with his persona -- that of the groovy and somewhat hedonistic liberal-arts professor who taught philosophy, kept a garden, communed with his students on the basketball court and on dance floors and was blissfully at home in academia until his collapsing marriage spurred a midlife crisis that ultimately, in 1999, propelled him into the winemaker's life. He all but liquidated his college pension, borrowed $15,000 from friends, procured another $20,000 from designing a company's Web site and financed the bottling of his first few vintages. ''I was initially just driven by the desire to learn,'' he recalls, ''and sort of hoping that I would please people -- which is not the same thing as having the confidence that I could do so, which I have now, for sure.''
From the outset, Schoener was bent on what his fellow winemaker Steve Matthiasson terms ''fearless experimentation'' -- reflected in the winery's emblem, a diagram from Isaac Newton's ''Principia'' that shows how gravity accounts for planetary motion. That schematic, plus the Scholium Project's name and the specific wine's vineyard, would be his lone descriptors on the bottles' labels. He tinkered endlessly with obscure vineyards and varietals, with temperatures, with juice extraction, with acidity levels, with tannic structure, with rotting grapes. Sometimes he didn't tinker at all and simply let a seemingly doomed wine repose in barrels for years, until the day came that a brilliant identity suddenly materialized. (Or not. ''I've still got a 2003 botrytis-infected Malbec that's turning into some interesting form of balsamic vinegar,'' he told me.) Along the way, the ex-professor's daring earned him the respect of fellow cult winemakers who would then alert him to small and tricky but promising vineyards, as Andy Erickson, the former Screaming Eagle winemaker, did in 2005, when he introduced Schoener to the Farina property high up Sonoma Mountain, owned by a farmer who had been kicking himself for switching from growing pinot noir to sauvignon blanc, just before the movie ''Sideways'' immortalized the pinot noir. Since that time, the Scholium Project's singular Prince in His Caves has been made from the Farina vineyards.
''All of us experiment with weird wines, which we then serve at home or at parties,'' the winemaker Alex Kongsgaard told me. ''What sets Abe apart is that he'll publish his results -- he'll bottle and release his wine to the market. So when people complain that 'I had this wine of his, and I didn't like it,' well, that's not the point. The point is to try his wines and learn about them and think about why they taste the way they do. People who are into Abe's wines are interested in those ideas.''
In fact, it did not take very long for Abe Schoener to distinguish himself as the leading protagonist in a niche market cluttered with tiny and unorthodox viticultural artisans like Matthiasson, Salinia, Arnot-Roberts, Forlorn Hope and Donkey & Goat. ''I feel completely lucky,'' Schoener told me, ''because there were forces at work, completely independent of my efforts. I caught, at the very beginning, a desire for wines that were outside of the Napa paradigm. A whole new generation of 25- and 30-year-old sommeliers who hadn't grown up on Burgundy and Bordeaux were making it their mission to seek out unconventional wines.'' One of them, Cory Lane, a wine director in David Chang's Momofuku empire, cracked open a bottle of the Prince in His Caves during a dinner party with fellow wine geeks one night in 2008 on the Lower East Side, and within weeks the Scholium Project had taken up residence on about a dozen elite wine lists throughout Manhattan. Some restaurants, like Sepia in Chicago, would come to devote whole paragraphs on its menu to preparing customers for Schoener's eccentric product: ''The best way to experience the Scholium Project is by total immersion, letting your sense of adventure erase any preconceptions.'' For all of his iconoclasm, Schoener had stumbled upon a cherished gambit of Madison Avenue: he was selling a lifestyle, the pursuit of the ''interesting.''
One evening over dinner last month at a restaurant in Napa, Schoener told me that henceforth he would offer his wines only as a package: ''I thought, the right way to finance what I'm doing is to tell people that if they like the fact that I'm making 12 different wines, then get on board and buy all 12.'' (Price for the mixed case: $500.) I asked Schoener which of these 12 wines he considered his favorite. He did not hesitate for more than a second before replying, with a subversive grin, ''I think my desert-island wine would have to be Naucratis'' -- referring to a $24 white wine he makes from the Portuguese verdelho grape, which Schoener harvests from an undistinguished vineyard otherwise monopolized by a large commercial winery and residing below sea level in the Sacramento River delta. His choice was fitting, because it was his impulsive decision to purchase 34 tons of verdelho grapes from this vineyard in 2009 that brought him to the edge of financial ruin. With the recession in full swing, the winemaker found himself wandering from restaurant to restaurant, trying to sell thousands of bottles of wine made from a grape that few Americans have heard of. Eventually Schoener came to his senses, more or less: he took out a $250,000 bank loan, paid his debts and drastically scaled back his production of Naucratis. Eventually he sold all 3,400 cases. Nonetheless, there remain a few uncharitable souls in Napa who recall his early folly and refer to Schoener as the Verdelho King.
Just as Schoener maintains a love for the wine that almost bankrupted him, he harbors scorn for one of his most commercially successful staples, a delicious blend of four white grapes. ''I don't really want to make blended wines, but they're kind of a commercial necessity,'' he explained to me, somewhat apologetically. ''I have some wines that I feel are not good enough to put into a bottle with the name of the vineyard on it. That leaves me with only two alternatives: make a blended wine or throw it away.'' Reflecting his ambivalence, no doubt, Schoener has saddled this wine with the name Midan Al-Tahrir, after Egypt's Liberation Square -- ''such a commercially preposterous name that I might have to give it up,'' he went on to say. A week later, Schoener acknowledged that he didn't really like Midan -- too rich, too encumbered, lacking ''transparency'' -- and was going to discontinue it. In the end, he changed the way he was making the blend and renamed it Gemella.
''Look, I want to make good wine and live a reasonably good life, it's true,'' Schoener told me. ''But my professional aim is to make really good wine.'' Referring to the chardonnay he makes from the tiny vineyard in John Guman's backyard, he added: ''Like the Sylphs, vineyards like that are of an international level -- there's almost nothing of that quality in Napa and throughout the world, really -- and so it's very important to me to make a very small amount of very good wine. And so far, selling that wine has been the easy part.''
The greater challenge -- and the risk that the Scholium Project's customers accept, sometimes with relish -- has been to make magic out of lesser sites, the below-sea-level verdelho and the mangy old-vine sauvignon blanc tract, and in so doing to master the balancing act between the distinctive and the financially practical. For all that Abe Schoener has learned from his past mistakes, his ongoing flirtation with fatal error -- with wines that can perplex or even repel -- is what defines him and his cult appeal.
One morning after visiting his winery, I noticed a few wooden barrels stacked up near the driveway. ''These contain skin-fermented gewürztraminer from 2009,'' Schoener explained. ''I made the decision that we're not walking away from this wine. But I mean, it's really strange wine. It was unpalatable until about a year ago. Then it started showing promise. It's just not good enough yet.''
Schoener then added, ''Maybe it'll never get good enough.'' Still, he laughed as he said it. Strange, unpalatable, not good enough yet -- but interesting, and there was always a place for interesting.

HEADLINE: Suburban Disequilibrium

BYLINE: By BECKY M. NICOLAIDES and ANDREW WIESE. 
Becky M. Nicolaides, a research scholar at the U.C.L.A. Center for the Study of Women, and Andrew Wiese, a professor of history at San Diego State University, are the editors of ''The Suburb Reader.''

 BODY:
A little pocket of Los Angeles County tucked into the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains reflects a crucial facet of suburban life. There's tiny, wealthy Bradbury, a town that prides itself on having one of the richest ZIP codes in Los Angeles, where a house is on the market for $68.8 million. A couple of miles to the east is Azusa. This modest suburb is more than two-thirds Latino, a town of working families whose incomes and home values are a sliver of the wealth nearby.
These towns represent extremes of social inequality, but in Los Angeles and other areas, they reflect a defining pattern of contemporary suburban life. Nationwide, rich and poor neighborhoods like these house a growing proportion of Americans, up to 31 percent compared with 15 percent in 1970, according to a recent study by Sean F. Reardon and Kendra Bischoff. Meanwhile, iconic middle-income suburbs are shrinking in numbers and prospects. 
Today's suburbs provide a map not just to the different worlds of the rich and the poor, which have always been with us, but to the increase in inequality between economic and social classes.
From the historian's perspective, these patterns also reveal another truth about suburban places: their tendency to sustain and reinforce inequality. Bradbury and Azusa have maintained their spots in the top and bottom tiers of the Los Angeles suburbs for decades. The sociologist John Logan described this ''stratifying'' feature long ago, noting that localities held on to social advantages and disadvantages over time. Patterns are established, and successive waves of pressure -- fiscal, political, social -- tend to keep things moving in the same direction.
Some of this is obvious. High property values support high-achieving schools, which in turn increase property values and personal wealth. Racial redlining holds property values down, limiting investment in schools and preventing families from building equity, disadvantages that pass to the next generation like a negative inheritance. The point is not simply that rich and poor people live in different places through a kind of class sorting in the marketplace. The places themselves help to create wealth and poverty. Because of this power of places to fix inequity over time, current patterns are likely to outlive their residents.
Los Angeles embodies these processes in vivid ways, showing how recent trends have amplified uneven landscapes from the past. At the high end, San Marino, Palos Verdes Estates and La Cañada Flintridge have ranked for decades among the county's top municipalities. All are picturesque suburbs, sited in some of the most visually appealing locales in the Southland. Adding to these natural advantages, each is carefully controlled by land-use restrictions that freeze in place their landscapes of high-end homes and freeze out almost everyone else. In San Marino, these buffers are so strong that home prices actually rose during the recession. At the other end, working-class towns like Azusa, San Fernando and Maywood began and remain in a lower tier. These suburbs started modestly with small homes and slender public investments, and they passed these humble trappings down through time.
Globalization helps drive these patterns to new extremes. Money flows into suburbs like San Marino and Palos Verdes, where Asian immigrants buy up expensive properties and generously donate their time and money to the local schools. Money flows out of poorer suburbs like South Gate, Bell and Huntington Park, all heavily Latino, where disposable income is tight and many families export remittances to a home country. New poverty builds upon old impoverishment. Infrastructure is stretched as renters crowd into dwellings that were modest to begin with. The toxic footprint of departed industries is left behind for new residents to contend with.
Many of Los Angeles's middling suburbs have also slipped, especially those ravaged by plant closures since the 1980s. The southern section of blue-collar suburbs was hit especially hard. Here, suburbia transformed from comfortable communities housing unionized workers with well-paying jobs in local factories that gave them access to a middle-class lifestyle to fiscally strained communities housing immigrants working in low-paying, nonunion jobs.
Outer suburbs have fared little better. As home costs skyrocketed in recent decades, families chased ''affordable'' housing to the exurbs. They took on outsize mortgages and monster commutes, and they took with them congested roads, smog and sprawl. Compounding these strains, tax revenues lagged behind the cost of schools, roads, parks and libraries -- the very infrastructure necessary to sustain middle-class life. This edifice came crashing down in the recession. In the Inland Empire, 60 miles east of Los Angeles, one in six homes entered foreclosure between 2006 and 2009. Billboards on the interstate recite a sad litany of child custody law, foreclosure counseling and addiction hot lines -- symbols of the good life turned inside out.
Policies to redress suburban inequality must focus not only on factors like income but also on tax equity across metro areas and regional planning that fairly distributes resources and responsibilities (like affordable housing). We should limit the mortgage-interest deduction for second homes and for values above the regional median. These steps would reduce distortions that inflate housing prices and concentrate wealth in what are already wealthy places.
It is not enough to call for measures that stop suburbanization -- the suburbs aren't going anywhere. If all we do is try to pretend away their radically unequal fortunes, we will just drop a new suburban inequality on top of the old one.

HEADLINE: The Infinity Pool Of Executive Pay

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
RELAX. Sit back. And forget, for a moment, those pesky shareholders and bothersome boards, the regulations, the investigations and all the other headaches of being a chief executive today.
Dodd-Frank rules? Securities and Exchange Commission lawyers? Leave them behind. And let yourself sink into the buttery leather seat of your corporate jet as it soars through the clouds.
That's what Steve Wynn did. As chief executive of Wynn Resorts, he sat back and enjoyed more than a million dollars' worth of personal travel last year on his company's private jet.
It gets better: in December, the company took delivery of the first G650 jet to roll off Gulfstream's assembly line. A $65 million wonder, the plane can whisk Mr. Wynn from Las Vegas, where Wynn Resorts has its headquarters, to New York, where he owns a $70 million penthouse overlooking Central Park, and it should make 2013 another busy year aloft for him. (Wynn Resorts declined to comment.) 
Indeed, while Mr. Wynn may have been a very frequent flier in 2012 among chief executives listed in an annual survey of executive pay conducted for The New York Times by Equilar, an executive compensation data firm, he has plenty of company in the shareholder-unfriendly skies.
As C.E.O. of Hertz, Mark Frissora pushes rental cars, but he racked up nearly a half-million dollars' worth of personal travel on the corporate jet last year.
Marsh & McLennan, the risk management company, doesn't own its own plane -- it prefers holding a fractional share of a jet -- but that didn't stop its chief, Brian Duperreault, from running up $441,875 in private plane travel on the company tab before he retired at year-end.
These highfliers help explain why pay for perks like jet travel and other supplemental benefits including pension contributions and life insurance policies jumped last year, even as overall compensation rose only modestly.
For the 100 highest-paid C.E.O.'s among American companies with revenue of more than $5 billion, the typical 2012 perks package was worth $320,635, up 18.7 percent from 2011, according to an analysis by Equilar for The Times. By contrast, median total pay among the 100 C.E.O.'s rose just 2.8 percent, to more than $14 million.
The data are preliminary -- public companies have 120 days after their fiscal year-end to disclose the pay of top executives in their proxies. Many corporations whose fiscal year ended in December won't file before the end of April.
Still, the data reveal the contours of executive pay packages. Besides the jump in perks, overall cash compensation also made a comeback, rising 19.7 percent, to $5.7 million. Cash bonuses jumped 25 percent.
THE highest-paid C.E.O., Lawrence J. Ellison of Oracle, perennially ranks among the best-paid executives, but other leaders in 2012 didn't come from sectors where you might expect to find them, like technology or Wall Street.
Instead, companies with familiar brand names were among the most generous, with Robert A. Iger of Disney, Mark G. Parker of Nike, Howard Schultz of Starbucks and Kenneth I. Chenault of American Express all in the top 10, each with more than $25 million in total compensation.
The second-highest-paid chief executive on the list, Richard M. Bracken of the hospital chain HCA, received more than half his pay in the form of special compensation worth nearly $22 million, but it was nearly all from from dividends rather than traditional perks like the company plane.
Shareholders, too, enjoyed solid gains in 2012, with the typical company's stock returning 17 percent.
And at a few companies where profits dropped, C.E.O. pay declined as well. At Ford, where earnings per share fell 7 percent, the pay of the chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, sank 29 percent. James P. Gorman, the chief of Morgan Stanley, saw his compensation fall 20 percent as both revenue and profits at the company tumbled in 2012.
J.C. Penney did not make this year's list because it filed its proxy after the March 29 cutoff, but its board definitely sent a message to Ron Johnson, the former Apple executive who took over in late 2011 and has so far failed to turn around this troubled retailer. It cut his total compensation by almost 97 percent, to $1.9 million, and didn't give him and several other top execs any bonus payments.
The most notable decliner in 2012 was the highest-paid C.E.O. in 2011: Tim Cook, the C.E.O. of Apple, was awarded $377.9 million in 2011 -- almost all of it in stock -- but in 2012, he was paid just $4.2 million in cash, too low to make this year's list at all. The drop, however, is more a quirk in how pay is handed out than any judgment about Mr. Cook's tenure. Because the outsize 2011 package vests over the course of a decade but was counted all at once in 2011, sizable new year-to-year awards aren't being made in the meantime, limiting his annual totals.
The money spent on perks accounts for a relatively tiny portion of overall compensation packages, but the increase is striking because it comes even as business leaders have become more sensitive about public perceptions of compensation excesses, corporate governance experts say.
Under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law passed in 2010, companies are now required to ask shareholders for their approval of executive pay packages. These so-called say-on-pay votes are nonbinding, but the ignominy of failing to win approval has received boards' attention.
So in an age when shareholders can now make their collective views known publicly, it can seem downright provocative to let the company pick up the bill for lavish trips, big security entourages (more on that later) and housing subsidies.
''It's dumb with a capital D,'' said Alan Johnson, a consultant who advises boards on how best to structure compensation packages. ''You're rubbing it in the faces of shareholders and employees. It fails the I.Q. test.''
Personal travel on the company plane may be the favorite perk, but a few chief executives managed to gain some other interesting freebies. Mr. Wynn, for example, enjoyed a villa in Las Vegas that cost the company $451,574 for the year.
Greg Brown, chief executive of Motorola Solutions, was honored by his employer with an endowed chair in the neuroscience department of his alma mater, Rutgers University. Mr. Brown didn't receive the money directly: Motorola Solutions donated $1.5 million to the university, where he is a trustee, but the position will be named for him.
In a few cases, top executives other than the corporate C.E.O. also walked away with some swag.
At the HollyFrontier Corporation, which is based in Dallas and is one of the nation's largest oil refiners, membership has its privileges. The company spent $238,907 in 2013 on club initiation fees and monthly membership dues for two top executives, Douglas S. Aron, the chief financial officer, and David L. Lamp, the chief operating officer.
Jeffrey Evenson, a senior vice president hired at Corning in 2011, received $400,000 to help make up for the drop in value on his house in the Boston area when he sold it and moved to upstate New York to take the job.
Roger Ailes, chairman and chief executive of Fox News, billed $155,091 in personal corporate car use to his employer, the News Corporation, even as his boss, Rupert Murdoch, made $361,013 worth of personal trips on the company jet.
Spending on perks and other compensation declined sharply in the recession's wake, according to Equilar, with the median package dropping sharply from 2007 to 2010. But corporate compensation experts say nice extras have a way of coming back whenever the economy shows signs of life and the stock market turns higher. Companies put a bit more money into perks in 2011 -- a median of $270,101 -- and the trend gained steam in 2012.
Even though unemployment remains high by historical standards and the top 1 percent of earners face higher taxes, executives and boards may figure that the popular outrage that followed the financial crisis and the recession has cooled a bit.
''When the economy improves and companies are doing better, the view is that shareholders will look the other way,'' said Charles M. Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.
''I think it's offensive,'' Mr. Elson added. ''The corporate aircraft is for a business purpose; it's a business tool. You don't take the company car to Disneyland with your kids, so why would you use a corporate jet for personal use?''
In many cases, the official answer to that question is security, according to the proxies and other filings that companies provide shareholders and regulators. Chief executives in many instances, including that of Mr. Frissora at Hertz and Mr. Murdoch at the News Corporation, are actually required to take private transportation, even on personal holidays, because companies argue that it is prudent for their safety.
Another justification is that the private jet helps C.E.O.'s make the most of their valuable time.
Mr. Elson doesn't buy either argument about personal use of a jet.
''I find the security argument tough to swallow,'' he said. ''Airports are among the safest places on earth these days.'' In any case, he said, ''you're paid so much money you can charter a plane if necessary.''
Private jets, club dues and housing subsidies get under the skin of the ordinary shareholder, says David F. Larcker, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and an expert on corporate governance. There is something about the specific details of life at the top, he says, that leads to both envy and outrage.
But in some cases, he noted, the perks are a sign of a deeper problem.
''It's usually a small bit of money, but it provides an insight into what's going on,'' Mr. Larcker said. ''If this is out of whack, it makes you wonder about the desirability of other parts of the pay package.''
WHICH brings us to the case of Mr. Ellison, Oracle's chief. His pay packages have earned him a place among the top three highest-paid C.E.O.'s for six years in a row. But in some ways, 2012 was special for him.
For a start, while fewer than half his shareholders approved his pay package in the annual say-on-pay vote, he managed to earn more than $96 million for the year.
Nearly all of that was in stock, but that's significantly more than twice as much as the next-highest-paid C.E.O. in this year's survey and nearly $20 million more than what he earned in 2011.
And the raise came despite a 22 percent drop in Oracle's stock in fiscal 2012.
Given all that, did Mr. Ellison really need the company to spend more than $1.5 million on his security retinue? He pays out of pocket for the installation and maintenance of home security systems; Oracle covers the cost of the security personnel.
''He doesn't care what shareholders think,'' said Mr. Johnson, the compensation consultant. ''He's one of the richest guys in the world, and he has the company pay for his bodyguards. I don't think he's going to change.''
Oracle declined to comment.
Shareholders may be displeased, but Mr. Ellison has much to console himself with. He owns nearly a quarter of Oracle, the software giant he founded, giving him a net worth of more than $40 billion, and Oracle's shares have been doing better recently. Plus, he can always fly off to Lanai, the Hawaiian island he acquired last year. (Mr. Ellison, to his credit, doesn't bill the company for personal jet travel.)
Don't expect executives to give up their prized perks anytime soon, says Mr. Elson, the University of Delaware expert on corporate governance, even if shareholders can now publicly register their displeasure.
''If I ask for it and you give it to me, then why not ask?,'' he said. ''They love it. Who wouldn't?''

HEADLINE: Tax Lobby Builds Ties to Chairman Of Finance Panel

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON; Kitty Bennett contributed research.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Restaurant chains like McDonald's want to keep their lucrative tax credit for hiring veterans. Altria, the tobacco giant, wants to cut the corporate tax rate. And Sapphire Energy, a small alternative energy company, is determined to protect a tax incentive it believes could turn algae into a popular motor fuel.
To make their case as Congress prepares to debate a rewrite of the nation's tax code, this diverse set of businesses has at least one strategy in common: they have retained firms that employ lobbyists who are former aides to Max Baucus, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which will have a crucial role in shaping any legislation.
No other lawmaker on Capitol Hill has such a sizable constellation of former aides working as tax lobbyists, representing blue-chip clients that include telecommunications businesses, oil companies, retailers and financial firms, according to an analysis by LegiStorm, an online database that tracks Congressional staff members and lobbying. At least 28 aides who have worked for Mr. Baucus, Democrat of Montana, since he became the committee chairman in 2001 have lobbied on tax issues during the Obama administration -- more than any other current member of Congress, according to the analysis of lobbying filings performed for The New York Times. 
''K Street is literally littered with former Baucus staffers,'' said Jade West, an executive at a wholesalers' trade association that relies on a former finance panel aide, Mary Burke Baker. ''It opens doors that allow you to make the case.''
Like Ms. Baker, many of those lobbyists have already saved their clients millions -- in some cases, billions -- of dollars after Mr. Baucus backed their requests to extend certain corporate tax perks, provisions that were adopted as part of the so-called fiscal cliff legislation in January. Baucus aides who later became lobbyists helped financial firms save $11.2 billion in tax deferments and helped secure a $222 million tax benefit that is shared with the liquor industry.
Sean Neary, a spokesman for Mr. Baucus, said the senator had regularly rejected requests from those lobbyists for provisions benefiting their clients, like an appeal from one former aide, Pat Bousliman, now working as a wind industry lobbyist, to extend an alternative grant in lieu of tax credit program that expired in 2011.
Mr. Baucus's decisions are based on the merits of the policies, Mr. Neary said, not on who is advocating for them. ''The fact is, oftentimes good policy can indirectly benefit someone,'' he said. ''That doesn't mean it shouldn't be done.''
The debate over the tax code -- which has emerged as part of the two-year effort to stimulate the economy and reduce the deficit -- could turn into a battle royal. While many members of Congress talk about lowering the corporate tax rate, replacing that lost revenue would require eliminating many tax loopholes that legions of lobbyists, including many who had worked for other prominent lawmakers, make a living laboring to expand or defend.
Mr. Baucus, 71, the son of a wealthy Montana rancher, is somewhat of a wild card in the tax debate: he is the top Democrat in what arguably is the Senate's most powerful committee seat. The finance panel helps dictate how the government raises almost all of its money, and spends nearly half of it.
But he often bucks his party's leadership. Last month, for example, he voted against the Democrats' budget proposal for 2014, which included nearly $1 trillion in new revenues. He also favored the Bush administration's tax cuts in 2001 for Americans including the wealthy, putting him at odds with many Democrats.
Mr. Baucus, who has spent nearly his entire professional career in Congress, declined a request for an interview. But Mr. Neary said that every action the senator takes is motivated by his commitment to voters.
''Every vote has to answer one question for him and that is: How is it impacting Montanans?'' Mr. Neary said.
Several veteran Capitol Hill aides said it was naïve to suggest that former aides could extract special favors from their one-time bosses -- unless what they were pushing for had broad support. But the former aides still bring an advantage to the corporations that hire them.
''It does mean you will have someone who knows how the levers of power are pushed or how to push the levers, and who can describe to you how situations are going to play out based on their years of experience,'' said Jim Manley, a former aide to Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader. Mr. Manley now works at a Washington lobbying and communications firm, QGA Public Affairs.
In recent interviews, four former aides to Mr. Baucus said that their ties to him heightened their appeal to potential clients. The link also helped justify their salaries, in some cases $500,000 or higher, more than double or triple their Capitol Hill paychecks.
Former Senate aides who become lobbyists must wait a year before they can contact Mr. Baucus or his staff on behalf of a client, according to Senate ethics rules.
Staying active in their circle, one former aide said, also requires that they help Mr. Baucus's political career, through fund-raising and other assistance.
Several of the lobbyists regularly fly to Big Sky, Mont., for weekend fund-raising retreats that Mr. Baucus hosts, or attend more intimate events in Washington like a gathering last month near the Capitol, where Paul Wilkins, Mr. Baucus's chief of staff, talked about the millions of dollars Mr. Baucus will need to raise for his re-election campaign next year.
Among them, the top givers include Jeffrey A. Forbes, Mr. Baucus's former Finance Committee staff director, who has donated a total of at least $25,000 to Mr. Baucus, his political action committee or the Montana Democratic Party. He attended the retreat in February at the Big Sky resort, which included skiing, snowmobiling and a big family dinner at Buck's T-4 Lodge. The totals grow much bigger -- to hundreds of thousands of dollars -- when donations from Mr. Forbes's clients, including Verizon and Altria, and other partners at his lobbying firm, are counted.
Mr. Wilkins said that the donations and fund-raising had been vital, noting that the nearly $4.6 million expected in hand by the end of this month would rank Mr. Baucus's campaign chest among the top 10 in the Senate.
''It allows us to scare off opponents,'' Mr. Wilkins told the group, which included former Baucus aides turned lobbyists, at a Capitol Hill townhouse owned by Federal Express. ''It is the basis of everything that we do. So thank you for your support and everything you have done for Senator Baucus.'' A New York Times reporter in attendance was asked to leave the private event.
Asked later about his comments, Mr. Wilkins said, ''There is no expectation that former staffers do anything related to the office. They are private individuals, if they want to donate fine. If they don't want to donate, that is fine, too.''
Mr. Baucus's office points out that the former aides who now work as tax lobbyists are a small fraction of those whose who have worked for him over the years. Still, several colleagues who have served more than two decades on the finance panel -- including Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, and Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, both as ranking Republican or chairman -- have much smaller networks of former aides who are tax lobbyists, according to the data collected by LegiStorm and the Center for Responsive Politics.
Republicans, though, imposed term limits on committee leadership posts more than a decade ago to help deter the creation of a so-called iron triangle among the chairman, federal officials and corporate lobbyists.
Mr. Baucus is viewed as an important ally when it comes to including corporate tax priorities into legislation. Last year, he introduced a plan -- most of which was eventually passed into law as part of the fiscal cliff deal in January -- that contained more than a dozen tax breaks, some of them pushed by clients who had retained Washington lobbying firms that employ his former aides or political advisers.Shannon Finley, who served as a political consultant and fund-raiser for Mr. Baucus before joining a lobbying firm in Washington, was hired in late 2011 by Beam, the liquor industry giant, to protect a federal tax break that it gets a cut of for producing its Cruzan rum in the United States Virgin Islands. Despite protests from fiscal conservatives that it was a giveaway, the provision was included in Mr. Baucus's package, costing $222 million over the coming decade. Ms. Finley declined to comment.
The National Restaurant Association, whose board includes a senior McDonald's executive, had three former aides to Mr. Baucus working on tax-related matters, including Patrick Heck, who once held the post of chief tax counsel to Mr. Baucus. The association helped secure three provisions in the January deal, worth an estimated $5.9 billion over the next decade to restaurants and other companies. Elizabeth Garner, a Restaurant Association lobbyist, said Mr. Heck had expertise and relationships that proved helpful in their push.
With a debate on rewriting the tax code to streamline and simplify it expected to start this year -- leaders in both the House and the Senate are working on their own drafts -- lobbying could reach levels like that of the 2009 debate over health care, which also was overseen in part by the Senate Finance Committee, with Mr. Baucus at the gavel. His staff is already hosting meetings with industry lobbyists, academics and outside parties to get advice on the tax package that the Senate Finance Committee is trying to create.
Mr. Baucus's former aides will almost certainly be pushing competing plans. Some large corporations with relatively high corporate tax rates, like Verizon and Altria, have retained Mr. Forbes to help push for the overall cut in the tax rate, while others, like General Electric, which pays a relatively low rate, have a team of lobbyists including Ms. Finley to try to protect their various federal tax advantages.
Mr. Baucus's office said the senator's actions on the tax rewriting effort would be based on the bipartisan consensus that he was trying to build among the committee's members, not any special favors that individual industries wanted, even if they were represented by his former aides.
Bob Packwood, the former Republican senator from Oregon who was the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee in 1986 -- the last time Congress passed broad legislation rewriting the tax code -- said in an interview that former aides tended to have access to lawmakers, though he questioned how much influence they really had.
But one thing is certain: they will try.
''The lobbying will be tremendous,'' he said. ''As it was last time.''

Several veteran Capitol Hill aides said it was naïve to suggest that former aides could extract special favors from their one-time bosses -- unless what they were pushing for had broad support. But the former aides still bring an advantage to the corporations that hire them.
''It does mean you will have someone who knows how the levers of power are pushed or how to push the levers, and who can describe to you how situations are going to play out based on their years of experience,'' said Jim Manley, a former aide to Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader. Mr. Manley now works at a Washington lobbying and communications firm, QGA Public Affairs.
In recent interviews, four former aides to Mr. Baucus said that their ties to him heightened their appeal to potential clients. The link also helped justify their salaries, in some cases $500,000 or higher, more than double or triple their Capitol Hill paychecks.
Former Senate aides who become lobbyists must wait a year before they can contact Mr. Baucus or his staff on behalf of a client, according to Senate ethics rules.
Staying active in their circle, one former aide said, also requires that they help Mr. Baucus's political career, through fund-raising and other assistance.
Several of the lobbyists regularly fly to Big Sky, Mont., for weekend fund-raising retreats that Mr. Baucus hosts, or attend more intimate events in Washington like a gathering last month near the Capitol, where Paul Wilkins, Mr. Baucus's chief of staff, talked about the millions of dollars Mr. Baucus will need to raise for his re-election campaign next year.
Among them, the top givers include Jeffrey A. Forbes, Mr. Baucus's former Finance Committee staff director, who has donated a total of at least $25,000 to Mr. Baucus, his political action committee or the Montana Democratic Party. He attended the retreat in February at the Big Sky resort, which included skiing, snowmobiling and a big family dinner at Buck's T-4 Lodge. The totals grow much bigger -- to hundreds of thousands of dollars -- when donations from Mr. Forbes's clients, including Verizon and Altria, and other partners at his lobbying firm, are counted.
Mr. Wilkins said that the donations and fund-raising had been vital, noting that the nearly $4.6 million expected in hand by the end of this month would rank Mr. Baucus's campaign chest among the top 10 in the Senate.
''It allows us to scare off opponents,'' Mr. Wilkins told the group, which included former Baucus aides turned lobbyists, at a Capitol Hill townhouse owned by Federal Express. ''It is the basis of everything that we do. So thank you for your support and everything you have done for Senator Baucus.'' A New York Times reporter in attendance was asked to leave the private event.
Asked later about his comments, Mr. Wilkins said, ''There is no expectation that former staffers do anything related to the office. They are private individuals, if they want to donate fine. If they don't want to donate, that is fine, too.''
Mr. Baucus's office points out that the former aides who now work as tax lobbyists are a small fraction of those whose who have worked for him over the years. Still, several colleagues who have served more than two decades on the finance panel -- including Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, and Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, both as ranking Republican or chairman -- have much smaller networks of former aides who are tax lobbyists, according to the data collected by LegiStorm and the Center for Responsive Politics.
Republicans, though, imposed term limits on committee leadership posts more than a decade ago to help deter the creation of a so-called iron triangle among the chairman, federal officials and corporate lobbyists.
Mr. Baucus is viewed as an important ally when it comes to including corporate tax priorities into legislation. Last year, he introduced a plan -- most of which was eventually passed into law as part of the fiscal cliff deal in January -- that contained more than a dozen tax breaks, some of them pushed by clients who had retained Washington lobbying firms that employ his former aides or political advisers.Shannon Finley, who served as a political consultant and fund-raiser for Mr. Baucus before joining a lobbying firm in Washington, was hired in late 2011 by Beam, the liquor industry giant, to protect a federal tax break that it gets a cut of for producing its Cruzan rum in the United States Virgin Islands. Despite protests from fiscal conservatives that it was a giveaway, the provision was included in Mr. Baucus's package, costing $222 million over the coming decade. Ms. Finley declined to comment.
The National Restaurant Association, whose board includes a senior McDonald's executive, had three former aides to Mr. Baucus working on tax-related matters, including Patrick Heck, who once held the post of chief tax counsel to Mr. Baucus. The association helped secure three provisions in the January deal, worth an estimated $5.9 billion over the next decade to restaurants and other companies. Elizabeth Garner, a Restaurant Association lobbyist, said Mr. Heck had expertise and relationships that proved helpful in their push.
With a debate on rewriting the tax code to streamline and simplify it expected to start this year -- leaders in both the House and the Senate are working on their own drafts -- lobbying could reach levels like that of the 2009 debate over health care, which also was overseen in part by the Senate Finance Committee, with Mr. Baucus at the gavel. His staff is already hosting meetings with industry lobbyists, academics and outside parties to get advice on the tax package that the Senate Finance Committee is trying to create.
Mr. Baucus's former aides will almost certainly be pushing competing plans. Some large corporations with relatively high corporate tax rates, like Verizon and Altria, have retained Mr. Forbes to help push for the overall cut in the tax rate, while others, like General Electric, which pays a relatively low rate, have a team of lobbyists including Ms. Finley to try to protect their various federal tax advantages.
Mr. Baucus's office said the senator's actions on the tax rewriting effort would be based on the bipartisan consensus that he was trying to build among the committee's members, not any special favors that individual industries wanted, even if they were represented by his former aides.
Bob Packwood, the former Republican senator from Oregon who was the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee in 1986 -- the last time Congress passed broad legislation rewriting the tax code -- said in an interview that former aides tended to have access to lawmakers, though he questioned how much influence they really had.
But one thing is certain: they will try.
''The lobbying will be tremendous,'' he said. ''As it was last time.''

HEADLINE: The Infinity Pool Of Executive Pay

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
RELAX. Sit back. And forget, for a moment, those pesky shareholders and bothersome boards, the regulations, the investigations and all the other headaches of being a chief executive today.
Dodd-Frank rules? Securities and Exchange Commission lawyers? Leave them behind. And let yourself sink into the buttery leather seat of your corporate jet as it soars through the clouds.
That's what Steve Wynn did. As chief executive of Wynn Resorts, he sat back and enjoyed more than a million dollars' worth of personal travel last year on his company's private jet.
It gets better: in December, the company took delivery of the first G650 jet to roll off Gulfstream's assembly line. A $65 million wonder, the plane can whisk Mr. Wynn from Las Vegas, where Wynn Resorts has its headquarters, to New York, where he owns a $70 million penthouse overlooking Central Park, and it should make 2013 another busy year aloft for him. (Wynn Resorts declined to comment.) 
Indeed, while Mr. Wynn may have been a very frequent flier in 2012 among chief executives listed in an annual survey of executive pay conducted for The New York Times by Equilar, an executive compensation data firm, he has plenty of company in the shareholder-unfriendly skies.
As C.E.O. of Hertz, Mark Frissora pushes rental cars, but he racked up nearly a half-million dollars' worth of personal travel on the corporate jet last year.
Marsh & McLennan, the risk management company, doesn't own its own plane -- it prefers holding a fractional share of a jet -- but that didn't stop its chief, Brian Duperreault, from running up $441,875 in private plane travel on the company tab before he retired at year-end.
These highfliers help explain why pay for perks like jet travel and other supplemental benefits including pension contributions and life insurance policies jumped last year, even as overall compensation rose only modestly.
For the 100 highest-paid C.E.O.'s among American companies with revenue of more than $5 billion, the typical 2012 perks package was worth $320,635, up 18.7 percent from 2011, according to an analysis by Equilar for The Times. By contrast, median total pay among the 100 C.E.O.'s rose just 2.8 percent, to more than $14 million.
The data are preliminary -- public companies have 120 days after their fiscal year-end to disclose the pay of top executives in their proxies. Many corporations whose fiscal year ended in December won't file before the end of April.
Still, the data reveal the contours of executive pay packages. Besides the jump in perks, overall cash compensation also made a comeback, rising 19.7 percent, to $5.7 million. Cash bonuses jumped 25 percent.
THE highest-paid C.E.O., Lawrence J. Ellison of Oracle, perennially ranks among the best-paid executives, but other leaders in 2012 didn't come from sectors where you might expect to find them, like technology or Wall Street.
Instead, companies with familiar brand names were among the most generous, with Robert A. Iger of Disney, Mark G. Parker of Nike, Howard Schultz of Starbucks and Kenneth I. Chenault of American Express all in the top 10, each with more than $25 million in total compensation.
The second-highest-paid chief executive on the list, Richard M. Bracken of the hospital chain HCA, received more than half his pay in the form of special compensation worth nearly $22 million, but it was nearly all from from dividends rather than traditional perks like the company plane.
Shareholders, too, enjoyed solid gains in 2012, with the typical company's stock returning 17 percent.
And at a few companies where profits dropped, C.E.O. pay declined as well. At Ford, where earnings per share fell 7 percent, the pay of the chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, sank 29 percent. James P. Gorman, the chief of Morgan Stanley, saw his compensation fall 20 percent as both revenue and profits at the company tumbled in 2012.
J.C. Penney did not make this year's list because it filed its proxy after the March 29 cutoff, but its board definitely sent a message to Ron Johnson, the former Apple executive who took over in late 2011 and has so far failed to turn around this troubled retailer. It cut his total compensation by almost 97 percent, to $1.9 million, and didn't give him and several other top execs any bonus payments.
The most notable decliner in 2012 was the highest-paid C.E.O. in 2011: Tim Cook, the C.E.O. of Apple, was awarded $377.9 million in 2011 -- almost all of it in stock -- but in 2012, he was paid just $4.2 million in cash, too low to make this year's list at all. The drop, however, is more a quirk in how pay is handed out than any judgment about Mr. Cook's tenure. Because the outsize 2011 package vests over the course of a decade but was counted all at once in 2011, sizable new year-to-year awards aren't being made in the meantime, limiting his annual totals.
The money spent on perks accounts for a relatively tiny portion of overall compensation packages, but the increase is striking because it comes even as business leaders have become more sensitive about public perceptions of compensation excesses, corporate governance experts say.
Under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law passed in 2010, companies are now required to ask shareholders for their approval of executive pay packages. These so-called say-on-pay votes are nonbinding, but the ignominy of failing to win approval has received boards' attention.
So in an age when shareholders can now make their collective views known publicly, it can seem downright provocative to let the company pick up the bill for lavish trips, big security entourages (more on that later) and housing subsidies.
''It's dumb with a capital D,'' said Alan Johnson, a consultant who advises boards on how best to structure compensation packages. ''You're rubbing it in the faces of shareholders and employees. It fails the I.Q. test.''
Personal travel on the company plane may be the favorite perk, but a few chief executives managed to gain some other interesting freebies. Mr. Wynn, for example, enjoyed a villa in Las Vegas that cost the company $451,574 for the year.
Greg Brown, chief executive of Motorola Solutions, was honored by his employer with an endowed chair in the neuroscience department of his alma mater, Rutgers University. Mr. Brown didn't receive the money directly: Motorola Solutions donated $1.5 million to the university, where he is a trustee, but the position will be named for him.
In a few cases, top executives other than the corporate C.E.O. also walked away with some swag.
At the HollyFrontier Corporation, which is based in Dallas and is one of the nation's largest oil refiners, membership has its privileges. The company spent $238,907 in 2013 on club initiation fees and monthly membership dues for two top executives, Douglas S. Aron, the chief financial officer, and David L. Lamp, the chief operating officer.
Jeffrey Evenson, a senior vice president hired at Corning in 2011, received $400,000 to help make up for the drop in value on his house in the Boston area when he sold it and moved to upstate New York to take the job.
Roger Ailes, chairman and chief executive of Fox News, billed $155,091 in personal corporate car use to his employer, the News Corporation, even as his boss, Rupert Murdoch, made $361,013 worth of personal trips on the company jet.
Spending on perks and other compensation declined sharply in the recession's wake, according to Equilar, with the median package dropping sharply from 2007 to 2010. But corporate compensation experts say nice extras have a way of coming back whenever the economy shows signs of life and the stock market turns higher. Companies put a bit more money into perks in 2011 -- a median of $270,101 -- and the trend gained steam in 2012.
Even though unemployment remains high by historical standards and the top 1 percent of earners face higher taxes, executives and boards may figure that the popular outrage that followed the financial crisis and the recession has cooled a bit.
''When the economy improves and companies are doing better, the view is that shareholders will look the other way,'' said Charles M. Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.
''I think it's offensive,'' Mr. Elson added. ''The corporate aircraft is for a business purpose; it's a business tool. You don't take the company car to Disneyland with your kids, so why would you use a corporate jet for personal use?''
In many cases, the official answer to that question is security, according to the proxies and other filings that companies provide shareholders and regulators. Chief executives in many instances, including that of Mr. Frissora at Hertz and Mr. Murdoch at the News Corporation, are actually required to take private transportation, even on personal holidays, because companies argue that it is prudent for their safety.
Another justification is that the private jet helps C.E.O.'s make the most of their valuable time.
Mr. Elson doesn't buy either argument about personal use of a jet.
''I find the security argument tough to swallow,'' he said. ''Airports are among the safest places on earth these days.'' In any case, he said, ''you're paid so much money you can charter a plane if necessary.''
Private jets, club dues and housing subsidies get under the skin of the ordinary shareholder, says David F. Larcker, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and an expert on corporate governance. There is something about the specific details of life at the top, he says, that leads to both envy and outrage.
But in some cases, he noted, the perks are a sign of a deeper problem.
''It's usually a small bit of money, but it provides an insight into what's going on,'' Mr. Larcker said. ''If this is out of whack, it makes you wonder about the desirability of other parts of the pay package.''
WHICH brings us to the case of Mr. Ellison, Oracle's chief. His pay packages have earned him a place among the top three highest-paid C.E.O.'s for six years in a row. But in some ways, 2012 was special for him.
For a start, while fewer than half his shareholders approved his pay package in the annual say-on-pay vote, he managed to earn more than $96 million for the year.
Nearly all of that was in stock, but that's significantly more than twice as much as the next-highest-paid C.E.O. in this year's survey and nearly $20 million more than what he earned in 2011.
And the raise came despite a 22 percent drop in Oracle's stock in fiscal 2012.
Given all that, did Mr. Ellison really need the company to spend more than $1.5 million on his security retinue? He pays out of pocket for the installation and maintenance of home security systems; Oracle covers the cost of the security personnel.
''He doesn't care what shareholders think,'' said Mr. Johnson, the compensation consultant. ''He's one of the richest guys in the world, and he has the company pay for his bodyguards. I don't think he's going to change.''
Oracle declined to comment.
Shareholders may be displeased, but Mr. Ellison has much to console himself with. He owns nearly a quarter of Oracle, the software giant he founded, giving him a net worth of more than $40 billion, and Oracle's shares have been doing better recently. Plus, he can always fly off to Lanai, the Hawaiian island he acquired last year. (Mr. Ellison, to his credit, doesn't bill the company for personal jet travel.)
Don't expect executives to give up their prized perks anytime soon, says Mr. Elson, the University of Delaware expert on corporate governance, even if shareholders can now publicly register their displeasure.
''If I ask for it and you give it to me, then why not ask?,'' he said. ''They love it. Who wouldn't?''

HEADLINE: Europe's Markets, No Longer in Lock Step

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine.

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH the overall European economy is stuck in neutral at best, the region's stock market may have turned a corner in the first quarter.
Money managers point to signs like these: Investors barely flinched during the banking crisis last month in Cyprus, an indication that the Continent may be moving past its manic phase. The Vstoxx index, a measure of stock market volatility in the euro zone, is about half of what it was in the fall of 2011, when the region's debt crisis spread to Greece and Italy. And Europe has actually been the best-performing major overseas market since the start of 2012, with equities surging nearly 19 percent.
''The markets get that it's not 2011 anymore,'' said Edward A. Gray, a co-manager of the Delaware International Value Equity fund. 
But impressive as that change has been, the hard part may be coming now.
That's because, until recently, the European market has followed a fairly simple, predictable pattern. When investors sensed that the fiscal crisis there was worsening, as in the late summer of 2011, European stocks sold off in lock step. Conversely, investors raced back into the region's equities anytime there was better-than-expected economic news -- like that of the second Greek bailout, in the first quarter of 2012.
Now that European stocks appear to be past these extreme swings, investors are ''much more fundamentally focused and discriminating,'' said Harry W. Hartford, president of Causeway Capital Management. That means European stocks ''are not a homogeneous entity anymore,'' he added.
Consider the performance of European stocks in the first quarter. While stock funds that invest broadly in the region returned 2.6 percent, on average, the stock markets of individual countries were all over the map. Greece, for instance, finished the quarter up more than 14 percent and Switzerland gained more than 10 percent. Germany, meanwhile, was flat, while Spain sank 6 percent and Italy fell nearly 10 percent.
Future success in Europe will require investors to distinguish not only among markets, but among sectors and individual stocks as well, money managers say. But it is becoming harder to find decent values among European stocks, said Kimball Brooker Jr., a co-manager of the First Eagle Overseas fund.
Broadly speaking, European equities still trade at lower valuations than domestic or Japanese shares. Yet the broad market's price-to-earnings ratios don't necessarily paint an accurate picture of the investment landscape, Mr. Brooker said.
For instance, a few years ago, it was fairly easy to find shares of high-quality multinational companies in the region that were trading at discounted prices relative to their American counterparts, simply because they were based in Europe. Today, those types of industry-leading companies -- those with pristine balance sheets that generate a large portion of their sales in faster-growing areas like emerging markets -- are becoming expensive.
These are companies like L'Oréal, the beauty products giant based outside Paris, and Diageo, the spirits maker based in London, said Charles de Vaulx, chief investment officer at International Value Advisers. Both stocks are trading at P/E ratios well above 20.
''These stocks are very pricey, but deservedly so,'' he said, owing to their strong finances and geographic reach. But that leaves fewer apparent opportunities for value-minded investors looking to put new money to work.
''To find generally cheap stocks in Europe, you have to look for cyclical businesses that require you to believe that we're on the verge of a major economic recovery,'' Mr. de Vaulx said. ''Unfortunately, we worry that European economies are decelerating.''
THIS explains why only about 57 percent of the assets in the IVA Worldwide fund, for which Mr. de Vaulx is a co-manager, are currently in equities. That's down from 71 percent a year ago. Furthermore, only about 15 percent of the total portfolio is in European equities, with double that stake held in the United States.
European stocks are facing increasing competition for global investment dollars now that Japan's stock market is finally rebounding, said Mark D. Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.
Japanese stock funds, in fact, soared 15 percent in the first quarter, more than their gains in all of 2012. And over the past six months, the MSCI Japan stock index has climbed by nearly 42 percent.
For European equities to continue to rally in the face of such stiff competition, from both Japan and the United States, ''it's going to require some kind of positive catalyst,'' Mr. Luschini said.
In the short run, he said, he does not know whether any economic indicators will provide such a lift.
But over a five-year horizon, he says he thinks European markets could still turn out to be among the more attractive foreign destinations, especially if European companies can keep increasing their profitability while the economy slowly heals.

HEADLINE: Getting Serious About a Texas-Size Drought

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH. 
A reporter on energy and environment for The Texas Tribune.

 BODY:
AUSTIN, Tex.
SOMETHING odd happened here last week.
It rained.
But the relief, an answer to desperate prayers, is likely to be short-lived. The drought that has gripped much of Texas since the fall of 2010 shows few signs of abating soon. The latest forecasts say that parched West and South Texas will remain dry, and that the state is likely to see above-average temperatures this spring, increasing evaporation from already strained reservoirs. The conditions could lead to severe water restrictions in some parts of the state.
The implications have finally sunk in among lawmakers and business leaders here, who like to boast about the economic appeal of Texas's low taxes and relaxed regulatory environment: no water equals no business. In a state fabled for its everything-is-bigger mentality, the idea of conserving resources is beginning to take hold. They are even turning sewage into drinking water. 
The overwhelmingly conservative and tightfisted Texas House of Representatives recently voted to create a fund to finance water development and conservation projects and is considering allocating $2 billion to jump-start it. The State Senate is weighing a similar measure. The state's water plan, released last year, recommends spending $57 billion (in 2013 dollars) over the next half-century to ensure there is enough water to go around; Texas's population of 26 million is expected to grow by 80 percent by 2060.
Texas is also suing neighboring states to get more water. The United States Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments in two weeks in one of these cases, in which the authority that supplies water to Fort Worth and fast-growing surrounding communities is demanding more water from Oklahoma. Texas has accused New Mexico of siphoning off more than its share of water from the Rio Grande. The state is likewise arguing that under an international agreement, it is entitled to more water from Mexico, which has also been stricken by drought.
Other desperately dry states in the Midwest and West are facing similar challenges. Drought has hurt farmers in New Mexico and reduced California's crucial mountain snowpack. Even the Great Lakes are at worryingly low levels. Drought conditions in the western half of the country are likely to persist at least through June, federal forecasters have warned. Over time, as the effects of climate change become more pronounced, hotter weather and longer dry spells will continue to threaten water supplies that are essential for development.
Already the drought has led to consideration of wild, expensive ideas, like piping water hundreds of miles from the Missouri River to the parched Colorado River basin. Water traditionally has been mostly a state or local issue because communities draw supplies from nearby rivers or aquifers. But increasingly it is becoming a national one. Economies will rise and fall on the availability of water, whose price is inexorably marching upward. Litigation and rural-urban water conflicts are likely to intensify throughout the West and Midwest.
''Texas does not and will not have enough water'' in a bad drought, the state's water plan warned last year. More than two dozen communities could run out of water in 180 days, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Looking ahead, the already-dry western half of the state is expected to be hit particularly hard by climate change. State leaders generally accept such projections, even as they question the scientific consensus that humans are a major cause of climate change.
Officials from Gov. Rick Perry on down are focused on expanding water supplies. Doing nothing could create ''a reputation that Texas is not a business-friendly state,'' State Representative Lyle Larson, a Republican, warned fellow lawmakers last month. Bill Hammond, president of the Texas Association of Business, agrees. ''Clearly, not having an adequate water supply will harm us in terms of bringing jobs to Texas and is doing so now, already,'' he said recently.
Cargill, the giant food producer, idled a beef-processing plant in Plainview in the Texas Panhandle earlier this year after ranchers thinned their herds because of dry pastures and soaring hay prices. Some 2,000 people lost their jobs in the town of 22,000. Power plants and other industrial operations that depend on water are also worried. One community close to Austin nearly ran out of water last year and had to truck in supplies. That's a public relations disaster for a state that brags that it does things better than other places.
In a promising twist, a cultural shift seems to be under way. Conserving water is now seen as a priority in a state that dislikes conserving just about anything else.
Midland, an arid West Texas town at the epicenter of the current oil boom, had never imposed watering restrictions until a few years ago. Residents liked coming home to green lawns after a day in the dusty oil fields. Watering rules smacked of big government.
Then drought caused reservoir levels to drop alarmingly. Midland imposed sharp restrictions on outdoor watering and hiked rates, albeit temporarily, on water hogs. Other innovations are on the way: a project to turn sewage into potable water will soon bolster Midland's drinking supplies, a concept that has drawn interest from around the state and nation.
Wes Perry, an oilman who doubles as Midland's mayor, put it this way recently: as valuable as oil and gas are, he said, ''we are worthless without water.''

HEADLINE: Mariam Chamberlain, Women's Champion, Dies at 94

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

 BODY:
Mariam Chamberlain, who played a pivotal yet little-known role in establishing women's studies in the American college curriculum, and financing early research about the inequities women faced in the workplace and other realms of society, died Tuesday in Manhattan. She was 94.
Her death was confirmed by the National Council for Research on Women, a nonprofit organization of university-based research centers that she founded in 1981 and served for many years as president. 
Though she rarely gave speeches, and considered herself more of a researcher than an activist -- she had a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard -- Dr. Chamberlain came to be known in the women's movement as ''the fairy godmother of women's studies.''
She earned the sobriquet as a program director for the Ford Foundation from 1971 to 1981, granting about $5 million in seed money to a few dozen groundbreaking academic studies, sociological projects and statistical surveys that laid the groundwork for women's studies departments and public policy research programs across the country.
Dr. Chamberlain's contribution to the women's movement was incalculable, said Heidi Hartmann, the president of the Institute for Women's Policy Research, a Washington group specializing in public policy issues. ''It's hard to imagine how bad things were when she came on the scene,'' she said. ''Women's suffrage was not taught in most American history classes.'' Female writers were footnotes to the literary canon as taught in most colleges, she added.
''She made a huge impact with small but strategic grants,'' Ms. Hartmann said.
In 1975, Dr. Chamberlain approved a grant for a Princeton University study, for example, that analyzed introductory courses in English, history, sociology and psychology at 172 American colleges. The study found that women's history and literature were virtually being ignored. It warned that unless changes were made ''most undergraduate men and many undergraduate women would continue to leave college without considering the role of women in history, the implications of sex discrimination in the labor market, or the influence of sex stereotyping on their daily lives.''
The Center for Women Policy Studies in Washington, founded in 1972 with another of her grants, was among the first to study domestic violence, pay inequities, and discrimination against women in loan policies.
The Ford Foundation, which Dr. Chamberlain joined in 1956, had a policy of encouraging changes in American college curriculums to keep pace with changes in the culture. In the 1950s, it encouraged expanding international studies programs; in the 1960s, it provided seed money for black studies research.
In 1967, when Dr. Chamberlain was named director of the foundation's higher education program, she began looking for ways to address what she called -- ever-temperate in her language -- ''the limits that society places on the aspirations of women.''
Florence Howe, the founder of the Feminist Press, which received one of the foundation's first women's studies grants, said that Dr. Chamberlain's background as an economist defined her approach to philanthropy.
''She always wanted numbers,'' she said. ''She would say, 'give me the numbers' to back up the case for funding feminist studies.'' Ms. Howe received a $12,000 grant in 1971 to find out whether and where women's studies was already being taught in colleges and universities.
The report, ''Who's Who and Where in Women's Studies,'' found a few hundred courses already being taught. By 1976, a follow-up survey counted thousands of courses, and 270 degree-granting programs in women's studies. In 1977, Dr. Chamberlain arranged a small grant to help establish the National Women's Studies Association, which helped organize international conferences that have since taken women's studies to more than 100 countries.
Mariam Kenosian was born on April 24, 1918, in Chelsea, Mass., one of three children of Avak and Zabel Kenosian, immigrants from Armenia. Despite the initial objections of her father, a shoe factory worker who did not believe in women's education, she completed high school and attended Radcliffe College on a full scholarship.
Her studies toward a Ph.D. in economics at Harvard were interrupted during World War II, when she worked as an analyst for the Office of Strategic Services. She received her Ph.D. in 1950.
Her marriage to Neil Chamberlain, a fellow Harvard Ph.D. in economics who taught for many years at Columbia University, ended in divorce in 1970. There are no immediate survivors.
Dr. Chamberlain held teaching positions at Connecticut College, the School of General Studies at Columbia University, and at Hunter College, before joining the Ford Foundation. After leaving the foundation, her work as the president of the National Council for Research on Women helped consolidate and coordinate research centers that she had helped seed at Stanford, the University of Michigan, the University of Arizona and Memphis State, among 100 others.
An essay in ''The Politics of Women's Studies,'' published in 2000 by the Feminist Press, was one of the few articles Dr. Chamberlain ever wrote about herself. In it, she used the image of a car climbing a steep mountain in describing her role in the movement.
''The car, in this case women's studies, was already on its journey,'' she wrote. ''But outside funding gave it the extra power to get to the top.''

HEADLINE: Chinese Hint at Limits To North Korea Actions

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ and CHOE SANG-HUN; Jane Perlez reported from Boao, and Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul, South Korea. Christopher Buckley contributed reporting from Hong Kong, and Steven Lee Myers from Washington.

 BODY:
BOAO, China -- In an indirect but clear reference to the North Korean crisis, China's president, Xi Jinping, said Sunday that world peace should not be put at risk because of a single country.
''No one should be allowed to throw a region and even the whole world into chaos for selfish gain,'' Mr. Xi said in a speech at an annual regional business forum in Boao, China. Mr. Xi did not single out any countries or disputes, but in separate remarks, China's Foreign Ministry repeated its ''grave concern'' over the rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
At the same time, South Korea's government warned that North Korea might carry out another provocative act this week, possibly a missile test, as a way to extract concessions from Washington and Seoul.
As North Korea's major ally, China has been discomfited by the behavior of the North's leader, Kim Jong-un, but it has refrained from making pronouncements that would signal what, if anything, it planned to do to rein in North Korea. 
The Obama administration, in response to the North's threats to fire missiles at the United States, has said that it will strengthen its missile defenses, and it has sent jet fighters, bombers and warships to the area as a show of support for South Korea.
Mr. Xi did not mention the American actions in his speech at the Boao Forum, but China has grown increasingly concerned about efforts by the United States to reassert itself in Asia. He said Asia's stability faced new challenges as ''hot spot issues keep emerging and both traditional and nontraditional security threats'' surfaced. Obama administration officials say that Beijing faces a choice between cracking down on North Korea or facing a larger American military presence in East Asia.
But it is unclear how much China can moderate the North's behavior. North Korea ignored China's wishes when it carried out a nuclear test in February. That test led to more United Nations economic sanctions -- which China agreed to despite reservations about their effectiveness -- and set the stage for the North's latest conflict with the United States and South Korea.
The South Korean government's new warning came three days after its defense minister said that the North had moved a missile with a ''considerable range'' to its east coast, although it is not capable of reaching the mainland United States.
Kim Jang-soo, director of national security for President Park Geun-hye of South Korea, said during a meeting of security-related officials on Sunday that the North ''may launch a provocation, such as missile launch,'' around Wednesday. The missile that was moved is widely believed to be the Musudan, which the South Korean military and analysts say has the range to hit South Korea and Japan and perhaps American bases in Guam as well.
''North Korea has been engaged in a so-called headline strategy,'' Kim Jang-soo said, referring to an almost daily drumbeat of North Korean threats since early March and the news stories they have generated.
North Korea is raising tensions in an effort to frighten and force the United States and South Korea into negotiations and concessions, he said. The pressure was also aimed at China and Russia in an effort to push them to mediate on North Korea's behalf, he said.
''We see through their motive,'' he said. ''Although North Korea shows no signs of attempting a full-scale war, it will suffer damage many times more than we do if it launches even a localized provocation.''
South Korea ''has no intention of attempting premature dialogue just because of a crisis,'' Mr. Kim said, urging the North to ease tensions so talks can start.
In an interview on the ABC News program ''This Week'' on Sunday, President Obama's senior adviser, Dan Pfeiffer, declined to discuss what the United States would do if North Korea tested another missile, but said that it would not be a surprise if it did. ''We have taken the steps we need to be able to protect our allies, protect the homeland,'' Mr. Pfeiffer said. ''The real focus and the onus is on North Korea to do the right thing.''
Two senior senators also criticized China on Sunday for not doing more to press North Korea to tone down its confrontational stance. ''The Chinese hold a lot of the cards here,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation.'' ''They're by nature cautious, but they're carrying it to an extreme. It's about time they stepped up to the plate and put a little pressure on this North Korean regime.''
Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, appeared on the same program and said China could use its economic leverage over North Korea, cutting off support entirely ''if they want to.'' Mr. McCain said China's failure to push North Korea was ''very disappointing.''
Mr. Xi's remarks, which were primarily focused on economic and social issues in Asia, did not mention any specific dispute, but he promised a constructive approach to regional tensions and ''unremitting efforts to properly handle relevant issues through dialogue and negotiations.''
Obama administration officials say that China's stance toward North Korea is ''evolving.'' In the past week, China's Foreign Ministry has released several statements saying that it considers the North Korean situation to be of ''grave concern.'' On Sunday, the ministry repeated that phrase, saying that China had requested that North Korea protect foreign diplomats living in Pyongyang, the North's capital. North Korean authorities has told foreign embassies to inform them by Wednesday whether they need assistance in evacuating because of rising tensions on the peninsula.
''Currently, tensions on the Korean Peninsula continue to escalate, and China expresses grave concern about this,'' according to the statement by the ministry spokesman, Hong Lei. ''The Chinese government has already requested that North Korea abide by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and other international laws and practices and thoroughly ensure the safety of Chinese Embassy and consular personnel resident in North Korea.''
The North gave similar warnings to some of the 123 South Korean factories in the joint industrial park in the North Korean city of Kaesong, said Mr. Kim, the South's national security director. For a fifth consecutive day, North Korea blocked South Korean workers and supplies from entering the factory park, forcing 13 plants to stop production as of Sunday.

HEADLINE: An Old Ally Sends Droves of Students to U.S.

BYLINE: By D.D. GUTTENPLAN

 BODY:
ISTANBUL -- Which European country sends more students to U.S. universities than any other? Is it Britain, which shares a common language and a reverence for ancient collegiate campuses? Or Germany, whose great research universities did so much to shape U.S. higher education?
The answer, it turns out, is neither. Though Britain sent more than 9,000 students to the United States last year -- more than ever before -- and Germany sent about 9,300, both lagged behind Turkey, which has been sending more than 10,000 students a year to the United States since 2000.
The numbers have fluctuated, with a sharp falloff after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when the United States was seen as a less desirable destination, and when Turkey was mired in its own economic crisis. But according to Open Doors, a census of international student movement issued by the Institute for International Education in New York, Turkey has long been the only European country to figure regularly in the top 10 sending nations, behind mainstays like China, India, Canada and Mexico. In 2012, Turkey sent nearly 12,000 students to the United States. 
''Turkey's vision has always been looking to the West,'' said Zeynep Gurhan-Canli, a professor in the business faculty at Koc University on the outskirts of Istanbul. ''We have always looked to Europe and the U.S.,'' she said.
At one time, France and Germany were popular destinations for Turkish students, but the increasing popularity of English as a second language helps pull students to the United States. Britain's appeal as an alternative has been diminished by recent changes to student visa rules.
''The U.S. is seen as more open to international students,'' said Selcuk Karabati, Koc's vice president for academic affairs. ''The U.K. is seen as being mainly interested in attracting foreign students for financial reasons.''
For some students, the longer distance actually works in favor of the United States.
''It will be nice to study somewhere else, far from my parents,'' said Alara Alkin, a chemical and biological engineering major at Koc who is heading to Drexel University in Philadelphia next year. Ms. Alkin is a graduate of St. Joseph, a French-language high school. ''I had the opportunity to go to Paris instead. But French is dying, and America is alive.''
Todd Pierce, cultural attaché at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, said that demographics had much to do with the number of Turkish students on U.S. campuses. ''There was a baby boom here from the late 1970s to the early 1990s, which is still just reaching the age to go to college,'' he said. ''Turkey expanded its own educational capacity a lot in the past 20 years. From a few dozen universities, the current figure is 164, and that number keeps growing. But it hasn't grown fast enough to keep up with the demographic bulge.''
Admission to Turkish universities depends on a candidate's score on a single national exam. With a constantly rising student population, ''you could be a really good student and still not get in anywhere -- especially in fields like medicine or engineering, where the required scores are very high,'' Mr. Pierce said.
The highly competitive nature of admissions poses a problem for Turkish families, which traditionally place a strong emphasis on education. Admission to any U.S. university is attractive given the real possibility of being shut out at home.
''The leading private educational institutions in Turkey were modeled after American universities, so when our students think of studying abroad it is only natural that they should think of America first,'' Dr. Karabati said. ''Even our grading systems are the same. We have A's and B's, tests every week and midterm and final exams.''
Idil Kutay, a finance major at Koc, said she had been encouraged to think about studying in the United States since high school. ''We were really recommended to study abroad. A lot of my friends went to universities in the U.S.,'' she said, adding that she had decided to spend part of next year at Drexel after researching schools on the Internet. ''They had courses in my major I couldn't find in my college.''
Irsadi Aksun, a professor of electrical engineering at Koc, said, ''There are two different groups of Turkish students who go abroad.''
The first, he said, is ''very competitive -- some have taken Advanced Placement courses in high school. Some have followed the International Baccalaureate.''
''This group is quite small,'' he went on, adding that most came from a handful of Turkish private schools that offer English instruction in many subjects. Such schools are increasingly popular among wealthy families in Istanbul and Ankara.
''But there is also another, much larger group who don't do so well in the national exams,'' Dr. Aksun said. ''They are not so academically competitive. But we have agencies here that specialize in placing students in U.S. universities.''
''We have many Turkish students who attend community colleges in the U.S.,'' Dr. Karabati said. According to the Web site of the Turkish Fulbright Commission, students studying a range of subjects like agriculture and tourism management are eligible for grants to attend U.S. community colleges, which generally offer two-year programs that can act as a bridge to four-year universities. The program also provides English language training for students in Turkey and additional language classes in the United States before classes start.
''Foreign-language proficiency is a major problem in Turkey -- especially for students who come from state schools,'' Dr. Karabati said.
Nearly 30 percent of Turkish students in the United States are undergraduates; 52 percent are graduate students. The rest are either classed as ''other'' or are pursuing Optional Practical Training, under which students with appropriate visas who have already studied in the United States for more than nine months are allowed as much as 29 months of work experience.
Because of longstanding research ties, the draw for graduate students is particularly strong.
''At Koc, 95 percent of the faculty received their Ph.D.'s from American universities,'' said Dr. Karabati, who completed his doctorate at the University of Texas at Austin.
''Most of our top graduates go on to universities in the U.S,'' said Dr. Aksun, who holds a doctorate from the University of Illinois. ''When I was at Bilkent we were sending 50 students a year,'' he said, referring to the oldest private university in Turkey, founded in Ankara in 1984.
For some Turkish universities, the ties to U.S. institutions are even more direct. Bosphorus University, a Turkish state institution and Dr. Karabati's undergraduate alma mater, actually took over the Istanbul campus of Robert College, a private prep school founded by the American philanthropist Christopher Robert in 1863.
The alumni of Robert College's Turkish branch include former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, the first woman to hold that post, former Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, and the novelist Orhan Pamuk, the 2006 Nobel laureate in literature. Tuition is currently 25,000 Turkish lira for day students and 44,000 lira for boarders, or $14,000 and $24,000, respectively.
Koc, which was founded in 1993, boasts a Henry Ford Building, a testimony to the relationship between Vehbi Koc, a Turkish industrialist who was the university's benefactor, and Ford Motor.
''Last year Sabanci University, another private university in Istanbul, started a dual degree program'' with the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mr. Pierce said, adding that while the most recent statistics actually showed a slight decline in the total number of Turkish students going to the United States -- from 12,184 in 2011 to 11,973 in 2012 -- he was not concerned.
''As long as the economy here keeps doing well, I think the numbers will hold up,'' he said. ''But we'd like to get more American students to come here.''
In the 2010-11 academic year, the most recent year for which Open Door statistics are available, the United States sent slightly more than 2,000 students to Turkey -- a jump of 34 percent from the previous year, and more than double the 2006-7 number.
''I can definitely see Turkey as the next frontier in studying abroad,'' Mr. Pierce said.

HEADLINE: Students Go Local for Expertise in Global Business Problems

BYLINE: By D.D. GUTTENPLAN

 BODY:
ISTANBUL -- Two years ago, Steven Becker was a Peace Corps volunteer in Nicaragua. Next year he will be working for Chevron.
Next year, Mike Peng will be in Beijing, helping to invest the endowments of some of the leading U.S. universities. Both are students at Yale University's School of Management.
But on a crisp morning in March, they were in a classroom at Koc University's campus on the outskirts of Istanbul, set in a pine grove high above the Black Sea. They were listening to Ahmet Erelcin, head of HSBC's Turkish private equity division, explain how his country had survived a banking crisis and financial meltdown more than 10 years ago. 
Also in class were two graduates from the Getúlio Vargas Foundation, a São Paolo university: Carine Bastos, who works at the central bank, and Mariam Irie, who works on the ethics and compliance committee at the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly in São Paolo.
What brought them together was Istanbul Immersion Week, organized by the Global Network for Advanced Management, a group of 22 business schools that share research, teaching materials and students.
''We were looking for a more intelligent way of responding to globalization,'' said David Bach, a former dean at IE Business School in Madrid, who is now in charge of Yale's executive M.B.A. and global programs. He said they were moving away from a traditional model, in which one school might pay another to set up a module, or two schools might have an exchange, but students would not have a chance to mingle.
Instead the network is built around the idea of local expertise in a global world.
''It makes no sense to pretend that you have all the knowledge in one place,'' Mr. Bach said. ''Offering your own course is the only price of entry. This year we had five schools, each offering a weeklong program on a topic where they have special expertise.''
In the inaugural session, students from Yale, Koc, Getúlio Vargas, IE, and the Renmin University of China were given a choice of five courses on five campuses. Those who went to Yale, in New Haven, Connecticut, studied behavioral finance, while IE offered an introduction to the European economic crisis. At Getúlio Vargas, visitors learned about marketing to low-income consumers -- a crucial market across Latin America -- while Renmin focused on China's entrepreneurial culture and its success in emerging markets.
In Istanbul the students learned how to cope with crises. ''In the U.K. before 2008 a banker could retire without seeing a single crisis,'' said Mr. Erelcin of HSBC. ''I've seen 20 crises here in the past 25 years. I know how to act.''
For the Brazilian visitors, much of the material was familiar. ''We need to know how Turkey coped with its crisis in order to understand the crises in Brazil,'' Ms. Bastos said.
Just as the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the United States in 2008 led to an economic meltdown in Europe, so the decision by Russia to default on its debts in 1998 led to financial collapse in Brazil, said Luís Felipe Teixeira, another Vargas graduate, who works for General Motors in São Paulo. ''I never realized there were so many similarities between Brazil and Turkey,'' he said. ''We also had a period of hyperinflation.''
For the Americans, the week was more about noticing differences. ''We don't get enough about developing economies,'' said Harsh Gupta, an Indian native who grew up in Atlanta and did his undergraduate degree at the Georgia Institute of Technology. ''When I graduate I want to work in other countries -- not just the U.S. and India. Also I've heard great things about Istanbul, and I'd never been.''
Nate Hundt, a Washington native who worked as a volunteer on President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign, followed by a stint with the U.S. Department of the Interior, said he had decided to come to Istanbul ''because I was in Israel last year, and I wanted a different perspective on a similar region.''
Mr. Peng, the Yale student, graduated from Peking University and then worked as a management consultant. ''I had spent 26 years in China, and I wanted to work in different regions,'' he said. ''In China we haven't had any financial crises since I was born. But we also have problems with inflation, and like the Turks we don't trust the figures the government gives out. So it's interesting to learn about a country that has gone through a crisis and come out the other side.''
For Jason Koster, the week offered a chance to catch up with a classmate from Tulane University in New Orleans and gain some new insights. ''My friend's family own a textile company here,'' he said, referring to a venture in Istanbul.
An afternoon spent listening to Semih Yalman, a former vice president of Dogus Holding -- a family-owned conglomerate that includes one of the largest banks in Turkey, as well as hotels, television and radio channels, construction companies and automobile dealerships -- gave Mr. Koster ''a better sense of how a family-owned business in an emerging economy operates.''
Mr. Yalman, a thin, intense man with a shaved head who went from selling Gillette razors to planning strategy and media for a multibillion-dollar corporation, recounted his own version of Turkey's rise from the ashes of economic collapse. As he spoke, the assigned reading -- a slightly dry Harvard Business School case about his company's change in management -- came alive. When he described the company's decision to promote the national basketball team by commissioning the pop song ''12 Dev Adam'' (12 Giant Men), he was interrupted by Imge Su Aral, a Koc student from Adana, a city in south central Anatolia. ''That song was huge!'' she said.
That kind of local perspective was exactly what the immersion week was designed for. ''I would argue that a Harvard or Yale case written about Indonesia will never be the same as an Indonesian case written about Indonesia,'' Mr. Bach said. ''We wanted students to be mixed together in the classroom, so they can see that the way people in another country or another culture react to situations may be very different from the way you would react.''

HEADLINE: Insurance And Freedom

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
President Obama will soon release a new budget, and the commentary is already flowing fast and furious. Progressives are angry (with good reason) over proposed cuts to Social Security; conservatives are denouncing the call for more revenues. But it's all Kabuki. Since House Republicans will block anything Mr. Obama proposes, his budget is best seen not as policy but as positioning, an attempt to gain praise from ''centrist'' pundits.
No, the real policy action at this point is in the states, where the question is, How many Americans will be denied essential health care in the name of freedom? 
I'm referring, of course, to the question of how many Republican governors will reject the Medicaid expansion that is a key part of Obamacare. What does that have to do with freedom? In reality, nothing. But when it comes to politics, it's a different story.
It goes without saying that Republicans oppose any expansion of programs that help the less fortunate -- along with tax cuts for the wealthy, such opposition is pretty much what defines modern conservatism. But they seem to be having more trouble than in the past defending their opposition without simply coming across as big meanies.
Specifically, the time-honored practice of attacking beneficiaries of government programs as undeserving malingerers doesn't play the way it used to. When Ronald Reagan spoke about welfare queens driving Cadillacs, it resonated with many voters. When Mitt Romney was caught on tape sneering at the 47 percent, not so much.
There is, however, an alternative. From the enthusiastic reception American conservatives gave Friedrich Hayek's ''Road to Serfdom,'' to Reagan, to the governors now standing in the way of Medicaid expansion, the U.S. right has sought to portray its position not as a matter of comforting the comfortable while afflicting the afflicted, but as a courageous defense of freedom.
Conservatives love, for example, to quote from a stirring speech Reagan gave in 1961, in which he warned of a grim future unless patriots took a stand. (Liz Cheney used it in a Wall Street Journal op-ed article just a few days ago.) ''If you and I don't do this,'' Reagan declared, ''then you and I may well spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it once was like in America when men were free.'' What you might not guess from the lofty language is that ''this'' -- the heroic act Reagan was calling on his listeners to perform -- was a concerted effort to block the enactment of Medicare.
These days, conservatives make very similar arguments against Obamacare. For example, Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin has called it the ''greatest assault on freedom in our lifetime.'' And this kind of rhetoric matters, because when it comes to the main obstacle now remaining to more or less universal health coverage -- the reluctance of Republican governors to allow the Medicaid expansion that is a key part of reform -- it's pretty much all the right has.
As I've already suggested, the old trick of blaming the needy for their need doesn't seem to play the way it used to, and especially not on health care: perhaps because the experience of losing insurance is so common, Medicaid enjoys remarkably strong public support. And now that health reform is the law of the land, the economic and fiscal case for individual states to accept Medicaid expansion is overwhelming. That's why business interests strongly support expansion just about everywhere -- even in Texas. But such practical concerns can be set aside if you can successfully argue that insurance is slavery.
Of course, it isn't. In fact, it's hard to think of a proposition that has been more thoroughly refuted by history than the notion that social insurance undermines a free society. Almost 70 years have passed since Friedrich Hayek predicted (or at any rate was understood by his admirers to predict) that Britain's welfare state would put the nation on the slippery slope to Stalinism; 46 years have passed since Medicare went into effect; as far as most of us can tell, freedom hasn't died on either side of the Atlantic.
In fact, the real, lived experience of Obamacare is likely to be one of significantly increased individual freedom. For all our talk of being the land of liberty, those holding one of the dwindling number of jobs that carry decent health benefits often feel anything but free, knowing that if they leave or lose their job, for whatever reason, they may not be able to regain the coverage they need. Over time, as people come to realize that affordable coverage is now guaranteed, it will have a powerful liberating effect.
But what we still don't know is how many Americans will be denied that kind of liberation -- a denial all the crueler because it will be imposed in the name of freedom.

HEADLINE: Lew to Press For Growth In Europe

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Jacob J. Lew began his first trip to Europe as Treasury secretary on Sunday, a four-city tour in which he is expected to try to persuade finance ministers to pursue a little more growth and a little less austerity to improve the economic fortunes of the Continent and the world.
Growth is again at the top of the Obama administration's agenda as Mr. Lew meets over a 48-hour period with high-ranking leaders representing the European Union, Germany and France. Europe's sovereign debt crisis continues to simmer for its fourth year, most recently in Portugal over the weekend, and European unemployment rates are still rising. The euro zone economy shrank in the fourth quarter of 2012, with the large economies of Germany, France, Spain and Italy all contracting. 
''Our European partners need to safeguard the stability they have achieved so far,'' a senior Treasury official said, noting that euro zone problems reduced global growth by three-tenths of a percentage point last year.
''In light of the reality that countries representing one-third of euro area G.D.P. are shrinking their budgets and restructuring their economies, it is vital to see rebalancing within the euro area with surplus economies contributing more to demand,'' said the official, who insisted on anonymity in discussing the Treasury secretary's plans.
Some European officials have also said they are concerned about a potential cycle of austerity and recession, with budget cuts leading to shrinking economies, making it harder and harder to meet budget goals.
The ''economic outlook for the euro area remains subject to downside risks,'' Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said at a news conference last week. Mr. Lew is scheduled to meet with Mr. Draghi on Monday.
''The risks include the possibility of even weaker than expected domestic demand and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in the euro area,'' Mr. Draghi said. ''These factors have the potential to dampen the improvement in confidence and thereby delay the recovery.''
But countries like Germany have shown little willingness to ease the constraints of austerity for peripheral European countries, or to engage in stimulus spending themselves. And for years, European officials have bridled at being lectured by officials from Washington -- particularly because many feel that their financial crisis was largely caused by American financial products exported around the world by American banks.
Though Mr. Lew will travel to Europe with a familiar message from Washington, it may not be delivered as urgently as in the past. The European crisis continues to weigh on American growth, cutting into exports, but many economists believe that the United States has entered a cycle of self-sustaining economic growth driven by a turnaround in housing and improving household budgets.
Moreover, American companies have over the last few years steeled themselves against Europe's financial woes, and the risk of contagion is perceived to be relatively low.
Europe was the primary international concern for Timothy F. Geithner, Mr. Lew's predecessor as Treasury secretary and a familiar face on the Continent. But perhaps as a sign of Europe's diminishing threat to United States economic stability, Mr. Lew's first overseas trip as Treasury secretary, last month, was not to Paris or Berlin or Brussels, but to Beijing.
European leaders are expected to press Mr. Lew on an eagerly anticipated free-trade agreement. A study by the European Commission found that a deal could increase European Union exports to the United States by as much as 28 percent, a lift for the flailing European economy.
''The European Commission is ready with a proposed mandate for the future negotiations,'' Karel De Gucht, the European trade commissioner, said in a statement last month. ''We can now roll up our sleeves and get down to the business of preparing negotiations.''
The Treasury official said: ''We will seek an ambitious, comprehensive and high-standard agreement.'' The official added that such an agreement would include ''full elimination of tariffs, reductions in nontariff barriers and disciplines that address emerging challenges such as state-owned enterprises and localization barriers.''
Financial regulations, including a proposed European tax on financial transactions, are expected to be a major subject of negotiations as well. But concerns over growth, austerity and stability in the euro zone looked certain to be the central topic of negotiations yet again.
Speaking at a conference in China on Sunday, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, also reiterated her concerns about growth. ''Low and lopsided growth is not enough,'' Ms. Lagarde said at the Boao Forum for Asia annual conference, citing the continuing troubles in Europe. ''It is not enough of a real recovery. It is not enough of a global recovery.''
In Brussels on Monday, Mr. Lew will meet with Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council; José Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission; Olli Rehn, commissioner for economic and monetary affairs; and Michel Barnier, commissioner for internal market and services. He will also meet with Mr. Draghi in Frankfurt.
On Tuesday, he will travel to Berlin and Paris to meet with his counterparts, the finance ministers Wolfgang Schäuble of Germany and Pierre Moscovici of France.

HEADLINE: Reforms for Work Visas

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
The debate about immigration reform has properly focused on giving the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in America a shot at citizenship. But broad reform should also include improvements to employment-based visas and green cards that make it possible to attract and keep highly skilled workers in technology, medical and educational fields, among others. 
These individuals and their families often languish in a kind of immigration purgatory for a decade or more as they apply to become permanent residents and, eventually, citizens. Many are effectively required to stay with one employer for fear that they will lose their place in line for a green card. This employment trap can deprive the broader economy of their abilities and allows some companies to pay these workers below-market salaries.
There have been various proposals to improve the system, including measures that would increase the current limit of 85,000 first-time visas under the popular H-1B category used by skilled professionals. (That cap has already been reached for this year.) Others have suggested ''stapling'' a green card to the degrees of graduate students studying science, technology, engineering and math. And some have pushed for a start-up visa that would help potential entrepreneurs. Here are some sensible changes that should be part of comprehensive reform:
¶Instead of hard caps for work visas, Congress should use flexible limits that are adjusted based on economic conditions, allowing more immigration when there is a shortage of skilled workers. Policy makers should consider creating an advisory commission, as proposed by the Migration Policy Institute, that would examine the limit every year or two. In the past, lawmakers have raised or lowered the limit on H-1B visas, which stood at 195,000 from 2001 to 2003, in response to lobbying by technology companies or labor groups.
¶People admitted on work visas should be allowed to change employers after a probationary period of 12 months without losing their place in line for permanent status. This would deal with complaints of discriminatory pay practices. Also, spouses of skilled immigrants should be allowed to work if they choose; it makes no sense to waste their skills by forcing them to stay home.
¶The per-country limits that restrict immigrants from any one country to 7 percent of the 140,000 employer-sponsored green cards issued annually should be reviewed, and perhaps eliminated. These restrictions, which were first put in place in 1965 to replace racial quotas, create a green card bottleneck for workers from populous countries like India, China and Mexico.
Not every immigrant who comes on a work visa wants to settle here, and some will leave after getting a few years of work experience. But rational immigration policy should make it easier for skilled and hard-working immigrants to stay and contribute to this country.

HEADLINE: Obama Must Walk Fine Line As Congress Takes Up Agenda

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The days ahead could be decisive ones for the main pieces of President Obama's second-term agenda: long-range deficit reduction, gun safety and changes to immigration law.
With Congress back this week from a recess, bipartisan groups of senators who have been negotiating about immigration and gun violence are due to unveil their agreements, though prospects for a gun deal are in question as the emotional impact of the massacre in Newtown, Conn., has faded and the National Rifle Association has marshaled opposition. And on Wednesday, Mr. Obama will send his annual budget to Capitol Hill intended as a compromise offer, though early signs suggest that Republican leaders have little interest in reviving talks.
Members of both parties say Mr. Obama faces a conundrum with his legislative approach to a deeply polarized Congress. In the past, when he has stayed aloof from legislative action, Republicans and others have accused him of a lack of leadership; when he has gotten involved, they have complained that they could not support any bill so closely identified with Mr. Obama without risking the contempt of conservative voters. 
Representative Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, called this predicament Mr. Obama's ''Catch-22.'' And Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said he had often seen it at work since 2010 while negotiating with Republican lawmakers to reach a long-term budget agreement.
At times, Mr. Warner said, Republicans would urge him to get Mr. Obama more involved, saying, ''Gosh, Warner, we've got to have the president.'' Other times, he said, the same lawmakers would plead otherwise, saying, ''If the president comes out for this, you know it is going to kill us in the House.''
''Everybody wants him involved to the right degree at the right moment,'' Mr. Warner said, ''but not anytime before or after.''
The challenge for Mr. Obama became evident as soon as he took office, when Republicans almost unanimously opposed his economic stimulus package even as the recession was erasing nearly 800,000 jobs a month. The author Robert Draper opened his recent book about the House, ''Do Not Ask What Good We Do,'' with an account from Republican leaders who dined together on the night of Mr. Obama's 2009 inauguration and agreed that the way to regain power was to oppose whatever he proposed.
Though Mr. Obama was able to prevail over Republican opposition in his first two years as president because Democrats had majorities in the House and the Senate, that changed when Republicans won control of the House in 2010, giving them a brake to apply to the president's agenda.
Other than the stimulus experience in early 2009, the moment that most captured that polarization for the White House occurred a year later. In early 2010 Republican senators, including the minority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, demanded that Mr. Obama endorse bipartisan legislation to create a deficit-reduction commission. But when he finally did so, they voted against the bill, killing it.
Now the president's three pending priorities are shaping up as test cases for how he and Republicans will work together -- or not -- in his second term.
Each measure -- on the budget, guns and immigration -- in its own way illustrates the fine line that Mr. Obama must walk to succeed even with national opinion on his side. Privately, the White House is optimistic only about the prospects for an immigration bill, which would create a path to citizenship for about 11 million people in the country illegally.
That is because an immigration compromise is the only one that Republicans see as being in their own interests, given their party's unpopularity with the fast-growing Latino electorate. In contrast, most Republicans see little advantage in backing gun legislation, given hostility toward it in their states or in districts throughout the South and the West and in rural areas. A budget compromise would require agreeing to higher taxes, which are anathema to conservative voters, in exchange for Mr. Obama's support for the reductions in Medicare and Social Security that they want.
Yet even on immigration, many Republicans are weighing their party's long-term interests in supporting a compromise against their own short-term arguments for opposing one: antipathy remains deep in conservative districts to any proposal that would grant citizenship. That calculation also holds for Republicans planning to seek the 2016 presidential nomination.
Against this backdrop, Mr. Obama early on outlined elements that he wanted in the immigration and gun measures. Then he purposely left the drafting to Congress. Senior aides, mainly the chief of staff, Denis R. McDonough, and the deputy chief of staff, Rob Nabors, check in daily with senators. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. stays in touch with his former Senate colleagues about the gun bill talks.
On immigration, Mr. Obama had wanted to propose his own measure because he had promised Latino groups he would do so. But Senate Democrats advised against it, fearing an ''Obama bill'' would scare off Republicans like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who has presidential ambitions. Indeed, Mr. Rubio's office once issued a statement to deny that he was discussing immigration policy ''with anyone in the White House,'' even as it criticized the president for not consulting Republicans.
''I think he's handled it just perfectly,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, a Democratic leader who is part of the bipartisan negotiations on both issues, said of Mr. Obama. ''He's mobilizing public opinion. He's staying on top of the issues and being helpful. But at the same time he's given us -- in the House and Senate -- space to craft a bipartisan agreement.''
While Mr. Obama is said to be actively involved in the immigration talks behind the scenes because of that bill's better odds, on gun measures like tighter background checks of firearms purchasers he is waging his fight mostly in public settings far from Washington. On Monday he will travel to Connecticut to meet again with the families of those killed in the school shooting in Newtown last year. At the University of Hartford, he will give another speech calling for passage of gun legislation.
Even Democrats say these speeches are having no effect on Republican lawmakers. Mr. Schumer and Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, spoke again over the weekend but have been unable to reach a deal, raising interest in a fallback proposal that two other senators -- Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia -- are working on.
Yet White House aides predict that if the gun issue dies, Mr. Obama will at least get credit for trying and Republicans will be blamed by the majority of Americans who favor tighter controls.
On Sunday, Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, intensified the White House's efforts to shame Republicans who are threatening to filibuster a Senate vote on gun measures.
''Now that the cameras are off and they are not forced to look the Newtown families in the face, now they want to make it harder and filibuster it,'' Mr. Pfeiffer said on the ABC News program ''This Week.''
On the budget, Mr. Obama has tried both strategies -- negotiating personally with Speaker John A. Boehner on a ''grand bargain'' for taxes and entitlement-program reductions, and when that failed, letting Congress try, which also failed. Now, with the bipartisan effort moribund, the president has decided he has no option but to publicly take the lead to revive negotiations with hopes of drawing some Republican support.
So the budget he is sending to Congress will embody his last compromise offer to Mr. Boehner in December. For the first time, Mr. Obama is formally proposing to reduce future Social Security benefits, if Republicans will agree to higher taxes on the wealthy and some corporations.
Republican leaders already have rejected the overture, based on early reports about it. But Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' on Sunday that Mr. Obama is ''showing some signs of leadership that's been lacking. I'm encouraged.''
On Wednesday, Mr. Obama is to dine with a dozen rank-and-file Republican senators, hoping they might deal with him on the budget, as well as on immigration and gun measures.

HEADLINE: Slaking a Region's Thirst While Cleaning Its Beaches

BYLINE: By IAN LOVETT

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Surfers here have long lived by a simple rule: When it rains, no matter how good the waves may be, stay out of the water. Those who do head out to the Venice Pier on a rainy day might have their bravery (or naïveté) repaid with pinkeye, a fever or diarrhea.
''The water will have this weird, funky smell to it,'' said Sean Stanley, 26, who has been surfing here his entire life. ''It's murky. You'll see soda cans and plastic bottles, oil from the cars. All the runoff from the city gets in there.'' 
Even in this water-starved region, storm and other runoff has become the primary source of water pollution. After the rare rains, runoff drags heavy metals, pesticides, cigarette butts, animal waste and other pollutants into streams and rivers and eventually to the Pacific Ocean, turning Los Angeles County's beaches into the filthiest in the state.
But now, local officials are trying to deal with runoff pollution and another problem -- the lack of drinking water -- with an ambitious plan to make the runoff drinkable.
The Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board has issued new rules that include strong incentives for cities to work together on projects that capture and filter rainwater in the ground. Not only would those projects keep runoff pollution out of the waterways, they would also bolster groundwater supplies, which could eventually be used for drinking water.
Jared Blumenfeld, the Environmental Protection Agency's administrator for California, Nevada, Arizona and Hawaii, said Los Angeles County was the first to try to deal with storm water and drinking water in an integrated way, calling the plan ''a really important step forward in thinking about storm water.''
''If you think about how much money we spend getting water to Los Angeles from elsewhere, the potential for rainwater capture is great,'' he said. ''Integrating that goal into a plan to deal with storm water before it becomes a problem is a big innovation coming out of Los Angeles.''
Just about everyone around here likes the idea of developing a new source of drinking water. Southern Californians have already explored almost all potential sources of drinking supplies -- desalinated seawater, groundwater in the desert and even wastewater that has been treated and recycled.
The question is how to pay for it.
Regional projects to capture storm water by using soil and plants that naturally absorb and filter the water -- unlike the concrete that lines so many of the waterways here -- are often expensive, and those costs threaten to derail the Southern California plan.
County supervisors have proposed a fee on property owners that would raise $290 million a year to finance a project to mitigate runoff pollution. It was put on hold indefinitely last month amid loud objections. For major landowners, like school districts, the plan would cost millions. That would force even deeper cuts to districts that have already laid off teachers and increased class sizes.
One City Council member from Santa Clarita, which is not a coastal city, mocked the fee as ''a tax on God's good rain.'' Another Santa Clarita council member said the city's residents were already paying a fee to finance a city program to keep runoff pollution out of the country's waterways.
''What we don't understand is why we have to pay another fee on top of what we already pay,'' the council member, Marsha McLean, said at a recent meeting of the county supervisors. ''Our residents can't afford it. The city can't afford it.''
Storm water has become a primary source of pollution around the country, especially in urban areas, as the Clean Water Act -- passed by Congress four decades ago -- has forced the cleanup of wastewater and runoff from industrial facilities.
But the incentive to tackle the problem is greater here, not only because of the dearth of drinking water, but because the beaches play such a vital role in the region's economy, bringing billions of dollars into the county each year.
Los Angeles County is home to 7 of the 10 most polluted beaches in California. Malibu, a city known for its oceanfront, is home to four of those beaches, according to Heal the Bay, an environmental group that grades beaches based on health risks. In all, up to 1.8 million people experience stomach problems each year after visiting Los Angeles County beaches, which are sometimes closed when bacteria levels in the water get too high, according to a 2008 study cited by the county.
Although the regional water board issued very few fines to cities over toxin levels in the last decade, many experts expect that will change under the new regulations.
''It could actually bankrupt some agencies with costs and penalties,'' said Zev Yaroslavsky, a Los Angeles County supervisor whose district includes much of the coastline. ''This is a very expensive proposition, but we have no choice.''
Opponents of the new regulations, including some cities, hope to have the rules thrown out. Some have filed petitions to the state water board, claiming that the regulations do not follow state and federal water guidelines. Others have said it is the state's responsibility to ensure water quality. Even environmental groups object to a provision that exempts cities from testing for pollution levels in storm water if they adopt a regional plan to capture runoff in the ground.
The issue of who is ultimately responsible for runoff pollution could wind up back in court.
Kirsten James, the director of water quality policy at Heal the Bay, argued that in the long run, investment in a new supply of drinking water could save money.
''Looking at the skyrocketing costs of imported water,'' she said, ''it will be much more economical for our region to have storm water as a drinking water source.''

HEADLINE: Ukraine President Frees a Rival's Allies, but Leaves Her in Prison

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- In a possible sign that political tensions are easing in Ukraine, President Viktor F. Yanukovich pardoned the country's second-most-prominent political prisoner on Sunday, but his intentions concerning his biggest rival, who is also in custody, remained unclear. 
The pardoned prisoner, Yuri V. Lutsenko, is a former interior minister whose arrest in December 2010 on charges that he had abused his office raised concerns in the European Union and the United States that Ukraine's democracy was at risk. Those worries were heightened the following year when the police arrested Mr. Yanukovich's biggest rival, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, a former prime minister and the leader of the political opposition.
Mr. Yanukovich also freed several lower-profile figures on Sunday, including a former ecology minister, Georgy Filipchuk. But about a dozen other opposition figures remain in prison.
The pardon decree, published by Ukraine's government, laid out a host of factors that went into the decision, including the prisoners' former service to the state, their family affairs and their behavior while in prison.
The statement did not mention a campaign mounted by the European Union to win the release of prisoners in exchange for an agreement on broadened trade relations that includes provisions on human rights and the rule of law.
That agreement would open desperately needed access to European Union markets for Ukraine's struggling economy. The human rights provision has turned the political prisoners into bargaining chips.
European governments are pushing for adoption of the agreement by this fall. The arrest of Ms. Tymoshenko in August 2011 scuttled an earlier opportunity for the agreement's adoption last year. The process is complicated because all 27 member nations of the European Union must agree to such a treaty.
Diplomats have often cited the release of Ms. Tymoshenko and Mr. Lutsenko as conditions before the negotiations can continue. Western governments have called their prosecutions politically motivated.
It is unclear whether the release of Mr. Lutsenko and the other prisoners would suffice. Mr. Lutsenko, though, was upbeat concerning the wider significance of his release as he left Menskoi Prison on Sunday.
He told journalists that ''this event for me is a victory for Ukrainian democracy, for world democracy'' and that Ukraine was ''making correct steps to end political repression.''
Ms. Tymoshenko's case is likely to carry far more weight. She was a leader of the 2004 street protests known as the Orange Revolution and was elected to her first term as prime minister in 2005. After her narrow defeat by Mr. Yanukovich in 2010, she was sentenced to seven years in prison on charges that she abused her position in connection with the approval of a contract to buy natural gas from Russia. She now faces new charges involving the 1996 assassination of a member of Parliament.

HEADLINE: Medical Device Tax Hurts the Economy and Patients

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Contrary to ''One Industry's Hold on the Senate'' (editorial, April 2), overwhelming bipartisan majorities in Congress want to repeal the medical device tax because they understand how important medical technology is to our economy and patient care. 
Medical technology is an American success story, but our world leadership in this sector is increasingly threatened, along with the good jobs, economic growth and new treatments that come with that leadership. The tax creates a heavy additional burden, and dramatically increases the already uncompetitive United States corporate tax rate.
Money to pay the tax comes from somewhere: reduced jobs, research cuts or more likely both. Thousands have already been laid off, and analyses show that the tax threatens as many as 40,000 American jobs.
The industry will reap little, if any, new business from health care reform, certainly not enough to offset the tax. Repealing it won't harm health reform's laudable goals. The tax is simply bad public policy.
STEPHEN J. UBL GAIL M. RODRIGUEZ MARK B. LEAHEY Washington, April 4, 2013
The writers are, respectively, president and chief executive of AdvaMed (Advanced Medical Technology Association); executive director of the Medical Imaging and Technology Alliance; and president and chief executive of the Medical Device Manufacturers Association.
To the Editor:
Taxing the medical device industry is poor policy when applied across the board. You argue that devices ''are not purchased directly by consumers,'' and therefore a price increase will not affect demand. If only that were so.
While there are few, if any, artificial joints and pacemakers that are directly sold to consumers, it is certainly not true for other devices like wheelchairs that are swept into this device tax.
Medical devices aim to mitigate disability and keep people functionally independent and gainfully employed. Yet in many cases, people must pay out of pocket to get the devices they need to remain functionally independent. Functional independence is not considered medically necessary according to the Health and Human Services Department, particularly for wheelchair users.
United Spinal Association's members, most of whom have spinal cord injuries or disorders, need a robust and vibrant medical device industry to provide and maintain access to employment, education and community integration. In combination with the Health and Human Services Department's poorly designed medical equipment bidding program, this device tax will further harm an industry under siege and have a direct, negative effect upon the lives of people with disabilities.

HEADLINE: The Pitfalls of Evaluating Teachers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Curious Grade for Teachers: Nearly All Pass'' (front page, March 31):
What your article calls ''curious'' is, sadly, not very surprising.
A new generation of teacher evaluation systems has emerged since we published our 2009 report ''The Widget Effect,'' which documented how the old systems labeled nearly all teachers ''satisfactory'' and encouraged school districts to treat them like interchangeable parts. But while policy can change overnight, changing the culture of schools and districts is more complex.
America's schools have been largely inattentive to differences in teacher effectiveness for decades. Today, most teachers remain unaccustomed to receiving anything less than above-average evaluation ratings. 
Most principals have never before been asked to assess teacher effectiveness so rigorously. Many education leaders continue to resist the very notion that some teachers perform better than others. So it should come as no surprise that many districts and states are struggling against rating inflation and other challenges as they begin instituting better systems.
The answer is not to throw up our hands but to acknowledge that eradicating the widget effect requires a shift in perspective and everyday practice -- one that demands not just smarter policies but also strong training, effective oversight and, critically, courage and resolve.
TIMOTHY DALY New York, April 2, 2013
The writer is president of TNTP, a national nonprofit organization that consults with school districts and states to improve teacher effectiveness.
To the Editor:
Most evaluations comprise a single, 20-minute observation of classroom activity once a year and one meeting. What about other important parts of good teaching: composing a lesson, creating an evaluation, collaborating with other members of a department or grade-level team, reviewing what worked and what didn't?
In many schools, teachers all know one another's strengths and weaknesses from working together every day and from the caliber of students they pass on to one another. They compare projects, approaches, assignments, tests and quizzes, and how their children are doing.
Schools need master teachers to do this kind of in-depth evaluation: talented, midcareer professionals, willing to step away from their own classrooms after years of teaching, who have the skill and experience to help their peers improve and to identify who needs to go.
ALEX PEARSON Director of Technology The Episcopal Academy Newtown Square, Pa., March 31, 2013
To the Editor:
Why is it surprising that so many teachers are rated effective even with new evaluation systems in place?
In New York City, half of the teachers hired leave the profession within five years because of the demands of the job. How many bad teachers remain?
When I was a new teacher, all my supervisors had more than 20 years of classroom experience. Observations were done at least six times a year, and new teachers were critiqued rigorously, yet the feedback received was reasonable, instructive and intended to help us develop the skills necessary to thrive in an inner-city school. It was not the method of evaluation that mattered; it was the skill of the evaluator.
In our current system, many administrators have little or no actual teaching experience so ''reformers'' seek new, ''objective'' evaluation methods rather than using the wisdom and experience of one generation to help advance the next one.
ALAN ETTMAN Bronx, March 31, 2013
The writer teaches English at DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx.
To the Editor:
We need to take one step back when ''grading'' teachers and consider two critical factors.
First, children and young adults spend much more time out of school than in school between 5 and 18. So it isn't fair that teachers should be held fully responsible for what students learn.
Second, teachers are the only helping profession that does not start the evaluation process with a look at their professional practice. In every other helping profession, the professional's practice is considered first before judging the outcome of their practice. Doctors are not responsible for the death of a patient if their professional practice is deemed appropriate and effective.
Teachers should be given the same professional respect. They should not be held solely responsible for student achievement if their professional practice was deemed appropriate and effective.
DAN LORITZ Senior Fellow and President Center for Policy Studies Lake Elmo, Minn., March 31, 2013
To the Editor:
Your article advances the idea that costly teacher evaluation systems are required to remove ineffective teachers. But according to the article, only 5 percent of teachers are supposed to be ineffective. Are all of the effort, money and testing worth it? What if we focused on engaging the other 95 percent with effective teaching and learning environments?
For example, teachers can be more effective if they have the means to modify curriculums, instruction, assessments and policy to meet the needs of their students. Effective learning environments emphasize the use of student projects and portfolios -- not standardized tests -- as indicators of student growth. At the core of any worthwhile evaluation system is teacher stewardship.

HEADLINE: Updates: Reaction to the Death of Margaret Thatcher

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: The Lede gathered reaction to the death of the &#8220;Iron Lady&#8221; of British politics, who died Monday at the age of 87. 

 BODY:
 7:50 P.M. | Obits Recall Mrs. Thatcher's Leadership Differently 
PoliticsHome, a leading Web site in the United Kingdom has linked to the various obituaries published online Monday about Margaret Thatcher that represent that she was both loved and loathed in the United Kingdom. 
The Daily Telegraph: 
 For more than a decade Margaret Thatcher enjoyed almost unchallenged political mastery, winning three successive general elections. The policies she pursued with ferocious energy and unyielding will resulted in a transformation of Britain's economic performance.
The resulting change was also political. But by discrediting socialism so thoroughly, she prompted in due course the adoption by the Labour Party of free market economics, and so, as she wryly confessed in later years, "helped to make it electable". 
The Guardian:
Margaret Thatcher, who has died aged 87, was a political phenomenon. She was the first woman elected to lead a major western power; the longest serving British prime minister for 150 years; the most dominant and the most divisive force in British politics in the second half of the 20th century. She was also a global figure, a star in the US, a heroine in the former Soviet republics of central Europe, a point of reference for politicians in France, Germany, Italy and Spain.
In Britain, the Thatcher years were a watershed. After them, the ideals of collective effort, full employment and a managed economy - all tarnished by the recurring crises of the 1970s - were discredited in the popular imagination. They were replaced with the politics of me and mine, deregulation of the markets and privatisation of the state's assets that echoed growing individual prosperity. Thatcher did not cause these changes, but she legitimised and embedded them. Her belief in the moral authority of the individual and the imperative of freedom of choice led left as well as right to reappraise the welfare state. Her perception of economics, society and Britain's place in the world continue to shape British politics.
The Times:
 Indomitable Prime Minister whose unswerving belief in free enterprise transformed the political and social landscape
Margaret Thatcher was one of the greatest British politicians of the 20th century. The first woman prime minister in Europe, she held the job for 11 years. In the 20th century no other prime minister had been in office for such a long unbroken period, and no one since Lord Liverpool (1812-27) had had such a long continuous run as Prime Minister. 
The Independent:
There has been no other leader quite like Margaret Thatcher in post-war Britain. No other post-war Prime Minister has been so admired, or so reviled. She was the first woman to lead a major political party in Britain, the longest-serving Prime Minister of the 20th century, and almost the only Prime Minister whose name is synonymous with an ideology. "Thatcherism" remained in political diction when the holder of that name was an elderly frail, lonely widow.
She was never much loved, though she would have liked to have been. She believed that she had a direct line to the British people, or at least the section of it from which she sprang: the hardworking, law-abiding, self-denying lower middle class. Although she dominated her party and the government machine, her self-image was of an outsider battling with an inert establishment. Evening visitors to the flat above Downing Street would sometimes find her and her husband, Denis, watching the news, and grumbling about the state of the nation, wanting something done.
The Evening Times , the evening newspaper of the Herald and Times Group in Scotland:
Margaret Thatcher was loved and hated in equal measure throughout Britain. As her popularity in Conservative strongholds in the south of England increased with election victories in 1979, 1983 and 1987, in parallel her reputation in Scotland worsened and here she became one of the most despised politicians of the modern age.
There will be no national show of grief, civic sentimentality or spontaneous public floral tributes here for a woman whose very name being mentioned can still get the blood of many a Glaswegian boiling ... even more than 20 years after leaving office.
Her premiership saw the decline of heavy industry and factory closures in Glasgow and elsewhere leading to mass unemployment in communities and a spiralling of associated problems such as debt, alcoholism and drug abuse.
Battles with unions, with nurses, teachers and most notably the miners going on strike provided defining social images of the 80s.
In Glasgow the social legacy of her era was economic decline, a cycle of inter-generational unemployment and a right-to-buy housing policy that robbed the social sector of its most desirable homes.

 7:13 P.M. | Video Report on Thatcher's 1984 Battle with Miners 
 [Video: A report from ITN on Margaret Thatcher's battle with the National Union of Mineworkers in 1984. Watch on Youtube.]
Curbing the power of trade unions, as our colleagues reported was a top priority for Margaret Thatcher when she came to power in 1979.
A major test came in early 1984 when the government announced plans to shut down several coal mines that were nationalized in 1947. In response to the government's action to eliminate 20,000 jobs, the union's president called for a walkout. 
Violent clashes ensued between hundreds of miners and the police with images shown night after night on television news broadcasts. 
Mrs. Thatcher vowed not to back down.
The union's leader, Arthur Scargill, lost public support for the strike, including among some Labour leaders and his own members, when he did not quickly condemn actions that led to the death of a taxi driver taking a miner to work that fall. The driver was killed when a concrete slab was dropped on his cab.
Some of Mr. Scargill's union members sought to have the strike declared illegal. Meanwhile, Mrs. Thatcher was depicted in newspaper cartoons using her purse to flail a cowering Mr. Scargill. The strike ended after 362 days, without a settlement, paving the way for Mrs. Thatcher and the Conservative government to move ahead with the party's "popular capitalism" platform that led to the privatization of other state-run industries and 900,000 jobs.
- Jennifer Preston 
 5:21 P.M. | Thatcher and Reagan 
 [Video: CNN's Nic Robertson on the relationship between Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan Watch on Youtube.]
Margaret Thatcher was known particularly for her close working relationship alliance with President Ronald Reagan, with whom she shared a profound ideological rejection of cold war Communism. In a statement released Monday, Nancy Reagan even called her husband and Mrs. Thatcher "political soul mates."
It is well known that my husband and Lady Thatcher enjoyed a very special relationship as leaders of their respective countries during one of the most difficult and pivotal periods in modern history. Ronnie and Margaret were political soul mates, committed to freedom and resolved to end Communism. As prime minister, Margaret had the clear vision and strong determination to stand up for her beliefs at a time when so many were afraid to "rock the boat." As a result, she helped to bring about the collapse of the Soviet Union and the liberation of millions of people.
In her eulogy for Mr. Reagan in 2004, Mrs. Thatcher called the former president "a dear friend."
In his lifetime, Ronald Reagan was such a cheerful and invigorating presence that it was easy to forget what daunting historic tasks he set himself. He sought to mend America's wounded spirit, to restore the strength of the free world and to free the slaves of Communism. In the terrible hours after the attempt on his life, his easy jokes gave reassurances to an anxious world. They were evidence that in the aftermath of terror, and in the midst of hysteria, one great heart at least remained sane and jocular. They were truly grace under pressure. And perhaps they signified grace of a deeper kind. Ronnie himself certainly believed that he had been given back his life for a purpose.
Read the full text of the eulogy on the Margaret Thatcher Foundation's Web site
 4:59 P.M. | Thatcher on Gorbachev: 'We Can Do Business Together.' 
Mikhail Gorbachev, the last president of the former Soviet Union, issued a statement, describing Mrs. Thatcher as a "great politician."
He recalls that their relationship, when it began in 1984, was difficult at times but grew to be more friendly. He said that eventually their ability to reach an understanding about each other and their countries contributed to changing the relationships between their countries, and between the former Soviet Union and the West. 
 In a 1984 television interviewwith the BBC's John Cole, Mrs. Thatcher said she was "cautiously optimistic" about her relationship with Mr. Gorbachev.
I like Mr. Gorbachev. We can do business together. We both believe in our own political systems. He firmly believes in his; I firmly believe in mine. We are never going to change one another. So that is not in doubt, but we have two great interests in common: that we should both do everything we can to see that war never starts again, and therefore we go into the disarmament talks determined to make them succeed. And secondly, I think we both believe that they are the more likely to succeed if we can build up confidence in one another and trust in one another about each other's approach, and therefore, we believe in cooperating on trade matters, on cultural matters, on quite a lot of contacts between politicians from the two sides of the divide.
- Jennifer Preston 
 3:54 P.M. | Thatcher on '60 Minutes' 
"It's not the job of a politician to do only those things which you think will be popular," Margaret Thatcher told Diane Sawyer during this interview on "60 Minutes" in 1985. 
Around the nine-minute mark, Mrs. Thatcher talks about the 1984 bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton, where she and others had been staying for a Conservative Party conference. The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for the attack that killed four people and wounded more than 30. Mrs. Thatcher went on to address the party as scheduled the next day. 
Asked whether she thinks about that attempt on her life, Mrs. Thatcher said, "Look, every person in politics in the Western world takes that risk, and you just carry on, and we don't really think of it. We're deeply grateful to those who protect us. One day it may happen. My goodness me, the gunman is not going to stop us from carrying out the business of democracy. Ever. He will fail. And people must help him to fail by cutting off the money and supply of armaments he needs." 
 4:02 P.M. | Labour Leaders Recall Disagreements and Respect 
 [Video: Ed Miliband, Labour Party leader, remembers Margaret Thatcher Watch on Youtube.]
Ed Miliband, the leader of the Labour Party, said that his party disagreed with much of what Mrs. Thatcher did and that she would always remain a "controversial figure." But he said at the time that we "also greatly respect her political achievements and her personal strength."
I send my deep condolences to Lady Thatcher's family, in particular Mark and Carol Thatcher. http://t.co/qNnFYlI2To
- Ed Miliband (@Ed_Miliband)8 Apr 13
"She will be remembered as a unique figure," he said. "She reshaped the politics of a whole generation. She was Britain's first woman prime minister. She moved the center ground of British politics and was a huge figure on the world stage."
Tony Blair, the former leader of the Labour Party, noted that some of the changes that Mrs. Thatcher made were retained by the Labour government in 1997 and "came to be implemented by governments around the world."
Margaret Thatcher was a towering political figure. Very few leaders get to change not only the political landscape of their country but of the world. Margaret was such a leader. Her global impact was vast. And some of the changes she made in Britain were, in certain respects at least, retained by the 1997 Labour government, and came to be implemented by governments around the world. As a person she was kind and generous spirited and was always immensely supportive to me as Prime Minister although we came from opposite sides of politics. Even if you disagreed with her as I did on certain issues and occasionally strongly, you could not disrespect her character or her contribution to Britain's national life. She will be sadly missed.
Other comments by Labour leaders, including Gordon Brown, were gathered by LabourList.org.
Mr. Brown said that those who disagreed with Mrs. Thatcher "never doubted the strength of her convictions and her unwavering belief in Britain's destiny in the world."
Sarah and I have sent messages to Lady Thatcher's son Mark and daughter Carol, offering our condolences to them and to the Thatcher family and commemorating Lady Thatcher's many decades of service to our country. She will be remembered not only for being Britain's first female prime minister and holding the office for 11 years, but also for the determination and resilience with which she carried out all her duties throughout her public life. Even those who disagreed with her never doubted the strength of her convictions and her unwavering belief in Britain's destiny in the world. During our time in No. 10, Sarah and I invited Lady Thatcher to revisit Downing Street and Chequers - something which we know she enjoyed very much. But it was sad for her and her family that she lost her devoted husband Denis almost 10 years ago and that she was unable to enjoy good health in the later years of her retirement.
- Jennifer Preston 
 3:18 P.M. | Margaret Thatcher, Cultural Icon 
"The lady's not for turning," Margaret Thatcher famously said in an early speech. But almost from the moment she moved into 10 Downing Street in 1979, Mrs. Thatcher, who died Monday at 87, was most definitely for filming, recording and generally excoriating by British artists and writers who saw a rich target in her stiff-necked conservative politics and stiffer coiffure. Our colleague Jennifer Schuessler takes a look at Mrs. Thatcher's influence on culture.
 1:35 P.M. | Sullivan: 'I Was a Teenage Thatcherite' 
Thatcher definitively ended a truly poisonous, envious, inert period in Britain's history: http://t.co/0pb7ECphqA
- Andrew Sullivan (@sullydish)8 Apr 13
The writer Andrew Sullivan, who credits his "entire political obsession" to Margaret Thatcher posted a tribute on his blog, The Dish:
I was a teenage Thatcherite, an uber-politics nerd who loved her for her utter lack of apology for who she was. I sensed in her, as others did, a final rebuke to the collectivist, egalitarian oppression of the individual produced by socialism and the stultifying privileges and caste identities of the class system. And part of that identity - the part no one ever truly gave her credit for - was her gender. She came from a small grocer's shop in a northern town and went on to educate herself in chemistry at Oxford, and then law. To put it mildly, those were not traditional decisions for a young woman with few means in the 1950s. She married a smart businessman, reared two children and forged a political career from scratch in the most male-dominated institution imaginable: the Tory party. 
 1:22 P.M. | Quotable Thatcher 
Margaret Thatcher was known for her sharp wit, which was evident in many of her public statements. Even at age 9, she had a quick tongue, credited with saying "I wasn't lucky; I deserved it," when she received a prize at school.
Following is a video collection of selected speeches by Mrs. Thatcher - from remarks at the end of the Falklands war to her fight against European integration:
 1:21 P.M. | Video of Margaret Thatcher Delivering Speech in 1996 
 [Video: Excerpt of a speech delivered by Margaret Thatcher on the 50th anniversary of Winston Churchill's famous "Iron Curtain" speech. Watch on Youtube.]
In 1996, Margaret Thatcher traveled to Fulton, Mo., and delivered remarks on the 50th anniversary of Winston Churchill's famous "Iron Curtain" speech at Westminster College.
Mrs. Thatcher compared diplomacy and the state of international affairs in 1996 with 1946. She discussed the duality between optimism and uncertainty in the post-cold war era to the years after World War II. She also displayed her sense of humor, noting in the opening of her remarks that, unlike Mr. Churchill, she did not play poker with the president of the United States before the speech.
"I don't have the face for it," she said. 
 Correction: An earlier version of this post misstated the state where Fulton, home to Westminster College, is located. It is in Missouri, not Mississippi.

The Times's Graham Bowley on how the former prime minister's fiscal policies linger in Britain. 
 12:20 P.M. | Video of Thatcher Embracing Soviet 'Iron Lady' Slur 
 [Video: Archival video of Margaret Thatcher joking about being called an "Iron Lady" by a Soviet newspaper in 1976. Watch on Youtube.]
As the Russian newspaper Pravda explained a few years ago, Margaret Thatcher was first called an "Iron Lady," by the Soviet defense ministry newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, or Red Star, in 1976. Within days, Mrs. Thatcher joked about the slur, telling fellow Conservatives: 
I stand before you tonight in my Red Star chiffon evening gown, my face softly made up and my fair hair gently waved, the 'Iron Lady' of the Western world. A Cold War warrior, an Amazon philistine, even a Peking plotter. Yes, if that's how they wish to interpret my defense of values and freedoms fundamental to our way of life. And by they, I mean that somewhat strange alliance between the comrades of the Russian defense ministry and our own defense minister. They're welcome to call me what they like if they believe that we should ignore the build-up of Russian military strength.
Robert Evans, who was the Reuters bureau chief in Moscow at the time, explained Monday that he first reported on the Soviet article.
Leafing through the text-heavy and highly lookalike newspapers of the day, I came across a catchy headline - and there weren't many of those in the Soviet media - in the army mouthpiece Red Star, or Krasnaya Zvezda in Russian. "Zheleznaya Dama Ugrozhayet," it declared - "The Iron Lady Wields Threats." The story below, by reporter Yuri Gavrilov, berated the woman who was then leader of Britain's Conservative opposition for a speech warning of the danger posed by Soviet weaponry.
"She is known by her compatriots as the Iron Lady," Gavrilov asserted. As an exile Briton running Reuters' Moscow bureau, I had never heard the term applied to her and decided - in the absence of other news - that it was worth a story of my own. "British Tory leader Margaret Thatcher was today dubbed 'the Iron Lady' by the Soviet Defense Ministry newspaper Red Star," my piece read. It won wide play in the British media - without credit as is so often the fate of news agency reports.
Within a week, Thatcher - clad in scarlet - was herself demurely playing it up, clearly delighted at the term.
In an article on Mrs. Thatcher's death on Monday, the editors of Red Star saluted her spirited response to their barb. It had come, they explained, in response to a speech she had made on Jan. 19, 1976, in which she said:
The Russians are bent on world dominance, and they are rapidly acquiring the means to become the most powerful imperial nation the world has seen. The men in the Soviet politburo don't have to worry about the ebb and flow of public opinion. They put guns before butter, while we put just about everything before guns. 
Mrs. Thatcher continued to embrace the nickname in later years, as Russia Today, a satellite news channel financed by the Russian government, noted in a video report on her death. "The Russians said that I was an 'Iron Lady,'" Mrs. Thatcher said later. "They were right. Britain needs an Iron Lady."

Mr. Cameron, who cut short a visit to Continental Europe to return to Britain, also saidshe deserved to be considered "the greatest British peacetime Prime Minister."
"Lady Thatcher didn't just lead our country, she saved our country," Mr. Cameron in a statement posted to Twitter.
It was with great sadness that I learned of Lady Thatcher's death. We have lost a great leader, a great Prime Minister, and a great Briton.
- David Cameron (@David_Cameron)8 Apr 13
Very sad to hear of death of Baroness Thatcher. Her memory will live long after the world has forgotten the grey suits of today's politics.
- Boris Johnson (@MayorofLondon)8 Apr 13

"She stands as an example to our daughters that there is no glass ceiling that can't be shattered." -Obama on Margaret Thatcher's passing
- Barack Obama (@BarackObama)8 Apr 13
As our colleague Sarah Wheaton reports, Americans, especially those on the right, revered Margaret Thatcher, the three-term prime minister of Britain, as an important partner of President Ronald Reagan in the fight against communism. 
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, said in a statement, "A great ally and admirer of the United States and a trusted partner of Ronald Reagan during some of the most challenging days of the cold war, Margaret Thatcher never hesitated to remind Americans of their own obligations to the cause of freedom and of the need for political courage and confidence in the face of long odds."

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: Not Again!

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: The jobs report is a &#8220;punch in the gut.&#8221; Once again, the economy&#8217;s first-half momentum seems to be flagging. Some tips for keeping work-from-home employees accountable. Do you support paid sick leave? 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
 Small-Business Must-Reads 
An unregulated, decentralized virtual currency just became a billion-dollar market (but Felix Salmon explains why Bitcoin's rise is nothing to celebrate). A videographer, Dustin Cohen, tells a Brooklyn shoemaker's story, and an important partof the health care legislation affecting small businesses is delayed.
 The Economy: 'We've Been to This Rodeo'
 
The March jobs report is a "punch to the gut" (but don't blame sequestration). Companies added fewer workers than projected last month, held back by limited hiring in construction. Ylan Q. Mui wonders whether this is an April Fool's economy: "We've been to this rodeo twice already. In 2012 and 2011, seemingly strong momentum in the first half of the year gave way to summer slumps. Will the third try be the charm? Or is this just another prank - one that's getting old fast." Construction spending (pdf), as well as personal income and consumption all increased in February but economic confidence slipped in March. Demand for office space improves. Car sales surge as General Motors introduces a pair of midsize pickup trucks for casual users and small businesses. Economic activity in the nonmanufacturing sector also grows. Steven Hansen says that despite the headlines, manufacturing is not good. And here are 16 big bubbles that are getting ready to burst.
 Employment: Hiring Veterans 
The National Federation of Independent Business reports that small-business employment climbed last month by the most in a year, but hiring fell according to a monthly survey by SurePayroll. Another study, from Intuit, found that small businesses hired more in February but revenues continued to drop. Derek Bennett says hiring veterans is good business. Workers in seven of the 10 largest occupations typically earn less than $30,000 a year, and for many small-business owners, two jobs are a must. A survey finds small companies favor immigration changes that would provide a path to citizenship.
 Management: Disco and Leadership
Bill J. Bonnstetter writes that empathy is one of the qualities most entrepreneurs lack. Terry Starbucker explains what the rise, fall, and comeback of disco teaches us about leadership. Nick Tasler says there are reasons we ignore good advice. Nate Bolt provides a photo summary of how people sit in meetings and what they really mean. A new smart drug is especially popular among entrepreneurs.
 Energy: A Zero-Energy Retail Store
The first refinery in the United States since 1976 is being built in North Dakota as the Obama administration moves ahead with sweeping rules requiring cleaner gasoline. Some blame the corn industry for high gasoline prices - but after a sharp two-month climb of nearly 60 cents a gallon, gas prices have fallen over the past month and may have peaked for the year. Even so, farmers are planning on planting the most corn since 1936. A retailer's new store will supply its own energy.
 Ideas: Smell-O-Vision 
These are the 10 fastest-growing industries for small businesses. Teaching a course using your expertise is just one of five potential sources of side revenue you could be earning, according to John Corcoran. Samuel Wagreich thinks there are plenty of profits in 3-D printing. Sperm has become one of America's hottest exports. A Smell-o-Vision display emits localized virtual odors.
 Customer Service: Apple Learns a Lesson 
This infographic sums up the true cost of poor customer service. Jason Harter explains how Twitter has revolutionized the way we interact with customers. This is how the Zac Brown Band cultivates fans. Small businesses are finding success with customer-relationship software. Lauren Simonds says giveaways can turn tough sales into easy ones. Apple learns a customer-service lesson in China.
 Start-Up: A Giant Mood Swing 
Peter Cohan lists five steps for raising start-up capital. Kevin D. Johnson believes "the potential for attaining greatness is in creating new markets." These are the 11 start-ups that beat 1,700 others for spots in New York's hottest accelerator program. Being the founder of a start-up is just "one big giant mood swing." CNBC has a new series that will feature small businesses in a reality competition.
 Cash Flow: Calculating Gross Profit 
An alternative lender plans to provide loans to 100,000 small businesses this year. Here is a useful guide on how to calculate gross profit. Macy's mistakenly marks down a $1,500 necklace to $47. Amanda Henson shares some options for finding the right small-business grant. Here's how to go global with your small business, and a Small Business Administration official has advice for how to get payment for your export sales.
 Your People: Working From Home 
Barbara Corcoran explains what motivates employees more than money, and JJ Ramberg suggests three ways to energize your staff. Ian Smith offers ideas for creating a more positive environment for employees, and here are 26 delightful ways to make the work day more fun. Stephen J. Dunn analyzes the differences between employees and independent contractors. Liane Cassavoy offers tips for keeping your work-from-home employees accountable (without spying), and Mike Russell has thoughts on telecommuting from a manager's perspective. A new study encourages men to do less housework.
 Online: The Death of QR Codes
These are the top boards for monetizing Pinterest. Marla Tabaka has advice for attracting a huge crowd with LinkedIn. A co-founder of YouTube announces a new video-creation Web site. Christopher Mims explains how the Internet is making us poor. On April Fool's Day, Google introduces a "search and smell" feature and trades insults with Microsoft. David Meerman Scott says you should never delete content. Dana Prince says your opt-out rate is one of five online metrics to watch. Christopher Penn says there are times when it's O.K. to use boring e-mail subject lines. Aaron Strout believes QR codes are dying.
 Taxes: The Bagel Tax
K'Lee Banks lists five ways to book the right bookkeeper. Here's how to claim a home-office deduction for your small business. Paul Caron summarizes a few last-minute tax tips (but be sure to avoid these crazy deductions). These 10 corporate "taxation heroes" paid as much in taxes as the bottom 75 percent of all American taxpayers. The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee is outlining proposals to reduce the burden the tax code imposes on small businesses. And did you know that New York State charges an extra 8 percent tax if you ask for your bagel to be sliced? Was Shakespeare a tax-evading food hoarder?
 Red Tape: Teenage Tanning 
The chairman of the House small business panel wants to know how the Small Business Administration will deal with the sequestration's impact. The president hints at a budget compromise, continues to push his plan to build infrastructure and plays an April Fool's joke. The fight over an Internet sales tax intensifies. New Jersey's governor signs a teenage tanning law despite small-business concerns. New software will allow New York taxi regulators to monitor taxi whereabouts in real time. Saki Knafo believes that New York's paid sick leave bill may serve as a model for the United States, but New York's mayor vows to veto it.
 Around the Country: Mentor Month 
An OfficeMax in Milwaukee refashions itself so that it can offer more to small-business customers. An online Ponzi scheme leaves a North Carolina town poorer. The Small Business Administration and AARP will hold a series of events for "Mentor Month." A contest sponsored by the UPS Store will shine a spotlight on small-business owners. Local experts explain the difficulties of making money in Chicago's comedy business. A longtime owner sells his Minnesota grocery store to his employees. A California city is allowed to go bankrupt. A survey ranks the most (and least) small-business-friendly states and cities while another study concludes that there is more economic freedom in red states. A bunch of people walk backward through Times Square.
 Around the World: Jeddah's Entrepreneurs 
Cliff Wachtel shares seven lessons he learned from Cyprus, where many small businesses were caught in the cross-fire. A Small Business Saturday is scheduled for Britain, and a Startup Weekend highlighted Jeddah's entrepreneurial spirit. Queen Elizabeth gets a raise. One Chinese entrepreneur believes mainland start-ups must "become huge or die." China's manufacturing growth improved in March but the euro zone's manufacturing slump deepened. The Netherlands falls prey to the economic crisis and the mortgage crisis in Ireland is "insane."

 This Week's Best Quote 
Karen Vitale's advice to her 20-year-old self includes, "Chill out": "You will get dream jobs, lose dream jobs, realize there are no true dream jobs, and life will march on. Instead of trying too hard to get employers to want you, channel some of that nervous energy into figuring out if this is the best job for you. And if things do go south, remember that how you respond will say more about your character than any pat answer to an interview question. Do your best damage control and show the interviewer how you manage a crisis in real time."

HEADLINE: Which Governors Are Most Vulnerable in 2014?

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Ten of the 32 governors who are eligible to run for re-election in 2014 have net negative approval ratings. Eight of those 10 are Republicans, including 4 who rode the 2010 wave to power. 

 BODY:
A lot can change before Election Day next year, when 36 states will vote for governor. But at this early stage - when decisions on whether to run or retire are considered and made - 10 of the 32 governors who are eligible to run for re-election have net negative approval ratings in their states.
The two most unpopular governors up for re-election in 2014 are Gov. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, an independent, and Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois, a Democrat. But the remaining eight governors with net negative job approval ratings are Republicans, including four who rode the Tea Party wave to power in blue and purple states in 2010 and now appear to be in some danger: Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, Gov. Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania, Gov. Paul LePage of Maine and Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan. 
The chart below includes the three most recent job approval polls for each incumbent eligible for re-election in 2014. (The four states where term limits prevent the governor from running again - Arizona, Maryland, Nebraska and Arkansas - and Massachusetts, where Gov. Deval Patrick has announced he will not seek another term, are not included.) Surveys conducted before 2012 are not figured into the averages.

In Rhode Island, just 28 percent of residents approve of the job performance of Mr. Chafee, their Republican-turned-independent governor. The chief reason for Mr. Chafee's troubles appears to be Rhode Island's dismal economy. The state is tied with California for the highest unemployment rate in the nation, at 9.8 percent.
According to reports, Mr. Chafee is considering becoming a Democrat. That might not help him much. Roughly half of Rhode Island voters are unaffiliated with either major party, and their political allegiances are often fickle. If the economy remains bad, Mr. Chafee will have difficulty winning their votes again.
Although Mr. Quinn is the second most unpopular governor up for re-election in 2014, he is a Democrat in deep blue Illinois. If he runs, he is still considered a favorite to win re-election: the Cook Political Report, Sabato's Crystal Ball and The Rothenberg Political Report rate the Illinois governor's race, respectively, as leaning Democratic, likely Democratic and likely Democratic.
In other words, being unpopular does not necessarily make an incumbent vulnerable to defeat. The eight other governors up for re-election in 2014 who are under water in their job approval ratings are Republicans, but four of those Republicans - Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas, Gov. Nathan Deal of Georgia, Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina and Gov. Rick Perry of Texas - are in solidly Republican states and are likely to have an easier road to re-election if they run.
But the remaining four - Mr. Scott, Mr. Corbett, Mr. LePage and Mr. Snyder - lead states that were carried by President Obama in both 2008 and 2012. All were helped by favorable political winds in 2010 that no longer blow so hard.
Mr. Scott appears to be in the most trouble. A recent Quinnipiac survey showed former Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican-turned-Democrat and a possible candidate in 2014, beating Mr. Scott, 50 percent to 34 percent.
Mr. Scott has been stocking up campaign contributions, but currently only 32 percent of voters say he deserves a second term.
Mr. Corbett is in a similar position. Sensing weakness, Pennsylvania Democrats are lining up to challenge him.
Both Pennsylvania and Florida are rated as "tossups" by the Cook, Rothenberg and Crystal Ball reports, the only states - along with Rhode Island - to be rated tossups in all three sets of ratings.
In Maine, Mr. LePage's best chance of winning re-election may be to repeat his 2010 route to victory: winning a three-way race where the left-leaning and moderate votes are split. A recent survey by the Pan Atlantic SMS Group showed Mr. LePage leading all three-way matchups but losing by eight percentage points to an independent, Eliot Cutler, in a two-way race.
Mr. Snyder is in a slightly less precarious position in Michigan. His net job approval rating is negative, but in the single digits. The Rothenberg report rates the race as a tossup, but Michigan is rated as leaning Republican by Sabato's Crystal Ball and as likely Republican by the Cook report. Part of the reason for Mr. Snyder's relative strength is the lack of significant opposition. No prominent Democrat has announced an intention to run, but if one did, Mr. Snyder's chances could certainly diminish.
Mr. Snyder, Mr. LePage, Mr. Corbett and Mr. Scott may find hope in the fortunes of another Republican governor of a swing state who was elected in 2010: Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. Mr. Kasich's job approval rating was in the 30s in 2011. As Ohio's economy turned around, so did Mr. Kasich's image. The percentage of Ohio residents who approved of his job performance climbed into the 40s in 2012, and recent surveys have shown his numbers rebounding into the 50s.
Those numbers do not guarantee that Mr. Kasich will be re-elected, but he is in much better shape than his Republican colleagues. Not surprisingly, an incumbent governor's job approval ratings have been shown to be strongly correlated with how constituents vote.

HEADLINE: 'Battery University' Aims to Train a Work Force for Next-Generation Energy Storage

BYLINE: BRITA BELLI


HIGHLIGHT: The United States leads the world in battery research, but skilled manufacturing labor lags. Battery University seeks to change that with education. 

 BODY:
This summer, San Jose State University is offering the first classes in what it calls "battery university," a series in its professional development program intended to train a work force for the next generation of battery makers. The curriculum is being developed by more than 100 experts from the emerging battery storage sector - mostly from the San Francisco Bay Area - and will focus not only on developing the technology, but also on ways to make it cost-effective and realistically usable in electric cars, renewable energy or smartphones and laptops.
California is home to about 40 battery companies, but they are struggling to find a work force. 
"Start-up companies with new ideas are coming on board, but there is no work force to get those ideas to completion and to ultimately reach a point of success for the marketplace," said Venkat Srinivasan, head of the Energy Storage and Distributed Resources group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a partner in the program.
The vast majority of lithium-ion batteries are produced in China, Japan and South Korea, and emerging lithium-ion battery manufacturing in the United States is off to a shaky start. The 2009 federal stimulus bill gave more than $2 billion to support new battery plants. One of those plants, LG Chem Michigan, which was to produce batteries for the Chevy Volt, has remained idle since construction, and another, A123 Systems - the company that made batteries for the beleaguered electric carmaker Fisker Automotive - went bankrupt and was acquired by a Chinese auto parts maker in December. Johnson Controls, a lead-acid battery manufacturer, has fared better with its lithium-ion battery plant in Holland, Mich.
Mr. Srinivasan notes that "the United States still leads the world in research in battery technologies." The looming challenge facing lithium-ion battery manufacturers is the need to increase energy density without decreasing the battery's life cycle, while at the same time keeping production costs down, he said. The cost of batteries has been a major obstacle to increased electric car sales.
"Batteries are about half the cost of an electric vehicle," said Doug Davenport, a program manager at Berkeley Lab. "It pushes the price point of that car well beyond what a comparable gasoline engine car would be, and with a shorter range."
As researchers develop new materials and energy storage technologies for the next generation of batteries, both Mr. Srinivasan and Mr. Davenport say, the United States could have the opportunity to take the lead in battery manufacturing - if a skilled work force is available to do the specialized work necessary.
The Joint Center for Energy Storage Research at Argonne National Laboratory in Lemont, Ill., is one of many research centers trying to find energy storage breakthroughs. In November the Energy Department announced that two new advanced battery research facilities, both affiliated with the Argonne National Lab, would be built in Michigan.
Jeffrey Anderson, the interim executive director of CalCharge, which promotes energy-storage innovation, said such labs "are focused on addressing the energy density and cost challenge. If they succeed in their goal, we're going to have a huge opportunity to leapfrog the competition. 
"One of the critical pieces to being able to do that is whether we have a work force that is trained to know how to take something from innovation to infrastructure," Mr. Anderson said. "And that's the reason for 'battery university.'"
The first 10- to 12-week course will be offered in July or August, and online courses will be available in the future.

HEADLINE: Behind the Cover Story: Mark Bittman on the Reality of 'Healthful' Fast Food

BYLINE: RACHEL NOLAN


HIGHLIGHT: The author of this week&#8217;s cover article answers questions on the benefits &#8212; and limitations &#8212; of more-healthful fast food. 

 BODY:
 Mark Bittman, op-ed columnist, cookbook author and the magazine's lead food writer, wrote this week's cover article for the Food and Drink Issue about developments in the fast-food industry. His article about California's Central Valley was the cover story for last year's Food and Drink Issue.
 Why write about fast food? 
Because everybody eats it. We all know people who say, "I never eat at McDonald's," and I suppose there are such people. But they are rare. If it's not McDonald's, it's somewhere else. I got two e-mails from friends today saying that they also order off the "fresco" menu at Taco Bell. Everybody who travels, or has kids, or is in a hurry, eventually eats fast food. There's a little part of this story that went unsaid. I've spent many, many years encouraging people to cook. There certainly hasn't been a cooking revolution. On the contrary, there's been something of an un-cooking revolution. So if you really want people to eat well or eat better, it's not enough to just say that everyone should cook their own food. If we all did that, we'd be in pretty good shape. But I don't think there is a time in the near future or maybe ever when people are going to cook two or three meals a day again. So where is the food coming from? It's mass-produced, and it's fast. Big cities are a little different, but people generally eat in company cafeterias, or they go out and they grab fast food. So it is important to ask how we can make that food better.
 Still, in your ideal world, everyone would cook much more often? 
When you cook, you know what's going in the food. That's the only time you know what's going in the food, something I touched on in my essay "Cooking Solves Everything." When you're eating out or eating fast food, you really don't know. Even if they list ingredients, they're not listing all the ingredients. I keep expecting or hoping that people will want this control. But let's face it: It's a question of priorities. Do you want to collapse when you get home, or do you want to start cooking when you get home? Or do you not want to go home at all? Some argue that millennials might be different, but people are still choosing not to cook.
 Did you first hear of the "better" fast-food places like Lyfe and Veggie Grill before or after you started working on this article? 
Lyfe was something that I've been hearing about for a long time. I'm a California-phile: I used to live there, and I go there a lot. But to be clear, this is not just a California phenomenon. There are more healthful chains like Freshii in Chicago and a lot of other cities, and ShopHouse in D.C., which is the new place from Steve Ell of Chipotle. I have an ongoing argument with some vegan friends, including Ethan Brown, a guy I wrote about last year who makes vegan "chicken," about whether there should be a halfway point where people eat fake meat instead of real meat and whether we should be supporting that. As a nonvegan, I don't give a damn if people are vegan or not; we should just eat real food and more plants than we are eating now.
 In a world with no time or financial constraints, we'd all be superhealthy. But who can really afford healthful food? 
It is more complicated than that, because Veggie Grill really is junk food, but it's vegan junk food, and it's not cheap. Lyfe is actually a real restaurant with real food, and it is even more expensive. And that's why I included recipes with the article. Surely you could make a black-bean burger and sell it for the price of a McDonald's cheeseburger. And you could make sweet-potato fries and sell them for a dollar or two. But there is a difference between a $5 McDonald's check and a $15 dollar Veggie Grill check. There is something in between. People might be willing to pay a small premium for real food. When you start talking about economics and scale, you can't say only, "Well poor people can't afford this, so it's no good." That makes it sound like this matters only to low-income people. While I think it is important to address what they are able to afford and eat, it also matters what everyone else eats. What we have is people in the top 10 percent of income who eat very well. And a lot of people who are scraping by. But you can't ignore the people in the middle. There are a lot of people in that group.
 You write about a plan you had a few years ago to open a healthful fast-food restaurant, McBitty's. Was this article secretly a way to test out your business plan? 
No, but I'm open to anything.

HEADLINE: How the Location of Colleges Hurts the Economy

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: The location of the nation&#8217;s top colleges reflects the past as much as the present. As a result, many students who live far away from such colleges &#8211; especially in the Sun Belt and Mountain West &#8211; suffer. 

 BODY:
Some of the nation's most important companies did not exist a generation ago, and many of the most important - Amazon.com, Google, Apple, Costco, Home Depot, Microsoft, FedEx - did not exist 50 years ago. The federal government has also been transformed over the last century, with the creation of Social Security, Medicare, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the modern Federal Reserve and dozens of other agencies and programs.
The roster of major American universities, on the other hand, is largely unchanged. 
The top universities often considered the youngest - the University of Chicago and Stanford - started in the 1890s. Even colleges with the word "new" in their name don't quite quality. The New College of Florida opened in 1960, making it older than the first Walmart store. The New School, in New York (1919), has been around longer than universal women's suffrage (1920).
One problem that stems from the relatively unchanged nature of higher education is its geography. The country looks very different from the way it did 100 years ago, but the distribution of our leading universities still has 19th-century echoes.

The country's most selective 236 colleges - colleges that tend to have more resources and much higher graduation rates than others - are especially concentrated in New England and, to a lesser extent, the mid-Atlantic. The Midwest, Southeast and California have fewer such colleges than the Northeast, but still noticeably more than Florida and Texas. The Mountain West has just a handful.
Massachusetts, home to 6.6 million people, has 22 of the country's 236 most selective colleges, as defined by Barron's, based on test scores and grades; Arizona, nearly identical in population to Massachusetts, has not a single one of the 236. Texas has roughly four times as many people as Massachusetts - but only half as many selective colleges. Or consider that Florida has more than five times as many residents as Connecticut but one fewer such college. A complete list of states appears below.
This pattern has real consequences for teenagers. All else equal, students who live near a college are more likely to attend college, research by David Card of the University of California, Berkeley, has found. And students who live near a selective college are more likely to attend a selective college.
Because students who attend a selective college are more likely to graduate than similar students who attend a community college or nonselective four-year college, the geographic dispersion of colleges creates winners and losers. Students who live near selective colleges benefit - and those who do not pay a price. The economy also pays a price, because so many talented teenagers, many of them in smaller metropolitan areas in the Sun Belt and Mountain West, fall far short of their potential.
What might change the situation? Philanthropists in Birmingham, Miami, Oklahoma City, Phoenix or Salt Lake City might one day decide to follow the path of the 19th-century donors who founded Stanford and the University of Chicago. Less grandly, giving information about selective colleges to students who live far from any one of them seems as if it can encourage more to apply, according to a large recent experiment. Perhaps even more important, a rising new group of digitally focused colleges - though still highly uneven in quality - have the potential to make a difference.
I'm willing to predict that higher education will change more over the coming century than it did over the last century.

HEADLINE: The People's Choice for the People's Pension

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Many Americans favor elimination of the cap on taxable Social Security earnings in order to protect retirement benefits, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. 
Social Security, the most transparently self-financed program of the federal government, is not increasing our budget deficit. The most recent trustees' report shows sufficient funds to pay full benefits until 2033. 
No one is making out like a bandit: Social Security beneficiaries who retired in 2010 are expected to get back approximately what they paid in. 
If we wanted to adopt a cautious policy measure that would eliminate the shortfalls predicted 20 years down the road, we could eliminate the cap on earned income subject to Social Security taxes, currently set at $113,700. Such a measure would lead to increased payments by about the top 5.2 percent of wage earners. 
Legislation designed to "scrap the cap" has been introduced in Congress. Senator Mark Begich, Democrat of Alaska, and Representative Ted Deutch, Democrat of Florida, have drafted a law that would require all workers to pay the same overall Social Security tax rate, and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent, and Representative Peter DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon, recently proposed application of the tax to earnings over $250,000 (as well as under $113,700) creating a "doughnut hole" exemption for earners in between in order to win more votes. 
President Obama has voiced support for cap elimination or modification proposals in the past. 
But as Thomas B. Edsall pointed out in a recent commentary, "scrap the cap" has apparently been taken off the table, despite evidence of considerable public support for it. 
Readers doubtful of that public support should read the new National Academy of Social Insurance report, "Strengthening Social Security: What Do Americans Want?," based on an online survey asking respondents whether they favored or opposed 14 specific changes to Social Security. The analysis also draws on findings from focus groups to add qualitative texture to the quantitative results. 
That online survey, an opt-in model, is not based on a probability sample, but its findings echo other representative surveys, including this Quinnipiac University poll from 2011, which found that 56 percent of Americans favored raising the cap on taxable Social Security income.
Readers mystified by the yawning gulf between public opinion and current political discussion might benefit from the background provided in Eric Laursen's magisterial history, "The People's Pension: The Struggle to Defend Social Security Since Reagan." The book offers more than 800 pages of fascinating if gory details about the lobbying efforts and misinformation campaigns aimed at bringing the program down. 
It also reports on a series of surveys going back to 1977 in which most respondents said they would be willing to pay higher payroll taxes if that would shore Social Security up for the future. 
Mr. Laursen effectively decodes much of the economic jargon that has obscured public understanding of these issues, and continues to blog regularly on this topic.
Readers feeling demoralized by the history of class warfare over social insurance might be cheered by two of the short videos recently entered in an online contest sponsored by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation on the theme of "I'm Ready" to fix the national debt. 
In one entry, "Being Honest, Tough Choices," a serious young man uses his webcam to explain in simple, direct terms why he supports Social Security and deplores the rhetoric of "makers versus takers, young versus old." 
Another entry, originally titled "Scrap the Cap" but currently labeled "Movin' In, Kids," has outpaced all others to date in terms of both viewings and ratings. It features some lovable oldsters in a hilarious rap performance warning their son that if their Social Security benefits are cut he better pull out the sofa bed and put out some fresh towels because they will be living together from now on. 
Their song and dance goes on to explain why scrapping the cap would be better for everyone concerned.

HEADLINE: 'Kissinger Cables' Offer Window Into Indian Politics of the 1970s

BYLINE: NEHA THIRANI BAGRI


HIGHLIGHT: India may have conducted its first nuclear test to counter an economic slowdown and other revelations. 

 BODY:
The "Kissinger Cables," a collection of U.S. diplomatic cables released on Monday by WikiLeaks, contain some fascinating revelations about the political scenario in India in the 1970s. Here are the five great insights about India in the WikiLeaks release:
 India's first nuclear test was possibly motivated by political considerations: 
According to this cable, sent from New Delhi to the Department of State, India's first nuclear test on May 18, 1974, was motivated by domestic politics. The cable says that the nuclear test had been done at a time when the Indian government was tackling an economic slowdown, increasing discontent and rising political unrest.
"We are inclined to believe that this general domestic gloom and uncertainty weighed significantly in the balance of India's nuclear decision," reads the cable sent on the date of the nuclear test. "The need for a psychological boost, the hope of recreated atmosphere of exhilaration and nationalism that swept the country after 1971 - contrary to our earlier expectation - may have tipped the scales."
The cable adds that the U.S. Embassy was not aware of any recent military pressure on the Indian government, and that the decision to demonstrate nuclear capability may also have been driven by a need to regain its position in international politics, where India "has felt it had been relegated to the sidelines with its significance ignored and its potential role downplayed."
 Rajiv Gandhi might have acted as the middleman for a Swedish airplane manufacturer: 
During his stint as an Indian Airlines pilot, Rajiv Gandhi might have acted as a middleman for the Swedish company Saab-Scania, which was trying to persuade the Indian Air Force to buy its Viggen fighter aircraft. This cable, dated Oct. 21, 1975, says that a Swedish Embassy official had informed the U.S. Embassy that the "main Indian negotiator" for Saab-Scania is Rajiv Gandhi while the French company Dassault's chief negotiator was the son-in-law of the then Indian air marshal, Om Prakash Mehra. The cable added that Indira Gandhi did not want to purchase the British Jaguar because of "her prejudices against the British." The Swedish diplomat "expressed irritation at the way Mrs. Gandhi is personally dominating negotiations, without involvement of Indian Air Force officers."
"The Swedes here have also made it quite clear they understand the importance of family influences in the final decision in the fighter sweepstakes," said another cable, dated Feb. 6, 1976. "Offhand we would have thought a transport pilot not the best expert to rely upon in evaluating a fighter plane, but then we are speaking of a transport pilot who has another and perhaps more relevant qualification."
 In 1974 India returned 195 prisoners of war to Pakistan, originally wanted by Bangladesh for war crimes trials: 
This cable sent from Islamabad on May 17, 1974, reveals that after the Bangladesh-India-Pakistan agreement signed on April 9, 1974, India returned the last Pakistani prisoners of war from India, including 195 prisoners originally wanted by Bangladesh for war crimes trials. "Bhutto and Minstate Aziz Ahmed have hailed the April 9 agreement as a major move toward a durable peace with India, but the continuing drumfire of anti-India comment in the media reflects the strong emotional suspicion of India still prevalent here," the cable reads. The cable adds that even in the top leadership in the Pakistani government, there is "exasperation" over what they perceived as India's continuous efforts to hamper Pakistan from obtaining military supplies. While the U.S. diplomat foretold a thawing of relations between the two countries, he said "continuing mutual suspicion" would hinder diplomatic efforts.
Indira Gandhi said she was proud that she "resisted pressures to destroy Pakistan in 1971."
In an analysis of India-Pakistan relations after the 1971 war, a cable sent from the U.S. Department of State says that Indira Gandhi felt that she showed restraint during the war. "Mrs. Gandhi was proud, and we believe sincere, in explaining she resisted pressures to destroy Pakistan in 1971," reads this cable, dated March 1, 1974. "We believe that she wants détente on the subcontinent and she feels she made concessions at Simla to achieve this. She also insists - plausibly we think - that further disintegration of Pakistan would not be in India's interest." The cable says that while Pakistan's recognition of Bangladesh improves the short-term prospects for better India-Pakistan relations, there is continued suspicion on both sides. The document argues that while India feels that Pakistan must "adjust to Indian power and influence" there is little likelihood of that happening in the near future.
 The Indian takeover of Sikkim in 1973 might have been intended to send a message to Nepal and Bhutan: 
This cable sent on April 25, 1973, from New Delhi the U.S. ambassador relays the impressions and opinions of the then Times of India correspondent Sivdas Banerjee. He says that Mr. Banerjee had received his information from a senior West Bengal Congress minister who had been briefed by a high-level official from the Ministry of External Affairs. "There was an important and deliberate message to Nepal and Bhutan in prompt Indian action in Sikkim," reads the cable.
The cable adds that according to Mr. Banerjee's source in the Ministry of External Affairs, Nepal and Bhutan had been reluctant to cooperate with India on defense matters and "Nepal's position in particular had irked Mrs. Gandhi during her recent visit there and she was sending direct message to King Birendra."

HEADLINE: Washington Reacts to Thatcher's Death

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: Margaret Thatcher offered inspiration to the American right and served as a role model to female leaders. 

 BODY:
Americans, especially those on the right, revered Margaret Thatcher, the three-term prime minister of Britain who died Monday at age 87, as a key partner of President Ronald Reagan in the fight against communism.
At a time when Americans' attention has been focused on domestic matters, with United States' role in the world has been a subject of debate as operations in Afghanistan and Iraq wind down, leaders noted Ms. Thatcher's influence on American foreign policy - though did not use it to draw conclusions about today's questions.
President Obama on Monday called her "an example to our daughters that there is no glass ceiling that can't be shattered." 
He continued, in a statement, "And as an unapologetic supporter of our trans-Atlantic alliance, she knew that with strength and resolve we could win the cold war and extend freedom's promise." 
And Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, said in a statement, "A great ally and admirer of the United States and a trusted partner of Ronald Reagan during some of the most challenging days of the cold war, Margaret Thatcher never hesitated to remind Americans of their own obligations to the cause of freedom and of the need for political courage and confidence in the face of long odds."
For women on both sides of the aisle, Mrs. Thatcher, one of the strongest female leaders in Western history, was a source of inspiration. Gov. Nikki Haley, the Republican governor of South Carolina who has faced her own political trials in recent years, hailed her on Facebook as "independent, strong, loved, and loathed." Ms. Haley added, "We have lost an amazing leader."
And Donna Brazile, a Democratic strategist, found grounds for praise, though they shared little ideology.
RIP #Iron Lady. Margaret Thatcher was tough, decisive & fearless. She was a controversial figure. Ronald Reagan respected her leadership.
- Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile)8 Apr 13
(Though a later, somewhat cryptic message, seemed to draw angry responses in Mrs. Thatcher's defense.)
At a time when Republicans are mostly out of political power, tributes to her included nostalgia for a golden era.
"The greatest peacetime prime minister in British history is dead. Margaret Thatcher, a grocer's daughter, stared down elites, union bosses, and communists to win three consecutive elections, establish conservative principles in Western Europe, and bring down the Iron Curtain," House Speaker John A. Boehner said in a statement. "There was no secret to her values - hard work and personal responsibility - and no nonsense at all in her leadership. She once said, 'Defeat? I do not recognize the meaning of the word.'"
Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, in his trademark Twitter style, also praised her stewardship:
GreatBritain is a greater nation today from MargaretThatcher leadership.she saved the island fr its Socialist economy
&gaveMORALleadership
- ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley)8 Apr 13
For other conservatives, including Representative Steve Stockman, a firebrand freshman congressman from Texas, her passing prompted a call to arms.
The best way to honor Baroness Thatcher is to crush liberalism and sweep it into the dustbin of history. What are you doing this morning?
- Rep. Steve Stockman (@SteveWorks4You)8 Apr 13

HEADLINE: Senate Gives White Its Unanimous Consent for S.E.C.

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The Senate on Monday confirmed Mary Jo White to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, dismissing concerns about her close ties to the Wall Street banks she will now oversee. 

 BODY:
The Senate on Monday confirmed Mary Jo White as head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, dismissing concerns about her close ties to the Wall Street banks she will now oversee.
Ms. White, a former federal prosecutor who spent the last decade defending JPMorgan Chase and other big banks, secured Senate approval by unanimous consent. Ms. White is expected to join the agency in the coming days, replacing Elisse B. Walter, who has led the S.E.C. since the departure of Mary L. Schapiro in December.
 Her arrival at the post comes at a time of transition for the S.E.C. and the public markets it regulates. The agency is under pressure from Congress to complete new rules for Wall Street and take aim at financial fraud. It also most confront the growing world of high-frequency trading, a business that continues to confound the agency, and money market funds, which the S.E.C. is seeking to rein in. 
On Monday, industry groups applauded the Senate's move. "Her long experience and notable accomplishments as an advocate for the public interest will serve her well in her new role as S.E.C. chair, carrying out the agency's vital missions of protecting investors and overseeing our capital markets," Paul Schott Stevens, the chief executive of the Investment Company Institute, a trade group representing money market funds, said in a statement.
The Senate's move on Monday was widely expected. Ms. White won broad support last month from the Senate Banking Committee, which voted 21-to-1 vote in her favor.
Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, cast the lone vote against her, citing her turns through the revolving door that connects government and private practice. Mr. Brown expressed concern that Ms. White, who represented JPMorgan in financial crisis cases and Morgan Stanley's board in vetting a chief executive, could carry conflicts of interest.
"I don't question Mary Jo White's integrity or skill as an attorney," Mr. Brown said at the time. "But I do question Washington's long-held bias toward Wall Street and its inability to find watchdogs outside of the very industry that they are meant to police."
To sidestep potential conflicts, Ms. White will recuse herself for one year from most matters involving former clients. She further vowed "as far as can be foreseen" never to return to Debevoise & Plimpton, the firm where she built a lucrative legal practice.
Ms. White's supporters also point to her long tenure as a prosecutor. Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York called her "tough as nails" during her time as the first woman to serve as United States attorney in Manhattan.
As a federal prosecutor in New York for more than a decade, she helped oversee the prosecution of the crime figure John Gotti and directed the case against those responsible for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. She also supervised the original investigation into Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.
With Wall Street, Ms. White has already signaled a hard line.
"It will be a high priority throughout my tenure to further strengthen the enforcement function of the S.E.C.," she said at her confirmation hearing last month. "It must be fair, but it also must be bold and unrelenting."

HEADLINE: A.I.G. Seeks to Bar Greenberg From Suing U.S. on Its Behalf

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: A.I.G. has formally requested that its former chief executive, Maurice Greenberg, be barred from suing the federal government on the insurer&#8217;s behalf, after the company decided not to join his lawsuit. 

 BODY:
 5:15 p.m. | Updated 
The American International Group already ruled out suing the federal government over its bailout during the financial crisis. Now it is asking a federal judge to stop its former chief executive from suing in its name. 
The insurer has formally demanded that its onetime leader, Maurice R. Greenberg, stop pursuing so-called derivative claims in his $25 billion lawsuit against the government that would allow him to fight on the company's behalf.
"A.I.G.'s directors had every right to decide, in the exercise of their business judgment, that suing the government for its rescue of A.I.G. is not the right thing for A.I.G. to do, and that A.I.G.'s interests are better served by focusing on the future and not joining litigation concerning the past," the insurer said in its filing. "Under well settled Delaware law, Starr cannot usurp the right of A.I.G.'s board to make this business judgment."
A.I.G.'s request, made late Friday in the Court of Federal Claims in Washington, doesn't seek to bar Mr. Greenberg's claims on behalf of himself and other shareholders. The former chief, through his Starr Investment vehicle, has contended that the "onerous" terms of the bailout wrongly cost A.I.G. investors billions of dollars.
But it does note that the company's directors unanimously chose not to join the lawsuit in January, deeming Mr. Greenberg's fight unlikely to succeed. The former A.I.G. chief has contended in court filings that the company was under pressure from its savior, the federal government, not to partner with him in the lawsuit.
The prospect of A.I.G. joining the suit prompted a wave of outrage among politicians and the public, leading some lawmakers to excoriate the insurer as "the poster company for corporate ingratitude and chutzpah."
For its part, the federal government supported A.I.G.'s request in a separate filing, as well as sought the dismissal of Mr. Greenberg's lawsuit in its entirety.
A lawyer for Mr. Greenberg, Robert J. Dwyer, said in a statement:
"A.I.G.'s motion to dismiss, filed Friday in the Court of Federal Claims, only repeats the position taken by the A.I.G. board in January when it declined to take over and tried to stop Starr from pursuing derivative claims on behalf of the company. Starr intends to oppose that motion in a filing on April 26. In any event, A.I.G.'s motion does not affect the vitality of the direct claims that Starr is pursuing in that action on behalf of a class of A.I.G. shareholders."

HEADLINE: Guest Post: Hungary, The Public Relations Offensive

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A frantic defense. 

 BODY:
This is another guest post from my Princeton colleague Kim Lane Scheppele. The post is after the jump. Before I go there, however, a word about Ms. Scheppele and this blog, and why I stand behind her work.
Obviously I am an expert neither in law nor on Hungary - which is why Ms. Scheppele is writing these posts, not me! I do, however, know what serious inquiry looks like. Ms. Scheppele and colleagues have kept me apprised of their work and how they reach their conclusions, and I've looked at supporting material. This is the real thing - while the often-scurrilous broadsides aimed at my colleague aren't. 
And with that, let me turn over the space.
The Public Relations Offensive 
Kim Lane Scheppele
Princeton University
8 April 2013
The other day, I received a letter in my inbox, attempting to set me straight. He also sent along for my edification the letter that Hungarian Foreign Minister János Martonyi penned to Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Member States of the European Union. 
I'm sure I'm not alone. The Fidesz government of Hungary is on a flat-out PR blitz, trying desperately to gain sympathy as international opinion solidifies against them. Because all of these communications repeat more or less the same talking points and are blanketing inboxes, editorial pages and diplomatic meetings across Europe and North America, I'll respond to the Fidesz public relations offensive here by explaining what their government's laws actually say. Fidesz officials are hiding behind Hungarian, which is a small and difficult (yet beautiful) language, so that outsiders are at a disadvantage in responding to their assertions of "fact." 
Unfortunately for them, however, I've lived in Hungary for years, worked in the Hungarian court system, studied Hungarian law for decades and can find my way around Hungarian legalese. That is why they take me seriously enough to attack. Since I started writing about Hungary, I have received mountains of hate mail, been ambushed by non-academic criticism in academic settings and gotten death threats to the point where I need security on my trips back to Budapest. But I'm not taking it personally. I just happen to stand in the way of what Fidesz wants. They are ruthless and relentless - but not stupid. 
Paul Krugman, who graciously allows me to post on his blog, knows precisely what I'm up to. He has seen the proof of what I say and knows that I have fact-checked all of my posts on every particular. I live, as he does, in the "reality based community" (as we say here in the US), where a commitment to detailed evidence informed by academic expertise counts for a lot. Paul's economic models have correctly predicted the ups and downs of the current financial crisis, and my legal analysis - which predicted from the start that Fidesz was bent on centralizing power based on the laws it was passing - has also been confirmed by events. 
By contrast, as you will see, Fidesz spokespeople and government officials are engaged in a different enterprise. They say things that are technically accurate but misleading. In this post, I will expose what they are doing in their new public relations offensive. 
To recap for those just entering the story: Hungary is in trouble with its critics right now because of the new and troubling constitutional Fourth Amendment that just went into effect, adding to three years of other troubling legal developments. I've written about the Fourth Amendment before, and since that time, many governments and human rights groups have expressed serious concern about different aspects of the Fourth Amendment. I've also testified before the Helsinki Commission, a joint committee of the Congress in Washington, which recently had a hearing that raised questions about whether Hungary is still on a democratic path. You can see my testimony here. 
Why is Fidesz ramping up such a strong defense now? An increasing number of members of both the European Parliament and the European Commission have called for the most extreme sanctions now that the Fourth Amendment to the new Hungarian constitution has added to the litany of other complaints that Europe has had against Hungary. The European Parliament has Hungary on its agenda for its plenary session on Wednesday, 17 April. The LIBE (Civil Liberties) Committee of the European Parliament has prepared four (soon to be five) very critical working documents on the Hungarian situation that can be found . Those documents will form the basis of the European debate and have been signed off on by all parties of the European Parliament, including the European People's Party, the party fraction that includes Fidesz. They add to the many critical reports prepared by the expert Venice Commission of the Council of Europe. 
No wonder Hungary has been has been trying to hit back - hard. 
So what does Fidesz say in its defense? 
Fidesz spokespeople argue that they have a democratic mandate to do what they are doing and therefore that the outside world should leave them alone. The young Hungarian MP, Gergely Gulyás, insists in his letter to me that the constitutional drafting process of 2010-2011 was open to public input and that the "constitutional drafting committee" sought advice from civil society and opposition parties. Like many statements in the Fidesz PR blitz, this is true as far as it goes, but it is misleading. 
Mr. Gulyás does not mention something that is important to know: the constitutional drafting process in 2010-2011 consisted of two disconnected stages, one inconsequential public stage and one consequential secret stage. In stage one, the constitutional committee of the Parliament had open meetings, sought the opinions of civil society and produced a list of principles that the constitution was supposed to follow. The principles that came out of that parliamentary committee were approved by the Fidesz parliamentary bloc in the Parliament on 7 March 2011. 
In stage two, a parliamentary resolution passed on 7 March 2011 (carried by the votes of the Fidesz parliamentary bloc), gave MPs exactly one week to propose complete draft constitutions, which were due 14 March 2011. But the resolution said that a proposed constitution could be offered "with or without" taking the draft principles into account. In short, the first participatory stage of the constitutional drafting process was entirely disconnected from the second secret stage. In the end, no one ever publicly checked the Fidesz constitutional draft against the basic principles that allegedly had public input, the public input that Mr. Gulyás relies on for his claim that the constitutional drafting process was open to public engagement.
Stage two of the constitutional drafting process was entirely secret. Even now, people outside the Party do not know who actually wrote the constitution. Its lead author, József Szájer, claims to have written much of it himself on his iPad. While some Party members have also claimed credit, there is no official record of just who was in on the process, who was consulted, whose opinions were engaged. All of that was, and remains, a secret. The Fidesz constitution was unveiled as a completed document on 14 March 2011. And while there were some fine-tuning amendments added as the constitution hurtled to passage with the votes of only the Fidesz parliamentary bloc, the basic structure remained intact. 
Mr. Gulyás insists that the Hungarian public was consulted about this new constitution because "a questionnaire was sent to each citizen in Hungary about some of the national issues that were undecided at that point." Also literally true - and misleading. 
 In late February and early March 2011, the Fidesz government sent out a "social consultation" to all Hungarian voters, a questionnaire consisting of twelve questions that were to inform the constitutional drafting process. I've translated the questions here so you can see that none of them addressed central issues of constitutional design. 
Did this social consultation affect the constitutional process? There is no way it could have done so. The questionnaires were sent out before the constitutional draft appeared - but no responses were collected in time to have influenced that draft. Instead, the questionnaires were being returned before, during and after the short one-month window when the constitution was on display before being adopted. The social consultation therefore provided neither input into the process nor a ratification of the result. In fact, the government still has not made the results of the questionnaire public despite the fact that Mr. Gulyás claims that nearly 1 million Hungarians returned it. So it is impossible to know whether the constitution has anything in common with the social consultation's results, even on the rather odd collection of topics that the questionnaires probed. 
Social consultations are often used by Fidesz to claim that it has a democratic mandate. The Party has repeatedly sent out questionnaires over the last three years to gauge public sentiment. But it never publishes the results. We do know that the questionnaires promise anonymity and yet each embeds a QR barcode that, when scanned with an ordinary cell phone, reveals the respondent's name and address. After the independent ombudsman for data protection exposed the QR code, his position was terminated before the end of his legal mandate and his office was transferred into the government, where it no longer has structural independence. The EU now has an infringement action before the European Court of Justice on the independence of the data protection officer. Critics within Hungary believe that the government has been using the social consultation process to determine who is with them and who is against them - but of course, that is impossible to prove from the outside of a very closed process. 
Mr. Gulyás and other Fidesz spokespeople constantly say that Fidesz has a democratic "mandate." It's true that Fidesz won the free and fair election of 2010 with 52.7% of the popular (party-list) vote. But Fidesz rests its argument about having a mandate, especially when speaking to outsiders, on a mistaken claim that the party promised during its election campaign to change the constitution, a promise they say was ratified by the election. Mr. Gulyás claims in his letter that "[p]rior to the elections [Prime Minister] Viktor Orbán repeatedly said, on public television and various public forums, that Hungary needs a new, permanent constitution." That statement may be true as is stands, but it certainly is misleading. In his 20+ years on the Hungarian political scene before the 2010 election, Mr. Orbán may well have said on numerous occasions a new constitution would be a good idea. Fidesz certainly participated in the constitutional drafting process of 1995-1996, to which I was an expert advisor. But Mr. Orbán did not call for a new constitution during the 2010 election campaign, as Mr Gulyás implies. 
Does Fidesz still have the public support to qualify as a "mandate"? Even though Fidesz's popularity picked up a little in the last few weeks after the government promised to force down utility rates, still only one quarter of Hungarian voters would vote for them again. As you can see below, Fidesz's bad poll numbers were confirmed again when the online economic news portal Portfolio.hu last week published data averaged across all three of the major Hungarian polling firms. The results confirm that almost half of those who said they voted for Fidesz at the time of the election (April 2010) would not vote for the party now (April 2013).
Of course, the tragedy of Hungary's political system is that none of the parties are popular. Routinely close to half of the public says that there is no party on offer that they would vote for. So Fidesz retains the dubious distinction of being the most popular party in a political system where the majority of the public doesn't like any of them. But that's hardly much to cheer about. 
Because of strong international criticism, Fidesz officials' public relations blitz routinely includes a defense of what they have done to Hungary's churches, since hundreds of churches lost their official status through a law that went into effect on 1 January 2012. Now every church that seeks official recognition has to be approved from scratch by a special two-thirds vote of the Parliament. If a church can't get that, it is confined to the legal category of a civil association without tax exempt status, assuming that the church can make it through the onerous re-registration process. The Constitutional Court struck this system of church registration twice - once on procedural grounds in December 2011 (in Decision 164/2011 (XII. 20)) and again on substantive grounds in February 2013 (in Decision 6/2013 (III. 1)). But the Fourth Amendment inserts the same unconstitutional system back into the constitution again. 
Fidesz defends church registration by claiming that many of those now-deregistered churches were fraudulent. But Mr. Martonyi proclaimed to the European foreign ministers that "the exercise of religion and confession of faith is [sic] not restricted by law." 
David Baer of Texas Lutheran University has studied in detail what happened to these legally demoted churches, and his results strongly challenge Mr. Martonyi's statement. The Catholic Church may have abolished limbo for its faithful, but the Hungarian government restored it in the form of a legal insecurity that has gripped many legitimate churches for nearly 16 months. The legal changes have forced a number of them into moving, closing or agreeing to requirements that violate their faith by making them adopt specific internal structures of governance that are contrary to their beliefs. 
Mr. Martonyi, however, assured his fellow European foreign ministers that the Fourth Amendment adds procedural guarantees to the church registration process, explaining that "an individual review of such decision can be sought before the Constitutional Court." But a closer look reveals that this review is actually a trick. 
How does this trick work? The Fourth Amendment provides (in Article 4) that "The provisions of cardinal Acts concerning the recognition of Churches may be the subject of a constitutional complaint." Translated from legal language to ordinary language, that means that only laws can be challenged before the Constitutional Court only by those parties who are directly affected, who are the only ones who can bring a constitutional complaint. 
But when a church applies to be recognized by the Parliament, the law is only modified if a church wins recognition. In such cases, the law is amended to add the name of the church to the list of recognized churches, which are all explicitly named. But if a church is rejected by the Parliament, the rejection comes in the form of a parliamentary "order" (határozat) and not an amendment to the "law" (törvény). And orders of the Parliament cannot be challenged before the Constitutional Court. So if a church is successfully added to the list of official churches, it has a remedy at the Constitutional Court when it doesn't need one. But if a church is turned down and would benefit from judicial review, the appeal to the Court is barred. It's a trick that makes it appear that the government has provided an avenue of legal redress to a church that has lost official recognition. But it doesn't. 
As a result, the Fourth Amendment perpetuates an unconstitutional situation because the Parliament can determine the fate of any church with no rules, evidentiary standards, or appeal when there is a rejection. The amendment simply overrules the Constitutional Court's decision of a few weeks ago because it does not provide a real remedy to the problem identified by the Court - that there were no meaningful standards of procedural fairness in the church registration process. 
Mr. Gulyás and Mr. Martonyi defend other aspects of the new Fourth Amendment as part of a common chorus of responses from other Fidesz loyalists. Mr. Gulyás claims that the Hungarian Constitutional Court "specifically mandated" that the Parliament pass this the Fourth Amendment to fix an unconstitutional situation. Mr. Martonyi says that the Fourth Amendment's very purpose is "to implement" a decision of the Constitutional Court. 
It is true that the Court annulled on purely formal grounds a number of purported constitutional amendments in its decision on the Transitional Provisions in December 2012 (45/2012 (XII.28)) because permanent changes were made not in the constitution itself but only to a constitutional annex. But the Court did not ask that the constitution be amended again to include the same provisions that were struck. 
Mr. Gulyás asserts that failing to reenact the unconstitutional constitutional amendments would have been a problem because "Parliament had a constitutional responsibility to re-regulate these matters, otherwise an ex lex situation would have created complete legal uncertainty."
It's a touching concern. But again misleading. Mr. Gulyás fails to mention that almost all of the unconstitutional provisions struck down in the Transitional Provisions were duplicated in existing cardinal laws, so the nullification of the constitutional amendments changed very little on the ground and certainly did not cause legal insecurity. If the Parliament were deeply worried about legal uncertainty, perhaps it should not have annulled overnight more than 20 years of constitutional case law through the Fourth Amendment, something that really does create legal uncertainty. 
Since the new constitution went into effect, Constitutional Court did declare a number of other laws unconstitutional as substantively inconsistent with the principles of the new constitution, including two of the now-nullified former constitutional amendments. But, far from implementing these Constitutional Court decisions, the Fourth Amendment simply overrode them by inserting the unconstitutional laws directly into the constitution without attempting to fix them. It's true, as Mr. Martonyi says, that the government refrained from reintroducing into the constitution a requirement that each voter register anew before each election, after that requirement was declared unconstitutional. He fails to mention to the foreign ministers of Europe, however, that the Fourth Amendment did override most of other the important Constitutional Court decisions that went against the government in the last 16 months, a fact which gives a very different impression. 
Here are the substantive Constitutional Court decisions that were explicitly overruled in the Fourth Amendment:
\x81\xAEA Constitutional Court decision declared unconstitutional the law that defined the family as consisting of a heterosexual couple and its descendants (Decision 43/2012 (XII. 20.)). But that decision is now overruled through Art. 1 of the Fourth Amendment. 
\x81\xAEA Constitutional Court decision declared unconstitutional the procedure through which the Parliament votes on the official status of each church (Decision 6/2013 (III. 1).). But that decision is now overruled through Art. 4(1) of the Fourth Amendment. 
\x81\xAEA Constitutional Court decision declared unconstitutional on free speech grounds the restriction of political advertising during election campaigns (Decision 1/2013 (I.7.)). But that decision is now overruled by Art. 5(1) of the Fourth Amendment.
\x81\xAEA Constitutional Court decision declared unconstitutional on grounds of freedom of movement the requirement that students be forced to seek employment only in Hungary after their university degrees have been paid for by the state (Decision 32/2012 (VII. 4.)). But that decision is now overruled by Art. 7 of the Fourth Amendment. 
\x81\xAEA Constitutional Court decision declared unconstitutional the law that creates a system of administrative fines for homelessness because it violates the human dignity of the very poor (Decision 38/2012 (XI. 14.)). But that decision is now overruled through Art. 8 of the Fourth Amendment.
(In case you want to check this, the official English translation of the Fourth Amendment is here, but it can only be fully understood by cross-referencing the constitution here. . Unfortunately, the Court decisions are only in Hungarian.) 
And, of course, the Fourth Amendment indiscriminately nullifies ALL of the decisions that the Constitutional Court made between 1990 and 2011. 
Fidesz officials say that critics have exaggerated the significance of the nullification of all of the previous Constitutional Court case law because, as Mr. Martonyi notes, the prior decisions' "legal effect would remain intact." But one needs to understand the meaning of "legal effect" to see how limited a claim this is. When the Hungarian Constitutional Court declares a law unconstitutional, the law is nullified. That is the legal effect: the law disappears from the law books. Mr. Martonyi's assurance only means that once-nullified laws don't automatically return when the decision that nullified the law is itself nullified. But everything else that gave Hungarian constitutional law its stability through reasoned Court judgments - the guarantees of checked powers, the elaboration of rights, and the relationship between Hungarian constitutional law and European human rights law, for example - has disappeared through the government's nullification of the case law. And that is what critics are objecting to. 
As Mr. Martonyi explains, the legal disappearance of all prior case law "strengthen[s] the freedom and autonomy of the Court" because "[t]he Constitutional Court would hence be free to choose between taking its own previous decisions into consideration, referring to them, or simply ignoring them." Exactly. But this is odd to claim as a benefit. 
I ask my readers who live under a Supreme Court or a Constitutional Court outside of Hungary: How would you feel if your high court were "liberated" in this way - by having all of its prior case law indiscriminately cancelled overnight? As Janis Joplin famously sang in the song "Me and Bobby McGee," "Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose." When the United States adopted its constitution, most of the rights of American citizens were guaranteed in the common law, which was carried over - intact - from the period of colonial rule. In fact, that is typical of constitutional reform around the world: everything else stays the same except those relatively few things that have been explicitly changed. Not so, now, in Hungary. 
Critics say that the Fourth Amendment restricts the power of the Constitutional Court, but the government now insists that the Fourth Amendment expands the Court's power because, for the first time, the constitution permits what the Court has already done - which is to declare constitutional amendments unconstitutional if they are not passed in the appropriate way. Perhaps the government thinks that giving the Constitutional Court a capability it has already used is an expansion of its power, but that is not the usual meaning of the word "expand." The government cannot deny that it is taking away a power that some judges of the Constitutional Court also claimed (in Decision 45/2012 (XII. 28)) - which was to review constitutional amendments for their substantive conflicts with constitutional principles. The Court had not yet used that power, but it was clear that support was gathering within the Court to do so. Removing from the Court the ability to review the content of constitutional amendments simply means that there is no barrier to the government inserting completely contradictory provisions into the text or overruling any Court decision the government doesn't like, both of which the government has already done with the Fourth Amendment. 
 The idea of an unconstitutional constitutional amendment may sound odd. In countries like the US and others where the constitutional amendment process is long and arduous with many checks along the way, there may not be a need for a high court to be able to review amendments. But when the constitution is amended nearly every week and the government is routinely using its supermajority to put controversial laws beyond any check, some power should examine what the government does or else the government simply bursts the bounds of the rule of law. If the Court is not given this power, there must be some other check somewhere in the system - for example, an upper chamber of the Parliament, or an independently elected president, or parliamentary procedure that guarantees that the majority must address minority concerns, or a popular ratification of constitutional amendments. But, in Hungary, none of these options are present. Hungary has a unicameral parliamentary system with no other powerful checks. That is why the Court should have that power or else the constitutional system would - and now has - become a farce. 
Mr. Gulyás claims that the Constitutional Court asked to have its power limited in a crucial way, by removing its "actio popularis" jurisdiction that allowed anyone to challenge a law before the Court. True, but misleading. Since the 1990s, constitutional judges have been complaining about the thousands of vague and misdirected complaints they receive through actio popularis petitions. But the Court's judges (before those added by this government) would never have agreed to have most of their jurisdiction gutted, which has been the overall effect of the new system. (For more detail, see my . ) While the open petition system was not the only way that the Court could have been empowered to review important laws, eliminating it without a good substitution has created holes in the Court's oversight of the constitutional order. 
But we should all be careful what we wish for. This month, the ninth judge elected with the Fidesz two-thirds supermajority is joining the 15-member Constitutional Court. (He is one of the few judges to get a multi-party vote since the far-right Jobbik party supported him, too.) The eighth joined last month. Now that the government is practically guaranteed a friendly majority, perhaps Fidesz will offer to restore some of the Court's powers as a way of showing how flexible they are. A Court that has nine judges who owe their careers to one party and who have been elected for 12-year terms can make it difficult for any non-Fidesz government to govern, even if a new government could be elected against the background of an ever-changing landscape of new electoral barriers that the opposition has to hurdle. Yes, the long terms for constitutional judges mean that the Fidesz judges could (and should) be independent but so far only one of the Fidesz judges has shown serious independence from Fidesz party positions. 
Mr. Gulyás tells me I can't have it both ways - since he claims that I have argued both that no institution can check the powers of this government and also that a future government will be stymied by the ability of these very same institutions to thwart a future government. But that is not what I claim. Fidesz has seized control of all institutions in the Hungarian government through a two-pronged strategy. It has tried to cut the power of institutions it could not yet control - like the Constitutional Court and the central bank. It has beefed up the power of institutions that were in reliable hands - like the National Judicial Office, the Media Board, the Prosecutor's Office, the State Audit Office and the Budget Council. 
As a result, after Fidesz gains control over the personnel of an institution it has previously weakened, then it often "compromises" with critics and strengthens the powers that institution again. The same is true for institutions it needed to capture only for a brief time to accomplish a specific purpose (like replacing 10% of the judiciary at once, including much of the ordinary court leadership). Then it agrees to disperse centralized power. Fidesz can then be very cooperative with its international partners by agreeing either to limit the powers of an office that it no longer needs to control or to strengthen the apparent independence of an institution that is now safely in its hands. But otherwise, strong powers in reliable hands are just what the government has accomplished. And as long as strong-enough powers are in reliable-enough hands, the Fidesz supermajority can rein in any future opposition government that deviates from the Fidesz path. So the very same institutions that have been domesticated by Fidesz can turn fierce when a party other than Fidesz is in charge. To understand what this government is doing, one must always look both at the party background of the occupants of the offices and at the powers of those offices. Am I the one having it both ways - or it is Fidesz? 
There are many other points to address in this Fidesz public relations blitz, and I have addressed them in detail in many of my other writings and interviews, which you can see . 
Since Mr. Gulyás has called into questions my qualifications and independence, let me explain my background. I lived in Hungary full-time between 1994 and 1998, working as a researcher at the Constitutional Court, where I learned Hungarian constitutional law as it was being made. I was involved in the 1995-1996 constitutional drafting effort, as an expert advisor to the parliamentary committee drafting the text. I have held tenured positions as a law professor, political scientist and sociologist in the United States. My field of expertise is comparative constitutional law, which I have taught for more than 20 years. I am an elected member of the International Academy of Comparative Law. 
Despite Mr. Gulyás's insinuations that I am an agent of some opposition party, I have never accepted money for my research and writing except through a scientific review process or university research funds. My 1990s research on Hungary was funded by two competitive peer-reviewed grants from the American National Science Foundation. I was not then and have never been in the employ of any government institution or political party in Hungary - or for that matter of any other government, including my own. All of my publications, including blog posts, have been fact-checked down to the ground and I am happy to provide supporting documentation for all of the statements I have made. While I have always talked to representatives from all parts of the political spectrum in Hungary to understand their arguments, I have also always insisted on my independence from any partisan organization. 
Fidesz tries to turn all of its critics into agents for the "other side." But that is a public relations trick. When a party brings all institutions of government under its control and attacks the independent judiciary, we are no longer in the world of normal party politics. Instead, we are in the world where Hungary's very existence as a state under the rule of law is in question. That is why I have gotten involved. Once Hungarians regain their ability to live in a fully democratic society with depoliticized courts, I plan to go back to the quiet world of scholarship from which I came.

HEADLINE: Did Thatcher Turn Britain Around?

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Harsh policies in 1979, good results in 1997 &#8212; causation? 

 BODY:
There will presumably be a lot of commentary about Margaret Thatcher over the next few days, although probably nothing like the "Reagasm" of 2004. And there will in particular be many assertions that Thatcher turned around a moribund British economy. So, is this right? 
OK, I don't want to do a slash-and-burn here - the question mark in the title of this post is for real. But I think it is interesting to look at what actually happened at a macro level.
Now, there is no question that Britain did turn around. In the 1970s it was a country with huge economic problems; today, despite the failure of austerity policies, it's in a much stronger position. There are various ways you could show this; I find it useful to compare Britain with its love-hate-relationship neighbor France. So, here's per capita GDP in Britain relative to France:
A long decline ended and turned into a revival.
And here's unemployment in the two countries:
Britain had terrible unemployment for a while, but has done pretty well since (France has done better than the numbers suggest, for technical reasons, but still).
So, a real turnaround. Was it the Iron Lady wot did it?
Well, there's a bit of a problem: Thatcher came to power in 1979, and imposed a radical change in policy almost immediately. But the big improvement in British performance doesn't really show in the data until the mid-1990s. Does she get credit for a reward so long delayed?
This is, by the way, somewhat like a similar issue in America: right-wingers were eager to give Ronald Reagan credit for the productivity boom of the Clinton years, which also didn't start until around 1995; if Reagan could get credit for events that were 14 years or more after his 1981 tax cut, shouldn't Richard Nixon be given credit for anything good that happened in the Reagan years?
Anyway, I guess there is a case that the Thatcher changes in taxes, labor regulation, etc. created a more flexible economy, which made the good years under Blair possible. But it's an awfully long lag. And there's another possibility. For what happened in the 90s that arguably redounded very much to Britain's benefit? Why, the rise of fancy finance - which was a huge boon to the country that contains the City.
I'm sure that British economists will be hashing this stuff over in the days ahead. For now, consider this a caution: if anyone tells you that Thatcher saved the British economy, you should ask why the results of that salvation took so very long to materialize.

HEADLINE: The Fine Line Between Political Intelligence and Insider Trading

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: The imprecise rules governing insider trading are an ineffective means to regulate how political intelligence firms operate, the author writes. 

 BODY:
Life in Washington is all about information - who will support or oppose an initiative, how will an agency address an issue in its rules, and when will a decision be announced. The pervasive role of the government in the economy makes that information particularly valuable to investors. And that can lead some to get a jump on the market if they learn about changes in policy before others.
"Well-timed" trading before a public disclosure of material information has all the hallmarks of insider trading. The problem is that the imprecise rules governing insider trading are an ineffective means to regulate how political intelligence firms gather, analyze and selectively disseminate such information to their clients. 
Political intelligence has become a hot topic these days because of its potential to move markets. Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported about an investment firm in Washington that correctly predicted a decision by the government about reimbursement of Medicare costs; that information led to a jump of more than 6 percent in the shares of health insurers before the close of trading.
While that certainly looks questionable, trying to regulate firms that seek government information is difficult because of the lack of a definition of what constitutes "political intelligence" that would distinguish it from the ordinary analysis of governmental operations. A report issued by the Government Accountability Office points out just how hard it would be to try to adopt workable rules for the industry whose sole purpose is to gather such information. 
Congress mandated the report as part of the Stock Act - for Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge - passed last year in response to reports that some legislators were reaping outsize gains on their investments. The law made it clear that Congress and its staff members must obey laws that prohibit insider trading, something that wasn't clear before last year. A Senate proposal to mandate disclosure by political intelligence firms was scuttled in favor of the Government Accountability Office report, a classic means of burying an issue.
In conducting interviews with firms dealing in government information, the Government Accountability Office found that "the prevalence of the sale of political intelligence is not known and is therefore difficult to quantify," and that it can be "especially difficult to make a determination that a sale of nonpublic information has occurred."
In addition to the difficulty in identifying what constitutes political intelligence, the report discusses the many hurdles that the Securities and Exchange Commission would face if it wanted to pursue an insider trading case based on information disclosed by a political intelligence firm to its clients (particularly if the firm itself does not trade directly on the information).
Political intelligence is a mix of public information and tidbits gleaned from interactions with government officials. Particular information may be incorporated into a broader discussion of political developments that is sold to a number of clients - not all of whom are engaged in stock market investing. The analysis often involves opinions about where the government might be leaning on a particular issue, so it might be hard for the government to determine what is nonpublic information and what is just an opinion about future government conduct.
The product sold as political intelligence deals with broad factors that affect an industry or segment of the economy, and rarely would the focus be on a specific company because legislation and administrative rules usually do not reach that level of detail. That makes the information quite different from what is usually seen in insider trading cases, which mostly involve nonpublic data about an individual company.
A crucial element in any insider trading case is proving the information received was both material and confidential. When dealing with political intelligence, the S.E.C.'s ability to prove each could be problematic.
So what constitutes "material" information? Broadly, it is data that a reasonable investor would consider important in deciding whether to act. The more general the information, the less likely it can be considered material. 
Political intelligence may not meet the standard of "material" information when it is about broad trends in government policy. For instance, whether the Federal Reserve will continue to keep interest rates low would be difficult to link to a particular company's prospects. And when confidential information is mixed with publicly available data, it becomes even harder to prove a political intelligence report met the required materiality standard.
A greater challenge would be showing that the information was confidential. Washington is rife with leaks, some of which are even planned as a means of sending up a so-called trial balloon to gauge public reaction to a new policy. So it might be difficult to show where the information came from or that a government official disclosed it in breach of a fiduciary duty in order to aid insider trading by the recipient.
In fact, it is questionable whether insider trading laws would even apply to the bulk of the analysis provided by political intelligence firms. In Dirks v. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Supreme Court noted that the role "analysts in general can play in revealing information that corporations may have reason to withhold from the public is an important one." The same could be said about the disclosure of information about the government when its policies have a much greater impact on the public than any individual company.
Thus, the insider trading laws are a weak means of policing firms that specialize in gathering government information. The prohibition on insider trading is not crafted to deal with cases in which information about a broad segment of the economy could influence a decision about what type of investment to make.
Senator Charles E. Grassleysaid that he planned to introduce legislation to require political intelligence firms to register and disclose their contacts with government officials, highlighting the report about Medicare reimbursement as an example of the need for greater regulation. Increased disclosure by political intelligence firms might provide a number of benefits, if Congress can come up with a workable definition of what constitutes political intelligence that would not impact how journalists and other analysts scrutinize government policy. 
The insider trading prohibition, however, would be ill suited as a means to police how these firms operate because of the many hurdles to proving a violation.

HEADLINE: Alcoa Reports Profit Up 58%, Exceeding Analysts' Forecast

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Alcoa kicked off the earnings season on Monday by reporting a larger first-quarter profit than analysts had expected, helped by strong demand for aluminum used to make airplanes and automobiles. 
The company still predicts that demand for aluminum will grow 7 percent in 2013, with gains cutting across many industries.
Alcoa is the first company in the Dow Jones industrial average to report first-quarter results. Because its products wind up in so many things, including cars, buildings and soda cans, investors study Alcoa's results for hints about earnings at companies in other industries.
Alcoa reported that its net income rose 58 percent in the first quarter, to $149 million, or 13 cents a share, compared with $94 million, or 9 cents a share, a year ago.
Excluding one-time items, the company said it earned 11 cents a share, beating analysts' forecast of 8 cents a share, according to FactSet.
Revenue fell 3 percent, to $5.83 billion, from $6.01 billion a year ago, and was below the $5.91 billion that analysts had predicted. Alcoa blamed lower aluminum prices and curtailed production in its European primary metals business.
Over the last decade, Alcoa has shifted more of its business to the production of parts for industry and away from mining and refining. It is benefiting as airplanes and autos get lighter to improve fuel efficiency by using more aluminum parts.
Airlines have been ordering new planes to reduce spending on fuel, the largest cost for many of them. That trend should continue for several years, making aerospace a growing aluminum market, Klaus Kleinfeld, Alcoa's chairman and chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts.
Auto sales are booming, too, as customers who delayed buying in the recession trade in their old vehicles. In March, sales hit 1.45 million vehicles, the highest total since August 2007, according to Autodata.
Alcoa predicts that government fuel standards and customer demand for better mileage will lead carmakers to use more lighter materials like aluminum. Some drivers contend heavy vehicles are safer in a crash, but Mr. Kleinfeld argued that lighter cars could brake to a stop faster, potentially avoiding accidents.
Sales of aluminum for nonresidential construction is finally recovering in North America and will grow much faster in China, Mr. Kleinfeld said.
Alcoa, based in Pittsburgh, released its earnings after the markets closed. In after-hours trading, its shares fell 13 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $8.26 after gaining 15 cents, or 1.8 percent, in the regular trading to close at $8.39.

HEADLINE: New Level of Micro Manufacturing

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Under a microscope, four slivers of silicon -- electronic circuits called chiplets -- perform an elaborate, jerky dance as if controlled by a hidden puppet master. Then on command, they all settle with pinpoint accuracy, precisely touching a pattern of circuit wires, each at just the right point of contact.
The technology, on display at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center, or PARC, is part of a new system for making electronics, one that takes advantage of a Xerox invention from the 1970s: the laser printer. 
If perfected, it could lead to desktop manufacturing plants that ''print'' the circuitry for a wide array of electronic devices -- flexible smartphones that won't break when you sit on them; a supple, pressure-sensitive skin for a new breed of robot hands; smart-sensing medical bandages that could capture health data and then be thrown away.
Today's chips are made on large wafers that hold hundreds of fingernail-sized dies, each with the same electronic circuit. The wafers are cut into individual dies and packaged separately, only to be reassembled on printed circuit boards, which may each hold dozens or hundreds of chips.
The PARC researchers have a very different model in mind. With financing from the National Science Foundation and from Darpa, the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, they have designed a laser-printer-like machine that will precisely place tens or even hundreds of thousands of chiplets, each no larger than a grain of sand, on a surface in exactly the right location and in the right orientation.
The chiplets can be both microprocessors and computer memory as well as the other circuits needed to create complete computers. They can also be analog devices known as microelectromechanical systems, or MEMS, that perform tasks like sensing heat, pressure or motion.
The new manufacturing system the PARC researchers envision could be used to build custom computers one at a time, or as part of a 3-D printing system that makes smart objects with computing woven right into them.
The technology is still in the future. The researchers are years from simultaneously placing tens or hundreds of thousands of circuits accurately in a fraction of a second. And they acknowledge that this would be only the first step in designing a commercially viable system.
Still, if the PARC researchers are successful, they will have thrown out 50 years of Silicon Valley conventional wisdom.
A related but simpler technology was pioneered by Alien Technology, a maker of RFID tags in Silicon Valley. Called Fluidic Self Assembly, it is based on suspending small integrated circuits called ''nanoblocks'' in a fluid and then flowing them over a surface where they drop into tiny holes of corresponding shapes.
Both approaches reverse a five-decade long tradition of making computers faster and more powerful by doubling every two years the number of transistors squeezed onto fingernail-sized computer chips.
The emerging printing technology poses a heretical idea: Rather than squeezing more transistors into the same small space, why not smear the transistors across a much larger surface?
Moreover, the research could have tremendous economic consequences -- feeding the emergence of a new digital era in manufacturing, much as laser printing transformed publishing three decades ago.
By replacing the circuit boards now assembled in factories, the technology would vastly compress a supply chain that spans the globe and employs hundreds of thousands of workers.
It is one of a variety of technologies related to 3-D printers, which have captured the public's imagination, raising the specter of homemade manufacturing of everything from tools to guns.
''Digital fabrication will allow individuals to design and produce tangible objects on demand, wherever and whenever they need them,'' Neil Gershenfeld, a physicist who directs the Center for Bits and Atoms at M.I.T., wrote in December in the journal Foreign Affairs.
While there has already been an explosion in 3-D printing of solid and mechanical objects both for prototyping and increasingly for small production runs, PARC's scientists believe that there will also ultimately be an ensemble of manufacturing technologies that seamlessly blend microelectronics with mechanical components.
''You can print mechanical objects, but a lot of things in the world today are more than mechanical,'' said Stephen Hoover, PARC's chief executive. ''A lot of the opportunities we're going to find in the 'Internet of things' are going to be about how to embed intelligence at very low cost in a distributed way into the world.''
The new manufacturing system the PARC researchers envision would allow easier customization. For example, just as today software customizes computers for each purpose, computers in the future could be individually shaped for each system they were added to. Or in the future the computer could just be another part, to be added to the component inventory of a 3-D printing system.
Eugene Chow is an electrical engineer who leads the PARC team that has designed the new technology that they have dubbed ''Xerographic micro-assembly.'' The technology breaks silicon wafers into tens of thousands of chiplets, bottles them as ''ink'' and then ''prints'' them, much as a Xerox laser printer puts toner on paper, he said.
The PARC technology is based on the ability to use computing and an array of electrodes that generate microscopic electrical fields to control the precise placement of tiny electronic circuits -- not just in the correct position, but with the proper orientation as well.
''It's a crazy new revolutionary tool,'' Dr. Chow said.
Already, more than half a dozen different printing techniques, from inkjet to gravure to offset printing, have been used to make electronic circuits -- a business that was estimated at $9.4 billion last year.
But the PARC researchers argue that all of the current commercialized techniques are limited in that they can't achieve the transistor density now available through conventional chip manufacturing. So while it is possible to use printing techniques to make a flexible display screen with hundreds or even thousands, of transistors, it cannot be done with millions or billions of transistors, like today's silicon chips.
The new PARC technology is intended to address that shortcoming and bridge the two worlds by smearing computing power across areas much larger than today's postage stamp-sized chips.
''This is a very different way to think about electronics,'' said Greg Whiting, a senior research scientist at PARC.

HEADLINE: Kerry to Focus on Palestinian Economy as Part of Peace Process

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON and ISABEL KERSHNER

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- Secretary of State John Kerry signaled Monday that he is hoping to use the economic development of Palestinian areas on the West Bank as a means to build support for a new set of Middle East peace negotiations.
''I'm having discussions about those steps that would get at this issue of mistrust,'' Mr. Kerry told reporters after meetings on Monday with Israeli and Palestinian officials. 
One step, he added, is to move on the ''economic front because that can be critical to changing perceptions and realities on the ground, all of which can contribute to forward momentum.''
Mr. Kerry's latest trip here represents a new phase of American involvement in Middle East diplomacy. On both the Israeli and the Palestinian sides, officials said Mr. Kerry's personal engagement appeared at the least to have put the peace process back on the agenda for the first time in years.
After meeting on Sunday night with Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mr. Kerry met on Monday with Salam Fayyad, the Palestinian prime minister, and Shimon Peres, the Israeli president.
Mr. Kerry also attended Israel's annual Holocaust Memorial Day ceremony at Yad Vashem, the memorial for the six million Jews who perished in the Holocaust, which he said he found moving.
On Monday night, Mr. Kerry had a dinner meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and was scheduled to have another session with him on Tuesday morning.
Mr. Kerry has not talked in detail about the idea he has been discussing and has even asked Palestinian officials he consulted not to share it.
But he outlined the tenets of his thinking in a Monday meeting with reporters, stating that the ''festering absence of peace'' was being used by extremist groups around the world to recruit supporters. Without a reinvigorated peace process, he said, the window for a comprehensive peace settlement that would lead to an independent Palestinian state would begin to close.
''One of the reasons for these early interventions is to get right at the issue of mistrust,'' he said, referring to his flurry of meetings.
''I am convinced that we can break that down,'' he said. ''This process should not be rushed, subject to some sort of external time limit or artificial process, because it's too important.''
Mr. Kerry has yet to elaborate on how he would strengthen the economy of the Palestinians. But the basic idea is to make the area more economically viable in the hope of giving the Palestinian leaders more of a stake in a revived peace process and providing Israel with a credible negotiating partner.
A Palestinian official, who asked not to be identified because he was discussing private diplomatic discussions, said the Palestinians had presented a paper to President Obama last month detailing several economic projects that the official said were ''important for building capacity'' for a future Palestinian state.
The proposed projects were mainly in the roughly 60 percent of the West Bank known as Area C, where Israel maintains full security and civilian control under the terms of the Oslo Accords, the 1990s agreements between Israel and the Palestinians. One example of the kind of project the Palestinians have in mind is a tourism development along the northern shore of the Dead Sea, the official said.
Any Palestinian initiatives in Area C, however, have to be coordinated with Israel. And Palestinians and international experts have long argued that limits on Palestinian economic activity there have stymied Palestinian growth.
The Palestinian news agency Ma'an reported that in his meeting with Mr. Abbas, Mr. Kerry said that if the Palestinians returned to the negotiations they would receive several benefits, including the transfer of more land to the control of the Palestinian Authority, enabling construction in Area C.
There was no indication that the Palestinians had dropped their preconditions that Israel must stop settlement construction and agree to release Palestinian prisoners before talks can resume.
Still, the Palestinian official said Mr. Kerry was ''well trusted'' on the Palestinian side. ''He does not want to get engaged in another 20 years of negotiations,'' the official said, adding, ''He made that clear.''
After his one-hour meeting with Mr. Kerry, Mr. Peres said in an interview that all parties agreed there was a need to ''move fast'' and that a return of Kissinger-like shuttle diplomacy was a possibility.
Mr. Peres's job as president is mostly ceremonial. But Mr. Netanyahu has in the past leaned on Mr. Peres's experience as a veteran of Israeli politics and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Mr. Peres said he still maintained his own connections with the Palestinian leadership, with the knowledge of the Israeli government.
''I think the most important point right now is time,'' he said. ''The Middle East today is like a watch without hands.''

HEADLINE: Banks Healthy, Bernanke Says

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said Monday night that the central bank's annual stress tests of major American banks were better able to detect risks in the financial system. He said the tests showed that the banking industry had grown much healthier since the financial crisis. 
Mr. Bernanke, in a speech, noted that this year's tests showed that 18 of the biggest banks had collectively doubled the cushions they hold against losses since the first tests were run in 2009. He said the tests were providing vital information to regulators.
The latest test results were released last month. They showed that all but one of the 18 banks were better prepared to withstand a severe American recession and an upheaval in financial markets. The tests are used to determine whether the banks can increase dividends or repurchase shares.
Mr. Bernanke was speaking to a financial markets conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. In his prepared remarks, he said he viewed the first stress test conducted in 2009, months after the financial crisis struck, as ''one of the critical turning points in the crisis.''
''It provided anxious investors with something they craved: credible information about prospective losses at banks,'' he said.
Mr. Bernanke said that since the financial crisis, in the ensuing years, the Fed had worked to improve the stress tests so they could serve as a resource for banking regulators to monitor and detect threats to the financial system.
The stress tests have been criticized by some banks because the central bank has kept secret the full details of the computer models it is using to evaluate each bank. The Fed has defended this practice. It has argued that it is similar to teachers not giving students specific questions that will appear on a test to guard against students memorizing answers.
''We hear criticism from bankers that our models are a 'black box' which frustrates their efforts to anticipate our supervisory findings,'' Mr. Bernanke said. He said that over time, the banks should better understand the standards the tests are measuring.
In this year's test, the Fed approved dividend payment plans and stock repurchase plans for 14 of the 18 banks outright.

HEADLINE: In Effort to 'Rebalance,' Europe Appears Committed to Austerity Plan

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- Jacob J. Lew, the United States Treasury secretary, urged European officials to adopt more growth-friendly policies on Monday. But there was little indication that the recession-plagued European Union was moving away from the austerity path it has pursued to deal with the debts and imbalances that emerged in the financial crisis of 2008-9.
At the outset of a joint news conference with Mr. Lew, Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, emphasized the difficult climate that both economies faced. 
''We continue to rebalance and rebuild our economic potential to ensure strong, sustainable and inclusive growth and jobs going forward,'' Mr. Van Rompuy said. ''It is a long and difficult process, but one we stick to with determination on both sides of the Atlantic.''
But despite Mr. Van Rompuy's reassuring words, it was clear that deep divisions remain between the American and European approaches to the crisis, which have contributed to the divergent paths the economies of Europe and the United States have followed in its wake.
''Our economic recovery is gathering strength,'' Mr. Lew said. ''The U.S. economy has expanded for 14 consecutive quarters, and although the pace of job creation is not as fast as we would like, the private sector has added jobs for 37 straight months.''
In contrast, the euro zone continues to struggle with shrinking economies and rising unemployment, with Germany, France and Spain all contracting in the fourth quarter of 2012. That has made meeting Europe's goals of reducing fiscal deficits even harder.
The question that Mr. Lew came to Europe to raise is how to strengthen the European economy -- for the Continent's sake, as well as for the global economy's. The United States has an investment in Europe's growth, American officials have said repeatedly, because of the deep financial and trade ties between the countries.
''We have an immense stake in Europe's health and stability,'' Mr. Lew said. ''I was particularly interested in our European partners' plans to strengthen sources of demand at a time of rising unemployment.''
The Obama administration has urged countries with stronger economies, like Germany, to slow their pace of fiscal retrenchment and ease off on demands for tougher cutbacks in hard-hit countries like Greece, Spain and Portugal. In the last few years, such advice has often fallen on deaf ears, given the political constraints in Europe and many officials' belief in budget balance as a prerequisite to growth.
Mr. Van Rompuy mentioned the ''vivid debate'' over ''fiscal policy and the pace of fiscal consolidation'' in his remarks. He pointed out that some countries have been given additional time to meet the euro zone's deficit goals. But Mr. Van Rompuy reaffirmed the Continent's strategy, rather than indicating a change in direction despite the rising unemployment and worse than expected contraction.
''The European economies face a high level of debt, deep structural medium-term challenges and short-term economic headwinds that we need to confront,'' he added. ''There is no room for complacency.''
The trip is Mr. Lew's first to Europe as Treasury secretary. Earlier this year, he visited Beijing in his first trip abroad in the post. Though he worked for a time in the State Department in the Obama administration, Mr. Lew is primarily known as a domestic budget expert.
In contrast, his predecessor, Timothy F. Geithner, was an international finance specialist who had previously worked at the International Monetary Fund and as Treasury under secretary for international affairs. During his tenure, Mr. Geithner repeatedly pressed his counterparts in Europe to ease up on austerity, though without much success.
On Monday, the French government canceled a meeting between Mr. Lew and his counterpart, Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici, with a scandal over a former budget chief's offshore accounts brewing. But late Monday evening, the meeting was rescheduled for Tuesday afternoon in Paris, the Treasury said.
Later on Monday, Mr. Lew also met in Frankfurt with Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank. He is scheduled to travel to Berlin on Tuesday to see Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister.
Earlier on Monday, Mr. Lew met with other European officials, including José Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union.
A Treasury official said they, too, discussed the need for Europe to generate more demand, as well as the situation in Cyprus, a cross-border banking union and a prospective free-trade agreement.

HEADLINE: Japan's Moves to Weaken the Yen Have a Global Effect

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
The Bank of Japan's new antideflation policy made waves throughout the global financial system on Monday, driving down the yen and lifting share prices in Tokyo, but economists said the effect had yet to be fully felt overseas.
The most visible sign of the move by the bank, which is the country's central bank, was the sharp decline of the yen and a 2.8 percent rise in the benchmark Nikkei 225-stock average. The dollar settled at 99.32 yen on Monday in New York, a four-year high. The euro traded at 129 yen, its highest level in more than three years. 
''They're taking a page out of the quantitative easing playbook, multiplied two and a half times what the Fed is doing,'' said Michael H. Strauss, chief investment strategist at Commonfund in Wilton, Conn.
That, he said, created a situation where institutions and individuals both faced pressure to buy stocks, at home and overseas.
The shake-up was touched off on Thursday by Haruhiko Kuroda, the new Bank of Japan governor, who announced a decisive break with his predecessor's policies. He said the bank would nearly double the amount of Japanese currency held by individuals and banks over the next two years as it tries to raise the annual inflation rate to its new 2 percent target.
Mr. Kuroda's plan calls for the central bank to inject nearly 62 trillion yen, or $630 billion, into the economy this year, new money that must find a home. Some of that will undoubtedly end up overseas.
''This is a very big new injection of money into the global system,'' said Thomas Mayer, senior adviser to Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, and overseas bonds and equities will be among the beneficiaries.
United States stocks and bonds, which are already trading at high levels, are one obvious target for investors with yen to spend, he said. Core European countries like Germany, France and Britain are also favored destinations for Japanese capital, as are Australia and New Zealand.
The debt of governments in the developed world is already trading at low yields, Mr. Mayer noted, but as long as the euro zone crisis continues, struggling southern euro countries like Spain, Italy and Portugal may attract rather less investor interest because of concern about political risk.
While the size of the Japanese intervention is perhaps unprecedented relative to the size of the country's economy, the Bank of Japan is in good company. The Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank have all poured in liquidity and worked to hold interest rates down as the global financial sector creaks along year after year. That money is credited with helping to keep government borrowing costs low and to push the Dow Jones industrial average to high levels this month.
A weakening Japanese currency opens a window for international investors to profit on two fronts. With the central bank's main interest rate target near zero, they can borrow the yen cheaply, then lend it abroad.
This ''carry trade'' offers the possibility of higher returns overseas -- and if the yen falls, investors also reap a foreign-exchange gain since they can repay the loan in cheaper yen.
Of course, a rising yen would bring the opposite result, but the magnitude of the central bank's plan could persuade investors that the currency is set to fall further.
Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics in London, estimated that the dollar would continue strengthening to 110 yen this year and to 120 yen next year.
''The Bank of Japan's new policy stance surely does amount to a game changer,'' he noted, ''at least for the currency markets.''
The weakening yen may also be felt by companies operating outside Japan -- like American and German automakers and South Korean device manufacturers, which compete head-to-head with Japanese corporations. Those companies may find themselves under pressure to squeeze profit margins to compete against suddenly flush Japanese competitors.
''Some of these Japanese companies were profitable at 78 yen to the dollar,'' Mr. Strauss said, so the dollar at 100 yen would be a boon for the corporate sector.
It will take time for competitors to Japanese companies to feel the effects, Mr. Mayer said, but he cautioned that there were larger concerns to consider: ''By injecting such a large amount of money into the global financial system, you may end up distorting prices in such a way that it causes distortions in the real economy.''
Mr. Strauss said the biggest effect would be felt in Japan, where an investor could hold a 10-year government bond with a yield of less than 0.4 percent or could take on a little more risk in stocks.
The lesson after the Japanese investment bubble collapsed in 1990 was ''never own equities again,'' he said, but the moment may have arrived where that no longer holds true.
But today's Japanese investors are more cautious than those of a generation ago, he added.
''I don't think they're going to go out and buy Pebble Beach,'' he said, referring to the golf course in California that was acquired by a Japanese business owner in 1990 at a wildly inflated price.

HEADLINE: Senate Talks on Farmworker Program Inch Forward

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- After hitting a snag last week, negotiations in the Senate for an agricultural workers program -- the last piece of a broad overhaul of the nation's immigration laws -- appeared to be coming back from the brink on Monday.
Representatives of farmworkers and growers inched closer to a deal on wages for workers, under pressure from a bipartisan group of senators who want to move forward soon with a broad immigration overhaul. 
Though the overall structure for the agricultural workers program had been set, the deal broke down last week over the issue of wages and the number of visas -- known as H-2A visas -- the program would provide to low-skilled farmworkers.
''The framework has been worked out, but the questions are wage rate and the cap, and both of those things are related to whether farmworkers are paid too much or too little,'' said Giev Kashkooli, a national vice president of the United Farm Workers. ''Growers are currently making the claim that farmworkers make too much money, and we think they're making too little.''
The labor unions say they want to ensure that workers are paid a fair wage, and are concerned that the growers' demand for an unlimited number of workers will make it easier for employers to exploit agricultural workers. The growers, meanwhile, say they, too, want to pay workers a fair wage, but argue that if wages are too high, no one will use the program. If the visa cap is too low, there will not be enough workers and crops will perish.
''If the wage is set too high, growers will be unable to afford it and there will be no jobs because those growers are either going out of business, or they're going offshore where they can meet their labor demands,'' said Kristi Boswell, director of Congressional relations for the American Farm Bureau Federation.
The effort -- which is being spearheaded by Senators Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado; Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California; Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah; and Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida -- would offer agricultural workers an expedited path to earn a green card, which could take as little as three years. (Mr. Bennet and Mr. Rubio are part of a bipartisan group of eight senators who are working on a broad overhaul of the nation's immigration laws.)
Under the program being discussed, farmworkers in the country illegally could earn a green card in three to seven years, providing a path to legal status that is considerably quicker than the 10-year path under consideration by the bipartisan group for the nonagricultural workers already in the country illegally.
The timeline would depend on how many days per year a farmworker was willing to work in the agricultural industry -- more days providing a quicker path to a green card.
First, according to several people with knowledge of the negotiations, all workers who could prove that they had worked a total of 150 days over the prior two years would qualify for a ''blue card'' visa, which would let them live and work here legally, and travel across state lines. Workers would then be eligible for a green card if they worked 150 days annually in three of the next five years, or 100 days annually in five of the next seven years.
Both labor and growers estimate that roughly 70 percent of agricultural workers are in the country illegally, and that farmworkers make up about one million of the 11 million illegal immigrants currently in the country. The goal of the agricultural worker program, aides said, is to give farmworkers, who are often performing tough manual labor that is critical for the nation's economy, an incentive to remain in the industry.
''There's broad recognition about the extraordinary work farmworkers do every day and have already done every day in feeding our country,'' Mr. Kashkooli said. ''The best way to stabilize the agricultural industry and to not have a new program where we're bringing in new people who are making low wages is to reward the people who are currently doing the work and encourage them to stay in agriculture.''
Still, the questions as to the number of workers who can enter the country and what wages those workers should be paid have been sticking points. Aides with knowledge of the talks said the number of workers would most likely be determined by a formula that would be overseen by the secretaries of agriculture and labor.
The senators have proposed a plan in which wages would vary by job and region. For instance, a California picker and a California equipment operator could be paid at different rates, and an equipment operator in California and one in New England could also be paid differently.
The growers, however, have yet to agree to the approach, said several people with knowledge of the negotiations. The workers' unions have agreed, even though they say that such a deal will lower wages by roughly 10 percent.

HEADLINE: Hello, Cambodia

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- Tiffany & Company is quietly building a diamond-polishing factory in Cambodia, a country popularly associated more with killing fields and land mines than baubles.
Some of Japan's biggest manufacturers are also rushing to set up operations in Phnom Penh to make wiring harnesses for cars and touch screens and vibration motors for cellphones. European companies are not far behind, making dance shoes and microfiber sleeves for sunglasses.
Foreign companies are flocking to Cambodia for a simple reason. They want to limit their overwhelming reliance on factories in China. 
Problems are multiplying fast for foreign investors in China. Blue-collar wages have surged, quadrupling in the last decade as a factory construction boom has coincided with waning numbers of young people interested in factory jobs. Starting last year, the labor force has actually begun shrinking because of the ''one child'' policy and an aging population.
''Every couple days, I'm getting calls from manufacturers who want to move their businesses here from China,'' said Bradley Gordon, an American lawyer in Phnom Penh.
But multinational companies are finding that they can run from China's rising wages but cannot truly hide. The populations, economies and even electricity output of most Southeast Asian countries are smaller than in many Chinese provinces, and sometimes smaller than a single Chinese city. As companies shift south, they quickly use up local labor supplies and push wages up sharply.
While wages and benefits often remain below levels needed to provide proper housing and balanced diets, the manufacturing investment -- foreign direct investment in Cambodia rose 70 percent last year from 2011 -- is starting to raise millions of people out of destitution. ''People along the Mekong River are being lifted out of poverty by foreign investment inflows driven by higher Chinese wages,'' said Peter Brimble, the senior economist for Cambodia at the Asian Development Bank.
Only a smattering of companies, mostly in low-tech sectors like garment and shoe manufacturing, are seeking to leave China entirely. Many more companies are building new factories in Southeast Asia to supplement operations in China. China's fast-growing domestic market, large population and huge industrial base still make it attractive for many companies, while productivity in China is rising almost as fast as wages in many industries.
Foreign investment in China nonetheless slipped 3.5 percent last year, after rising every year since 1980 except 1999, during the Asian financial crisis, and 2009, during the global financial crisis. Still, at $119.7 billion, foreign investment in China continues to dwarf investment elsewhere.
By comparison, investment in Cambodia rose to $1.5 billion. But last year was the first time since comparable recordkeeping began in the 1970s that Cambodia received more foreign investment per person than China.
''People are not looking for exit strategies from China, they're looking to set up parallel operations to hedge their bets,'' said Bretton Sciaroni, another American lawyer here. Among Japanese makers, Sumitomo is making wiring harnesses for cars, Minebea is assembling parts for cellphones and Denso is about to start production of motorcycle ignition components.
Foreign investment also jumped last year in Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar and the Philippines.
As companies compete for employees, working conditions in the region are improving. Pactics, a Belgian-run company that is the world's largest maker of microfiber sleeves for luxury sunglasses, has introduced employee benefits that were previously rare in Cambodia, like medical insurance, accident insurance, education allowances and free lunches.
Because costs are extremely low in Cambodia, where a visit to the doctor may cost only a couple of dollars, overall compensation for each worker is still less than $130 a month. At the company's factory on the outskirts of Shanghai, workers doing the same tasks earn $560 to $640 a month, including government-mandated allowances, said Piet Holten, the company's president.
Cambodian workers sew 15 to 30 percent fewer sleeves per day than their Shanghai counterparts, but productivity in Cambodia has been catching up.
''I will never get it up to China, but the cost is less than a third of China's, and China only gets more expensive,'' Mr. Holten said.
Overall monthly compensation for industrial workers has increased as much as 65 percent in the last five years in Cambodia, although from such a low base that workers here remain among the poorest in Asia. A decade ago, workers flocked to newly opened factories in Phnom Penh that posted hiring notices, but ''today, you put a notice on a factory and you don't have anybody come,'' said Sandra D'Amico, the managing director of HR Inc. Cambodia, a human resources company.
Strikes this winter temporarily crippled numerous Taiwanese-owned garment factories in eastern Cambodia producing simple garments like bathing suits after Japanese factories moved in to make more sophisticated products like business suits and gloves -- and offered higher pay and benefits.
At the Phnom Penh Special Economic Zone here in central Cambodia, Minebea is trying to attract workers by building a modern, four-story dormitory for 2,000 people with six beds to a room and a large recreation hall -- a big change from the plywood houses with thatched roofs in which millions of Cambodians still live. The Laurelton Diamonds unit of Tiffany has already driven pilings for a modern, 95,000-square-foot factory across the street to polish small diamonds, and is seeking international ''green building'' accreditation for the project.
Employment at the zone is doubling this year, to 20,000 workers, and is projected to redouble to 40,000 in the next several years, said Hiroshi Uematsu, the zone's managing director.
Skeptics like David J. Welsh, the Cambodia representative of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s Solidarity Center, say that rising food and housing costs prevent many workers from fully benefiting from rising wages. Ken Loo, secretary general of the Garment Manufacturers Association in Cambodia, said that his industry needed to resist workers' demands for further pay increases to preserve international competitiveness.
Tatiana Olchanetzky, a manufacturing consultant to companies in the handbag and luggage industry, said that she had analyzed the costs in her industry of moving operations from China to the Philippines, Cambodia, Vietnam and Indonesia. She found that any savings were very small because China produces most of the fabrics, clasps, wheels and other materials required for the bag trade, and these would have to be shipped to other countries if final assembly moved there.
But some factories have moved anyway, at the request of Western buyers who fear depending exclusively on a single country.
While moving to a new country with an unproved supply chain is a risk, Ms. Olchanetzky said, ''They think there's a risk in staying in China, too.''

HEADLINE: A Governor Retrenches on a Big Idea

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
BATON ROUGE, La. -- In a short address Monday on the first day of the legislative session, Gov. Bobby Jindal described why his next big plan -- a plan that had been applauded by conservative pundits nationally, pitched at meetings around the state and promoted in slickly produced commercials -- was crucial to Louisiana's success.
Then he announced he was shelving it. 
''Governor, you're moving too fast, and we aren't sure that your plan is the best way to do it,'' Mr. Jindal said, describing what he had heard from legislators and citizens alike.
''Here is my response,'' he said. ''O.K., I hear you.''
The plan, to get rid of the state income and corporate taxes and replace the lost revenue with higher and broader sales taxes, was not dropped altogether. Mr. Jindal emphasized that he was still committed to losing the income tax, but that he would defer to the Legislature to suggest how exactly to make that work.
But it was a rare admission of defeat for Mr. Jindal, 41, a constant Republican in the mix for 2016 and rising conservative luminary since his early 20s. And it was only the latest in a season of setbacks.
In the fall, Mr. Jindal was tapped to lead the Republican Governors Association and after the 2012 election appeared often on national op-ed pages and at Washington forums, diagnosing the party's ills and earning a reputation as a politician who could deliver straight talk.
Back home in Louisiana his troubles were piling up. Unfavorable polls, once discounted as the byproduct of an ambitious agenda, were only getting worse -- recently much worse.
The governor's statewide school voucher program, a pillar of his education reform package, was blocked by a trial court judge on constitutional grounds.
Judges have since also blocked his revamp of teacher tenure rules and a change of the state retirement system (the administration has appealed the rulings and is pushing for legislative action should they stand).
Then at the end of March, Mr. Jindal's health secretary, Bruce Greenstein, announced his resignation amid reports of a federal grand jury investigation into the awarding of a $185 million state contract. Mr. Greenstein had also been the point man for one of the administration's most complex, consequential and potentially risky projects: the accelerated transfer of the state's safety-net hospital system to a system of public-private partnerships.
All along, opposition to the tax swap was growing broader and more bipartisan by the day. Clergy members urged the governor to drop the plan, saying it could hurt the poor, while the state's most prominent chamber of commerce group came out against the plan for its potential impact on businesses.
With the math behind the tax swap remaining vague and variable, the plan's few outspoken friends in the Legislature began to wobble.
Most legislators said on Monday that the governor had made the politically wise decision to stop championing something that had such unfavorable prospects, and some even expressed admiration.
''It's a monumental thing for any politician to realize that what they're trying to promote the public isn't behind yet,'' said John Alario, a Republican and the president of the State Senate.
But it sets up a legislative session no less contentious. Democrats immediately criticized Mr. Jindal for remaining committed to the elimination of the income tax while dropping the more politically difficult insistence that any tax plan be revenue neutral.
On the right, where Mr. Jindal has been facing some of his most vociferous opposition, a group of budget-minded Republican lawmakers who call themselves the fiscal hawks seemed far from satisfied as well.
''It doesn't bode well for a governor's leadership skills just to, in essence, kind of throw his hands up and say, 'I don't want to have anything to do with it but if it passes I'll take credit for it,' '' said Representative Cameron Henry, a member of the hawks, who has become so dissatisfied with the governor's fiscal management that he and a colleague have sued to have Mr. Jindal's most recent two budgets declared unconstitutional.
It is in fact the state budget, more than any reform plans, that accounts for the governor's slide in the polls. In particular, surveys show a growing frustration with the annual deep cuts to higher education and health care, partly because of a reduction in federal Medicaid rates but also of Mr. Jindal's fiscal policies.
Mr. Jindal says that these policies have made Louisiana more business friendly, and indeed the state has weathered the recession better than many others; there are regular announcements by major companies moving plants or offices into Louisiana, often taking advantage of generous tax incentives. The unemployment rate is a full two percentage points below the national average of 7.6 percent.
''There are only a handful of states that have more jobs now that than they did when the recession started and Louisiana's one of them,'' said Timmy Teepell, a political consultant and Mr. Jindal's former chief of staff.
But in a state that is still poor, routine deep budget cuts -- made even deeper after routine midyear revenue shortfalls -- are hard to counter with a message of growth, said Bernie Pinsonat, whose polling firm, Southern Media & Opinion Research, released a survey last week showing Mr. Jindal's approval rating below even that of President Obama's within the state.
Mr. Pinsonat said that the governor's upbeat message is further compromised when it is delivered, as it frequently has been, to audiences outside of Louisiana. ''It is very difficult to play national politics and come back home and not suffer,'' Mr. Pinsonat said, adding: ''They see his reforms as not as helping Louisiana but putting another trophy on his mantel.''
Supporters of Mr. Jindal strongly take issue with this perception, saying that Mr. Jindal has long been an advocate of these reforms. Mr. Teepell suggested that the governor's current political difficulties are in fact a testament to his seriousness about improvements.
''You go through temporary rough patches,'' Mr. Teepell said. ''But that's not going to slow him down.''

HEADLINE: North Korea Halts Work At Shared Factory Site

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN; Martin Fackler contributed reporting from Tokyo.

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea said Monday that it was withdrawing all of its 53,000 workers from the industrial park it runs with South Korea, suggesting that the North was seeking to portray itself as willing to subordinate financial gains to political and military priorities as it increased tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
North Korea ''will temporarily suspend the operations in the zone and examine the issue of whether it will allow its existence or close it,'' the country's official Korean Central News Agency quoted a North Korean official as saying after visiting the complex on Monday. The official, Kim Yang-gon, a secretary of the Central Committee of the North's ruling Workers' Party of Korea, said the final decision would depend on the South Korean government's attitude, making it clear that North Korea was using the project's future to pressure the South for political concessions. 
The complex, in the North Korean border town of Kaesong, operated for eight years despite continuing political and military tensions, including the North Korean artillery attack on a South Korean island two and a half years ago and the cutoff of all other trade ties after the sinking of a South Korean warship in 2010. South Koreans had hoped that the North's growing dependence on the complex as an important source of hard currency would provide South Korea with leverage on the North's recalcitrant leadership. South Korea also thought that it could be used as a possible buffer should there be military conflict.
But the North was angered after its threat this month to close the complex was met with skepticism from some news media analysts who said the North's leader, Kim Jong-un, would not want to risk losing the cash. On Monday, North Korea said it ''gets few economic benefits from the zone while the South side largely benefits from it.''
As with many of the repressive government's aggressive moves, closing the factory park would harm North Koreans. It is the biggest employer in Kaesong, the North's third-largest city. It generates $90 million a year in wages for the North Koreans employed there, and shutting it down would affect the lives of 200,000 to 300,000 people in the area, South Korean analysts estimate.
Mr. Kim ''is not accountable to his people, and thereby can afford to raise tension almost indefinitely at a great cost to his own people,'' said Lee Sung-yoon, a North Korea specialist at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Massachusetts. He recalled that the government did not change its policy even after a famine killed an estimated 10 percent of the North Korean population in the mid-1990s.
Hours before the North made its announcement, South Korea said it had no intention of talking with North Korea. Doing so amid a torrent of North Korean threats to attack the South and the United States with nuclear weapons would amount to capitulation and would only embolden the North's brinkmanship, officials here said.
''If the Kaesong project is stopped and we have to pull our workers completely, it will be a tremendous setback to South-North relations,'' Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae of South Korea said during a parliamentary hearing. ''If we can bring about concrete results through dialogue, perhaps we will swallow our pride and start dialogue, but this is not such a time.''
''We don't need photo-ops or talks for talk's sake,'' he said.
After the announcement, the South Korean government said in a statement: ''North Korea will be held responsible for all the consequences. We will calmly but firmly handle North Korea's indiscreet action, and we will do our best to secure the safety of our people and the protection of our property.''
North Korea has blocked South Korean managers and cargo trucks from crossing the heavily armed border to Kaesong for six days to protest United Nations sanctions over its February nuclear test and joint military drills that the United States and South Korea are conducting on the Korean Peninsula. The blockade quickly dried up the fuel, food and raw materials for 123 South Korean factories there.
More than 470 South Koreans remained in Kaesong on Monday, hoping that the North would lift the blockade. Long lines of South Korean trucks loaded with supplies for the Kaesong factories were stalled at the border.
The situation is a blow to factory owners who have invested millions of dollars during the years when the South pushed for economic cooperation as a way to encourage political reconciliation. They urged the government to start talks with North Korea to defuse tensions.
South Korea spent nearly $1 billion to build the complex, which was begun under a deal reached in 2000 and has been held up as a test case of how Korean reunification might look. South Korean factories hired North Korean workers, allowing the North's Communist authorities their first taste of South Korean capitalism. Nearly 820,000 people from the South have crossed the sealed border to travel there since 2005.
As relations deteriorated in recent years, however, the factory park became controversial in South Korea. Some conservative South Koreans argued that the complex had helped undermine the impact of United Nations sanctions by extending a lifeline to the North Korean leadership.
North Korea has issued a daily barrage of bellicose language since March. In the past week, it told foreign embassies in Pyongyang, the capital, to consider evacuating their personnel because of rising tensions, and, according to South Korean officials, it moved one of its medium-range missiles to its east coast for a possible test launching.
On Monday, South Korean officials said vehicles, cargo and personnel had been detected moving near the entrance of one of two recently dug tunnels at the North's main nuclear test site; one of the tunnels was used for a detonation in February. ''For now, we don't see them as an indication of a nuclear test,'' said Kim Min-seok, a spokesman of the Defense Ministry. ''But since they prepared both tunnels for the last test, we believe that once North Korea makes up its mind, it can conduct another nuclear test any time.''
On Tuesday, the Japanese Army set up a Patriot antimissile battery of interceptor missiles on the grounds of the Defense Ministry in central Tokyo as the nation girds for a possible missile test by North Korea.
Japan's defense minister has ordered the military to shoot down any North Korean missile that threatens to hit Japanese territory. Japan has responded to past North Korean tests by similarly issuing such orders and pre-positioning interceptor missiles.

HEADLINE: Loan Rate Set to Rise, Despite Lack Of Support

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
The interest rate on many student loans is scheduled to double on July 1, to 6.8 percent from 3.4 percent -- just as it was last year, when in the midst of an election campaign, Congress voted to extend the lower rate.
Again this year, no one wants the increase to happen, especially since even the current rate is well above market. But once again, there is likely to be a good deal of brinkmanship before the issue is settled. This time around, though, longer-term solutions may be on the horizon. 
On Tuesday, the day before the White House plans to send its budget to Congress, student advocacy groups are releasing an issue brief charging that the federal government should not be profiting from student loans, while more and more students bear a crushing debt burden.
The brief, citing a February report from the Congressional Budget Office, said the federal government makes 36 cents in profit on every student-loan dollar it puts out, and estimates that over all, student loans will bring in $34 billion next year.
''Higher education loans are meant to subsidize the cost of higher education, not profit from them, especially at a time when students are facing record debt,'' said Ethan Senack, the higher education advocate at the United States Public Interest Research Group, which is issuing the brief with the United States Student Association and Young Invincibles, an organization for people 18 to 34.
''The revenue from student loans should be used to keep education affordable, and should never be used to pay down the deficit or for other federal programs,'' Mr. Senack said.
While it has long been known that the government makes money on student loans, the numbers in the issue brief are surprising, said Terry Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on Education.
''If the numbers are accurate, the government will make more money on student loans than Ford makes on automobiles,'' he said. ''Using student loans to create a profit center is not what anybody intended.''
Student loan borrowers graduate with an average debt of $27,000, and the scheduled interest rate increase on subsidized Stafford loans would cost almost 10 million borrowers about $1,000 more over the life of their loan, for each year of college.
According to the C.B.O. report, the government will get 12.5 cents in revenue next year for every dollar lent through subsidized Staffords, 33.3 cents per dollar in unsubsidized Staffords, 54.8 cents on each dollar of graduate school loans, and 49 cents per dollar of parent loans, for a total of $34 billion a year.
Borrowers of subsidized Stafford loans make up more than a third of those using federal student aid. More than two-thirds of those borrowers are from families with an annual income under $50,000. Last April, in his re-election campaign, President Obama made a central issue of stopping the Stafford interest rate increase. A few days later, Mitt Romney expressed a similar view.
Now that the lower rate is about to expire, there is general agreement that it should not double. But a solution is unclear.
The White House budget is widely expected to include a proposal to move to a variable interest rate, pegged to the government's cost of borrowing, that would be reset every year.
''The president's plan will help middle-class students and their families afford college by stopping interest rates from doubling on July 1 as part of a long-term solution that is fair, fiscally responsible and benefits more borrowers by offering lower interest rates on nearly all federal student loans next year,'' said an administration official, who declined to provide details of the plan.
Many Republicans favor a variable interest rate. But the Senate recently passed a budget resolution extending the 3.4 percent rate indefinitely, and Representative Joe Courtney, Democrat of Connecticut, said he planned to introduce legislation this week extending the 3.4 rate for two years, to give Congress time to rethink student loan interest rates as part of the higher education reauthorization bill.
''We have this very fragmented loan system, with subsidized loans and nonsubsidized loans and graduate students who may not qualify for anything,'' Mr. Courtney said, ''and we need some kind of long-term proposal that isn't a one-year fix, but would use the low cost of money now as a sweetener.''

HEADLINE: Senate Gives White Its Unanimous Consent for S.E.C.

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
The Senate on Monday confirmed Mary Jo White as head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, dismissing concerns about her close ties to the Wall Street banks she will now oversee.
Ms. White, a former federal prosecutor who spent the last decade defending JPMorgan Chase and other big banks, secured Senate approval by unanimous consent. Ms. White is expected to join the agency in the coming days, replacing Elisse B. Walter, who has led the S.E.C. since the departure of Mary L. Schapiro in December.
Her arrival at the post comes at a time of transition for the S.E.C. and the public markets it regulates. The agency is under pressure from Congress to complete new rules for Wall Street and take aim at financial fraud. It also most confront the growing world of high-frequency trading, a business that continues to confound the agency, and money market funds, which the S.E.C. is seeking to rein in. 
On Monday, industry groups applauded the Senate's move. ''Her long experience and notable accomplishments as an advocate for the public interest will serve her well in her new role as S.E.C. chair, carrying out the agency's vital missions of protecting investors and overseeing our capital markets,'' Paul Schott Stevens, the chief executive of the Investment Company Institute, a trade group representing money market funds, said in a statement.
The Senate's move on Monday was widely expected. Ms. White won broad support last month from the Senate Banking Committee, which voted 21-to-1 vote in her favor.
Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, cast the lone vote against her, citing her turns through the revolving door that connects government and private practice. Mr. Brown expressed concern that Ms. White, who represented JPMorgan in financial crisis cases and Morgan Stanley's board in vetting a chief executive, could carry conflicts of interest.
''I don't question Mary Jo White's integrity or skill as an attorney,'' Mr. Brown said at the time. ''But I do question Washington's long-held bias toward Wall Street and its inability to find watchdogs outside of the very industry that they are meant to police.''
To sidestep potential conflicts, Ms. White will recuse herself for one year from most matters involving former clients. She further vowed ''as far as can be foreseen'' never to return to Debevoise & Plimpton, the firm where she built a lucrative legal practice.
Ms. White's supporters also point to her long tenure as a prosecutor. Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York called her ''tough as nails'' during her time as the first woman to serve as United States attorney in Manhattan.
As a federal prosecutor in New York for more than a decade, she helped oversee the prosecution of the crime figure John Gotti and directed the case against those responsible for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. She also supervised the original investigation into Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.
With Wall Street, Ms. White has already signaled a hard line.
''It will be a high priority throughout my tenure to further strengthen the enforcement function of the S.E.C.,'' she said at her confirmation hearing last month. ''It must be fair, but it also must be bold and unrelenting.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: With Help From Nature, a Town Aims to Be a Solar Capital

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
LANCASTER, Calif. -- There are at least two things to know about this high desert city. One, the sun just keeps on shining. Two, the city's mayor, a class-action lawyer named R. Rex Parris, just keeps on competing.
Two years ago, the mayor, a Republican, decided to leverage the incessant Antelope Valley sun so that Lancaster could become the solar capital ''of the world,'' he said. Then he reconsidered. ''Of the universe,'' he said, the brio in his tone indicating that it would be parsimonious to confine his ambition to any one planet. 
''We want to be the first city that produces more electricity from solar energy than we consume on a daily basis,'' he said. This means Lancaster's rooftops, alfalfa fields and parking lots must be covered with solar panels to generate a total of 126 megawatts of solar power above the 39 megawatts already being generated and the 50 megawatts under construction.
To that end, Lancaster just did what former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger failed to do in 2006: require that almost all new homes either come equipped with solar panels or be in subdivisions that produce one kilowatt of solar energy per house. He also was able to recruit the home building giant KB Home to implement his vision, despite the industry's overall resistance to solar power.
''Lancaster is breaking new ground,'' said Michelle Kinman, a clean energy advocate at Environment California, a research and lobbying group. Ms. Kinman, who tracks the growth of solar energy in the state, calculates that the city tripled the number of residential installations in the past 18 months.
The city's pursuit of solar self-sufficiency may exceed that of other municipalities, but California has long outpaced the country in its embrace of that technology. Cities like San Diego, near the Mexican border, and counties like Sonoma, in Northern California's wine country, have been aggressive in converting sunshine into electricity.
The lifetime costs of a large solar facility are expected to be about 15 percent more than electricity bought from the state's grid. Those projected costs are now roughly half of what they were five years ago, state figures show.
Around the country, photovoltaic energy is increasingly being embraced as panel prices fall. Nationally, photovoltaic generating capacity rose 76 percent in 2012, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association; more than 40 percent of the country's solar capacity of 7,700 megawatts came on line last year.
While the desert sunshine in California and Arizona helped put those states atop the national solar energy rankings, towns in cloudier regions are also adopting it. Napoleon, Ohio, for instance, benefits from 14 megawatts of local solar power.
But energy politics in Ohio and other Republican-run states are not solar friendly. Earlier this year Ohio's Republican-dominated public utilities board blocked construction of a 50-megawatt solar facility on strip-mined land. In Republican-controlled Florida, state law prohibits third parties from installing the rooftop solar panels and then selling power to the homeowner, relieving the homeowner of large upfront costs.
Of course, it makes sense to see a city leader championing solar energy in a place like Lancaster, with some of the best solar resources in the world. But the city's long-term population has many former military families, who are largely conservative. Many newer residents are migrants from the black and Hispanic precincts of Los Angeles.
But embracing solar power is not just a matter of energy costs or reliability. It's also about jobs. Like many exurban areas in California, Lancaster was hit hard by the housing bust and the recession. The unemployment rate here is 15.5 percent. Municipal revenues declined, as did school budgets. As Mayor Parris saw it, solar power could mean lower public expenditures and more private jobs.
So solar self-sufficiency became his quest. It does not hurt that Mr. Parris is a showman. He brought a makeup artist to a photo session; he notes the legal awards he has won (slightly under $1 billion) in ads on city buses.
And while his competitive streak is seldom masked -- he said his home has the biggest residential solar array in town and his new law office received LEED gold certification, a seal of approval for green buildings -- the mayor couches his vision in terms of the science of complexity. ''You need to be at the center'' to take advantage of the forces spinning around you, he said.
''We want to make Lancaster the center'' of renewable technology, he added. Entrepreneurs should know ''that if they come and have an idea to create energy without a carbon footprint,'' the local government ''will move mountains for them.'' Getting a permit for a solar installation, he said, takes 15 minutes.
Mr. Parris is aggressively pro-business. He has been hatching plans to create and store more energy locally with SolarCity, a major installer and financier of home systems, and BYD, the Chinese panel, battery and electric vehicle maker.
His solar push began about three years ago; City Hall, the performing arts center and the stadium together now generate 1.5 megawatts. Solar arrays on churches, a big medical office, a developer's office and a Toyota dealership provide 4 more.
The biggest power payoff came with the school system. After the Lancaster school board rejected an offer from SolarCity, saying it was unaffordable, the city created a municipal utility. It bought 32,094 panels, had them installed on 25 schools, generated 7.5 megawatts of power and sold the enterprise to the school district for 35 percent less than it was paying for electricity at the time. Another 8 megawatts now come from systems operating at the local high school and Antelope Valley College.
Not surprisingly, the private companies in Lancaster's collection of public-private partnerships praise him. ''It's so business friendly here, it's not even funny,'' said Jim Cahill, a regional vice president at SolarCity.
''A lot of what we're doing appears to be public relations,'' the mayor conceded. ''It has that taint to it. But what we're doing is scalable and portable.'' Lancaster is already marketing its power to other municipalities.
Global warming, the mayor said, will eventually persuade others to realize that locally generated renewable energy may provide a safety net as the cost of cooling desert homes goes up.
Is global warming indeed a threat? Absolutely, he said. ''I may be a Republican. I'm not an idiot.''

HEADLINE: Margaret Thatcher, Prime Minister

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
Margaret Thatcher, who died of a stroke on Monday at age 87, transformed Britain more thoroughly than any other prime minister of the past half-century. She was a pathbreaker from the moment she took office in 1979 as Britain's first, and so far only, female prime minister. And she was the rare conservative leader to come not from the upper echelons of Britain's class-obsessed society, but from a modest apartment above her father's grocery. 
But much more than that distinguished the 11 years of Mrs. Thatcher's government, which followed years of tepid leadership, economic stagnation and high inflation. She tamed the power of Britain's once powerful labor movement by shutting down inefficient coal mines and privatizing state-owned industries. She encouraged an entrepreneurial culture that had grown timid and somnolent. With her powerful, plain-spoken approach to issues large (like Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait) and relatively small (the brief war over the Falkland Islands), she reawakened Britain's taste for military engagement.
In the process, she revived policy debates among political parties that had grown too comfortable with safe consensus mumbling. As she pushed the conservatives to the right, she pushed the Labour Party to the center. Without Mrs. Thatcher, there probably would have been no Tony Blair.
She had many critics, and her record was not all triumphal. Eventually, Mrs. Thatcher's relentless negativism on the European Union and her bullying style of leadership pushed her own party to drive her from office in 1990. Over the intervening years, much of the glow has faded from Mrs. Thatcher's economic achievements.
The capitalist revival she sparked did not slow the over-financialization and deindustrialization of the economy, with clear and negative consequences in the 2008 financial crash. Her weakening of the unions also led to a regressively skewed distribution of wealth and, her critics said, a widening gap between rich and poor.
Arguably, Mrs. Thatcher's popular military successes made it easier for Mr. Blair to carelessly and recklessly follow George W. Bush into Iraq. But Mrs. Thatcher knew how to stand up to Ronald Reagan when she needed to -- for example, over the ill-considered United States invasion of Grenada.
She was one of the first Western leaders to recognize the reformist intentions of Mikhail Gorbachev, showed remarkable foresight on the dangers of climate change, and in general managed Britain's global role more deftly than her successors.
Mrs. Thatcher was, without a doubt, a divisive political figure in her day. The passage of time has drained much of the old anger and left behind her record of accomplishments.

HEADLINE: Even in Death, Chávez Is a Powerful Presence

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
SAN FELIPE, Venezuela -- Nicolás Maduro is certainly not the first political candidate to invoke the name and legacy of a dead leader to win votes. But he may be the first to say that his political mentor, President Hugo Chávez, visited him from beyond the grave in the form of a little bird.
In what stands out as the most surreal moment of Venezuela's presidential campaign -- a race whose central personality is the deceased president -- Mr. Maduro told the nation that Mr. Chávez's spirit came to him as a tiny bird that flew into a chapel where he was praying.
So now at campaign rallies he whistles like a bird. 
An intense, compressed campaign for president is under way in Venezuela, a month after Mr. Chávez's death from cancer. Voters will go to the polls on Sunday to choose between Mr. Maduro, Mr. Chávez's handpicked political successor, and Henrique Capriles Radonski, a state governor who just six months ago mounted an energetic but losing campaign against Mr. Chávez.
With all the temporal troubles Venezuela faces, including out-of-control crime, high inflation and production problems in the country's all-important oil industry, Mr. Maduro's campaign has done its best to leverage the spiritual, emphasizing his close, continuing ties to the deceased leader.
At times, it seems as if Mr. Chávez is running again himself. At Mr. Maduro's rallies, images of Mr. Chávez are everywhere, with the slogan ''Chávez lives!'' Mr. Chávez's old campaign songs blast from loudspeakers. His picture is displayed on huge television screens on the stage where Mr. Maduro speaks. Hawkers sell key rings with a picture of Mr. Chávez on one side and Jesus on the other. Supporters sing along to a recording of Mr. Chávez belting out the national anthem.
Mr. Maduro drives home the point by telling crowds that his only mission, if he wins, will be to carry out the socialist revolution that Mr. Chávez left unfinished. He calls himself ''the son of Chávez.''
Mr. Chávez was a charismatic populist and a thorn in the side of Washington, which he pilloried as an imperialist force of evil even as he reaped the financial benefits of Venezuela's being the fourth-largest foreign oil supplier to the United States.
Mr. Maduro, 50, who was Mr. Chávez's vice president and is now interim president, has followed his mentor's lead. He expelled two military attachés from the United States Embassy, saying they were seeking to destabilize the country, and suggested that the United States might have caused Mr. Chávez's cancer. He accuses former American diplomats of plotting to kill him. And he recently slammed the door on talks aimed at improving relations between the two countries.
But just in case that is not enough, he wants people to know that Mr. Chávez, who is worshiped by many as something close to a god, has come to him from the great beyond.
Appearing on television last week from Mr. Chávez's hometown, Sabaneta, in the western plains, he told the nation that he had been praying in a small chapel when a little bird flew in, perched on a rafter and sang to him. Mr. Maduro said that he whistled back and that the bird responded.
''I felt his spirit,'' Mr. Maduro said. ''I felt him there as if he was blessing us, telling us: 'Today the battle begins. Go to victory.'''
The story brought jeers from the opposition and even some raised eyebrows from supporters. But Mr. Maduro is betting there are plenty of believers among the masses.
''It's a message from our commander,'' said Elena Quiñones, 54, at a Maduro rally in this western city. She carried a homemade sign with photos of Mr. Chávez framing one of the campaign's main slogans: ''I swear to you, Chávez, my vote is for Maduro.''
''We have to continue the revolution with his son, which is Nicolás Maduro,'' Ms. Quiñones said.
Mr. Maduro, who spent years far from the hustings as foreign minister, is not a polished campaigner, and he often seems to struggle to connect. At the rally here many ignored his speech, chatting and drinking beer. A large circle formed around a group of young people playing drums and dancing, oblivious to the candidate's speech blasting from nearby speakers.
''Maduro is going to win through Chávez,'' said Livia Llovera, 42, who works at a preschool. ''If it was just him, he might not. The leader is Chávez. We will admire him forever.''
Crammed into just a few weeks, the campaign has turned negative fast. Mr. Maduro mocks Mr. Capriles, calling him Caprichito, a play on his name that suggests he is capricious.
He claims the opposition plans to sabotage the electrical network to disrupt the election, and he accused Mr. Capriles of preparing to abandon the campaign and move to New York. On Sunday, Mr. Maduro said a close aide to Mr. Capriles was in cahoots with plotters seeking to kill him.
Mr. Capriles, 40, has hardly been demure himself, calling Mr. Maduro ''Fresh Lies'' and ''the little bird's candidate.'' He has accused Mr. Maduro's United Socialist Party of obtaining a secret code that can turn digital voting machines on and off.
Mr. Maduro is widely considered the favorite. Mr. Chávez, who dominated political life here for 14 years with his outsize personality and firm hold on power, beat Mr. Capriles by 11 percentage points in October, although Mr. Capriles received the most votes for an opposition candidate since Mr. Chávez was first elected in 1998. Mr. Chávez died March 5; the winner of Sunday's election will complete his six-year term, which began in January.
Mr. Capriles has once again energized a demoralized and fragmented opposition. He is a more polished campaigner than Mr. Maduro. And he seems to have a stronger personal connection with his followers than Mr. Maduro does, a striking turnaround, since Mr. Chávez was legendary for his rapport with the masses.
Mr. Chávez's followers have been through several grueling weeks after the death of their revered leader. And Mr. Maduro's rallies seem at times to struggle against a sense of emotional exhaustion.
The opposition, by contrast, did not have a chance to release its emotions in public after the death of Mr. Chávez, who was hated by some as fiercely as he was loved by others. Mr. Capriles is now feeding off that pent-up energy.
Still, Mr. Chávez's party has a strong get-out-the-vote machine, and it taps nearly unlimited government resources. Government workers are required to attend rallies. Government television stations broadcast every event, and government ministries openly take part in the campaign. At a recent rally in Maracay, a north-central city, people in red T-shirts provided by the government stood in line to get lunches distributed by government workers that included products like bottled juice, made in government-run factories.
Mr. Capriles relies on financing from private companies and donors, and his campaign events are broadcast on a privately owned station closely allied with the opposition.
But most observers say the field is tilted strongly in Mr. Maduro's favor, citing a court system packed with loyalists and an electoral council that refuses to curb the use of government resources in the campaign.
While Mr. Maduro may be shying away from original ideas, the campaign is not without novelty.
At the Maracay rally, Mr. Maduro whistled into a microphone, pointing to an imaginary bird fluttering overhead. Carolina Díaz, 38, carried a poster showing Mr. Maduro's head on a yellow banana (the word ''maduro'' in Spanish sometimes refers to a ripe plantain). On stage, Mr. Maduro looked incongruously like a boy scout, in a khaki shirt, a red neckerchief and a small green backpack that he has started wearing, saying it is packed with Mr. Chávez's revolutionary dreams.
''Maduro is not convincing,'' said Edesia Rodríguez, 58, a Capriles supporter at a rally for Mr. Capriles in the city of Barinas, in Mr. Chávez's home state. ''He is basing his campaign on what Chávez was. He has nothing new to offer.''
But that may be what many Chávez loyalists want. As thousands congregated for the rally in Maracay, two die-hard Chávez supporters discussed their certainty that Mr. Maduro would be elected to carry out the leader's legacy.
''I say to God, let me live until April 14 to vote for Chávez,'' said one of the men, Nayef Mussa, 67.
''For Maduro,'' his friend, Marco Rojas, 43, corrected him.
''Bah.'' Mr. Mussa waved a hand dismissively. ''It's the same thing.''

HEADLINE: Thatcher, Reagan and Their Special Relationship

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WAPSHOTT. 
Nicholas Wapshott, a former editor at the British newspapers The Times and The Observer, is the author of '', Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher: A Political Marriage'' and, most recently, ''Keynes Hayek: The Clash That Defined Modern Economics.''

 BODY:
THE Iron Lady was an inappropriate epithet for Margaret Thatcher. She disliked it, but learned to use it to her advantage. For those who knew her in her prime, however, it did not do justice to her.
Returning aboard her plane from a trip to Japan, I offered to help her open a bottle of Champagne. ''No, Nicholas,'' she ordered, pointing to her chair. ''Sit down. I'll do it.'' I protested that if there was one thing I was good at, it was opening Champagne. She fixed me with a stare, passed the bubbly to her press secretary, put both hands on my shoulders, and pushed me down into her seat. I felt a charge go through my body. I have thought of it ever since as my Mrs. Robinson moment.
It was Mrs. Thatcher's charisma that those who thought of her as merely a hectoring bossy-boots did not grasp. And it was that sense of subdued danger and not-quite-erotic excitement that inspired the most important Anglo-American alliance since that of Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt. 
From the moment they met, in April 1975, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan bonded. They agreed on almost everything, and even completed each other's thoughts. When he encouraged Paul A. Volcker, the Federal Reserve chairman, to deliberately set off a recession in the hope of purging hyperinflation, she encouraged him to resist the alarmist warnings of those who thought the resulting high unemployment and business bankruptcies were too dear a price. She had been there and done that.
On the world stage, she was mostly the good cop to Reagan's bad, though sometimes they switched places. Reagan's pointless tirades against Communism may have remained just that, had Mrs. Thatcher not explored a way to engage with a new generation of Soviet leaders. Having attended two funerals of the grumpy old men who ran what Reagan dubbed ''The Evil Empire,'' she invited two young Kremlin rivals to London. When Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrived at No. 10 Downing Street, she perceived that he was the man on the rise and swiftly called Reagan to say he was ''a man who you can do business with.'' The resulting Reagan-Gorbachev summit meetings hastened the Soviet Union's demise.
Reagan and Thatcher did not end the cold war -- proper credit goes to defiant dock workers in Gdansk, Poland; decades of brave resistance by refuseniks in Russia, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and elsewhere; and John Paul II, the ''Polish pope'' -- but together, with her worldly sense of what was possible alongside his bonhomie and charm, they helped ensure that the transfer was peaceful.
What the British like to think of as the ''special relationship'' between the United States and Britain flowered under Mrs. Thatcher. She offered sound advice and urged resolution on a president anxious to do the right thing. Her example taught her successor, Tony Blair, that to increase his influence in the world he must befriend first Bill Clinton, then George W. Bush. That was fine when, as in Kosovo, Mr. Blair and Mr. Clinton agreed on the same approach. When Mr. Bush became intent on invading Iraq, Mr. Blair's opinions on the occupation of Iraq were dismissed and yet he, too, fell in line, a serious blemish on his tenure.
Reagan, for all his jokes and banter, was aloof, even to close members of his family. Mrs. Thatcher, too, often kept her distance, and with good reason. A woman who stormed the male chauvinist citadel that was the Tory Party, she lived with the constant threat of revolt, as she found out when they took turns stabbing her like Caesar on the steps of the Roman Senate. Yet in each other Thatcher and Reagan found not merely kindred spirits, but life partners. It is not extravagant to suggest that the alliance they forged was a political marriage.
Of the two, Thatcher was more fiercely loyal and Reagan more likely to play the henpecked husband. Once he interrupted a meeting in the Oval Office to take a call from her. Putting a hand over the mouthpiece, he held up the phone so the others could hear her hectoring like Ethel Merman. ''It's Margaret,'' he said, amusedly. ''Isn't she wonderful?'' After he dared to invade Grenada, a member of the British Commonwealth, without tipping her off in advance, he called her to say, ''If I were there, Margaret, I'd throw my hat in the door before I came in.''
''There's no need to do that,'' was her chilly reply. It took some minutes of awkward explanation, laced with Reagan charm, before she thawed.
The Thatcher papers reveal a close rapport conducted literally in the margins. No official memorandum was too important for them not to scribble personal notes, like birthday wishes or best regards to their spouses, Nancy and Denis, at the end, as if they were torrid teenagers texting. Sometimes messages of support were not enough. When Reagan was consumed by the Iran-contra affair, Thatcher wrote to him, ''Whatever happened over Iran is in the past and nothing can change it.'' She flew to his side and did the rounds of the breakfast shows, wagging her fingers at those who dare suggest her office husband was anything but perfect.
When Reagan, in his childlike optimism, almost traded away the West's nuclear arsenal at Reykjavik, Iceland, at a summit meeting in 1986, Mrs. Thatcher leapt into a plane and took the president aside, telling him the world would not be a safer place if mutually assured destruction were removed. And the alternative -- huge standing armies and thousands of tanks facing each other across the East-West border -- would break the bank. It was the only genuine disagreement they ever had.

HEADLINE: What Is the Mission of a University?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
David Brooks presents an extremely utilitarian view of higher education (''The Practical University,'' column, April 5). It reflects an uncertain economic time but should not be embraced. 
As he notes, technical and practical knowledge and skills for career preparation are important and necessary goals of higher education. But the best outcomes of a college experience go well beyond this. They include development of the whole, thinking person, cultivation of creativity, maturation of social and cultural sensibilities, and even increased passion for life, learning and civic engagement of all sorts -- what collectively might be called ''life and citizenship knowledge.''
Thus, an essential, if not primary, answer to Mr. Brooks's question, ''What is a university for?,'' should be promoting knowledge and understanding for their own sake -- beyond any relevance to a job -- and educating thoughtful, caring citizens who have the skills and motivation for helping advance the well-being and flourishing of individuals and communities.
LOREN B. BYRNE Bristol, R.I., April 7, 2013
The writer is an assistant professor of biology and environmental science at Roger Williams University.
To the Editor:
David Brooks suggests that universities are places where students acquire two kinds of knowledge, ''technical'' and ''practical.'' I see little difference between these kinds, but I see a large difference between them and ''liberal knowledge.''
What used to be called a liberal education was one that aspired, through the study of literature, philosophy, history and science, to intellectual excellence. For many students and some teachers, such liberal knowledge appears not to count for much.
WILLIAM H. PRITCHARD Amherst, Mass., April 6, 2013
The writer is a professor of English at Amherst College.
To the Editor:
David Brooks asks a profound question: ''What is a university for?''
Let me be bold enough to provide the time-honored response. A university develops knowledge through scholarship and research. A university transmits knowledge through instruction. A university applies knowledge through public service. This traditional formulation of a university's purpose serves us far better than Mr. Brooks's dubious assertion that ''the future of the universities is in practical knowledge.''
MORTON I. TEICHER Scarsdale, N.Y., April 5, 2013

HEADLINE: Criticism of Cuomo Grows as the Problems in Albany Endure

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM; Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo once called himself the ''sheriff of State Street.''
Referring to the road that runs alongside the Capitol, he promised to patrol corruption as attorney general. The night he was elected governor in 2010, he vowed to end the ''dysfunction and degradation'' in Albany. And last month, after the state budget passed, he said he had triumphed over the ''dysfunction and chaos of Albany.''
But two corruption cases last week underscored a season of challenge for Mr. Cuomo, who has faced more criticism over the last few months than he did during much of his first two years, just as he is preparing to run for re-election next year and, say people close to him, pondering whether to run for president in 2016.
During an extended two-year honeymoon as governor, and the previous four years as attorney general, Mr. Cuomo and his staff assiduously warded off hints of dissent and disobedience. They scripted praise for outside groups to recite, removed some of Mr. Cuomo's potentially troublesome records from public view at the state archives, and effectively silenced many by making it known that they ''never forget'' slights and that they ''operate on two speeds'' -- ''get along and kill.'' 
But this year, some of the governor's traditional allies are turning on him, his poll numbers have begun to show signs of erosion and the State Legislature has become more assertive.
The corruption prosecutions are further complicating Mr. Cuomo's challenges as he seeks to make the case that he has transformed Albany. A federal prosecutor, Preet Bharara, alleged last Tuesday that Senator Malcolm A. Smith, a Queens Democrat and former president of the State Senate, had tried to pay New York City Republican leaders to allow him a spot on that party's mayoral primary ballot. Then, on Thursday, Mr. Bharara alleged that Assemblyman Eric A. Stevenson had accepted a bribe in exchange for legislation in Albany, and that Assemblyman Nelson L. Castro had been cooperating with prosecutors after he himself was secretly indicted on a charge of perjury in the Bronx.
''A 'show me the money' culture in Albany is alive and well,'' said Mr. Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York.
New York has long ceded corruption fighting to the Justice Department, but Mr. Cuomo said on Monday that he would push for changes to the state's election and campaign fund-raising laws, declaring, ''Never waste a crisis, as they say.'' He suggested, as he has in the past, that he would consider creating a special commission to investigate corruption.
But, speaking on the public radio program ''The Capitol Pressroom,'' he also tried to play down the state's role in the latest corruption charges.
''It was not an Albany scandal,'' he said of last week's cases against legislators, one of which involved an assemblyman accused of accepting money for a legislative proposal. ''It was primarily about New York City.''
Mr. Cuomo has repeatedly noted in recent days that, when he was attorney general, he successfully prosecuted several important corruption cases. But his efforts as governor to police state government have drawn some criticism. A revamped ethics commission that Mr. Cuomo championed has limited authority, unable even to release some of its own reports.
Mr. Cuomo said he was proud of his accomplishments in Albany. ''I believe the government has performed with renewed integrity,'' he said. ''Obviously we have more to do -- because we want integrity everywhere, all branches, all people.''
The new corruption cases come after several months in which there have been indications that Mr. Cuomo is less invincible than he once was.
On the opening day of the Albany session, the governor pushed through gun control legislation without significant legislative advice or debate, and before the bill was carefully vetted -- an insular approach that is becoming a hallmark of policy development in the Cuomo administration. The move, which included a tightened ban on assault weapons, cheered many after the Newtown massacre, and positioned Mr. Cuomo as the first governor to act in the tragedy's wake. But it also alienated the governor's supporters on the right, including The New York Post, which has turned against him with venom. Republican voters had been surprisingly positive about the governor, but now seem to be souring on him.
The gun measure needed a quick rewrite after one of the law's key provisions, banning the sale of 10-round magazines, proved unworkable. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg observed that ''if they had taken a few more days'' to consult with others, the Cuomo administration might have avoided problems with the legislation. And Larry Cafero, the Connecticut House Republican leader, took his own shot not long before his state reached its own deal, saying, ''To be the first out of the blocks and get it wrong is not a success.''
Mr. Cuomo also started to face unfamiliar trouble within his own ranks. Stephanie A. Miner, the Syracuse mayor, whom the governor just last year handpicked to be the co-chairwoman of the state Democratic Party, publicly assailed his proposed budget because of what she viewed as inadequate provisions to assist struggling upstate cities. Her continuing dissent erupted just days after Mr. Cuomo called for the party to be a ''tighter'' ship.
More recently, the State Legislature, previously cowed by Mr. Cuomo, has been more assertive. Most of Mr. Cuomo's fellow Democrats in the Senate voted against the health care portion of the state budget, partly to protest the governor's cuts to providers of services to people with developmental disabilities. And, in a more ominous move, a State Assembly committee decided to review the inclusion of a luxury box for state officials as part of a $130 million deal to renovate the stadium where the Buffalo Bills play.
Business groups, traditional allies of Mr. Cuomo, this year have chafed over the governor's rewriting of the state's tax code on the fly as part of a final, opaque round of budget talks. The budget includes extending a high-tax bracket on high incomes and a surcharge on utilities.
''Clearly, we were disappointed,'' said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, a leading business group and one of Mr. Cuomo's most important allies.
The tax changes, which also include a $350 tax rebate for middle class families to be delivered shortly before Election Day next year, diverge from Mr. Cuomo's initial stance as governor, when he ruled out tax increases. Since then, his orthodoxy has softened. This month, he said of the budget, ''You can't bring down all the taxes,'' adding, ''some taxes go up, some taxes go down.''
Brian Sampson, head of Unshackle Upstate, another crucial business group, called the budget ''a step backwards,'' adding, ''it's safe to say we're losing patience.''
The governor has hailed the budget as a success largely because it was approved before the start of the state's fiscal year, on April 1, for the third year in a row. Mr. Cuomo sees that as evidence that he has restored order and stability after the chaotic administrations of Eliot Spitzer and David A. Paterson, and years of late budgets under George E. Pataki.
Mr. Cuomo can also claim a string of legislative successes, including same-sex marriage, a cap on property taxes and gun control. But he has had little success addressing the state's long-term challenges. Much of upstate New York remains economically moribund. Municipal governments from Nassau County to Yonkers to Syracuse are teetering. And during Mr. Cuomo's time in office, unemployment has risen above the national average.
Changing Albany's political culture may be as great a challenge. On Monday, Mr. Cuomo seemed to be lowering expectations.
''You will always have individuals who break the law,'' he said, adding, ''If someone says, 'Well, we need a system where no one does anything wrong,' then they're talking about a utopia that doesn't exist.''

HEADLINE: 'Iron Lady' Who Set Britain on a New Course

BYLINE: By JOSEPH R. GREGORY

 BODY:
Margaret Thatcher, the ''Iron Lady'' of British politics, who set her country on a rightward economic course, led it to victory in the Falklands war and helped guide the United States and the Soviet Union through the cold war's difficult last years, died on Monday in London. She was 87.
Her spokesman, Tim Bell, said she died of a stroke at the Ritz Hotel. She had been in poor health for months and had suffered from dementia.
Prime Minister David Cameroncut short a visit to Continental Europe to return to Britain after receiving the news, andQueen Elizabeth II authorized a ceremonial funeral with military honors -- a notch below a state funeral -- at St. Paul's Cathedral in London. A statement from the White House said that ''the world has lost one of the great champions of freedom and liberty, and America has lost a true friend.'' 
Mrs. Thatcher was the first woman to become prime minister of Britain and the first to lead a major Western power in modern times. Hard-driving and hardheaded, she led her Conservative Party to three straight election wins and held office for 11 years -- May 1979 to November 1990 -- longer than any other British politician in the 20th century.
The strong economic medicine she administered to a country sickened by inflation, budget deficits and industrial unrest brought her wide swings in popularity, culminating with a revolt among her own cabinet ministers in her final year and her shout of ''No! No! No!'' in the House of Commons to any further integration with Europe.
But by the time she left office, the principles known as Thatcherism -- the belief that economic freedom and individual liberty are interdependent, that personal responsibility and hard work are the only ways to national prosperity, and that the free-market democracies must stand firm against aggression -- had won many disciples. Even some of her strongest critics accorded her a grudging respect.
At home, Mrs. Thatcher's political successes were decisive. She broke the power of the labor unions and forced the Labour Party to abandon its commitment to nationalized industry, redefine the role of the welfare state and accept the importance of the free market.
Abroad, she won new esteem for a country that had been in decline since its costly victory in World War II. After leaving office, she was honored as Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven. But during her first years in power, even many Tories feared that her election might prove a terrible mistake.
In October 1980, 17 months into her first term, Mrs. Thatcher faced disaster. More businesses were failing and more people were out of work than at any time since the Great Depression. Racial and class tensions smoldered. Even her close advisers worried that her push to stanch inflation, sell off nationalized industry and deregulate the economy was devastating the poor, undermining the middle class and courting chaos.
At the Conservative Party conference that month, the moderates grumbled that they were being led by a free-market ideologue oblivious to life on the street and the exigencies of realpolitik. With electoral defeat staring them in the face, cabinet members warned, now was surely a time for compromise.
To Mrs. Thatcher, they could not be more wrong. ''I am not a consensus politician,'' she said. ''I am a conviction politician.''
In an address to the party, she played on the title of Christopher Fry's popular play ''The Lady's Not for Burning'' in insisting that she would press forward with her policies. ''You turn if you want to,'' she told the faltering assembly. ''The lady's not for turning.''
Her resolve did the trick. A party revolt was thwarted, the Tories hunkered down, and Mrs. Thatcher went on to achieve great victories. She turned the Conservatives, long associated with the status quo, into the party of reform. Her policies revitalized British business, spurred industrial growth and swelled the middle class.
But her third term was riddled with setbacks. Dissension over monetary policy, taxes and Britain's place in the European Community caused her government to give up hard-won gains against inflation and unemployment. By the time she was ousted in another Tory revolt -- this one over her resistance to expanding Britain's role in a European Union -- the economy was in a recession and her reputation tarnished.
To her enemies she was -- as Denis Healey, chancellor of the Exchequer in Harold Wilson's government, called her -- ''La Pasionaria of Privilege,'' a woman who railed against the evils of poverty but who was callous and unsympathetic to the plight of the have-nots. Her policies, her opponents said, were cruel and shortsighted, widened the gap between rich and poor and worsened the plight of the poorest.
Mrs. Thatcher's relentless hostility to the Soviet Union and her persistent call to modernize Britain's nuclear forces fed fears of nuclear war and even worried moderates in her own party. It also caught the Kremlin's attention. After she gave a hard-line speech in 1976, the Soviet press gave her a sobriquet of which she was proud: the Iron Lady.
Yet when she saw an opening, Mrs. Thatcher proved willing to bend. She was one of the first Western leaders to recognize that the Soviets would soon be led by a member of a new generation,Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and invited him to Britain in December 1984, three months before he came to power. ''I like Mr. Gorbachev,'' she said. ''We can do business together.''
Her rapport with the new Soviet leader and her friendship with PresidentRonald Reaganmade Mrs. Thatcher a vital link between the White House and the Kremlin in their tense negotiations to halt the arms race of the 1980s.
Brisk and argumentative, she was rarely willing to concede a point and loath to compromise. Colleagues who disagreed with her were often deluged in a sea of facts, or what many referred to as being ''handbagged.''
''She had high standards, and she expected everyone to do their work,'' John O'Sullivan, a special adviser to the prime minister, recalled in 1999. ''But there was a distinction. She was tougher on her ministers than she was on her personal staff. The more humble the position, the nicer she was.''
Though she was the first woman to lead a major political party in the West, she rubbed many feminists the wrong way. ''The battle for women's rights has largely been won,'' she declared. ''I hate those strident tones we hear from some women's libbers.'' She relished being impolitic. ''You don't follow the crowd,'' she said. ''You make up your own mind.''
The arts and academic establishments loathed her for cutting their financing and called her tastes provincial, her values narrow-minded. In 1985, two years into her second term, she was proposed for an honorary doctorate at Oxford, a laurel traditionally offered prime ministers who had attended the university, as she had. The proposal, after a faculty debate, was rejected.
Yet her popularity remained high.
''Margaret Thatcher evoked extreme feelings,'' wrote Ronald Millar, a playwright and speechwriter for the prime minister. ''To some she could do no right, to others no wrong. Indifference was not an option. She could stir almost physical hostility in normally rational people, while she inspired deathless devotion in others.''
The Grocer's Daughter
Margaret Hilda Roberts was born on Oct. 13, 1925, in Grantham, Lincolnshire, 100 miles north of London. Her family lived in a cold-water flat above a grocery store owned by her father, Alfred, the son of a shoemaker. Alfred Roberts was also a Methodist preacher and local politician, and he and his wife, Beatrice, reared Margaret and her older sister, Muriel, to follow the tenets of Methodism: personal responsibility, hard work and traditional moral values.
Margaret learned politics at her father's knee, joining him as he campaigned for alderman and borough councilman as an independent. ''Politics was in my bloodstream,'' she said.
She won a scholarship to Kesteven and Grantham Girls School. In 1943, at 17, she was admitted to Somerville College, Oxford, to study chemistry. Barred from joining the Oxford Union debating society -- it did not admit women until 1963 -- she became a member of the Oxford University Conservative Association and its president in 1946. She graduated in 1947 and earned a master's degree in chemistry, then worked as a chemical researcher and studied law.
Entering politics, she was selected at 23 to be a Conservative candidate for Parliament, and in 1949 she met Denis Thatcher, a well-to-do businessman and former artillery officer who had been decorated for bravery during World War II. They married in December 1951. In August 1953, Mrs. Thatcher gave birth to twins, Mark and Carol, who survive her, along with grandchildren. (Sir Denis died in 2003.) That December, she was admitted to the bar and came to specialize in patent and tax law.
As the couple prospered, Mrs. Thatcher gained the financial independence to devote herself to politics. ''Being prime minister is a lonely job,'' she wrote in her memoir, ''The Downing Street Years'' (1993). ''It has to be; you cannot lead from the crowd. But with Denis there, I was never alone.''
In 1950 she campaigned to be a member of Parliament from Dartford, a Labour Party preserve. She was the youngest woman to run for a seat that year, a time when Prime Minister Clement Attlee, who had oustedWinston Churchillin an upset on July 5, 1945, was seeking re-election. Mr. Attlee had gone on to create a welfare state that promised full employment, state ownership of industry, public housing and a national health service. As expected, Mrs. Thatcher was defeated. She ran again the next year, and lost, but she did better than expected in both races.
In 1951 the Tories began a 13-year run as the party in power, first under the aging Churchill and then under Anthony Eden, Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home. But in exchange for support on foreign affairs, the Tories compromised with the unions and accepted the government's growing role in the marketplace. This ''policy of consensus'' was successful. Mr. Macmillan, seeking re-election in 1959, said, ''Most people have never had it so good.''
Few Tories dared voice misgivings as inflation spread, productivity dropped and deficits grew. Mrs. Thatcher, elected to the House of Commons that year from the largely middle-class Finchley district in north London, was among those who swallowed their doubts.
In 1964, the Tories, exhausted by scandal, a souring economy and internal divisions, lost power to Harold Wilson's Labour Party. But as the economy grew more feeble and the unions more militant, Mr. Wilson was ousted in 1970 by the Conservative leader,Edward Heath. He appointed Mrs. Thatcher secretary for education.
As a Conservative cabinet minister, she fought budget cuts in the university system and pushed to rebuild schools in poor areas with a zeal, as Hugo Young wrote in his critical 1989 biography, ''The Iron Lady,"that ''would have done credit to the best of the socialists.''
But it was her effort to restrict a free-milk program for schoolchildren that made her a national figure. Though poor children were exempt from the cutbacks, and the previous Labour government had also reduced free milk in schools, the opposition leapt to the attack. When Mrs. Thatcher argued in Parliament that the cuts would help finance more worthwhile programs, she was jeered. The tabloids labeled her ''Thatcher the Milk Snatcher.'' Her children were taunted at school. Her husband, worried, suggested that perhaps she should quit politics.
The government stood firm on the milk issue. But as the economy worsened, Mr. Heath retreated, imposing wage and price controls as inflation surged and igniting strikes. His U-turn angered the Tory right. Moreover, it proved futile. In the wake of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, the oil-producing nations of OPEC imposed huge price increases that stoked inflation. By winter 1974 Mr. Wilson was back in power.
The following December, the Conservative Party revised its rules for choosing a leader and opened a series of votes to the rank and file. Mrs. Thatcher, in what many regarded as an act of political gall, declared her candidacy. One British bookmaker, Ladbrokes, put the odds against her at 50 to 1.
Mrs. Thatcher finished ahead of Mr. Heath on the first ballot, 130 to 119. It was not enough for victory, but Mr. Heath was forced to drop out. In the second ballot, on Feb. 11, 1975, Mrs. Thatcher defeated the other contenders, all of them men.
For the next four years, as Labour ran the country, she fought to reshape her party. The conservatism she espoused was guided by the tenets of classic liberalism: faith in the individual, in economic freedom and in limited government power. But she had to contend with conservatism's basic reluctance to change with the times.
As the party of tradition, the Tories had little place for women in its upper echelons. All party leaders, for example, joined the Carlton Club, which excluded women. The club would not change its rules for Mrs. Thatcher, but she was accorded an honorary membership. Still, resentment lingered. At a party conference Mr. Heath studiously ignored her.
Mrs. Thatcher's prescription for change was based on the ideas of the conservative economists Friedrich von Hayek andMilton Friedman. Hayek believed that political and economic freedom were inseparable; Friedman argued that economic productivity and inflation were determined by the amount of money the government put into the economy, and that the heavy government spending advocated by Keynesian economics distorted the natural strength of the marketplace.
Mrs. Thatcher and her allies asserted that the Tory policy of consensus had allowed the country to lurch leftward as each successive leader, seeking the middle of the road, was forced to compromise with a leftist agenda. For her part, she cared little for theories. She called for an all-out attack on inflation, pledged to denationalize basic industry and promised to curb union power.
By the mid-1970s, Britain was the sick man of Europe. Nearly half of the average taxpayer's income went to the state, which now determined compensation for a third of the nation's work force: those employed by nationalized industries. In late 1978 and early '79, strikes paralyzed Britain. As the ''winter of discontent'' dragged on, Prime Minister James Callaghan, of the Labour Party, failed to survive a no-confidence vote and called an election for May 3.
Callaghan, who was known as Sunny Jim, drew higher personal ratings in opinion polls than Mrs. Thatcher. But on election day the Tories walked away with 43.9 percent of the vote. Labour received 37 percent and the Liberals 13.8 percent. It was the largest swing to the right in postwar history.
First Term
Mrs. Thatcher moved swiftly. ''I came to office with one deliberate intent,'' she later said. ''To change Britain from a dependent to a self-reliant society, from a give-it-to-me to a do-it-yourself nation.''
It was a painful beginning. Income tax cuts balanced by rising gasoline duties and sales taxes fueled inflation. Unemployment spread as she slashed subsidies to faltering industries. Tight money policies drove up interest rates to as high as 22 percent, strengthening the pound, hobbling investment at home and hurting competitiveness overseas. A record 10,000 businesses went bankrupt. Saying it would take years to cure Britain of the havoc wrought by socialism, Mrs. Thatcher warned, ''Things will get worse before they get better.''
In the summer of 1981 -- the same one in which Charles, the Prince of Wales, married Lady Diana Spencer-- discontent boiled over into days of rioting in the London district of Brixton; the inner cities of Liverpool, Manchester and Bristol; and many other areas. Televised reports of rioting, arson and looting shocked the nation. The prime minister, resisting advisers who counseled more social spending and jobs programs, called for greater police powers. Yet, in the face of national shame over the violence, she was forced to give way.
There were other compromises. Retreating from its declaration that state industries must sink or swim in the free market, the government came to the aid of British Airways and British Steel.
Mrs. Thatcher later said that 1981 was her worst year in office. But by the spring of 1982, things were looking up. Inflation was falling; so was the value of the pound, which gave a boost to Britain's exports and, along with tax cuts, began to feed economic growth.
In foreign affairs, she won some small victories. Standing up to the European Community, she argued that her country paid out much more to the organization than it got back in benefits, and won a significant reduction in contributions. Though her rhetoric and style had caught the world's eye, she had yet to stake a position as a world leader. Then, on April 2, 1982, Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands.
British settlers had lived on those remote islands in the South Atlantic, long claimed by Argentina, since the 1820s, and negotiations over their future had been dragging on for years. The Argentine military junta under Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri, eager to divert attention from economic and social unrest, moved to take the Falklands by force, gambling that once the islands were occupied, Argentine forces would never be ousted.
As the United States and other allies pushed for talks to avoid bloodshed, Mrs. Thatcher ordered a Royal Navy fleet to the South Atlantic. In a 10-week war, the British retook the islands in fighting that left some 250 British servicemen and more than 1,000 Argentines dead. The victory doomed Argentina's military government and cemented Mrs. Thatcher's reputation as a leader to be reckoned with.
Second Term
Her political fortunes were enhanced by squabbling among her opponents. Far-left factions and militant union leaders were gaining strength in the Labour Party as economic discontent and tensions with the Soviet Union grew.
In 1980, Mrs. Thatcher and PresidentJimmy Carterhad agreed to deploy American intermediate-range cruise missiles in Britain in response to a Soviet buildup in Eastern Europe. Under Mr. Reagan, who succeeded Mr. Carter the next year, the United States, with Mrs. Thatcher's support, persuaded other European allies to deploy the missiles. The arms buildups ignited demonstrations across Western Europe.
When Mrs. Thatcher called an election in June 1983, Labour's new chief, Michael Foot, campaigned for a unilateral ban on nuclear weapons, withdrawal from the European Community, further nationalization of industry and a huge jobs program.
Mr. Foot's turn to the left alienated Labour's center and right wing, and this time the bookmakers put the odds heavily in Mrs. Thatcher's favor, and they had no regrets. The conservatives won 397 of the 650 seats in Parliament, the biggest swing in voting since Labour's landslide victory against Churchill in 1945. The working class voted heavily for the Conservatives.
It was an axiom of British politics that one never picked a quarrel with the pope or the National Union of Mineworkers. Mrs. Thatcher flouted it. The coal mines, nationalized in 1947, were widely seen as unprofitable, overstaffed and obsolescent, and in 1984 the government announced plans to shut down several mines and to eliminate 20,000 of the industry's 180,000 jobs.
In response, Arthur Scargill, the Marxist president of the union, used union rules to elude a rank-and-file vote and, on March 6, 1984, called a walkout.
It was a violent strike. Night after night, the television news broadcast images of hundreds of miners battling the police. On Nov. 30, at a mine in South Wales, a taxi driver taking a miner to work was fatally injured when a concrete slab was dropped on his cab.
Though the episode shocked the Labour Party and many miners, Mr. Scargill refused to condemn it, alienating Neil Kinnock, the new Labour leader, and other supporters. As members of his own union sought to have the strike declared illegal, newspaper cartoons pictured Mr. Scargill flinching under Mrs. Thatcher's flailing handbag. The strike finally ended in March 1985, after 362 days, without a settlement.
'Popular Capitalism'
Mrs. Thatcher now pushed harder to fulfill her vision of ''popular capitalism.'' The sale of state-owned industries shifted some 900,000 jobs into the private sector. More than one million public housing units were sold to their occupants. And the chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, announced in 1985 that for the first time since the 1960s, the Treasury would not require deficit spending in its next fiscal budget.
Across the Atlantic, Mr. Reagan cheered Britain's turnaround. He and Mrs. Thatcher did not always agree; he thought she was too reluctant on cutting taxes, while she was wary of his insouciance over rising federal deficits. When Mr. Reagan, without warning the British, ordered troops to invade the Caribbean nation of Grenada, a member of the Commonwealth, in the wake of a Communist coup, Mrs. Thatcher gave him a dressing down. Nevertheless, the Reagan-Thatcher axis was, in the words of Hugo Young, ''the most enduring personal alliance in the Western world throughout the 1980s.''
The prime minister supported Mr. Reagan's stand against Communism, echoing White House assertions that Fidel Castro's Cuba was exporting revolution to Nicaragua and other Latin American states. She was equally vigorous in supporting the United States' fight against terrorism. In April 1986, after terrorist attacks in Western Europe, the United States sought permission to launch American warplanes from bases in Britain for attacks on Libya. Mrs. Thatcher granted it. The bombing destroyed the living quarters of the Libyan leader, Col.Muammar el-Qaddafi. Mrs. Thatcher's support for the mission outraged many Britons. But she said that terrorism demanded a united response.
Mrs. Thatcher had shown similar resolve at the Conservative Party conference in Brighton in 1984. On the evening of Oct. 12, as she worked on a speech in her hotel room, a bomb exploded on the floor below, killing four people and wounding more than 30. Among the dead was the wife of the Tories' chief whip, John Wakeham. A cabinet minister, Norman Tebbit, and his wife were wounded. The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility. The next day Mrs. Thatcher addressed the party as planned, declaring, ''All attempts to destroy democracy by terrorism will fail.''
Despite the sectarian violence, Northern Ireland was not high on her agenda. Mrs. Thatcher saw the troubles there as intractable and her policies as simply preserving the status quo.
She was more flexible over South Africa, where the struggle against institutionalized racism was growing more violent. Though she regarded apartheid as repugnant, she initially refused to impose economic sanctions on South Africa, arguing that apartheid would ultimately be undone by greater trade and the prosperity and yearnings for democracy that come with it. But pressured by other Commonwealth countries, she grudgingly reversed herself.
On another problem involving the British Empire's complex legacy, Mrs. Thatcher had more success, at least at first. In 1984, Britain reached an agreement with China over the fate of Hong Kong, which was to revert to China in 1997. Under a formula of ''one country, two systems,'' the political freedoms and economic structure of Britain's wealthiest colony would stand for 50 years, preserving Hong Kong's capitalist economy under a Communist state.
But in the turmoil after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, China, fearing a democratic Hong Kong's influence on the mainland, was far less amenable to granting the territory representative government. When the British governor, Chris Patten, handed over the colony to China in 1997, Hong Kong's political future remained uncertain.
The Cold War's End
''Some of these diplomatic minuets you have to go through I cannot stand,'' Mrs. Thatcher once said, by way of paying a compliment to Mr. Gorbachev. He forsook rhetoric for blunt realism, she said, and ''that suits me better.''
In the 1980s, the Soviet Union was rife with political disillusion and economic chaos. The Reagan administration sought to add pressure by moving ahead with high-tech weapons, including plans for the Strategic Defense Initiative, the space-based defense system known as Star Wars, which would in theory enable the United States to intercept incoming nuclear missiles.
Mr. Gorbachev was unalterably opposed to Star Wars, as were many in the West. Mrs. Thatcher was also against it, though she publicly supported it. At a White House meeting she warned that the project was a costly pipe dream. ''I am a chemist,'' she is said to have told the president. ''I know it won't work.''
But she changed her mind after being assured that Britain would receive a goodly share of the business in researching and developing the system. At a meeting in Washington in December 1984, she helped draft a position on Star Wars, later adopted by Mr. Reagan, that assured the Soviets that the program would enhance nuclear deterrence, not undercut it, and that it would not get in the way of arms control talks.
Nevertheless, it did. During a summit meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland, in October 1986, Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev came close to an agreement to ban nuclear weapons altogether. But when Mr. Gorbachev insisted first on an American promise to drop the Strategic Defense Initiative, Mr. Reagan refused, and the negotiations fell apart.
The president's position infuriated his critics. But many people in NATO and the Pentagon were relieved. ''The fact is that nuclear weapons have prevented not only nuclear war but conventional war in Europe for 40 years,'' Mrs. Thatcher said in a speech. ''That is why we depend and will continue to depend on nuclear weapons for our defense.''
Mrs. Thatcher did not fare so well in other battles. In the face of popular opposition, she retreated from plans to privatize the water industry and the National Health Service, replace college grants with a student loan program, cut back pensions and revamp the social security system. Many predicted she would not win a third term. But the economy continued to work in her favor. When she called an election for June 1987, the Tories were returned to power.
Third Term
That October, Wall Street crashed. In the following months, disagreements among the Tories over Britain's future in the European Community and a series of other events forced Mrs. Thatcher to surrender hard-fought gains.
She believed that linking the pound to other currencies would erode Britain's political independence. Mr. Lawson, her chancellor of the Exchequer, argued that it would be better to lay the groundwork for joining the European monetary system by tying the pound to the more stable German mark. Without telling the prime minister, Mr. Lawson, in January 1987, had informally begun to peg the pound to the mark.
Meanwhile, the government's tax-cutting and easy-credit policies fed an investment and housing boom, again fueling inflation. Mr. Lawson, reluctant to allow the value of the pound to rise above the ceiling he had imposed to keep it in range with the mark, ignored calls for higher interest rates. As his actions became apparent, the prime minister accused him of misleading her and warned that the practice had to stop.
But Mr. Lawson and his supporters saw the European monetary system not only as a step toward European integration but also as a safeguard against the kind of wide swings in the pound's value that had so disrupted Britain's economic health in the past. On this fundamental issue the Tories were split, the two sides set on a collision course.
As inflation rose, Mr. Lawson reversed himself and raised interest rates. The sudden effort to stanch the money flow threw Britain into recession. In October 1989, Mr. Lawson resigned, but many devoted Thatcherites admitted that she bore much of the blame.
Other misjudgments were laid at her door. In an effort to make the local authorities more accountable for the way they spent tax money, Mrs. Thatcher pushed through a measure that replaced property taxes with a ''poll tax'' on all adult residents of a community. The tax was intended to make everyone, not just property owners, pay for local government services. In practice, the measure was manifestly unfair and deeply unpopular. In March 1990, protests flared into riots. Within her own party, there was a growing feeling that the Iron Lady had become a liability.
The Fall
That November, tensions among the Tories exploded. The deputy prime minister, Geoffrey Howe, the last survivor of the original Thatcher cabinet of 1979, was known for his loyalty, though he disagreed with the prime minister's policy toward Europe. Now their differences came to a boil. At a cabinet meeting, ''Margaret was incredibly rude to Geoffrey,'' Kenneth Baker, another minister, recalled. ''It was the last straw for Geoffrey, and he resigned that night.''
The next day Michael Heseltine, a former defense minister who favored greater links with Europe, announced that he would challenge Mrs. Thatcher for the party leadership. On Nov. 20, as the prime minister was attending a summit meeting in Paris, the Tories took a vote. For Mrs. Thatcher, whose approval ratings in the polls were falling, the outcome was bleak: though she beat Mr. Heseltine, 204 votes to 152, under party rules her majority was not strong enough for her to keep her place.
The race, now wide open, took an unexpected turn. Mrs. Thatcher was awaiting results of the party ballot with her family and friends at 10 Downing Street when she learned that Mr. Heseltine had lost to the soft-spoken chancellor of the Exchequer,John Major, a protégé of hers. When someone said that her colleagues had done an awful turn, she replied, ''We're in politics, dear.''
Though vowing at first to ''fight on and fight to win'' the second ballot, she was persuaded to withdraw. After speaking to the queen, calling world leaders and making a final speech to the House of Commons, she resigned on Nov. 28, 1990, leaving 10 Downing Street in tears and feeling betrayed.
After leaving office, Mrs. Thatcher traveled widely and drew huge crowds on the lecture circuit. She sat in the House of Lords as Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven, wrote her memoir and devoted herself to the Margaret Thatcher Foundation, to further her values.
She remained forthright in expressing her opinions. During her final months in office, she had bolstered President George Bush in his efforts to build a United Nations coalition to oppose Iraq after it invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990. At the time of the invasion, Mrs. Thatcher was meeting with Mr. Bush and other world leaders at the Aspen Institute in Colorado. ''Remember, George,'' she is said to have told him, ''this is no time to go wobbly.''
In retirement, she continued to call for firmness in the face of aggression, advocating Western intervention to stop the ethnic bloodshed in the Balkans in the early 1990s. After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, she endorsed PresidentGeorge W. Bush's policy of sanctioning pre-emptive strikes against governments that sponsored terrorism. She also backed the war to oust the Iraqi leader,Saddam Hussein.
By then, according to her daughter, Mrs. Thatcher had begun to show signs of the dementia that would overtake her and become, to much criticism, the focus of ''Iron Lady,'' a 2011 film about her withMeryl Streepin the title role.
But while she was of sound mind, Mrs. Thatcher never let up on her anti-Europe views. ''In my lifetime, all the problems have come from mainland Europe, and all the solutions have come from the English-speaking nations across the world,'' she told the Conservative Party conference in 1999. Her words drew predictable outrage, but few doubted that Mrs. Thatcher, as usual, had meant exactly what she said.
She also did not shy from criticizing her successors' actions, including Mr. Major's handling of the economy. Her frankness often embarrassed the Tories. It seemed to many that Mrs. Thatcher preferred Labour's new leader,Tony Blair, to Mr. Major.
That perception was not surprising, since Mr. Blair's victory over Mr. Major in 1997 seemed in a curious way to emphasize the success of Mrs. Thatcher's policies. Mr. Blair led his ''New Labour'' party to victory on a platform that promised to liberate business from government restrictions, end taxes that discouraged investment and reduce dependence on the state.
Mrs. Thatcher's legacy, ''in most respects, is uncontested by the Blair government,'' Mr. Young, her biographer, said in a 1999 interview. ''It made rather concrete something she once said: 'My task will not be completed until the Labour Party has become like the Conservative Party, a party of capitalism.' ''

HEADLINE: Annette Funicello, 70, Dies; Beloved as a Mouseketeer And a Star of Beach Movies

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Annette Funicello, who won America's heart as a 12-year-old in Mickey Mouse ears, captivated adolescent baby boomers in slightly spicy beach movies and later championed people with multiple sclerosis, a disease she had for more than 25 years, died on Monday in Bakersfield, Calif. She was 70.
Her death, from complications of the disease, was announced on the Disney Web site.
As an adult Ms. Funicello described herself as ''the queen of teen,'' and millions around her age agreed. Young audiences appreciated her sweet, forthright appeal, and parents saw her as the perfect daughter. 
She was the last of the 24 original Mouseketeers chosen for ''The Mickey Mouse Club,'' the immensely popular children's television show that began in 1955, when fewer than two-thirds of households had television sets. Walt Disney personally discovered her at a ballet performance.
Before long, she was getting more than 6,000 fan letters a week, and was known by just her first name in a manner that later defined celebrities like Cher, Madonna and Prince.
Sometimes called ''America's girl next door,'' she nonetheless managed to be at the center of the action during rock 'n' roll's exuberant emergence. She was the youngest member of Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars tour, which included LaVern Baker, the Drifters, Bobby Rydell, the Coasters and Paul Anka. Mr. Anka, her boyfriend, wrote ''Puppy Love'' for her in her parents' living room.
As a Mouseketeer, she received a steady stream of wristwatches, school rings and even engagement rings from young men, all of which she returned. She wrote in her 1994 autobiography, ''A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes,'' that irate mothers often wrote back to say ''how hard Johnny or Tommy had worked to save the money for the gift and how dare I return it?''
She said that if she had charm (she undeniably had modesty), it was partly a result of her shyness. Mr. Disney begged her to call him Uncle Walt, but she could manage only ''Mr. Disney.'' (She could handle ''Uncle Makeup'' and ''Aunt Hairdresser.'')
At the height of her stardom, she said her ambition was to quit show business and have nine children.
With minor exceptions, like her commercials for Skippy peanut butter, Ms. Funicello did become a homemaker after marrying at 22. One reason, she said, was her reluctance to take parts at odds with her squeaky-clean image. She had three children.
Her cheerfulness was legendary. Her response to learning she had multiple sclerosis, a chronic disease of the central nervous system, was to start a charity to find a cure.
There was no irony, only warm good feeling, in her oft-repeated remark about the world's pre-eminent rodent: ''Mickey is more than a mouse to me. I am honored to call him a friend.''
Annette Joanne Funicello was born on Oct. 22, 1942, in Utica, N.Y., and as the first grandchild on either side of the family was indulged to the point of being, in her own words, a ''spoiled brat.'' At age 2, she learned the words to every song on the hit parade, her favorite being ''Ac-cent-tchu-ate the Positive.''
In 1946, her parents decided to move to Southern California in the hope of doing better economically. They lived in a trailer park until her father, a mechanic, found work. They settled in Studio City and later moved to Encino.
Annette took dancing lessons, learned to play drums and, at 9, was named Miss Willow Lake at a poolside beauty contest. She did some modeling. Mr. Disney, who wanted amateurs and not professional child actors, discovered her when she danced in ''Swan Lake'' at a local recital.
''The Mickey Mouse Club'' was instantly popular, generating orders for 24,000 mouse-eared beanies a day. Annette quickly became the most popular Mouseketeer, and Disney marketed everything from Annette lunchboxes and dolls to mystery novels about her fictionalized adventures.
But she did not receive special treatment. When she lost a pair of felt mouse ears, she was charged $55. It was deducted from her $185 weekly paycheck.
She once decided she wanted to change her last name to something more typically American. She chose Turner. But Mr. Disney, whom she considered a second father, convinced her that her own name would be more memorable once people learned it.
In 1958, as ''The Mickey Mouse Club'' was ending its run, Mr. Disney summoned Ms. Funicello to his office. She feared she was going to be fired for growing too tall, but instead he offered her a studio contract -- the only one given to a Mouseketeer.
Her first movie role was in ''The Shaggy Dog,'' Disney's first live-action comedy. Then came the television series ''Zorro.'' Next she was ''loaned out,'' in industry talk, to CBS to appear on the Danny Thomas sitcom ''Make Room for Daddy.'' She also pursued a recording career, and had two Top 10 singles: ''Tall Paul'' in 1959 and ''O Dio Mio'' in 1960.
She and her family continued living as they had, with her father working five days a week at a gas station and everyone pitching in to do housework. She was not allowed to date until she was 16. When her mother was asked how she was able to keep life so normal, she answered succinctly, ''Nothing impressed us.''
Ms. Funicello had crushes on her fellow singers Fabian Forte and Frankie Avalon but fell hard for Mr. Anka. ''As Paul wrote in his hit song about us,'' she wrote, ''just because we were 17 didn't mean that, for us, our love wasn't real.''
But their careers were increasingly busy, and time together was scant. When Ms. Funicello finally told Mr. Anka that she really cared for him, he replied, ''What script did you get that from?''
Her records continued, including the albums ''Hawaiiannette,'' ''Italiannette'' and ''Dance Annette.'' Movie parts included ''Babes in Toyland,'' in which she sang ''I Can't Do the Sum.'' (She actually could, as proved by her straight-A high school record.)
When Mr. Disney told her he had been approached by American International Pictures about her making a beach movie, he said he thought it sounded like ''good clean fun,'' but asked her not to expose her navel. She readily agreed.
She and Mr. Avalon ultimately starred in a series of beach movies together, beginning with ''Beach Party'' in 1963. She harbored no illusions that she and Mr. Avalon were the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers of their generation. ''Ma and Pa Kettle of the surf set,'' she suggested instead.
On Jan. 9, 1965, Ms. Funicello married her agent, Jack Gilardi. Charles M. Schulz, in his ''Peanuts'' comic strip, showed Linus reading a paper, clutching his security blanket and wailing: ''I can't stand it! This is terrible! How depressing. ... ANNETTE FUNICELLO HAS GROWN UP!''
She made a few films in the middle and late 1960s, including ''Fireball 500'' and ''Thunder Alley,'' but her attention was focused on her children, Gina, Jack Jr. and Jason Michael. During the 1970s and early 1980s, she appeared occasionally on TV but was known principally for commercials, including her memorable issuing of the Skippy peanut butter challenge: Which has more protein? (Bologna and fish were not the correct answers.)
In 1987, she and Mr. Avalon reunited to do a self-mocking beach party movie. She wore polka dots with matching hair bows, and he portrayed a work-obsessed car salesman who hates the beach. Their fictional son wore punk clothes and carried a switchblade.
But Ms. Funicello's main concern was being a good mom, her daughter, Gina, said. In a 1994 interview, she told In Style magazine that her mother ''was always there for car pools, Hot Dog Day and the PTA.''
In 1981 Ms. Funicello divorced Mr. Gilardi. In 1986 she married Glen Holt, a horse breeder. Mr. Holt, who cared for Ms. Funicello in her later years, survives her, along with her 3 children, 4 stepchildren, 12 grandchildren and 4 great-grandchildren.
Ms. Funicello learned she had M.S. in 1987 but kept her condition secret for five years. She announced the illness after becoming concerned that the unsteadiness the disease caused would be misinterpreted as drunkenness.
She set up the Annette Funicello Research Fund for Neurological Diseases and underwent brain surgery in 1999 in an attempt to control tremors caused by her disease.
But for many, Annette Funicello remained forever young, whether in mouse ears or a modest bathing suit. Some may even recognize a ditty from the long-ago television shows:
Ask the birds and ask the bees
And ask the stars above
Who's their favorite sweet brunette;
You know, each one confesses:
Annette! Annette! Annette!

HEADLINE: America's Most Profitable Export Is Cash

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: The currency of the United States remains very popular abroad, and the demand for $100 bills suggests that they are widely used in crime, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of "The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform - Why We Need It and What It Will Take." 
Two things I've heard my whole life that always seem within reach but have never occurred are that we will move to paperless offices and a cashless society. In theory, it seems simple enough; computers and the Internet should obviate the need for paper, and credit and debit cards and electronic bill pay should make cash superfluous. 
However, as we all know, we are no closer to a paperless office than we were at the dawn of the computer era. Same goes for the cashless society. As a new report from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco explains, cash has not only held its own against competitors but continues to grow in popularity. Measured in dollar terms, there is 42 percent more cash in circulation today than five years ago.
Among the reasons for the rise in cash holdings are convenience, dependability and anonymity. Another key factor is the decline in interest rates, which has reduced the opportunity cost of holding cash relative to such interest-earning assets as bank deposits, money market funds and Treasury bills.
Many economists believe that the rise in cash is strongly related to growth in the so-called underground economy - criminal activity such as drug dealing, as well as tax evasion by people working off the books for cash. Strong evidence for this proposition comes from examining the distribution of cash holdings by denomination.
As one can see, 84 percent of the increase in cash since 1990 has been in the form of $100 bills, which have risen to 77 percent of the value of cash outstanding in 2012 from 52 percent in 1990.
I seldom use $100 bills for anything except Christmas gifts to nieces and nephews, nor do I ever see people use them in stores. I suspect that most people have the same experience. For large purchases, most law-abiding people use checks or credit cards.
Studies and common sense suggest that those people most likely to use large bills are doing so for nefarious purposes, especially drug dealing. One can easily fit $1 million in $100 bills into a briefcase.
Another key factor has been the rising amount of United States currency being exported. The Federal Reserve estimates the annual flow of United States currency abroad as well as the total level of such currency, which is counted in the aggregate currency figures in the table above. (These data appear on Line 25 in Tables F.204 and L.204 in the Fed's Z.1 flow of funds release.)
One consequence of the rising share of United States currency held abroad is that it may distort analyses of the relationship between the money supply and economic activity. Many economists believe that inflation results largely, if not exclusively, from an increase in the money supply, much of which consists of currency, the rest being bank deposits, travelers checks and other forms of money. 
But if much of the money supply circulates abroad, then any analysis correlating the money supply to domestic economic activity may be distorted and provide false conclusions.
Incidentally, exports of cash appear in the Commerce Department's data on international transactions (Line 67). It is recorded as an increase in foreign-owned assets in the United States, but is better thought of as an almost costless way of financing a good chunk of our current account deficit. It's like borrowing money from foreigners that most likely will never have to be paid back, at zero interest.
Foreigners hold United States currency for the same reasons Americans do and may have better motives for doing so, especially in countries suffering severe financial problems such as Cyprus and Greece. Moreover, the continuing economic crisis in Europe has diminished the popularity of the euro even though it has the advantage of coming in 500-euro denominations, about $645 at current exchange rates, making it more compact and convenient for large cash transactions. 
However, some countries have withdrawn those notes as a crime-fighting measure, which has probably raised the popularity of the good old $100 bill. (United States $500 and larger bills are no longer produced and are withdrawn when found.)
According to a Federal Reserve study, the vast bulk of United States currency held abroad is $100 bills. Indeed, 65 percent of all $100 bills in existence circulate outside the United States.

HEADLINE: SeaWorld Seeks Up to $540 Million in I.P.O.

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: In an amended prospectus on Tuesday, SeaWorld Entertainment said it planned to sell 20 million shares at $24 to $27 apiece. 

 BODY:
The theme park operator SeaWorld Entertainment is looking to make a showy market debut, as it seeks to raise up to $540 million in its initial public offering. 
In an amended prospectus on Tuesday, the company said it planned to sell 20 million shares at $24 to $27 apiece. Half of the shares sold will come from its owner, the Blackstone Group.
At the midpoint of that range, SeaWorld would be valued at nearly $2.4 billion.
If the company - home to Shamu the killer whale and a few financially minded penguins - succeeds in meeting its fund-raising goal, its I.P.O. will be among the five biggest offerings in the United States this year, according to Renaissance Capital.
The theme park company, which Blackstone bought from Anheuser-Busch in 2009, is hoping to take advantage of a growing appetite for I.P.O.'s. Companies raised $22 billion in their trading debuts in the first quarter this year, up 27 percent from the period a year earlier, according to data from Thomson Reuters.
In nearly four years under private equity ownership, SeaWorld has increased its annual revenue by almost 17 percent, to $1.4 billion. Last year it earned $77 million, as its 11 parks drew in more visitors through an improving economy and more attractions. Though it draws the majority of its revenue from admissions, the company says it has also stepped up its merchandising and licensing efforts.
SeaWorld plans to list itself on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol SEAS. Blackstone will continue to own about 70.5 percent of the stock.

HEADLINE: Deficit Derangement Syndrome

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Doom at 90, and other misconceptions. 

 BODY:
This Dylan Matthews piece on the evils people perceive from deficits, and why they're almost all wrong, is a must-read. I would quibble with a few points - in particular, it really doesn't matter how much of our public debt foreigners own, what matters is our overall net international investment position (do we as a country owe more to foreigners than they owe to us). And I wish he'd made the no-crowding-out point in terms of the state of the economy, not just actual interest rates. But these are minor points, and the overall thrust of the piece is excellent. 
One thing I was really glad he took on was the Reinhart-Rogoff 90 percent = disaster stuff. He lays out the right critique - mainly, poorly performing economies tend to have high debt rather than the other way around - and gets a remarkably weak response from Reinhart:
Reinhart dismisses these criticisms as wishful thinking. "We're quite aware that you have causality going in both directions," she says. "But please point out to me what episodes from 1800 to the present have we had advanced economies who carried high levels of debt growing as rapidly or more rapidly than the norm." Belgium after World War I, she says, fits the bill, but that's basically it. "It's not about some exotic magic threshold where you cross the Rubicon," she says. "But high debt levels are like a weak immune system."
Gah. The fact is that there really aren't a lot of episodes in which advanced countries had high debt, and many of those episodes - like Japan or Italy in recent decades - are clearly associated with growth slowdowns that were happening for other reasons.Why, exactly, would you expect to see countries doing well have high debt in the first place?
The main exceptions are wars and their aftermath - and those can be problematic too. The original R-R paper highlighted slow growth just after World War II in the US - but that wasn't the burden of debt, it was the end of wartime mobilization, with Rosie the Riveter going back to being a housewife.
Look, here's a picture of British debt and growth since 1950. I show the debt level on the left axis, the 10-year forward per capita growth rate - Britain's rate of per capita growth in the 10 years after each date - on the right axis. If high debt were a huge problem for growth, you should have expected British performance in the first part of this figure to be terrible, since the country came out of WWII with debt twice as high as the R-R red line. You don't:
So back to Matthews: this whole deficit fever has been based on bad logic and weak evidence. I could have told you that from the beginning, and actually I did. But it's good to see the word getting out more widely.

BYLINE: BENJAMIN PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: The Bugatti Veyron Supersport was dethroned by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world&#8217;s fastest production car. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 Guinness World Records has pulled its world's fastest production car certification from the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport. The car, which broke the record when it hit 267.8 miles per hour on a July 2010 episode of Top Gear, was found to be in violation of Guinness' modification rules. A factory installed speed restrictor had reportedly been deactivated for the test, rendering the car effectively nonstock. The Sunday Times of London said the title would probably fall to Shelby SuperCars and its Ultimate Aero, which hit 256.1 m.p.h. before the Veyron claimed the record. Bugatti defended its record, offering doubts that a ding from Guinness would tarnish the supercar's reputation. (The Sunday Times) 
 Fisker Automotive, the embattled hybrid automaker, faces a lawsuit after laying off three quarters of its employees late last week. In a federal class-action suit, some of the 160 dismissed workers are seeking severance pay in accordance with the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. Plaintiffs also assert that Fisker also violated California labor laws by failing to inform the state unemployment office about the terminations. (Car Advice)
 Volkswagen has donated three new Passat wagons to a Northern Virginia volunteer fire department so firefighters can practice extracting victims from vehicles mangled in collisions. Rescue workers wasted no time ripping the new cars to pieces with the Jaws of Life. Typically, emergency departments rely upon quality control rejects for late model training, but a tough economy has made those cars rarer. (The Washington Post) 
 Although sales success of Mahindra & Mahindra's tiny Reva E-20 hasn't been stellar, the Indian automaker said it planned to build a larger, more powerful electric car for 2014. Based upon the Verito sedan, the new car will be midsized by Indian standards. (Forbes)
 Top ranked family cars typically aren't the fire-breathing monsters enthusiasts drool over in the pages of glossy car magazines. They're the practical, the mundane, the safe to operate. General Motors vehicles - relatively conservative models including the Chevrolet Cruze, Buick Verano and Chevrolet Traverse - performed solidly in this year's U.S. News and World Report rankings of the best cars, although results were roughly even between foreign and domestic manufacturers.

HEADLINE: Job Openings Rise, but Unemployment Stays High

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: There remains a strangely high unemployment rate relative to the job openings rate, at least when compared with the relationship these two variables had before the recession. 

 BODY:
The Labor Department has released its latest report on job openings and labor turnover today, which showed that job vacancies were at their post-recession high in February. But we still have a strangely high unemployment rate relative to the job openings rate, at least when compared with the relationship these two variables had before the recession began. 
The chart above is the Beveridge Curve, named for the British economist William Henry Beveridge. It shows the relationship between the unemployment rate and the job openings rate. As I also explained in an earlier post, during an expansion the jobless rate is low and the job vacancy rate is high; a small share of workers are looking for jobs, and so when employers post a vacancy, the opening can be hard to fill (or alternately, if there are a lot of jobs available, people will not have much trouble finding work, leading to low unemployment). 
In a recession, the reverse is true: there is a high unemployment rate and a low vacancy rate. Where you end up on the curve generally depends on where you are in the business cycle, but you will probably be somewhere on or near that line.
Since late 2009, though, the Beveridge Curve has shifted outward. That means that even though today's job market is not great, there are still more vacancies out there than the unemployment rate alone would have predicted a few years ago.
It's not clear why that's the case, but the answer probably involves some combination of skill mismatch; whether all the people who are calling themselves unemployed today might have done so in previous years; and hiring paralysis at firms that have vacancies but are afraid of making a hiring mistake in a still-uncertain economy.
One of the bright spots in today's Labor Department's report was that the quits rate (the number of people quitting divided by total employment) held steady at the peak for the recovery period so far. Janet Yellen, vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, recently said that she was looking for a pickup in the quits rate as a "signal that workers perceive that their chances to be rehired are good - in other words, that labor demand has strengthened."
Layoffs and discharges remain quite low; the problem in the job market remains too little hiring, not too much firing.
Here's a look at the ratio of quits to layoffs/discharges, which as you can see has been generally rising in the last four years:
The ratio peaked in August 2006, when there were 1.8 people quitting their jobs for each person laid off or discharged. It fell to 0.7 in April 2009, near the end of the recession, and is now about 1.4.

HEADLINE: Madison Square Garden Says It Will Not Be Uprooted From Penn Station

BYLINE: DAVID W. DUNLAP


HIGHLIGHT: The Garden&#8217;s 50-year permit expired in January, and there is opposition to its request for an indefinite extension of the permit, which is the subject of a City Planning Commission hearing on Wednesday. 

 BODY:
Madison Square Garden wants everyone to know: it isn't going anywhere.
"It is incongruous to think that M.S.G. would be considering moving," the Madison Square Garden Company said in a statement last month, especially as a three-year renovation, on which the company says it has spent $1 billion, is expected to be completed this fall. In other words, the announcement of the renovation in 2008 should have signaled that the Garden intended to stay put.
In one technical sense, however, its time has run out. 
The special permit that allows the company to operate an arena with more than 2,500 seats in mid-Manhattan expired on Jan. 24, exactly 50 years after it was granted. The arena, with a 22,000-seat capacity, has stayed open this year with a temporary certificate of occupancy.
On Wednesday, the City Planning Commission is to hold a public hearing on the Garden's request to extend its permit indefinitely (PDF).
"Virtually all special permits are granted without artificial expirations," the company said in a statement. "In addition to this, M.S.G. meets all required findings for this permit and operates in a city where no sports arena or stadium has a time limit to its use. Given these circumstances, we have the reasonable expectation that we will be treated like every other applicant." 
Reasonable or not, the company's expectations have not been met.
This juncture has emboldened advocates of a reimagined Pennsylvania Station to propose that the Garden's permit be renewed for only 10 years, thereby compelling everyone involved to come up with a plan for moving the arena off the station before the permit expires again.
They say there is no other way - besides lopping off the arena - to substantively improve Penn Station's main waiting concourse, which is the heart of the experience for both long-distance travelers and short-haul commuters. Amtrak and others have tried over the years, but the improvements were largely cosmetic.
The sentiment for binding the Garden and city planners to a tight timetable for solving the perennial inadequacies of Penn Station has picked up momentum.
On Feb. 15, Community Board 5 in Midtown voted 36 to 0 against granting a renewal in perpetuity and proposed the 10-year limit instead. On March 13, an editorial in The New York Times supported the 10-year limit, noting that the Garden had already moved twice since its days on Madison Square. On March 21, the Regional Plan Association and the Municipal Art Society announced the formation of the New Penn Station Alliance (PDF), one of whose immediate goals would be limiting the Garden to a 10-year permit.
In the most procedurally significant development to date, Scott M. Stringer, the borough president of Manhattan, on March 27 endorsed a 10-year limit. "Moving the arena is an important first step to improving Penn Station," he said. He focused on a constricted track and platform layout that cannot be significantly altered "since support columns for the arena run through Penn Station to its track level."
The borough president, like the community board, has a formal role in the city's land-use review process, though their decisions are not binding on the City Planning Commission or the City Council, which is the ultimate authority.
But Mr. Stringer's declaration did elicit the strongest public rebuttal yet from Madison Square Garden, in the form of a statement issued by Kimberly Kerns, the senior vice president for communications:
"The Garden - a company that has recently invested nearly $1 billion in its arena and helps drive the city's economy by supporting thousands of jobs and attracting hundreds of annual events - is being unfairly singled out because of a decision that was made 50 years ago: to demolish the original Penn Station.
"Adding an arbitrary expiration for reasons unrelated to the special permit process or requirements would not only set a dangerous and questionable precedent, but would also hinder our ability to make M.S.G. and New York City the long-term home of even more world-class events, and would harm a business that has served as a significant economic driver for the city for generations."
The question of why city planners limited the Garden in the first place is not explicitly answered by the original document (PDF), though those familiar with the commission's practices said it was standard at the time.
Mr. Stringer said the limit was imposed "largely out of concern" that the day might come when the station was no longer as underused as it seemed then. "The commission was correct," Mr. Stringer said, "ridership through Penn Station has more than tripled since 1963 and is now well over capacity."
It is possible to read the document and conclude that a 50-year term was chosen because Madison Square Garden Center Inc., the corporate predecessor to the Dolan family's present-day Madison Square Garden Company, did not own the arena but instead held a 50-year lease from the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. Today, however, the company owns the property outright, as it or its predecessors have since 1985.

HEADLINE: The Ad Campaign: Quinn and a 'Smoke-Filled Room'

BYLINE: MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: A television ad financed independent of candidates targets Christine C. Quinn in the campaign for mayor. The ad tries to portray Ms. Quinn as an elected official who works out of the public eye. 

 BODY:
The Race for City Hall
It is a fairly typical political advertisement: cheesy production values, overwrought narration and a soundtrack of ominous piano music playing over the unsmiling visage of the ad's target, Ms. Quinn. 
But "Smoke-Filled Room," which started to run on Monday on three cable television channels, has gained attention for its unusual provenance: it was financed by a group of political activists who are not affiliated with any candidate. The group, called NYC Is Not for Sale 2013, is legally allowed to spend unlimited amounts on political advertising, as long as it does not coordinate its activity with a candidate. The group's founders have pledged to spend more than $1 million on ads that attack Ms. Quinn - the first instance of a so-called independent expenditure in the 2013 mayor's race. 
The activists behind the ad include an animal-rights group that has long clashed with Ms. Quinn over horse-drawn carriages; a labor leader whose union has given money to Ms. Quinn and her rivals; and a wealthy businesswoman who has contributed to Ms. Quinn's campaign. So far, the group has declined to disclose a full list of its donors, although it will be required to do so by mid-May. 
Ms. Quinn has responded by calling the ad a "disgrace" and labeling it a troublesome intrusion of outside money into the city's stringent campaign finance system. On Tuesday, she asked her rivals for mayor to sign a pledge condemning the use of any independent expenditure in the campaign.
In an unusual move, Ms. Quinn's campaign lawyer also sent cease-and-desist letters to two New York television providers, Cablevision and Time Warner Cable, demanding that the advertisement be stopped. Ms. Quinn's campaign contended that it contained "a false statement"; the ad's creators say it is accurate. The ad continues to run.
Fact Check
 Real Estate Money?
The screen for "Smoke-Filled Room," the first television ad of the New York City mayor's race, opens on a room smothered in smoke, and the ad quotes from a 2011 column in The New York Times that described Christine C. Quinn as the recipient of "golden truckloads of contributions from the ... hedge fund and real estate set." Ms. Quinn has received about $1.3 million from real estate industry contributors, significantly more than any other candidate, according to a recent analysis. Ms. Quinn does not smoke cigarettes.
 'Living Wage' Battle
The narrator intones: "On the issues New Yorkers care most about, she is always on the wrong side." The ad cites a Daily News column asserting that Ms. Quinn, the City Council speaker, blocked a Council vote on the so-called living wage bill, which would raise the wages of workers at city-subsidized real estate projects. Ms. Quinn did block any vote on versions of this bill for months; she eventually supported compromise legislation that covered fewer workers than the initial proposal, and that exempted employees of a major real estate developer. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg vetoed the bill; the Council overrode the veto and is fighting a lawsuit filed by the Bloomberg administration to overturn the law.
 Term Limits and Paid Sick Leave
The narrator refers to Ms. Quinn's "flip-flop on paid sick leave and on term limits." For three years, Ms. Quinn stopped the Council from voting on legislation that would require some city businesses to provide paid days off to sick employees. Ms. Quinn said the city's economy could not sustain the added costs. But this year, under pressure, she negotiated a compromise, pleasing some advocates. On term limits, Ms. Quinn did reverse her position: in December 2007, she said she would "not support the repeal or change of term limits through any mechanism"; in October 2008, she led a successful effort in the Council to overturn the city's existing term limits law.

HEADLINE: With Popularity Fading at Home, Is Jindal the New Romney?

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: If Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana remains unpopular in his home state, how much does it hurt his chances of winning the 2016 Republican presidential nomination? 

 BODY:
Monday's article on the nation's least popular governors did not include Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, because he is not up for re-election in 2014. (Louisiana's next gubernatorial election will be in 2015, and Mr. Jindal will not be eligible, having served two consecutive terms.) But recent surveys suggest that Mr. Jindal has become very unpopular in his home state amid a series of battles on fiscal policy. A March poll from Southern Media & Opinion Research put Mr. Jindal's approval rating at just 38 percent, against 60 percent disapproval. His numbers had been similarly poor in a February survey by Public Policy Polling.
Some national political commentators are treating the news as being self-evidently injurious to Mr. Jindal's chances of capturing the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. Obviously, Mr. Jindal has plenty of time to turn around his image in Louisiana. But if he doesn't, would Republicans really consider nominating someone who is so deeply unpopular among his own constituents? 
Actually, you don't have to go back very far to find a precedent for when Republicans did exactly that. Their nominee last year, Mitt Romney, was very unpopular among Massachusetts voters by the time he finished his single term as governor in 2006.
The chart below tracks Mr. Romney's approval and favorability ratings during his term, based on data from PollingReport.com. Mr. Romney was reasonably popular throughout most of his tenure (as Mr. Jindal has been). But Mr. Romney numbers declined once he began to reposition himself as a candidate for national office (for instance, in gradually shifting his stance on abortion and contraception toward the right).
By late 2005, Mr. Romney badly trailed Massachusetts's attorney general, Thomas F. Reilly, then considered the leading Democratic nominee for the 2006 gubernatorial election, in head-to-head polling. Mr. Romney's polling did not improve any after he declined to run for a second term. Instead, the last poll conducted during his term, by The Boston Globe in October 2006, put his favorability rating at just 34 percent against a 54 percent unfavorable rating - similar to Mr. Jindal's numbers now.
There are differences, of course, between Mr. Romney's standing and Mr. Jindal's - notably that it is much more difficult for a Republican to be popular in Massachusetts than in Louisiana. Nevertheless, this ought to demonstrate that having strong approval ratings in one's home state is not a prerequisite for gaining the presidential nomination.
This is not to suggest that Mr. Jindal's approval ratings in Louisiana won't matter. It could constrain the way that he talks about his executive record. It could affect the way that local political reporters cover his candidacy, although how much that might spill over into national coverage is unclear. (Poor approval ratings at home might be more problematic for a candidate from an early-voting state like Iowa, New Hampshire or South Carolina, because reporters from those states can figure prominently in national coverage. It might also be problematic for a candidate from New York, New Jersey, Virginia or Maryland, because those states are in the national news media's figurative and literal backyards.)
What matters more is how prominent Republicans react to Mr. Jindal's home-state problems. The nomination process, especially at this early stage, is largely an insider's game. Will Republican thought-leaders and prominent conservative news and opinion outlets spin the news by praising Mr. Jindal as a principled champion of conservative fiscal policies? Will they compare Mr. Jindal to Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who became unpopular after curtailing public-sector unions, but whose image recovered enough for him to win a recall election?
Or will even conservative news outlets begin to treat Mr. Jindal as a candidate with "electability" issues? The Republican presidential field is liable to be more competitive in 2016 than in 2012. If Mr. Jindal's executive record is no longer seen as uniformly successful, it could reduce his comparative advantage against candidates like Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, who have some similar strengths to Mr. Jindal but who lack his executive experience.
And what about the precedent established by Mr. Romney? It is a favorable example for Mr. Jindal in the sense of demonstrating that a candidate can be nominated despite poor home-state approval ratings. But Republicans may not see it that way if they regard Mr. Romney as having been a poor nominee. Instead, they may seek out a candidate whom they perceive as nimble and skilled enough to push the policy window toward the right without sacrificing his popularity - perhaps someone like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.
None of this is to address the question of whether home-state popularity is in fact a leading indicator of how a candidate will come to be seen by voters elsewhere in the country. My personal view is that you could do a lot worse for reference points - local voters have a lot more information on a candidate. But I haven't seen much research on the topic, and it is easy to think of some contrary examples (for instance, Sarah Palin was very popular in Alaska in 2008 but played poorly on the national stage).
Mr. Jindal's home-state troubles are a reminder, however, that it can be difficult for a candidate to serve in an executive role and to position himself for national office at the same time. There was a series of active governors nominated by the parties between 1988 and 2000 (Michael S. Dukakis, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush). But there have been none since. Mr. Romney was a former governor but was almost six years removed from office at the time of his nomination and talked little about his executive record in either the primaries or the general election. 
As the parties have become more nationalized, demanding greater ideological fealty from their candidates, sitting governors may face an unpleasant choice between working to preserve their standing among their constituents while alienating national party leaders - or pursuing a national agenda at the price of their home-state popularity.

HEADLINE: Lifted by Gun Control Issue, Democrat Wins House Seat

BYLINE: By STEVEN YACCINO

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- Robin Kelly, whose stance on stricter federal gun laws brought a cascade of ''super PAC'' support to her campaign earlier this year, easily won the Congressional seat resigned by Jesse L. Jackson Jr. in a special election here Tuesday.
Facing a lesser-known Republican opponent, Paul McKinley, and a handful of third-party candidates, Ms. Kelly had been widely expected to win in the Democrat-leaning district, which includes the South Side of Chicago and its suburbs. She was expected to be sworn in by the end of the week to represent a community that has been without a voice in the House for nearly a year. 
''We not only won an election,'' Ms. Kelly, 56, said in her victory speech. ''We took on the N.R.A., we gave a voice to the voiceless, and we put our communities on a brand new path to a brighter day.'' She was joined on a stage by the parents of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old girl who was killed in Chicago gun violence in January, a week after performing during President Obama's inauguration festivities.
Ms. Kelly prevailed in a more competitive primary battle in February -- aided by Michael R. Bloomberg, the mayor of New York City and a staunch gun control supporter -- that thrust her unexpectedly into the spotlight amid a national debate over firearms. She now carries with her to Washington sizable public expectations.
''I think she has no choice but to be one to stand up and be one of the more vocal members of Congress around the issue of guns,'' said Representative Bobby L. Rush of Illinois, one of Ms. Kelly's new Democratic colleagues. ''I think for her to lowball that would be a mistake. It would be sending mixed signals to her constituents.''
Illinois's Second Congressional District seat was left vacant for the first time in almost two decades after Mr. Jackson, 48, took a medical leave last summer and later disclosed that he was being treated for bipolar disorder. Despite a long absence from public view, the congressman won re-election in November, only to resign two weeks later, citing his ill health and acknowledging a federal investigation into his use of campaign funds for personal use.
In February, Mr. Jackson, son of the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, the civil rights activist, pleaded guilty to one felony fraud count and admitted to using $750,000 in campaign cash to buy items like celebrity memorabilia and expensive furniture. His sentencing was scheduled for June 28.
Framed by a rash of violence in Chicago, the primary race to replace Mr. Jackson gained widespread attention because of an unexpected surge of spending by Mr. Bloomberg. His political action committee, Independence USA, ran more than $2 million worth of advertisements in the special election attacking some Democratic candidates for being friendly with the National Rifle Association. He endorsed Ms. Kelly, who wore her ''F'' rating by the gun lobby proudly.
Mr. Bloomberg's group said it had not spent in the general election.
Representative Jan Schakowsky, another Illinois Congressional Democrat, said, ''I think she understands that her victory had implications beyond the Second District and beyond Illinois when it comes to gun violence.''
Some former colleagues from Ms. Kelly's days in the state legislature said they were surprised to watch guns emerge as her chief campaign issue this year. While they acknowledged that she had backed gun restrictions, issues like education, economic development and domestic violence bills stood out in their minds as some of her more passionate pursuits at the time.
''It seemed that forces outside her control really created this issue to be the issue of the race,'' said Representative Aaron Schock, an Illinois Republican who served with Ms. Kelly in the legislature and will again be her colleague in Congress.
Ms. Kelly had been part of a passionate gun debate before. She has had some victories, including a 2003 measure criminalizing the practice of buying a gun for someone else in some circumstances. The bill was co-sponsored by Barack Obama, then a state senator. President Obama endorsed Ms. Kelly last week.
But she has also taken her share of legislative bruises. Almost a decade ago, as lawmakers in Illinois debated whether to ban assault weapons, Ms. Kelly, a sponsor of one such bill, would often retire to a nearby restaurant after a hard day on the House floor, spooning at an order of ice cream while nursing her wounds.
''We'd sit there and talk about how we got creamed for the day,'' said Alderman Deborah L. Graham, a former state representative who sponsored some gun-related bills with Ms. Kelly. ''Sometimes we'd be there, and we'd almost be in tears because the debates had been so extreme.''

HEADLINE: New Guidelines Call for Broad Changes in Science Education

BYLINE: By JUSTIN GILLIS

 BODY:
Educators unveiled new guidelines on Tuesday that call for sweeping changes in the way science is taught in the United States -- including, for the first time, a recommendation that climate change be taught as early as middle school.
The guidelines also take a firm stand that children must learn about evolution, the central organizing idea in the biological sciences for more than a century, but one that still provokes a backlash among some religious conservatives. 
The guidelines, known as the Next Generation Science Standards, are the first broad national recommendations for science instruction since 1996. They were developed by a consortium of 26 state governments and several groups representing scientists and teachers.
States are not required to adopt them, but 26 states have committed to seriously considering the guidelines. They include Arizona, Arkansas, California, Iowa, Kansas and New York. Other states could also adopt the standards.
Educators involved in drawing them up said the guidelines were intended to combat widespread scientific ignorance, to standardize teaching among states, and to raise the number of high school graduates who choose scientific and technical majors in college, a critical issue for the country's economic future.
The focus would be helping students become more intelligent science consumers by learning how scientific work is done: how ideas are developed and tested, what counts as strong or weak evidence, and how insights from many disciplines fit together into a coherent picture of the world.
Leaders of the effort said that teachers may well wind up covering fewer subjects, but digging more deeply into the ones they do cover. In some cases, traditional classes like biology and chemistry may disappear entirely from high schools, replaced by courses that use a case-study method to teach science in a more holistic way.
In many respects, the standards are meant to do for science what a separate set of guidelines known as the Common Core is supposed to do for English and mathematics: impose and raise standards, with a focus on critical thinking and primary investigation. To date, 45 states and Washington have adopted the Common Core standards.
''This is a huge deal,'' said David L. Evans, the executive director of the National Science Teachers Association. ''We depend on science in so many aspects of our lives. There's a strong feeling that we need to help people understand the nature of science itself, as an intellectual pursuit.''
The climate and evolution standards are just two aspects of a set of guidelines containing hundreds of new ideas on how to teach science. But they have already drawn hostile commentary from conservative groups critical of mainstream scientific thinking.
For instance, as the standards were being drafted, a group called Citizens for Objective Public Education, which lists officers in Florida and Kansas, distributed a nine-page letter attacking them. It warned that the standards ignored evidence against evolution, promoted ''secular humanism,'' and threatened to ''take away the right of parents to direct the religious education of their children.''
In many states, extensive scientific instruction does not begin until high school. The guidelines call for injecting far more science into the middle grades, with climate change being one among many topics. In high school, students would learn in more detail about the human role in generating emissions that are altering the planetary climate.
While thousands of schools in the United States already teach climate change to some degree, they are usually doing it voluntarily, and often in environmental studies classes. In many more schools, the subject does not come up because students are not offered those specialized courses, and state guidelines typically do not require that the issue be raised in traditional biology or chemistry classes.
Advocates of climate literacy hailed the new standards, saying they could fill a critical gap in public awareness.
''Quite simply, students have a right to know about climate science and solutions,'' said Sarah Shanley Hope, the executive director of the Alliance for Climate Education, which offers one-day programs in schools.
Many states are expected to adopt the guidelines over the next year or two, but it could be several years before the guidelines are translated into detailed curriculum documents, teachers are trained in the material and standardized tests are revised.
And all of this has to happen at a time when state education departments and many local schools are under severe financial strain. Inevitably, educators said, some states will do it better than others.
The other states that helped draw up the guidelines were Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington and West Virginia. The organizations included the National Science Teachers Association, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Research Council and Achieve, a nonprofit education group that helped develop the earlier common standards in mathematics and English. Financing was provided by private foundations, including the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Noyce Foundation and the Cisco Foundation, as well as DuPont.
Outlining how the standards might change science classrooms, educators said they foresaw more use of real-world examples, like taking students to a farm or fish hatchery -- perhaps repeatedly, over the course of years -- to help them learn principles from biology, chemistry and physics.
Educators want to introduce students to topics that can be made comprehensible only by drawing on the ideas and methods of many scientific disciplines, one of the reasons climate change and other large-scale environmental problems are seen as holding so much potential in the classroom.
Some teachers are already ahead of the curve.
Judith Luber-Narod, a high-school science teacher at the Abby Kelley Foster Charter Public School in Worcester, Mass., has incorporated climate change into her environmental studies classes, even though she teaches in a somewhat conservative area.
''I hesitated a little bit talking about something controversial,'' she said. ''But then I thought, how can you teach the environment without talking about it?''
Her students, on the other hand, love topics some deem controversial, she said. She devised an experiment in which she set up two terrariums with thermometers and then increased the level of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, in one of them.
The students watched as that terrarium got several degrees hotter than the other.
''I say to them, 'I'm here to show you the evidence,' '' she said. '' 'If you want to believe the evidence when we're done, that's up to you.' ''

HEADLINE: Before Meeting Syria Opposition, Kerry Says U.S. Is Considering More Support

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON and ISABEL KERSHNER; Michael R. Gordon reported from London, and Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem.

 BODY:
LONDON -- On the eve of a meeting with the Syrian opposition, Secretary of State John Kerry said Tuesday that the Obama administration was weighing ''stepped-up'' efforts to support the rebel fighters, and that such proposals had been ''front and center'' in administration discussions over the past week.
Mr. Kerry said that the Obama administration still favored a diplomatic solution in which President Bashar al-Assad would hand over power to a transitional government, but that additional pressure on the Syrian leader was needed. 
''The problem is you can't get there if President Assad is unwilling to decide that he should transfer that authority, and that's the current situation,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''So we are left with no choice but to try to find ways to get him to think differently about what lies in the future.''
Mr. Kerry made the remarks at a news conference at Ben-Gurion International Airport in Israel as he completed three days of meetings with Israeli and Palestinian officials.
Britain, the third stop on Mr. Kerry's six-nation trip, is hosting a meeting of foreign ministers from the Group of 8 advanced industrial nations, who are expected to discuss the Syrian war and Iran's nuclear program, among other issues.
William Hague, the British foreign secretary, is holding a lunch meeting Wednesday with representatives of the Syrian opposition, including Ghassan Hitto, a Syrian-born naturalized American citizen who was recently picked by the opposition coalition to serve as prime minister of an interim government.
Moaz al-Khatib, the president of the opposition coalition, who recently tendered his resignation only to have it rejected, is not expected to attend, a senior State Department official said.
Britain has been among the most forceful advocates of increased support to the armed Syrian opposition and has already committed to providing nonlethal support like body armor and communications equipment.
The Obama administration has not provided such extensive support to the rebels. At a conference in Rome in late February, Mr. Kerry said the United States would be providing food rations and medical supplies to the Free Syrian Army, as the armed Syrian opposition is known. That assistance has yet to be delivered, but is expected to be provided soon.
Mr. Kerry's remarks on Tuesday suggested that the United States was actively discussing the expansion of nonlethal support.
A senior American official in Washington, who asked not to be identified because he was discussing internal deliberations, confirmed that the Obama administration was moving to increase the nonlethal support. But the official said the details of what might be provided had yet to be decided.
Touching on another regional issue of concern, Mr. Kerry said the administration had been hoping for a more responsive proposal from Iran on its nuclear program in the last round of talks between Iran and six world powers in Almaty, Kazakhstan, last week.
He said that an announcement by Iran on Tuesday that it was starting production at two uranium mines and at a plant that makes yellowcake, a semirefined form of uranium, was provocative and raised questions, and that the negotiations could not be open-ended.
The focus of Mr. Kerry's trip to Israel and the West Bank was on finding a way to revive Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. To improve the atmosphere for peace talks, Mr. Kerry said he had proposed an initiative to promote economic development in the West Bank, which would ''begin to take hold immediately.''
While details of the plan are to be made public next week, he said it would combine investment by American corporations with efforts by American government agencies like the Export-Import Bank, the Agency for International Development and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.
Mr. Kerry emphasized that business expansion in the West Bank was not a substitute for the political track, but was meant to enhance it.
He said his meetings with Israeli and Palestinian leaders had been productive. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said on Tuesday that he was ''determined to not only resume the peace process with the Palestinians, but to make a serious effort to end this conflict once and for all.''
But these were talks about how to resume talks after a hiatus of years, and a breakthrough did not appear to be imminent.
''I think we are at the pre-breakthrough stage,'' a senior Israeli official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly.
Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, left on Monday for Doha, Qatar, to attend a meeting of the Arab League's Middle East peace follow-up committee. The league is sending a delegation of Arab foreign ministers to Washington this month to discuss the peace process with American officials.
There has been talk of an effort to revive the Arab Peace Initiative, a plan the Arab League first adopted in 2002. It called for ''full Israeli withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied since June 1967,'' including the Golan Heights, captured from Syria, and for Israel's acceptance of an independent Palestinian state, with East Jerusalem as its capital, in return for establishment of normal relations between Israel and the Arab countries.
It also called for a ''just solution'' to the Palestinian refugee problem in accordance with Resolution 194 of the United Nations General Assembly, on which the Palestinians base their demand for a right of return, a demand rejected by Israel.
There have been suggestions that some clauses of the plan should be modified to make it more palatable to Israel.
The Israeli official said of the Arab Peace Initiative: ''It is a step forward in the right direction. If it is presented as 'take it or leave it,' like a diktat, then obviously Israel has problems with that. But if it is used as a vehicle for strengthening the peace process, that could be very positive.''
Mr. Kerry said that as a free-standing plan, the Arab Peace Initiative constituted an ''important contribution to the overall dialogue.''

HEADLINE: Inventories Fall as Sales Rise, A Hint That Goods Are Needed

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wholesalers reduced their inventories in February by the most in 17 months. But their sales jumped, suggesting that businesses had underestimated consumer demand.
The Commerce Department said Tuesday that inventories at the wholesale level declined 0.3 percent in February. That followed a 0.8 percent increase in January, which was revised lower. 
The decline was the first in eight months and the biggest since September 2011. Farm products and gasoline led the drop. Agriculture stockpiles have fallen in recent months because of a drought in the Midwest.
Sales at the wholesale level rose 1.7 percent, the most since November. The increase was led by large gains in gasoline, clothes and computers.
Shrinking inventories weigh on economic growth because it means factories are producing fewer goods. But a jump in consumer spending in February suggests companies will have to build their inventories faster in the coming months, which should spur more growth.
Sluggish growth in inventories was a major reason the economy barely grew in the October-December quarter. But economists are looking for a significant rebound in business restocking this year, helped by a resilient consumer who has continued to spend despite paying higher taxes.
Most economists expect that growth accelerated in the January-March quarter to an annual rate of more than 3 percent. That would be a considerable improvement over the 0.4 percent growth in the final three months of 2012.
Americans spent more in January and February. Many analysts now expect consumer spending rose by about 3 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter. That would be much faster than the fourth quarter's 1.8 percent pace.
The jump in spending will most likely force many companies to order more goods to restock shelves

HEADLINE: Canadian Visits U.S. To Promote Oil Pipeline

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Alison Redford, the premier of the Canadian province that is home to the oil sands formations that would supply the proposed Keystone XL pipeline to the United States, said Tuesday that critics of the project had distorted its environmental effects and exaggerated the impact of developing the oil.
Ms. Redford, who as the premier of Alberta is the province's top government official, was on her fourth trip to Washington in 18 months to lobby on behalf of the intensely contested project. In a speech at the Brookings Institution, she said opponents of the 1,700-mile pipeline were ''far from reality'' about its environmental costs. 
''They proclaim that either you stand against the oil sands, or you write off the environment, along with any hope for a sustainable existence,'' said Ms. Redford, a lawyer and human rights adviser before being elected Alberta's premier in October 2011. ''That is completely wrong.''
She said the critics' central argument -- that without the pipeline Alberta's oil would remain in the ground -- was unrealistic.
''We're an exporting economy,'' she said, insisting that the billions of barrels of heavy crude known as bitumen embedded in tarlike formations will be exploited with or without the pipeline. ''Alberta does have other options,'' she said, including pipeline or overland transport to Canada's Atlantic or Pacific coasts or even to the Arctic Ocean.
Opponents and backers of the pipeline are stepping up organizing and advertising campaigns seeking to sway public and political opinion. The State Department is conducting a review to determine whether the much-delayed $7 billion project is in the national interest. President Obama, who will make the ultimate decision and for now appears to be leaning toward approving the pipeline, has given no timeline for action, although most expect an answer by midsummer.
A new group calling itself the All Risk, No Reward Coalition began a television advertising campaign this week highlighting the environmental dangers of oil pipelines. The group's 30-second commercial calls attention to the recent spill of oil sands crude from a decades-old pipeline in Arkansas.
''It's happened before, and now again,'' the script says. The advertisement also notes that much of the oil that would travel through the pipeline would be refined at Gulf Coast facilities and then exported. ''Keystone XL doesn't go to the U.S.; it goes through the U.S.,'' the spot says.
Rachel Wolf, a spokeswoman for the group, said Ms. Redford should stop trying to influence policy makers and pay a visit to Arkansas families displaced by the recent spill.
''It's less than 600 miles from Mayflower, Ark., to the pipeline route through Nebraska -- so perhaps she should make stops at both to see the true devastation of a tar sands spill and the risks that families would face before she schedules another speaking engagement promoting the pipeline,'' Ms. Wolf said in a statement.
On the other side, the American Petroleum Institute and construction unions, who would benefit from the roughly 4,000 temporary jobs if the pipeline was approved, announced a print and online advertising campaign promoting the project's economic and employment benefits. ''Keystone XL is more than a pipeline,'' the ads proclaim. ''It's a lifeline.''
The groups are also sponsoring rallies along the pipeline route.
Ms. Redford acknowledged that pipeline spills occur, but said the proposed 36-inch-diameter Keystone XL pipeline would be safer and more technologically advanced than existing pipelines.
''We have to be honest about the fact if we do have energy development, there really is the risk of unfortunate incidents happening -- and it is a risk,'' she said. ''But these are very isolated incidents, and they don't happen as often as people might suggest that they could.''
She said other means of transport -- rail, truck, river barge -- were far less safe and much more environmentally damaging than pipelines.
Ms. Redford also asserted that developing the oil sands would have a negligible impact on global warming, a claim disputed by opponents of the project, who say the high carbon content of the crude has the potential to disrupt the global climate.
Several anti-Keystone demonstrators were ejected from Ms. Redford's speech after silently raising placards asserting that her claims were false.

HEADLINE: Lots of Federal Property to Sell, but It's Not That Easy

BYLINE: By EUGENE L. MEYER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As government agencies are forced to do more with less, the General Services Administration has stepped up its efforts to dispose of surplus government buildings across the country in new and more profitable ways, instead of simply auctioning them off.
In an effort to streamline operations, the G.S.A., the federal government's landlord, has sold hundreds of buildings since 2010. But in the last several months it has been working with private developers to negotiate land swaps that reduce the government's real estate portfolio while consolidating offices and saving money for taxpayers. The goal, the agency's acting administrator, Dan M. Tangherlini, wrote in a staff memorandum, is ''to maximize the value of our real estate assets and reduce our federal footprint.''
The federal government owns about 14,000 excess buildings and other structures, and the G.S.A. is working to dispose of them. 
The strategy is evident here, where a proposed land swap involving the 40-year-old F.B.I. building last month yielded 35 formal expressions of interest, and in Miami and Los Angeles, where plans are under way to replace and dispose of two old federal courthouses. ''What we've seen is more attention and focus put on this activity, in part because of fiscal constraints across the government,'' Mr. Tangherlini said. ''At G.S.A., we are asking ourselves if there are other ways to speed the process of disposal and get positive outcomes as a result.''
Dorothy Robyn, the Public Buildings Service commissioner for the G.S.A., said at a public meeting on the F.B.I. building in January that ''functionally,'' much of the government's property, with an average age of 47 years, is ''out of date.'' But despite government efforts to sell obsolete or surplus properties quickly, the process has sometimes bogged down in political, technical and economic issues.
The federal courthouses in Miami and Los Angeles were long overdue for replacement, but how to do it cheaply and efficiently and what to do with the old structures have presented challenges.
Disposing of the David W. Dyer Federal Building and United States Courthouse in Miami has proved to be far more complicated than expected. Built in 1933 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, the 170,000-square-foot Mediterranean Revival structure was vacated in 2008 when a new court building was completed. The G.S.A.'s initial plan to renovate the older courthouse for continued use as a federal building was scrapped because of the $60 million cost. When the G.S.A. sought expressions of interest in the building last August, only two responses came in, neither acceptable to the agency.
One of the proposals came from Miami Dade College, which wanted to convert the old four-story courthouse, across the street from the college, into an educational and cultural center. But the courthouse is connected to another courthouse, and they share a courtyard. Separating the utilities and dividing secure areas from nonsecure ones in the buildings could cost nearly $15 million, which the G.S.A. said it would not pay.
''I don't see we have any budget for that,'' said Juan C. Mendieta, a spokesman for Miami Dade College. ''We have a pretty challenging budgetary situation here in Florida.''
At a House subcommittee hearing in Miami in March, John E. B. Smith, the Public Buildings Services commissioner for the Southeast Sunbelt Region, testified that ''the Dyer courthouse helps highlight the challenges of developing long-term asset strategies in changing fiscal times, and the unique characteristics of properties that can present hurdles to repositioning.''
The swapping strategy being applied to the F.B.I. building, where a developer will get the old headquarters in return for building replacement headquarters elsewhere in the region, is now also being tested in Los Angeles.
For years, federal judges, citing security concerns, have been pushing for a new building to replace the late 1930s courthouse on North Spring Street. In December, the G.S.A. awarded a $318 million contract to Clark Construction, of Bethesda, Md., to build a 550,000-square foot courthouse at another city location.
At the same time, the G.S.A. solicited ''creative development ideas'' for the old courthouse, which it said it hoped a developer would acquire in exchange for building federal offices in Los Angeles for other agencies. The G.S.A.'s ''request for information'' elicited four responses by the Feb. 11 deadline.
''Really, all I need is one or two good ones to get a sense of what the market's interested in,'' Mr. Tangherlini said.
Before a federal property can be offered for sale, several hurdles must be cleared. One major constraint is a requirement that federal, state and local government agencies must first be given the opportunity to acquire it. Then, under the 1987 McKinney-Vento Act, the property must also be made available to shelter the homeless. In addition, federal environmental and historic preservation reviews are required. Only then can properties be sold to private entities.
To simplify things, the Obama administration proposed streamlining legislation in 2011 to create a civilian board modeled after the military's Base Realignment and Closure Commission. A Republican version of the bill passed the House last year, but the Senate has yet to act. ''Both houses of Congress and the administration are agreeing in principle,'' Mr. Tangherlini said. ''It seems to be that's at least the three key ingredients you need to get anything done in this town.''
Ron Kendall, a real estate consultant and a former chief asset officer at G.S.A., said: ''This is a perennial stalking horse for many administrations. Everyone comes in with high hopes there's gold in them there hills, unbelievable stashes of federal property bureaucrats are just sitting on.'' However, he added, the agency's Public Buildings Service ''has done a lot to right its ship.''
Since 2010, the G.S.A. has sold 352 properties, including 114 in 2012, totaling $37.5 million in sales last year alone. Properties sold at auction included a federal building in Moscow, Idaho, for $2.4 million, and the Charleston Naval Hospital, in South Carolina, for $2 million. The city of North Charleston, which bought the hospital, soon sold it to a private developer for $9.2 million, after packaging it with more land and an old shopping center it owned.
But straight auctioning of properties is not always a fast track to disposal. The 1940s Art Deco-style West Heating Plant, in the Georgetown section of Washington, sat unused for more than a decade before being sold in February for $19.5 million. The Levy Group and Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, who made the successful bid among five offers, plan a $100 million renovation of the six-story, 93,078-square foot building, which they intend to convert into 70 to 80 condominium units.
Richard Levy, president of the Levy Group, a commercial real estate development firm based here, said he first considered the property 13 years ago and renewed his interest in 2010, when Four Seasons, based in Toronto, also expressed interest. Despite what he described as a ''cumbersome process,'' he said he and his partners were determined. ''G.S.A. is required to jump through hoops,'' he said. ''They're not poised for a quick turnaround.''
Mr. Tangherlini said that, even with the auction route: ''It's not as simple as pointing to an empty building and saying 'We're not using it anymore; let's just sell it.' And we have to make sure we're not just putting up 'for sale' signs left and right.''

HEADLINE: Emerging Asian Economies on Track for Solid Growth, Development Bank Says

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The economies of developing Asia appear to have settled into a new growth path that will allow the region to expand by between 6 percent and 7 percent a year -- a pace that is significantly slower than that seen before the global financial crisis, yet represents a firm trajectory that could last over the next decade. 
''It looks like we're in a new trend,'' said Changyong Rhee, the chief economist of the Asian Development Bank, which on Tuesday released its new forecasts for emerging Asia. The region spans developing countries like China, India, Indonesia and Thailand, but not Japan.
After relatively muted growth last year, when the region expanded by 6.1 percent, developing Asia is expected to pick up speed again with growth of 6.6 percent this year and 6.7 percent next year, according to the bank's projections.
''The era of double-digit growth is over,'' Mr. Rhee said. But, he added in an interview in Hong Kong, the United States is showing signs of recovery, and the euro zone likely to ''muddle through'' its debt crisis for the foreseeable future. That backdrop leaves developing Asia enjoying a relatively stable growth that was not yet visible just six months ago, when the development bank made its last projections for the region.
Faster growth in China -- by far the region's largest economy -- and what Mr. Rhee called the ''remarkable'' resilience of southeast Asian economies have been the main drivers of growth there growth, lifting domestic consumption and intraregional trade, and in the process also reducing the region's reliance on the world's advanced, and slower-growing, economies.
Growth, however, will be very uneven, with China likely to grow at between 7 percent and 8 percent; the Asean region, comprising countries like Thailand and Malaysia, growing around 5 percent; and more developed economies like Hong Kong, Singapore or Taiwan expanding at little more than 3 percent.
Moreover, events in other parts of the world continue to pose major potential risks to Asia.
Among them, the development bank said, are the wrangling over the U.S. debt ceiling and the struggles to implement austerity measures in Europe. Border disputes within Asia, potential asset bubbles inflated by the monetary stimulus efforts of the world's developed economies, and the possible reversal of capital inflows once that monetary stimulus ends also represent risks to Asia.
The Asian Development Bank also issued a stark warning on Asia's rapidly growing energy needs. The region, the bank said, is moving along a ''dangerously unsustainable energy path'' that ''could result in environmental disaster'' and increase the region's reliance on the oil-exporting nations of the Middle East.
''Asia could be consuming more than half the world's energy supply by 2035, and without radical changes carbon dioxide emissions will double,'' Mr. Rhee said. ''Asia must both contain rising demand and explore cleaner energy options, which will require creativity and resolve, with policymakers having to grapple with politically difficult issues like fuel subsidies and regional energy market integration.''

HEADLINE: World's Tech Companies Look to Brussels to Resolve Antitrust Complaints

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- When the European competition commissioner needs to communicate with the chairman of Google, he doesn't have to send an emissary or even pick up the phone.
Joaquín Almunia sometimes sends Eric E. Schmidt a text.
Like his predecessors, Mr. Almunia has the power to block mergers or fine companies billions of dollars. But where he differs is in how comfortable he is in communicating with executives across the table -- or the ocean -- to negotiate settlements that avoid long battles. 
''I have an open phone line, or e-mail line, or SMS line at any moment,'' Mr. Almunia said in an interview Monday.
Mr. Almunia, 64, served as the European Union's commissioner for economic and monetary affairs before being appointed four years ago as the bloc's competition commissioner. The post is likely to be his last job in Brussels and he does not foresee a return to politics in Spain, where he led the Socialists to defeat in 2000 before resigning as party leader.
But the formal complaint that recently hit his desk, focusing on how Google runs its mobile software business, is the latest sign that Mr. Almunia remains the go-to figure for antitrust enforcement in the world's technology sector.
That complaint, filed by a coalition of companies including Microsoft and Nokia, accuses Google of using the Android mobile operating system to promote its own products and services in a majority of smartphones sold to consumers.
Mr. Almunia still must decide whether to take up the new complaint, which landed just as he appeared to be reaching the final stages of settlement talks with Google over the way it conducts its search and advertising business. But the case is growing in importance, given the rise of mobile computing.
In recent years, the European Commission has become a defender of fair play in computing and communications, even as regulatory bodies with far more experience -- notably those in the United States -- have grown squeamish about using antitrust law to pry concessions from some of the world's most dynamic companies. Unlike his American counterparts, Mr. Almunia can decide punishments without judicial approval.
He has made a point of avoiding public showdowns with chief executives, or seemingly endless litigation. Indeed, he has made negotiation, rather than confrontation, a hallmark of his term in office to avoid dust-ups with giants like Microsoft and Intel, which were the subject of bitter, decade-long investigations. The change of approach has been most noticeable in the inquiry into Google's search and advertising business.
Less than three years after formally opening the case, Mr. Almunia said this week that he would test proposals submitted by Google aimed at making it easier for people to distinguish when the company was proposing its own services -- the strongest sign yet that the investigation into Google's search business would end in a settlement and without a fine or a finding of guilt.
Even as his officials burrowed into the inner workings of Google's hugely successful search and advertising businesses, Mr. Almunia met and spoke with Mr. Schmidt and called other senior representatives, like David C. Drummond, the company's chief legal officer, to update them.
His willingness to meet with executives to forge relationships and to gain knowledge about the sector also extends to figures like Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook. At a meeting with Ms. Sandberg in January at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the two discussed ''the relationship between the search activity and the social network's activity, but they were general conversations,'' Mr. Almunia said.
Not everyone is happy with how European antitrust enforcement is evolving.
Mr. Almunia's approach has frustrated companies like Foundem, a British online comparison-shopping site, which brought one of the original complaints about the way Google runs its search and advertising businesses.
Last month, Foundem, along with companies including TripAdvisor and the powerful Federation of German Newspaper Publishers, asked Mr. Almunia to force Google to ''hold all services, including its own, to exactly the same standards, using exactly the same crawling, indexing, ranking, display and penalty algorithms.'' The complainants suggested that Google would make such concessions only if it faced formal charges, called a statement of objections.
A few days earlier, Fleur Pellerin, the French minister for digital affairs, told a French Senate committee hearing that Google ''apparently systematically favors'' Web sites it controls. ''I hope that the European Commission will not compromise,'' she said.
Mr. Almunia batted away the suggestion that he was not standing up to Google, particularly after the United States Federal Trade Commission decided in January to end a 19-month inquiry into how the company operated its search engine with a finding that it had not broken antitrust laws.
''I don't feel that I am losing my nerve,'' he said. Instead he suggested that some of the complainants had unrealistic expectations.
''It's obvious that not everybody has the same merits,'' he said. ''Antitrust decisions cannot eliminate these merits and put everyone in the same position.''
One reason complainants tend to knock on the door in Brussels first is that European competition law is based on a tradition of protecting smaller businesses to ensure choice and defend against abuses. American enforcers, at least in recent decades, have tended to avoid intervention without strong evidence that consumers were harmed.
That is something of a sore point for the Europeans like Mr. Almunia, who are at pains to insist they share the same goals as the Americans when it comes to consumer welfare.

HEADLINE: After Talks End, Iran Announces an Expansion of Nuclear Fuel Production

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and RICK GLADSTONE; David M. Herszenhorn reported from Moscow, and Rick Gladstone from New York. Steven Erlanger contributed reporting from Paris.

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Iran's president announced an expansion of the country's uranium production and claimed other atomic energy advances on Tuesday, striking a pugnacious tone in the aftermath of diplomatic talks that ended in an impasse with the big powers last weekend in Kazakhstan.
''Iran has already become a nuclear country and no one is capable of stealing this title,'' the president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, proclaimed in a speech in Tehran during a ceremony commemorating National Nuclear Technology Day, a holiday he created in 2006 during his first term in office to trumpet Iran's nuclear energy achievements. 
Mr. Ahmadinejad, who is at the center of a power struggle in Iran over who will succeed him after presidential elections in June, also took aim at the United States and ''hegemonic powers'' in the European Union that have sought to penalize Iran with onerous economic sanctions aimed at pressuring it to capitulate in their nuclear dispute.
''They caused restrictions and issued threats, thinking that the Iranian nation cannot achieve nuclear energy,'' the official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him as saying.
While such rhetoric is hardly out of character, it showed how the talks had failed to narrow the divide between Iran and the six world powers that are demanding curbs in its nuclear program.
Iran has defied United Nations Security Council demands for a halt to the uranium enrichment until questions about its nuclear intentions are answered. It has denied accusations that it intends to build a nuclear weapon and has argued that it needs the enriched uranium for energy and medical uses.
The talks in Almaty, Kazakhstan, ended late Saturday without a deal, and with no plans for a next round of discussions -- capping a year of talks that by all accounts has not brought the sides any closer. At a briefing afterward, a senior American official said that Iran had not offered a detailed response to a proposal advanced by the big powers in February and that it had made unrealistic demands.
''That minimal response not only had very, very tiny steps in our view, but wanted a lot in return for those tiny steps,'' the official said. ''So this is a negotiation, but the gulf between their current position and ours is quite great.''
European officials said Iran had refused to suspend the enrichment of uranium to 20 percent purity, a level considered a short technical step to the higher level of purity needed for weapons-grade fuel. The Europeans also said Iran had refused to suspend work at Fordo, an underground processing plant, in a way that would make quick resumption difficult.
The officials said Iran expressed no interest in a deal to export most of its 20 percent-enriched uranium in exchange for nuclear fuel, saying it now has the capability to produce the fuel itself.
Iran's rejection was significant because the proposal, which was made at an earlier round of talks and would have offered Iran a modest easing of sanctions, represented a softened position by the six powers, which had demanded that Iran close its Fordo plant and relinquish its entire stockpile of 20 percent-enriched uranium.
As Israel and other critics who believe the Iranians are stalling for time renewed their calls for more decisive action, negotiators for the big powers planned to confer with senior officials in London, where the Group of 8 foreign ministers were meeting this week.
Negotiators representing the so-called P5-plus-1, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- plus Germany, expressed hope that the impasse would give their Iranian counterparts pause.
The American official said the Iranians needed to ''go back to Tehran and discuss with their government what they heard and the fact that we felt there was such a gulf that we wanted to stop and have these consultations before proceeding further.''
Mr. Ahmadinejad did not display the intended reaction. He said that Iran had opened two uranium extraction mines in the central province of Yazd and a factory in the same area to manufacture yellowcake, a form of semi-refined uranium that can be processed into nuclear fuel. The president also announced that Iranian nuclear scientists had created five new medicines and a homemade industrial electron accelerator.
Until now, the big powers have been unified in their efforts to prevent Iran from developing the capacity to make nuclear weapons. With time, though, differences may develop. Russia, for instance, has expressed more readiness than its Western partners to recognize that Iran has a sovereign right to enrich uranium for civilian purposes -- a recognition that the Iranian negotiators are demanding as a precursor to any deal.
The Western powers, particularly France, are adamantly opposed to recognizing any such right without a comprehensive agreement and substantial ''confidence building'' measures.
In his speech, Mr. Ahmadinejad offered no signal that Iran was ready to take such steps. On the contrary, he asserted that the Western powers must win Iran's trust. ''The best way for you is to cooperate with Iran,'' he said.
The next steps are unclear. Russia and China, which have opposed economic sanctions, are likely to resist further steps at the United Nations, while the Americans and Europeans have warned of imposing more on their own. The American official, speaking after the Almaty talks, noted that President Obama had repeatedly said he would ''not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.''
The triumphal tone of Mr. Ahmadinejad's announcements was undercut somewhat by a 6.3 earthquake that jolted the countryside in southern Iran near Bushehr, the site of its only nuclear power plant. Iran state news media said that the quake, which was felt in neighboring Dubai, killed at least 30 people, injured hundreds and heavily damaged two villages, but that the power plant had not been affected.

HEADLINE: At Last, Joining the Jet Age

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- As a small boy, Teruaki Kawai watched wide-eyed as American DC-3s took off and landed at a small airport across an inlet from his home on the Hiroshima coast.
Japan's golden era of aviation, which culminated with the feared and respected Mitsubishi Zero fighter planes, had ended a decade earlier along with World War II. Banned from making planes by American occupiers after the war, then allowed only to make parts for American military jets, Japan's aircraft industry was a shadow of its former self.
If all goes well this year, Mr. Kawai, now 65 and president of the Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation, will preside over Japan's biggest aviation comeback since the war. In late 2013, the company plans the first flight of its Mitsubishi Regional Jet, a sleek, 90-seat commercial plane that is Japan's bid to break into the industry's big leagues after almost 70 years.
''For decades, we were confined to supplying parts for other passenger jets. But we're finally heading into new territory,'' Mr. Kawai said in a recent interview at Mitsubishi Aircraft's Tokyo office. 
Mitsubishi's comeback was abetted in large part by Boeing's outsourcing more of its aircraft manufacture to overseas suppliers. As Boeing came to rely on foreign contractors, Japanese manufacturers moved in, designing and supplying some of the jet's most vital sections.
A full third of Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner is supplied by Japanese manufacturers, including Mitsubishi Aircraft's parent company, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which makes the jet's carbon-fiber composite main wings.
Even so, Boeing and Mitsubishi could not be further apart in their approach to jet-building. In contrast to the cutting-edge 787, Mitsubishi's regional jet uses only a little of the advanced carbon fiber that its parent company supplies to Boeing.
Neither does the regional jet use the volatile lithium-ion batteries that have become a major headache for Boeing, overheating on two planes in January and prompting American and Japanese safety regulators to ground the entire 787 fleet.
Mitsubishi's caution underscores the importance, to the company and to Japan, of getting the regional jet project off the ground in an industry where reputation for reliability is paramount. That is especially the case, experts say, for a country long absent from the business of making planes, save military jets under license from the United States, and a series of small private jets.
In the late 1950s and 1960s, Mitsubishi participated in a consortium to develop the YS-11 plane, a 60-seat turboprop airliner led and largely financed by the Japanese government, which was eager to restart the country's aviation industry.
Leading the YS-11's design was Teruo Tojo, one of the Mitsubishi Zero fighter's original engineers and the second son of Hideki Tojo, the Japanese wartime leader who was executed as a war criminal by the Allies. But with no experience in making civilian jets, Mr. Tojo and his team of engineers struggled with the YS-11's design.
Regulators in the United States who tested the plane said early versions of the aircraft rolled from side to side and leaked rainwater. Its air-conditioning systems broke down. Passengers complained its roaring twin engines were too loud. And despite generous state backing, soaring manufacturing costs crippled the consortium's finances. In 1973, barely 10 years after the YS-11's maiden flight, the consortium canceled the project. It built just 182 aircraft and sold its planes at a loss.
''We wanted to sell to the world, but on the ground, we felt we were chasing an impossible dream,'' Mr. Tojo, who eventually became vice president of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and president of Mitsubishi Motors, reminisced in a 1990 interview with the Nikkei Sangyo Shimbun newspaper. ''Who would buy a plane made in Japan?'' Mr. Tojo passed away last year at the age of 98.
Burned by the YS-11 flop, Japan shifted its aviation strategy to supplying, and learning from, the largest aircraft makers of the time, of which the largest was Boeing. Japanese suppliers have played an increasingly bigger role in building Boeing aircraft, supplying 15 percent of the 767 jet, 21 percent of the 777, and 35 percent of the 787.
The Japanese government quickly became one of the largest financial backers of those projects, handing out billions of yen in subsidies to help Japanese suppliers develop technology and win lucrative contracts from Boeing. Though the government declines to reveal exact numbers, estimates by researchers at the State University of New York of how much Japan has handed out to 787 suppliers in subsidies and loans over the past decade are as high as $1.6 billion. .
Boeing, which is based in Chicago, outsources its parts manufacturing to pare its investment in research and development, design, manufacturing and also its work force. These Boeing contracts have kept tens of thousands of Japanese workers busy for years, and still account for about 40 percent of jobs in the industry. They also help keep Japanese companies on the forefront of crucial aeronautical technology.
And in a cozy quid pro quo, Japan's biggest airlines have for years bought their planes almost exclusively from Boeing -- an unusual practice among global carriers, which tend to play Boeing off against its rival, Airbus, to negotiate better terms and prices.
''It's been a 'you scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours' kind of relationship that made both sides captive to each other,'' said Takanori Maema, an aeronautics expert and former engine designer at the IHI Corporation, another major Boeing supplier. ''But all along, Japan always aspired to build its own plane.''
At the same time, the Japanese government was ready to give passenger plane manufacturing another try, as it looked in the early 2000s for ways to bolster Japanese exports and revitalize the country's stagnant economy.
In 2003, it announced bold plans to finance the development of compact, fuel-efficient aircraft. By the mid-2000s, Mitsubishi executives were gearing up to develop a passenger jet. The company placed Mitsubishi Aircraft's new headquarters in its prewar offices in Nagoya, where engineers designed the Zero.
The Mitsubishi Regional Jet, announced in 2008, is conservative in its use of new technologies and materials. Mitsubishi drastically reduced its use of advanced carbon composite material, opting to use high-grade aluminum alloy wings after discovering that carbon fiber still did not deliver the weight savings that engineers had hoped for. (The weight savings from carbon composite materials are greater for the 787, a larger plane.)
After initially exploring the use of advanced lithium-ion batteries, Mitsubishi engineers also concluded that the technology was not tested enough to power a passenger jet, opting instead to use conventional cadmium nickel packs. (''It's too dangerous. The technology isn't mature enough for a plane like ours,'' Mr. Kawai said of lithium-ion batteries.)
Still, Mitsubishi's regional jet boasts about 20 percent in fuel savings compared to similar size Brazilian-built Embraer 190 jets. Much of the fuel economy comes from its use of new engines from the American manufacturer, Pratt & Whitney. The plane's wings are thinner and are more aerodynamic than those on similar models, also improving energy efficiency. Mitsubishi says newly designed seats on the M.R.J. also offer wider seats than rival aircraft: 18.5 inches across compared with 17.3 inches on Canada's Bombardier's CRJ700 series.
The company has 165 firm orders to date for the $42 million jet, and it aims to secure as many as 5,000 orders over the next two decades -- a goal some experts dismiss as unrealistic.
It faces well-established rivals like Bombardier and Embraer. The Russians and Chinese are also making inroads into plane-building. By bolstering its aviation credentials, Japan could also keep upstarts in South Korea, Taiwan and China from encroaching on its lucrative Boeing work, which analysts say contributes around a fifth of Mitsubishi's roughly $5.7 billion aeronautics business.
''As a boy, I didn't think that Japan would build a plane again,'' Mr. Kawai said. ''But it's been over a half-century. It's high time for Japan to give it another go.''

HEADLINE: New Jersey Condo Market Heats Up as Demand Surges

BYLINE: By RONDA KAYSEN

 BODY:
WEEHAWKEN, N.J. -- After years of stagnating sales, the New Jersey condominium market is finally warming up, with developers building again and potential owners buying from floor plans.
A handful of developers have revived projects and are releasing a few units in prime locations to willing buyers. In Weehawken, buyers have signed contracts for riverfront apartments sight unseen. Construction will not be completed for another month, yet all but one of the 36 units at one building are already under contract. A few miles north, in Palisades Park, developers converted a handful of rentals in a luxury development to condos. And in Long Branch, on the Jersey Shore, developers are getting ready to release 44 new units later this month.
Unlike New York City, where condo sales bounced back quickly after the recession hit, New Jersey has had a slower recovery. After the housing crisis, banks were unwilling to finance new condo construction and buyers were unable to get mortgages, so developers shelved condo projects and retreated to the rental market. But now a few developers see the low inventory of new condos for sale and the thriving New York market as signs that New Jersey is ready to sell again. 
''The market is strong now, but it's going to get stronger,'' said Craig Klingensmith, division president of Lennar Urban, which developed Henley-on-the-Hudson in Weehawken with the Roseland Properties Company. ''If you have very good properties and they're well situated, there are people looking to place their money.''
Lennar and Roseland will finish construction next month on the latest phase of Henley-on-the-Hudson, a community of condos and townhouses in the Port Imperial complex. Units in the latest condo building range from $570,000 for a 912-square-foot one-bedroom to $1.7 million for a 1,722-square-foot three-bedroom with a balcony, fireplace and city views. Interest has been so strong that on a recent weekend, 21 potential buyers stopped in at the sales office trailer, and only one unit is still available, said Mr. Klingensmith.
Despite local curiosity, 60 percent of the buyers are from overseas, many from China, Korea and Russia. ''If the international market wasn't in the area, the market wouldn't be as strong,'' said Mr. Klingensmith.
The international buyers that have shown interest in Henley-on-the-Hudson are not investors looking for a pied-à-terre. Rather, they are generally younger buyers looking for a primary residence or a second home with easy access to Manhattan, and have been priced out of the New York City market.
Emboldened from the recent success at Henley-on-the-Hudson, Lennar, a publicly traded company, broke ground last September on a 74-unit development, also in Port Imperial. The Avenue, a seven-story waterfront building, will be the first stage in a five-building, 669-unit development. Lennar purchased the 10-acre waterfront parcel in 2007, but delayed the project during the recession. Walking distance from the New York Waterways Ferry Terminal, a 3,300-square-foot penthouse apartment with a private terrace will be marketed for $4 million. In an effort to lure international buyers, Mr. Klingensmith traveled to Paris last summer to promote the Avenue, which will begin selling in the fall.
Sales over all have improved in northern New Jersey from a year ago. Median condo prices in Hudson County are up 17.6 percent from the same time last year, to $344,400, according to data provided by Zillow. In Bergen County, they're up 7.3 percent from a year ago, to $301,700. But prices still have a far way to climb to return to their March 2006 peak, when the median price for a condo in Hudson County, $384,000, was 10 percent higher than it is today. In Bergen County, it was 24 percent higher at $395,200. Compared to New York City, where the median condo price exceeds $1 million, sales have been relatively tame along New Jersey's Gold Coast, which runs along the Hudson River from Jersey City to Englewood Cliffs.
''It's not New York,'' said Jordan Roth, Senior Branch Manager at GFI Mortgage Bankers. ''The New Jersey market allows people a path of entry to homeownership where they get much more space than they would if they bought in New York.''
Ultimately, most New Jersey buyers see a condo purchase as a pathway to buying a single-family home in the suburbs, which make up the majority of the New Jersey housing stock.
While the condo market has picked up on the Gold Coast, venture a few blocks away from the riverfront -- and direct public transit to New York City -- and developers are enticing buyers with deals. Last year, Phoenix Realty Group began selling some of the 71 rental units at the Trio, a 140-unit condo and rental complex overlooking a nature preserve in Palisades Park. In March, it opened The M at Englewood South, a development in Englewood that had been stalled since 2007. To lure buyers to both properties, the company is offering up to $25,000 off the list price, a credit that can be used toward apartment upgrades, a second parking spot or a price reduction. Buyers can also purchase a unit through a ''rent-to-own'' agreement where a portion of their monthly rent is placed in an escrow account to be used toward a future down payment.
''We know that there are a lot of people out there who want to buy a condo and we need to give them a reason to do it,'' said Ron Orgel, managing director at Phoenix Realty Group. ''It takes a lot of hand-holding.''
Prices in these areas are also lower than they are along the Gold Coast. At the Trio, prices start at $305,000 for a 742-square foot one-bedroom, up to $500,000 for a 1,416-square-foot two-bedroom. And at the M, a 125-unit rental and condo mix, prices start at $275,000 for a 755-square foot one-bedroom, and go up to $475,000 for a 1,500-square-foot two-bedroom.
A year ago, Ironstate Development considered a condo conversion at 55 Melrose, a four-story rental building at Pier Village, a beachfront community in Long Branch. But the company postponed, deciding that the market wasn't strong enough yet. Since then, the mood has changed and later this month, Ironstate will begin marketing the 44 units starting at $295,000 for a one-bedroom up to $775,000 for a three-bedroom. These will be the first condos in the 536-unit luxury community.
''People are getting confident that for sure the worst is behind us,'' said David Barry, president of Ironstate. ''There is a sense that now is a good time to invest in real estate, and that didn't exist a couple of years ago.''

HEADLINE: North Korea Warns of Imminent Nuclear War

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN and DAVID E. SANGER; Choe Sang-hun reported from Seoul, and David E. Sanger from Washington. Thom Shanker contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- As North Korea warned foreigners on Tuesday that they might want to leave South Korea because the peninsula was on the brink of nuclear war -- a statement that analysts dismissed as hyperbole -- the American commander in the Pacific expressed worries that the North's young leader, Kim Jong-un, might not have left himself an easy exit to reduce tensions.
''His father and his grandfather, as far as I can see, always figured into their provocation cycle an 'off ramp,' '' the commander, Adm. Samuel J. Locklear III, said during testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee. ''And it's not clear to me that he has thought through how to get out of it. And so that's what makes this scenario, I think, particularly challenging.'' 
The administration has settled on a strategy of refusing to make concessions to the North and has adopted a new plan to deter any hostilities by promising a proportionate response. In doing so, it hopes to reverse what it considers a long-term pattern in which the West offers aid to calm tensions and then North Korea breaks its promises to halt its nuclear program. But Obama administration officials acknowledge that the new strategy will work only if Mr. Kim either backs down or satisfies himself with a token show of force, like a missile test into the open ocean. The South Koreans have warned such a test could happen as early as this week.
At the core of the concern within the administration and the intelligence agencies is that they do not understand Mr. Kim's motivations. His father and grandfather suggested, at times, that they might be willing to negotiate to end their nuclear program. But Mr. Kim arrived in power with a small nuclear arsenal -- the fuel for about six to a dozen weapons, according to intelligence officials, and a pathway to make more -- and he may be calculating that with those potential weapons in hand, he is less vulnerable to attack.
''He may think he has more running room than the rest of the family did,'' one administration official said this week, ''and that can lead to miscalculation.''
The United States' harder line has also been adopted by the South's conservative new president, Park Geun-hye, who parried the North's latest threat on Tuesday by saying she remained determined not to succumb to what she said were efforts to escalate tensions.
''How long are we going to repeat this vicious cycle where the North Koreans create tensions and we give them compromises and aid?'' she said at a cabinet meeting. The North's latest warning carried the same ominous tone as the flood of threats since the United States led a successful effort to impose sanctions on Pyongyang for conducting its third nuclear test in February.
''The situation on the Korean Peninsula is inching close to a thermonuclear war due to the evermore undisguised hostile actions of the United States and the South Korean puppet warmongers,'' the Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, a North Korean state agency, said in a statement. The statement added that the North ''does not want to see foreigners in South Korea fall victim to the war.''
Experts saw the new threat as part of what they have begun referring to as ''psychological warfare,'' meant to force concessions from Washington and Seoul. In recent days, analysts say, those threats have appeared designed specifically to cause jitters among businesses and investors in South Korea, perhaps reflecting a calculation that Ms. Park might be unable to stand as firm if her country's already weakened economy is seriously threatened.
The North's warning followed a similar advisory last week in which it told foreign embassies in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, to devise evacuation plans. And it came a day after the North said it was temporarily suspending operations at a joint North and South Korean industrial park; the South had previously assuaged investors' fears about possible hostilities by saying the operations at the factories were continuing despite the North's belligerent stance.
In South Korea, where people are somewhat inured to North Korea's bluster -- or have at least learned to ignore a threat that is out of their control -- there were no signs of panic on Tuesday. And the American Embassy in Seoul noted that the State Department's travel notice about South Korea was unchanged and did not recommend any special precautions for United States citizens living in South Korea or planning to visit.
Still there were some signals of unease. Air Charter Service, a global company, said that since last week, it had received ''growing interest'' from corporations inquiring about evacuation contingency plans for their expatriate staff in South Korea in case the situation escalated further. Last week, General Motors said that further increases in tensions would prompt it to consider eventually moving production elsewhere. South Korea's main stock index has dropped 65.71 points since a week ago Tuesday, although it crept up 2 points Tuesday to end the day's trading at 1920.74.
The Korea Tourism Organization said the latest torrent of North Korean threats has so far had little effect on that industry, with the number of Chinese visitors doubling during a vacation period last week, according to Lee Kwang-soo, a spokesman for the group. Still, it was taking precautions, reaching out to foreign tourist agencies to inform them that it was safe to visit South Korea, he said.
But DMZ Tour Corporation, which specializes in taking tourists to the heavily militarized border with North Korea to experience one of the world's last reminders of cold war tensions, said it had seen its business shrink in recent weeks.
''We have foreign tourists calling us to ask whether it's safe to go to the border,'' said Yoo Jae-sung, a company official who declined to reveal how many tourists his company had lost to the tensions. ''Yesterday, a group of Australian tourists had a vote among themselves after agreeing that if any one of them was afraid to go to the border they would cancel the trip. They went.''
In another sign of heightened worries, a prominent member of South Korea's Parliament argued Tuesday in Washington that the time had come for the South to build its own nuclear weapons.
In an interview and a speech to the Carnegie International Nuclear Policy Conference, the lawmaker, Chung Mong-joon, a son of the Hyundai industrial group's founder, said South Korea should withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and ''match North Korea's nuclear progress step by step while committing to stop if North Korea stops.''
''The only thing that kept the cold war cold was the mutual deterrence afforded by nuclear weapons,'' Mr. Chung said.
His position is a fairly lonely one: President Park has not endorsed any effort to turn South Korea into a nuclear power.

HEADLINE: Stay Cool. Call North Korea's Bluff.

BYLINE: By ANDREI LANKOV. 
Andrei Lankov, a professor of history at Kookmin University, is the author of ''The Real North Korea: Life and Politics in the Failed Stalinist Utopia.''

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea
NORTH KOREA is a tiny dictatorship with a bankrupt economy, but its leaders are remarkably adept at manipulating global public opinion. In recent weeks, we have been exposed to yet another brilliant example of their skill.
Scores of foreign journalists have been dispatched to Seoul to report on the growing tensions between the two Koreas and the possibility of war. Upon arrival, though, it is difficult for them to find any South Koreans who are panic-stricken. In fact, most people in Seoul don't care about the North's belligerent statements: the farther one is from the Korean Peninsula, the more one will find people worried about the recent developments here.
The average South Korean's calm indifference is understandable: he or she has been through similar ''crises'' many times. By now South Koreans understand Pyongyang's logic and know North Korea is highly unlikely to make good on its gothic threats. 
People who talk about an imminent possibility of war seldom pose this question: What would North Korea's leadership get from unleashing a war that they are likely to lose in weeks, if not days? Even if they managed to strike Japan, the United States or South Korea with nuclear weapons -- a big if, given that they do not have a reliable delivery system -- they could not save themselves from ultimate defeat. On the contrary, the use of nuclear or other terror weapons would be certain to invite overwhelming retaliation, delivering North Korea's decision makers to a fiery oblivion.
Suggestions that those leaders are irrational and their decisions unfathomable are remarkably shallow. North Korea is not a theocracy led by zealots who preach the rewards of the afterlife.
In fact, there are no good reasons to think that Kim Jong-un, North Korea's young dictator, would want to commit suicide; he is known for his love of basketball, pizza and other pleasures of being alive. The same logic applies to his advisers, old survivors in the byzantine world of North Korean politics who love expensive cars and good brandy.
Moreover, there is almost nothing particularly unusual in the recent developments. In the last two decades, North Korea has on various occasions conducted highly provocative missile and nuclear tests and promised to turn Seoul into a sea of fire. Now it has declared its withdrawal from the 1953 armistice agreement that ended fighting in the Korean War but not the war itself. It has denounced American and South Korean military exercises as an act of war. And on Tuesday, North Korea told foreigners in the South to look for shelter or consider evacuating because the Korean Peninsula could soon be engulfed in nuclear war. This time, the tune is being played louder, but that is the only real change.
A closer look at North Korean history reveals what Pyongyang's leaders really want their near-farcical belligerence to achieve -- a reminder to the world that North Korea exists, and an impression abroad that its leaders are irrational and unpredictable. The scary impressions are important to North Korea because for the last two decades its policy has been, above all, a brilliant exercise in diplomatic blackmail. And blackmail usually works better when the practitioners are seen as irrational and unpredictable.
Put bluntly, North Korea's government hopes to squeeze more aid from the outside world. Of late, it has become very dependent on Chinese aid, and it wants other sponsors as well.
The leaders in Pyongyang read their history books. In 1994, after a year of tension over North Korea's efforts to acquire nuclear weapons, the United States agreed to provide North Korea with oil shipments and light water reactors in exchange for the North's promise to halt its weapons program. Then, in 2002, a clandestine North Korean uranium enrichment program was unmasked, and for the next four years North Korea could not get much American aid. But after it conducted a nuclear test in October 2006, the United States promised significant concessions, in hopes that new negotiations could halt the North's weapons program after all. They did not.
If history is any guide, in a few weeks' time things will calm down. North Korea's media will tell its people that the might of the People's Army and the strategic genius of their new young leader made the terrified American imperialists cancel their plans to invade the North. Meanwhile, North Korea's diplomats will approach their international counterparts and start probing for aid and political concessions.
In other words, it is business as usual on the Korean Peninsula. Perhaps, when the atmosphere cools down, an argument can be made for giving North Korea's leaders some of the assistance they want, if they are willing to make concessions of their own.
But it does not make sense to credulously take their fake belligerence at face value and give them the attention they want now. It would be better if people in Washington and New York took a lesson from the people of Seoul.

HEADLINE: Lew's Visit Reveals Gap With Europe

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY; Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt and Steven Erlanger from Paris.

 BODY:
PARIS -- The two-day effort by the United States Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, to persuade Europe to consider shifting its focus from budget balance to growth highlighted a deep trans-Atlantic policy gulf that is likely to leave Europe as a drag on the global economy.
Mr. Lew pointed to evidence that increased government spending and looser monetary policy had helped the United States recover at a much faster pace than the Continent has. But even as some European leaders expressed concern about rising unemployment and deepening recession, it was clear that Europe's political constraints -- and Germany's insistence that bringing down deficits and reassuring lenders was the best route to sustained growth -- were preventing a more expansionary approach from taking hold.
''Nobody in Europe sees this contradiction between fiscal consolidation and growth,'' said Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister, sitting beside Mr. Lew at a joint news conference in Berlin on Tuesday. ''We have the common position of a growth-friendly process of consolidation, or sustainable growth.'' 
Consumed by the problems of the American economy and its efforts to hold off deep budget-cutting proposals from Republicans in the United States, the Obama administration has hardly been in a position in recent years to lecture other nations on good policy.
But Mr. Lew's trip to Brussels, Frankfurt, Berlin and Paris -- his first swing through Europe since becoming Treasury secretary -- gave the administration an opportunity to highlight the diverging economic fortunes of the United States and Europe and to make the case that more expansionary policies could actually help with budget deficits.
The United States has pointed out that its quick rescue of the financial system, front-loaded stimulus measures and delayed budget-cutting have helped foster 14 straight quarters of growth and a falling unemployment rate -- even if the recovery has proved sluggish by historical standards.
In contrast, Europe has lurched from one crisis to another, hobbled by a complicated political structure and skittish financial markets. It continues to suffer through rising joblessness and economic stagnation. Greece, Spain and Portugal all remain mired in deep recessions, and even the large economies of Germany, Italy and France were contracting as well at the end of 2012.
A Treasury official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the diplomatic conversations, said that while the Americans did not endeavor to lecture the Europeans, they did focus on the profound need for growth on the Continent, for the good of Europe as well as the world.
As Mr. Lew said in Berlin, ''The driver for economic growth will be consumer demand and policies that would help to encourage consumer demand in countries that have the capacity would be helpful.''
But some of the biggest levers that governments employ to bolster their economies during a downturn are seemingly out of the question in Europe, given its political constraints and some countries' heavy debt burdens. Any calls for more stimulus spending, less austerity or looser monetary policy face entrenched resistance in powerful Germany. The view there, shared in other Northern European countries like Austria and Finland, is that the European Central Bank has already gone far out on a limb with measures to prevent a collapse of the 17-nation euro zone.
Michael Heise, chief economist of the German insurance giant Allianz, said Tuesday that the central bank should already be thinking about how to reabsorb some of the money it has pumped into euro zone banks by issuing unlimited cheap loans. Otherwise, he said, easy money policies could feed new asset bubbles and remove pressure for economic reforms.
Looking on the bright side, the Treasury official said the European representatives all recognized the urgent need to focus on employment and growth. The official also said that there seemed to be growing pragmatism in Europe, with more officials willing to allow budget flexibility in certain economies, for instance.
Nevertheless, in joint news conferences European officials appeared to shrug off the Americans' suggestions, as they generally have done for the last few years. In Brussels on Monday, the European Council president, Herman Van Rompuy, acknowledged the ''vivid'' debate over how to conduct fiscal policy, but reiterated the Continent's commitment to its present strategy.
''The European economies face a high level of debt, deep structural medium-term challenges and short-term economic headwinds that we need to confront.'' Mr. Van Rompuy said. ''There is no room for complacency.''
But cracks were growing in the European consensus. As France struggles with another slump, its leaders are urging a little less austerity as well. ''Right now, all countries are consolidating, which means hitting the budgetary brakes, even in countries running surpluses,'' the French finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, said at a meeting with Mr. Schäuble in Strasbourg, France, last week. ''If we all hit the brakes together, we all get stuck together.''
At that meeting, Mr. Schäuble stood firm. ''We need to stop this debate which says you have to choose between austerity and growth,'' he said.
In Paris on Tuesday, standing beside Mr. Lew for the briefest of news conferences, Mr. Moscovici said there was a convergence of views between France and the United States. He called for a ''rebalancing'' and the need to increase growth.
Their French meeting was overshadowed by a political scandal in Paris stemming from the revelation that a budget chief in Mr. Moscovici's ministry had secret bank accounts abroad. On Monday, Mr. Moscovici had canceled the bilateral meeting, though he later rescheduled it. On Tuesday, he said he had to cut the news conference short to meet with President François Hollande.
Some of the urgency of previous meetings involving Mr. Lew's predecessor, Timothy F. Geithner, has been bled out of the talks as American financial institutions steeled themselves against contagion from Europe and as the American economy gathered strength from a turnaround in the housing sector. Mr. Lew's first international trip was to Beijing rather than Berlin.
Still, officials on Mr. Lew's trip emphasized that Europe was the United States' largest trading partner and that the financial ties between the economies were deep. Europe's economic convulsions continue to hold back American growth.
In his meetings, Mr. Lew also discussed a cross-border banking union, the unfurling problems in Cyprus and a potential free-trade deal with the European Union, a prospect that Continental officials eagerly anticipate negotiating to help increase their exports.
Mr. Lew, a longtime budget specialist, is new to the world of international economic diplomacy. But he is getting a quick education. During his four-city, two-day tour, he met with the heads of the European Council and European Commission, his counterparts in the finance ministries of Germany and France, and Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank. He will see many of the same officials in Washington later this month, during the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.

HEADLINE: Optimistic Investors Help Market Make Up Ground

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The stock market advanced on Tuesday as earnings season got under way, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing at another nominal record high on a rally in cyclical shares.
With the day's advance, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended less than two points shy of its nominal record, recovering from steep losses last week.
The strength in the indexes indicates that investors are again using market declines as buying opportunities. The top sectors of the day, technology and energy, are groups that are closely tied to the pace of economic growth. 
''It's encouraging that we're seeing cyclical sectors lead the rally,'' said Joseph Tanious, global market strategist at J. P. Morgan Funds. ''It's a healthy sign -- investors believe the market can continue to run higher.''
Among blue-chip technology stocks, Microsoft jumped $1.02, or 3.6 percent, to $29.61 as the Dow's top percentage gainer. Intel shares shot up 66 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $21.75, and Hewlett-Packard rose 29 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $22.22.
The Dow industrials rose 59.98 points, or 0.41 percent, to close at 14,673.46. The S.& P. 500 gained 5.54 points, or 0.35 percent, to 1,568.61. The Nasdaq composite index added 15.61 points, or 0.48 percent, to 3,237.86.
While only 5 percent of S.& P. 500 companies have reported results so far, almost three-quarters of those have topped expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. Still, profits are seen rising just 1.5 percent from the year-ago quarter, down from estimates in January for growth of 4.3 percent.
''Expectations have gotten managed down to the point where we could more easily see companies beat expectations, making it easier for us to pop,'' said Kristen Scarpa, an investment strategist at Barclays.
Late Monday, Alcoa reported earnings that beat expectations, though revenue was below forecasts. Shares of Alcoa, which as part of the Dow is unofficially seen as setting the tone for the earnings season, closed flat on the day at $8.39.
First Solar, which surged $12.31, or 45.5 percent, to $39.35, was the S.& P. 500's top gainer by far after forecasting 2013 earnings and revenue well above expectations.
The news lifted the solar sector, with Yingli Green Energy climbing 39 cents, or 21.1 percent, to $2.24, and Trina Solar up 56 cents, or 14.6 percent, at $4.40.
Recent reports have shown that the American economy is growing at a slow pace. The March employment report on Friday showed job creation was less than half of what economists had expected. Analysts said, however, that the market has the momentum to push indexes higher, even with the Dow industrials up 12 percent so far this year and the S.& P. 500 up 10 percent.
J. C. Penney was the S.& P. 500's largest percentage loser, tumbling $1.94, or 12.2 percent, to $13.93 after the department store's board ousted Ron Johnson as chief executive and replaced him with his predecessor, Myron E. Ullman.
Shares of Herbalife fell $1.44, or 3.8 percent, to $36.95 after it said that KPMG had resigned as its independent accountant. One of KPMG's senior partners in the firm's Los Angeles office was accused of leaking secret information to a stock trader about Herbalife and the footwear company Skechers USA. The accounting firm said Monday night that it had fired the partner.
In the bond market, interest rates showed little change. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note slipped 2/32, to 102 8/32, while its yield held steady at 1.75 percent.

HEADLINE: Laureates Urge No Cuts To Budgets For Research

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
More than 50 Nobel laureates are urging Congress to spare the federal science establishment from the looming budget cuts known as the sequester, saying that research has endured years of budget reductions and that additional cuts could endanger ''the innovation engine that is essential to our economy.'' 
The open letter was written by Burton Richter, a 1976 Nobel laureate in physics at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in California, and organized by the Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington. The group is making the letter public on Wednesday.
The Nobel laureates said their concern was not for themselves, since they would have the upper hand in any competition for scarce federal dollars, but for younger scientists who might be poised to produce the breakthroughs of tomorrow.
''We urge you,'' they wrote Congress, ''to keep the budgets of the agencies that support science at a level that will keep the pipelines full.'' The next generation, they added, will determine ''our economic vitality'' in the future.
Washington is the pre-eminent sponsor of basic research in the United States, disbursing billions of dollars to universities, contractors and federal centers. The Defense Department receives the largest share of the overall research financing, followed by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Energy Department.
Between 2009 and 2012, the federal financing of research and development dropped 18 percent, to $140.6 billion from $172.5 billion, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
The science association says the budget cuts would lower this year's research and development budget an additional 6 percent, to about $131 billion.
The letter from Dr. Richter and the other laureates gave no budget numbers but said the overall federal science budget ''has steadily fallen over the years, while our rivals in Europe and Asia invest more.''
It added that traditional partisans in Washington had agreed on the importance of federal financing of long-term scientific research.
President Obama stressed this importance in his State of the Union address, the letter said, adding that Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the Republican majority leader, emphasized it in a recent speech at the American Enterprise Institute.
''The agreement exists,'' the letter said, ''because of recognition that this sort of research fuels the innovation engine that is essential to our economy.''

HEADLINE: As Governor Steers Maryland to the Left, Talk Turns to 2016

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- As the Maryland Senate debated a crackdown on guns last week, one Republican after another objected that amendments were being smothered by the Democratic majority in its haste to send Gov. Martin O'Malley the bill he wanted.
But the opponents had no chance, as allies of the governor passed sweeping gun restrictions, the final victory in a series of triumphs that capped one of the most successful 2013 legislative seasons of any governor in the country.
Besides gun control legislation, Mr. O'Malley coaxed a liberal wish list from the General Assembly session that ended Monday: repeal of the death penalty, a $1.7 billion subsidy for offshore wind turbines and a bump in the gasoline tax to pay for mass transit and roads.
Republicans fumed that Mr. O'Malley had steered well to the left of Maryland residents' concerns, and denounced his agenda as a punch list for a 2016 Democratic presidential primary campaign. Mr. O'Malley -- largely unknown outside Maryland, though he is mentioned in presidential speculations alongside Govs. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and John W. Hickenlooper of Colorado -- said the bills were smart policy and in step with state residents. 
''I don't think the relevant question for Maryland families is whether we're moving left or right; it's whether we're moving forward or back,'' he said in an interview. To voters under 35, who represent a generational shift in American politics, especially on social issues, ''these are pretty mainstream things,'' he added.
In a relaxed mood a few days before the adjournment of the General Assembly, Mr. O'Malley, 50, offered a tour of the fine art in his office. He pointed out a Rembrandt Peale portrait of George Washington, whose distant eyes are the most arresting feature.
''They have the look of a man who knows how the conversation is going to end before it begins,'' Mr. O'Malley said.
It was a comment that could apply as well to Mr. O'Malley, who is in his next-to-last year as a governor facing term limits. That he is looking ahead to a presidential campaign ''is the worst-kept secret in Annapolis,'' said Anthony J. O'Donnell, the Republican minority leader in the House of Delegates. Mr. O'Donnell added that the governor was ''planting his flag as far to the left as possible'' with left-leaning Democratic primary voters in mind.
Mr. O'Malley would not confirm any such thing. He said he was flattered that people noticed ''the tough things we've accomplished here.''
''I haven't put a whole lot of brain power or effort or time into 2016,'' he said.
His successes come on top of others a year ago, when lawmakers in the Democratic-controlled legislature approved same-sex marriage and in-state college tuition for illegal immigrants. After opponents forced both measures onto the state ballot in November, Mr. O'Malley campaigned hard for them, and voters upheld the changes -- victories that provided political capital that allowed the governor to pass his even more ambitious agenda this year.
But with lawmakers in Annapolis increasingly on the ideological wings of each party, it is an open question whether Mr. O'Malley has left Maryland residents behind. Protests against his gun restrictions, including an assault weapons ban and fingerprinting for handgun buyers, were the largest and most inflamed in memory. In a Washington Post poll last month, a plurality of Maryland residents, 48 percent to 41 percent, said the state was on the wrong track.
A former mayor of Baltimore, who despised the city's dark portrayal in the television show ''The Wire,'' Mr. O'Malley is not a traditional liberal. His arguments to abolish the death penalty were practical, not moralizing, in keeping with his reputation for shaping policy by analyzing data. He argued that capital punishment failed as a deterrent and did not reduce violent crime.
Similarly, his defense of same-sex marriage and tuition breaks for illegal immigrants is an economic argument, aimed at attracting the well-educated and socially tolerant ''creative class'' to Maryland. ''We believe that openness and inclusiveness are good for creating jobs and expanding opportunities,'' he said.
Mr. O'Malley has succeeded with a fiscal policy balanced between tax increases and spending cuts, of the sort President Obama has sought with less success in talks with Congressional Republicans. He has nearly wiped out a $1.7 billion structural deficit he inherited in the Maryland budget, partly by slowing the rise of spending. He won re-election in 2010 in part by pointing out that spending went up less in his administration than under the previous governor, a Republican.
But Republicans denounce his tax increases, including on individual incomes above $100,000 -- a definition of ''high earner'' that is lower than the $250,000 threshold Mr. Obama campaigned on during his re-election race. Critics say Maryland has chased entrepreneurs to lower-taxed Virginia.
''Since 2007, we've lost 40,000 jobs in this state; we've lost 6,500 small businesses who have closed their doors to move across the border,'' said Jeannie Haddaway-Riccio, the Republican minority whip in the legislature's lower house.
Mr. O'Malley has been called a rising star in the Democratic Party since he rode on the back of garbage trucks as mayor. But he has picked his battles with care. He decided not to challenge Kathleen Kennedy Townsend in the Democratic primary for governor in 2002. When she lost the general election, Mr. O'Malley had a clean shot at Annapolis four years later.
He went on to lead the Democratic Governors Association, raising his national profile as a happy partisan warrior who attacked ''the dinosaur wing of the Republican Party.''
Strategists who have worked with him do not believe he will seek the presidency in 2016 if Hillary Rodham Clinton commits to the race. The governor is close to Mrs. Clinton, whom he supported in her unsuccessful 2008 primary campaign. A generation younger, he will presumably have many options when his term ends in 2014, including a run for the Senate or a cabinet position in a future Democratic administration.
Mr. O'Malley pointed out that he had begun campaigning to overturn the state's death penalty in 2007, his first year in office, long before Republicans in the General Assembly accused him of checking boxes for a presidential race.
''These guys would be sorely pressed to say that that was some sort of appeal to the base in Keokuk, Iowa, or Manchester, N.H.,'' he said.
He turned to an aide, Teddy Davis, his director of strategic communications. ''They still have the death penalty in New Hampshire, don't they?''
Mr. Davis said they did. ''They had passed a repeal bill about 10 years ago. Governor Shaheen had vetoed it,'' he said, referring to Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat who is now one of the state's senators.
And how did an aide to Maryland's governor know policy details in New Hampshire, which holds the first presidential primary?
''Just learned my New Hampshire stuff,'' said Mr. Davis, whom the governor recently hired to help with the next phase of his career.

HEADLINE: From Mexico, Some Lessons For Europe

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
I was in Mexico City in the summer of 1981, just out of high school, when Mexico's president, José López Portillo, announced he would defend the peso ''like a dog'' against speculative attacks.
His approach to economics was unorthodox but creative. He tried to raise oil prices by sheer force of will -- firing the director of the state oil company Pemex for having the temerity to reduce the price of Mexican crude as oil plummeted on international markets. He froze dollar accounts in local banks to try to stem capital flight.
But the canine defense didn't work. In 1982, interest on foreign debt swallowed almost two-thirds of the country's export revenue. In February, Mexico's currency started plummeting. In August, Jesús Silva Herzog, Mexico's finance minister, flew to Washington to tell Paul Volcker at the Federal Reserve and Donald Regan at the Treasury Department that Mexico could not make its coming payments to American and other foreign banks. 
Tweak a few of the details and Mexico in the 1980s looks a lot like most Southern European countries today. In Mexico's case, runaway government spending in the 1970s, fueled by high oil prices and greased by foreign debt, threatened to bankrupt the country after the Fed sharply raised interest rates to curb rampant inflation in the United States, increasing Mexico's interest payments even as oil prices crashed to earth.
Similarly, money poured into Spain and Greece when investors persuaded themselves that the bonds of all members of the euro zone should be as safe as Germany's, the region's most creditworthy country. In Greece, this allowed a government spending binge. In Spain it ignited a housing bubble. Both countries were left with an unbearable burden when the world economy hit a wall, creditors took flight and the money stopped.
European decision-making during the crisis of the last few years also shares some of the erratic nature of Mexican policy under President López Portillo. Cyprus was somehow allowed to threaten the euro area's banking system. European leaders then ''solved'' the problem by imposing capital controls that -- like those tried by Mexico -- are unlikely to work and will undoubtedly provide new headaches down the road.
But the most relevant parallel is one that European leaders refuse to see. If there is one overwhelming lesson from the debt crisis that struck Mexico and other Latin American countries so hard three decades ago, it is that countries that cannot grow will not pay. It is up to creditors, too, to allow them to grow. It took Mexico and its lenders seven years to figure that out. The European crisis is in its fifth year. You would think they might have learned something by now, but no.
Mexicans remember what happened after Mr. Silva Herzog's flight to Washington as the ''lost decade.'' Miguel de la Madrid, who took over as president the following December, promised deep budget cuts in exchange for bridge loans and debt rescheduling. That didn't work, so Mexico cut a new deal, getting new loans from commercial banks, the United States and the International Monetary Fund, in exchange for cutting government payrolls and subsidies, selling state-run companies and opening the country to foreign trade.
I started college a little before Mr. Silva Herzog's trip. In the five-plus years it took me to get a degree (Mexican degrees take longer) the Mexican economy contracted about 2 percent. By the time I got my graduate degree two years later, gross domestic product per person was 8 percent less than it was in 1982. Yet despite the enforced austerity, Mexico's foreign debt in 1988 still amounted to 56.5 percent of Mexico's economic output, more than it had six years before.
This must sound familiar to Europe's unemployed. If anything it's far worse there. The Greek economy has shrunk more than a fifth over the last five years. Government debt amounts to about 170 percent of the economy; it was 100 percent when the crisis started. The economies of Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy are smaller, too, than they were five years ago. Their debt burden is heavier. And still, European leaders insist that more of the same must be the solution.
Charles Dallara -- who earlier this year stepped down as the head of the Institute of International Finance, the lobbying group for multinational banks -- despairs of the depth of austerity imposed on Europe's debtor countries by its creditors in Berlin and Brussels.
Having worked on Latin America's debt problems at the Treasury Department and the International Monetary Fund throughout the 1980s, he has a keen sense of what did not work. ''They do not understand the flaws in their approach,'' he told me. ''It is fraying the fabric of democracy.''
But Latin America suggests there could be light at the end of the European debt tunnel, if only policy makers there could learn from previous experience.
Mexico's creditors performed a U-turn. Michel Camdessus, the head of the monetary fund then, became convinced that countries willing to continue economic reforms had to ''count on a more adequate alleviation of the present drag of debt-service payments on their adjustment efforts.''
Staring at the prospect of an imminent Mexican default that could have sunk some big American banks, Nicholas Brady, the newly minted Treasury secretary, prepared a plan for banks to reduce Mexico's debts on a ''voluntary'' basis instead. ''The problem was too much debt,'' Mr. Brady told me. ''The solution to too much debt is not more debt.''
In 1990, the deal was concluded by the Mexican government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Strong-armed by the Treasury Department and the monetary fund, banks swapped old Mexican debt for Brady bonds backed by United States Treasuries that offered a reduction in principal, below-market interest rates or new money. Mexico's economy expanded by 4 percent, the strongest growth since 1981. The Brady plan became the template for debt reduction across Latin America and beyond.
What can Europe learn from this experience? Proponents of austerity will probably note that the harsh years planted some of the seeds of Mexico's recovery. Bankers will remark that Mexico's absolute debt reduction package was small -- much less than the 50 percent or so already granted to Greece. Economists will note that Mexico had a degree of freedom that no member of the euro area has: it could devalue its currency to gain export competitiveness.
Nonetheless, the Brady plan was a crucial ingredient. It not only reduced Mexico's interest costs, it also produced a jolt of confidence that pushed down domestic interest rates and buoyed the peso -- reducing the burden of foreign debt. It prompted flight capital to return to the country and set off an investment boom.
Yet perhaps the most important lesson to be had about the dynamics of economic crises and relief is about what it takes to motivate the political will to act.
To some extent, we owe the Brady plan to the cold war. Political unrest simmered across Latin America. In 1988, Mexican voters almost ousted the party that had ruled the country since 1929. The region, Washington feared, risked falling into Soviet clutches. Arizona's governor, Bruce Babbitt, even called Mexico ''the ultimate domino.''
Lt. Col. John C. Mangels, studying at the Air War College in 1988, caught the flavor of thinking at the time. ''A financially devastated and chaotic Mexico would strongly interfere with our ability to maintain an East-West balance,'' he wrote. ''The long-term security threat from Mexico thus hinges on economics.''
In a speech almost three years ago, Mr. Brady asked himself whether something like the Brady plan could work now. ''I'm not sure,'' he answered. ''The level of cooperation I've described doesn't happen by chance, or easily.''
So far, Southern Europe's 1930s-style depression has done little to sway Europe's paymasters in Berlin. But the quagmire across the southern tier could rend Europe as deeply as the Iron Curtain divided East and West. Isn't it time for another U-turn?

HEADLINE: Schumer Says Storm Victims Deserve Aid For Self-Help

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
Senator Charles E. Schumer is urging New York City officials to make federal money available to homeowners who paid for their own repairs for damage caused by Hurricane Sandy.
As part of the $51 billion emergency aid package approved by Congress in January, $16 billion in Community Development Block Grants for Disaster Recovery was made available to areas that were affected. In the first round, New York City received $1.7 billion, and the government allocated $1.8 billion each to New York State and New Jersey.
While New York State and New Jersey have indicated that they plan to make reimbursements available, the city has indicated that it will not. Its draft proposal for how its money will be used includes the statement, ''Reimbursement for work that has been completed with private resources will not be permissible under this program.'' 
According to the city's proposal, which will be submitted to the federal government for approval after a comment period, $720 million of the grant money will be used for housing programs, including $350 million for rehabilitation of housing and $250 million for multifamily building rehabilitation. An additional $120 million will be used to fix public housing and make it sturdier.
While Mr. Schumer lauded the city for making multiple forms of aid available, he said that money would not be enough for homeowners who paid out of pocket for repairs that insurance and the Federal Emergency Management Agency did not cover.
''Much of this funding was not covered by private insurers, and in many cases FEMA individual assistance didn't adequately 'fill the gap,' '' he wrote in a letter to Shaun Donovan, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, whose office is authorized to approve the plans.
Lauren Passalacqua, a spokeswoman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, said the city chose not to include reimbursements in its initial draft because its ''immediate focus has been on how can we touch those people who haven't been able to do the necessary work.'' She said the office had received more than 350 comments on its proposal, which it will incorporate and then submit to HUD.
''The 14-day comment period on our proposal just closed, and we are considering a number of recommendations we received, including reimbursement for past repair work,'' she said.
Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery money is meant for homeowners, renters, businesses and communities affected by Hurricane Sandy. The goal is to provide money for ''unmet needs'' -- those not provided for by public or private sources like FEMA, the Small Business Administration or private insurance. The block grant money is intended for the most heavily affected areas and low and moderate-income populations. What the city and states are grappling with is reimbursements for homeowners.
Since New York State will seek to pay back homeowners who paid for damages related to the hurricane, the different city and state plans present an odd situation in which some New York residents -- say, those in Long Beach -- could get money while others, like those in the Rockaways in Queens, could not.
''The state fully intends to process reimbursement payments, subject to approval by feds,'' said Matt Wing, a spokesman for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. ''Homeowners who suffered a loss should be made whole to the greatest extent federal law allows.''
According to New Jersey's action plan, submitted to HUD for approval on March 28, details of what conditions need to be met for reimbursement have not been drawn up. The New Jersey Department of Community Affairs will handle the disbursement of funds when HUD approves the action plan, expected in April, according to a news release from that department.
One concern for state and local governments is the potential for fraud. In March, New Jersey passed legislation to establish a pool of monitors to oversee the distribution of Hurricane Sandy relief funds.

HEADLINE: In the Clear Light of Day, the Follies of the Night

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
Ah, the proverbial morning after, with its elation, deflation, confusion, humiliation, shock. It always brings some flood of pungent emotion, anyway, often different from whatever sentiment abounded under the comforting cover of night.
That phenomenon is the theme of ''The Spring Fling: The Morning After,'' a somewhat uneven collection of short plays, featuring a performance by the playwright of the moment, Annie Baker (''The Flick'' and others).
The undisputed highlight is Nick Jones's ''Thanks for the Bowl With the Spoon in It, Helen!'' In one long, early morning monologue, an uptight, skirt-suited young woman decides to confront her roommate, Helen, about leaving dirty dishes around the apartment. Well, ''confront'' is not quite the right word, considering that the monologuist directs her passive-aggressive rage at a closed bedroom door, behind which an unseen Helen is very loudly en flagrante. The writing here is insightful and often funny, and Allyson Morgan shows no vanity in her portrayal of the livid lodger. 
''Thanks ... Helen!'' is the fourth of six plays, and the others in this evening, presented by a New York-based production company, are mostly forgettable.
''Beyond the Sea,'' the evening's opener, takes place the morning after the happy couple in Disney's ''Little Mermaid'' get hitched. There probably isn't a millennial alive who doesn't love a good parody of the films from Disney's late-20th-century renaissance. But this play (by Joe Tracz) doesn't deliver on its gimmick. Many of the jokes -- about oil slicks and Ariel's ''awesome voice'' -- fall flat, partly a result of sluggish direction by Portia Krieger.
Hilary Bettis's ''Mud Hole'' captures two Amish teenagers on their rumspringa, waking up next to each other after a night of driving cars, ''dressing English'' (in contemporary, non-Amish clothes), drinking and partaking in other Devil's work. Adam Blodgett is affecting as an intense adolescent questioning his faith, but the play tries to pack in too much and closes with some sloppy loose ends.
''Hello Ms.'' recreates the all-nighter preceding the first issue of Ms. magazine (and, of course, the morning after it appears in print). Clad in bell bottoms and '70s eyeglass frames, Gloria Steinem (an easygoing, charming Ms. Baker) and Letty Cottin Pogrebin (Jo Mei) lead a discussion about what to name the publication: Sojourner, maybe? Some reference to ''bimbo'' or ''bitch'' or ''spinster,'' in order to ''take back'' misogynist epithets?
The play, by Heidi Schreck, is a nice snapshot of a historic moment for feminism, yet it doesn't crackle with the energy that you might expect, given the subject matter. In fact, it somehow feels as if it would have been a bit livelier as a magazine article rather than a play.
Krista Knight's ''Coach Darling'' features the most visually interesting theatrical direction, by Matt Dickson, including a slow-motion soccer game and other stylized elements. Then the play takes a sudden left turn that doesn't really make sense, and that compares unfavorably with other recent theatrical attempts to create a prequel for a certain beloved children's story (whose identity I won't reveal, but which might be evident from the title).
Finally ''Us; a Memory.,'' by Janine Nabers, takes place in couples' counseling, with many flashbacks of this couple's happy and unhappy recollections. With a perpetual lump in her throat, the actor Darcy Fowler takes us through the nooks and crannies of the souring relationship, but still can't persuade us to care much about these generic characters.
''The Spring Fling: The Morning After'' continues through Sunday at the Medicine Show Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton; (800) 838-3006, brownpapertickets.com.

HEADLINE: Margaret Thatcher, Lightning Rod

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Thatcher's Divided Isle,'' by A. C. Grayling (Op-Ed, April 9):
I was living in Britain when Margaret Thatcher came into power. It was 1979, the ''winter of discontent,'' when widespread strikes forced a vote of no confidence in James Callaghan's Labour government.
Public expenditures were 42.5 percent of gross domestic product. Inflation was in double digits. Unemployment was rising, and there were controls on prices, wages, dividends and currency. 
Mrs. Thatcher took on these dismal economic circumstances with vigor. Unimpressed by bullying from unions, she out-toughed them, and Britain became once again a place where businesses could flourish and attract investment, all to the benefit of the work force. Britain moved from the sixth largest economy in the world to the fourth largest.
She was magnificent. I doubt that we will see the likes of her again any time soon.
MARGARET McGIRR Greenwich, Conn., April 9, 2013
To the Editor:
When I lived in London in the late 1960s, I was acutely aware of the myriad problems facing Britain, yet there was still much to admire about a government that actually served and protected its most vulnerable citizens.
So I was shocked and revolted by what I found upon my return in the late 1980s, some 20 years later: hordes of homeless people, many of them children and elderly, living in the subways, pedestrian underpasses and rail stations; the faces of unspeakable human misery; and the all-too-human faces of Margaret Thatcher's odious policies.
When I raised this with a British friend, he sighed and told me that there was a name for such people: ''Thatcher's Army.''
VAUGHN A. CARNEY Stowe, Vt., April 9, 2013
To the Editor:
In the midst of mostly laudatory commentary, A. C. Grayling provides a starkly different view of Margaret Thatcher's legacy, arguing that she was a polarizing leader who ushered in a new era of division, inequality and incivility.
Many others have provided commentary on the close working relationship Mrs. Thatcher shared with Ronald Reagan (''Thatcher, Reagan and Their Special Relationship,'' by Nicholas Wapshott, Op-Ed, nytimes.com, April 9).
It should come as no surprise that the political philosophies shared by Mr. Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher led to the same outcome: the widespread division that plagues life in America is rooted firmly in the policy initiatives begun in the Reagan administration.
RANDALL R. YOUNG Rochester, Mich., April 9, 2013
To the Editor:
A. C. Grayling's article about Margaret Thatcher was remarkably one-sided. Ir leaves the impression that when Mrs. Thatcher came into office, she inherited a stable, prosperous Britain from the Wilson-Callaghan Labour governments of the 1970s and then proceeded to break the unions and destroy the manufacturing base and the mining industry.
In fact, the Britain that Mrs. Thatcher inherited was economically stagnant, with skyrocketing inflation, high unemployment and an industrial base frozen by union strikes and fuel shortages.
This culminated in the ''winter of discontent'' of 1978-79, when unions nationwide went on strike. Even the gravediggers in Liverpool took advantage of the Callaghan government's weakness and went on strike, and the unburied dead piled up.
Mrs. Thatcher pulled Britain out of a social and economic tailspin and restored it to its proper place as one of the major global economies and powers.
SCOTT D. PLATTON Washington, April 9, 2013
To the Editor:
According to David Brooks (column, April 9), Margaret Thatcher changed British values for the better, away from cooperation, self-exploration and narcissism to the ''vigorous virtues'' of ambition, competition and rectitude.
What quaint world does he live in, where ambition and competition are never narcissistic but only to be equated with rectitude?
Certainly not a historical one: those of us who lived through Mrs. Thatcher's 1980s witnessed an enormous explosion in narcissistic ambition and selfish, greedy, unregulated competition.

HEADLINE: School Reform in Syracuse

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Criticism of Cuomo Over Plight of Cities Raises Syracuse Mayor's Profile'' (news article, April 2): 
Mayor Stephanie A. Miner of Syracuse is the real goods, a fierce defender of her city who speaks truth to power. I have followed her career since 2009, when I began work on a book about school reform in Syracuse that will be published in November.
She not only was just about the first politician in town to embrace the whole-district reform that a group called Say Yes to Education proposed, but also won support and financing from other city leaders. Ms. Miner saw school improvement as a kind of last best hope for Syracuse. I quote her in the book as saying to me:
''The most important mission of the city and of the country is making sure that as a democracy we have an informed citizenry to go into the job market and that we have an economy where they can put those skills to work. ... When you have a system that fails, people lose hope and this is pernicious.''
Whether it is reviving the public schools or keeping her city from simply ''kicking the can down the road,'' as she puts it, when it comes to finances, Stephanie Miner is willing to take on tough issues.

HEADLINE: Quinn and a 'Smoke-Filled Room'

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
It is a fairly typical political advertisement: cheesy production values, overwrought narration and a soundtrack of ominous piano music playing over the unsmiling visage of the ad's target, Ms. Quinn.
But ''Smoke-Filled Room,'' which started to run on Monday on three cable television channels, has gained attention for its unusual provenance: it was financed by a group of political activists who are not affiliated with any candidate. The group, called NYC Is Not for Sale 2013, is legally allowed to spend unlimited amounts on political advertising, as long as it does not coordinate its activity with a candidate. The group's founders have pledged to spend more than $1 million on ads that attack Ms. Quinn -- the first instance of a so-called independent expenditure in the 2013 mayor's race.
The activists behind the ad include an animal-rights group that has long clashed with Ms. Quinn over horse-drawn carriages; a labor leader whose union has given money to Ms. Quinn and her rivals; and a wealthy businesswoman who has contributed to Ms. Quinn's campaign. So far, the group has declined to disclose a full list of its donors, although it will be required to do so by mid-May. 
Ms. Quinn has responded by calling the ad a ''disgrace'' and labeling it a troublesome intrusion of outside money into the city's stringent campaign finance system. On Tuesday, she asked her rivals for mayor to sign a pledge condemning the use of any independent expenditure in the campaign.
In an unusual move, Ms. Quinn's campaign lawyer also sent cease-and-desist letters to two New York television providers, Cablevision and Time Warner Cable, demanding that the advertisement be stopped. Ms. Quinn's campaign contended that it contained ''a false statement''; the ad's creators say it is accurate. The ad continues to run.
Fact Check
Real Estate Money?
The screen for ''Smoke-Filled Room,'' the first television ad of the New York City mayor's race, opens on a room smothered in smoke, and the ad quotes from a 2011 column in The New York Times that described Christine C. Quinn as the recipient of ''golden truckloads of contributions from the ... hedge fund and real estate set.'' Ms. Quinn has received about $1.3 million from real estate industry contributors, significantly more than any other candidate, according to a recent analysis. Ms. Quinn does not smoke cigarettes.
'Living Wage' Battle
The narrator intones: ''On the issues New Yorkers care most about, she is always on the wrong side.'' The ad cites a Daily News column asserting that Ms. Quinn, the City Council speaker, blocked a Council vote on the so-called living wage bill, which would raise the wages of workers at city-subsidized real estate projects. Ms. Quinn did block any vote on versions of this bill for months; she eventually supported compromise legislation that covered fewer workers than the initial proposal, and that exempted employees of a major real estate developer. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg vetoed the bill; the Council overrode the veto and is fighting a lawsuit filed by the Bloomberg administration to overturn the law.
Term Limits and Paid Sick Leave
The narrator refers to Ms. Quinn's ''flip-flop on paid sick leave and on term limits.'' For three years, Ms. Quinn stopped the Council from voting on legislation that would require some city businesses to provide paid days off to sick employees. Ms. Quinn said the city's economy could not sustain the added costs. But this year, under pressure, she negotiated a compromise, pleasing some advocates. On term limits, Ms. Quinn did reverse her position: in December 2007, she said she would ''not support the repeal or change of term limits through any mechanism''; in October 2008, she led a successful effort in the Council to overturn the city's existing term limits law.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Missiles and Memorial Stones: Figuring Out North Korea and China

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: Amid talk of China&#8217;s position on North Korea shifting, an ancient archeological find may point to its real interests in the region, some Koreans believe. 

 BODY:
BEIJING - Everybody is watching North Korea closely: Will it launch a ballistic missile? Destroy Seoul? Or, on an entirely different note, hold an international marathon in Pyongyang on Sunday to mark the birthday on April 15 of the nation's founder, Kim Il-sung, as Japan's NHK World has reported, citing North Korea's state-run news agency?
But for all the intense focus on the North, perhaps more attention should be paid to China. Attention of a different sort, that is. 
Recently, speculation appears to be growing among United States officials that China is shifting its position on North Korea, cooling to the country. China has long been North Korea's only major ally and relations traditionally were as close as "lips and teeth."
Yet on the ground - or perhaps in the ground - here in northeast Asia, there are concerns among Koreans that China's interest may be motivated by something very different from the United States': buttressing historical and territorial claims. In other words, China is not really interested in aligning itself more closely with the United States on North Korea because it has its own game plan. All it has to do is ensure that U.S.-North Korean relations remain terrible, as they are, and it increases its influence over the region, politically, economically and strategically.
As the Beijing-based journalist, Francesco Sisci, wrote in a column in the Asia Times Online: "Some Chinese believe the North Korean nuclear test was actually aimed at China, not at South Korea or the U.S. They underscored that for the first time China and the U.S. were informed at the same time about the experiment. In the past, China was informed first."
Mr. Sisci did not address the issue of territorial claims but wrote: "Pyongyang is tired of being used as a passive pawn in China's bigger foreign policy plans," adding, "The ideal situation for Beijing would be a regime in Pyongyang that gives up its nuclear weapons and embraces wider economic reforms."
For evidence of deep suspicion among Koreans about China, people need look no further than the reported discovery late last year of a memorial stone from the Koguryo, a dynasty that ruled approximately the territory of North Korea (and some of the South) and large parts of China's northeastern provinces, flourishing for 700 years until 1,300 years ago.
"China conducting closed research into ancient Korean dynasty," read a headline in the Hankyoreh, a South Korean newspaper. "Observers say work on the Goguryeo stele is an attempt to incorporate it into Chinese history," the paper said, using an alternative spelling for Koguryo.
The issue is not new. In 2004, China-South Korean relations soured over it. As my colleague James Brooke reported at the time, the tensions were prompted, among other things, by Xinhua, China's state-run news agency, calling the kingdom a "subordinate state that fell under the jurisdiction of the Chinese dynasties and was under the great influence of China's politics, culture and other areas."
That year, too, the Chinese Foreign Ministry deleted references to Koguryo from the Korean history section on its Web site. A Chinese government study group, the Northeast Project, had been set up two years previously, in 2002, to establish the kind of history Beijing was looking for, and issued academic papers bolstering the position that the ancient kingdom was merely a Chinese vassal state.
Protests erupted in South Korea. But North Korea is no less sensitive about China's claims to the kingdom, which Koreans of all kind see as the forerunner of their nation.
As my colleague in Seoul, Choe Sang-hun, explained back then, two-thirds of Koguryo's historical territory lies within contemporary China, and Beijing wants to forestall any future Korean claim over its northeastern territory, which is home to large ethnic Korean communities.
At Jilin University, in Jilin province, which borders North Korea, the archaeologist Wei Cuncheng is a key researcher into the bygone dynasty and worked on the Northeast Project, according to the university's Web site.
Today, Mr. Wei and others are engaged in a research project that began in 2011 and is due to run until 2015, on Koguryo and Balhae culture (Bohai in Chinese). Bohai is today the name of a sea area off China's northeast coast, but Balhae was a kingdom in the region about 1,300 years ago, the successor to the Koguryo. The research is a "major project" in the social sciences, the Web site says.
What about the newly discovered memorial stone that has been provoking interest?
The stele, which appears to date to around 414 A.D., was discovered last July in Maxian near Ji'an city in Jilin province, though the discovery was not announced until the beginning of January 2013, the Hankyoreh wrote.
It is the third such object to be discovered in the area, and the same people on the Northeast Project are involved: "The Hankyoreh confirmed that the research team includes a large number of scholars who took part in the Northeast Project, which was controversial for its distortions" of Koguryo history, it wrote.
"Officials in the city of Ji'an in Jilin Province, northeast China," where the new Koguryo stele was discovered, "assembled a guidance team for protection and study of the gravestone. The research team, according to an announcement posted recently by Ji'an's Cultural Administration on a local government website, includes Wei Cuncheng, professor at Jilin University," the Hankyoreh wrote.
Concerns are being raised that China may use the results of the study of the new Koguryo stele to reinforce its argument that Koguryo belongs to China, the newspaper wrote.
So amid all the talk of missiles and marathons, it is worth noting the story of the memorial stone, which points to older, deeper issues at work here in Northeast Asia - and to China's unique interests in the region.

HIGHLIGHT: Tensions continue on the Korean peninsula; unwanted horses in Spain; a surprising survey of European household finances; and trouble in night-life paradise. 

 BODY:
 NEWS As North Korea warned foreigners on Tuesday that they might want to leave South Korea because the peninsula was on the brink of nuclear war - a statement that analysts dismissed as hyperbole - the American commander in the Pacific expressed worries that the North's young leader, Kim Jong-un, might not have left himself an easy exit to reduce tensions. Choe Sang-hun reports from Seoul, and David E. Sanger from Washington. 
While a horse meat scandal recently alarmed Europe, another one has erupted in Spain - the increasing slaughter of horses that people either do not want or cannot afford. Raphael Minder reports from Chapineria, Spain.
A handful of Taliban emissaries flew into Qatar on an American plane in 2010 to discuss negotiating a peace deal that could stabilize Afghanistan and allow the United States a graceful exit. But peace talks broke down, and three years after their secret arrival, the Taliban officials remain idle and their political office in Doha remains unused. Rod Nordland reports from Doha.
The grandly named Syrian Observatory for Human Rights is virtually a one-man band, run by Rami Abdul Rahman from a drab industrial city in Britain. Neil MacFarquhar reports from Coventry, England.
Malaysia on Wednesday scheduled national elections for May 5, setting the stage for the biggest test of the ruling party's dominance since the country gained independence from Britain more than five decades ago. Gerry Mullany reports.
The Italians are the most prudent people in Europe. Spaniards and Greeks are not as badly off as their homelands' dismal economic statistics would suggest. And pity the Germans. They are poorer than the Cypriots they are helping to bail out. These were the results of a survey of European household debt and wealth - but a caveat is in order. Jack Ewing reports from Frankfurt.
In World War II, Japan produced the feared Mitsubishi Zero fighter planes. Today, the same company is working on a regional jet that it hopes will propel it into the industry's big leagues. Hiroko Tabuchi reports from Tokyo.

HEADLINE: Varieties of Not Working

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Reductions in unemployment have been largely matched by reductions in the number of people seeking work, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
Employment can be a better indicator of labor market activity than unemployment, because unemployment is not the only way that a person can be without work.
The blue series in the chart below shows the reduction in unemployment since March 2012, expressed as a percentage of the population (e.g., in a population of 100 million, 0.1 percentage points means 100,000 people and 0.5 percentage points means 500,000.) In order to correct for the movement of baby boomers into retirement, I used Bureau of Labor Statistics data only for people 25 to 54 years old (this group is about 124 million and has been falling a little). Over the subsequent year, and especially since mid-2012, unemployment was reduced significantly. 
But reduced unemployment is not the same as more employment, because the third labor force classification is "out of the labor force." Neither the unemployed nor those out of the labor force have a job, but only the unemployed are actively looking for one.

The red series in the chart shows that the "out of the labor force" ranks have increased roughly as much as unemployment has been reduced, and the difference between the blue and the red series indicates the change in the fraction of the population that is employed. For the months when the blue series is above the red series, employment per capita has increased since March 2012.
Because the blue series hardly exceeds the red series, if at all, the large majority of the reduction in unemployment has been associated with offsetting increases in people out of the labor force.
While the reduction in unemployment and the growth in the out of the labor force more or less cancel each other out, jobs are at least being created fast enough to absorb the growth in the working-age population. That additional population increases demand, which contributes to the jobs being created.
Retirements and going to school could increase the number of people out of the labor force, but the data I've shown are for an age group in which retirement and schooling are rare. For the 25-to-54 age group, "out of the labor force" typically represents people who are finding ways to get by without working.
Some people moving out of the labor force devote their time to caring for their young children while their spouses obtain cash income for the family. That some of the growth in those out of the labor force has occurred among married people suggests that such specialization in the family could be part of the story. But the fact that this group is growing especially among unmarried people suggests that family specialization explains at best a minority of the aggregate changes.
Unemployment insurance benefits are paid only to people who report that they are actively looking for work. Some unemployed have long been skeptical that they can find a good job and are just going through the motions of job search to satisfy the unemployment program's requirements (see this testimony to a House subcommittee by Stacey G. Reece, co-owner of a recruitment firm in Gainesville, Fla., who said he witnessed people "applying for jobs only to protect their status for unemployment insurance").
When such a person's unemployment benefits run out, he may look less actively for work, which changes his classification from unemployed to out of the labor force.
The termination of unemployment benefits can, and sometimes does, have the opposite effect, because the loss of income can make out-of-work people more seriously consider accepting a low-paying job. But unemployment insurance is by no means the only safety-net program. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly known as food stamps) is a major and newly expanded safety-net program and does not require its beneficiaries to work or be looking for work. Curiously, SNAP has been expanding while the unemployment rate falls.
People without jobs increasingly take part in the disability insurance program, which does not require people to look for work because "disability" means that the person is unable to work. Medicaid is another major safety program that does not require its participants to work.
A significant part of the recent reductions in the unemployment rate may reflect movements of people between safety net programs rather than any significant change in their job-finding prospects.

HEADLINE: Antique Tractor Sale Will Be Crawling With Caterpillars

BYLINE: TUDOR VAN HAMPTON


HIGHLIGHT: George E. Logue Sr. collected scores of tractors and bulldozers over the years. Now that he has passed away, his collection is up for grabs. 

 BODY:
A collection of nearly 100 antique tractors, mostly of the bright-yellow Caterpillar variety, will be auctioned at 10 a.m. Wednesday in Trout Run, Pa.
The auction's 109 lots, which range from farm tractors to heavy earthmovers and various durable parts, carry an total estimated value of $500,000, said Scott Edwards, territory manager for Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers, which is managing the sale.
The presale value is Mr. Edwards' own best guess because such collections of vintage industrial iron rarely come up for auction. Still, many antique tractor enthusiasts have inquired about the sale. 
"It's not something you see every day," Mr. Edwards said in a telephone interview. "I've had calls from throughout the United States, Canada - all over."
Rare items up for bid include a 1935 Caterpillar RD8 crawler tractor weighing more than 16 tons and a towable 1933 Caterpillar 48 elevating grader. Mr. Edwards said the tractor-grader combination helped build the Alaska-Canadian Highway, which traverses parts of British Columbia, the Yukon Territory and Alaska.
A contractor, inventor and machine-shop businessman named George E. Logue Sr., pieced together the bevy of bulldozers over his lifetime, housing them in two barns on his family farm in Trout Run. Mr. Logue, who lived in Williamsport, Pa., died in October at 85, prompting the family to sell the collection.
Mr. Logue "fell in love with Caterpillar tractors" when he was 5 years old, said his son Bob, who is 57. His father served in the Army Air Forces during World War II, Bob Logue said, and graduated from Penn State in 1951 with a degree in agricultural engineering. He eventually sought work at machinery companies in the Midwest.
"He applied for a job at International Harvester and Caterpillar," said Bob Logue. "Cat offered him an interview, and International offered him a job. He took the job."
A tinkerer, George Logue moved back to Pennsylvania in 1954 to start up his own construction business, using a backhoe that he built from scratch. He sold the company in 1984. He also operated a machine shop, which is still in business in Montoursville, Pa. Mr. Logue held several patents for heavy equipment, including one for a remote-controlled minesweeper that he developed for the Navy.
"He was an amazing guy," said Bob Logue, who also was bitten by the collecting bug. A former Honda motorcycle dealer, Mr. Logue operates a museum of 150 vintage motorcycles in Williamsport.
Most of the giant machines in George Logue's collection are still in running condition, said Eric Orlemann, a machinery historian who lives in Decatur, Ill.
"He always kept them in super mechanically sound condition because he did all of that work himself," Mr. Orlemann said, adding that Mr. Logue kept a healthy supply of parts for the old tractors. 
Mr. Orlemann said that several of the machines for sale are featured in his book, "Caterpillar Chronicle: History of the Greatest Earthmovers," published in 2000.
Registration is free for the one-day auction; lots will be offered with no reserve. Winning bidders will be charged a 2.5 percent buyer's premium that is capped at $950 per lot.

HIGHLIGHT: Recent deaths of five Indians in South Sudan highlight the bifurcated nature of the United Nations peacekeeping force. 

 BODY:
When the United Nations peacekeeping forces face a violent conflict, as they did in South Sudan this week, odds are high that a South Asian soldier will be among the injured or killed.
That's because Bangladesh, Pakistan and India, in order, are the top three countries supplying troops to the 93,368-strong peacekeeping force. Soldiers from these countries, together with Nepal, make up one-third of the total force. The other main contributors to the force are countries in Africa. 
In marked contrast, the countries that foot the over $7 billion annual bill for the United Nations peacekeeping forces are overwhelmingly Western nations, led by the United States, Japan and Britain. 
The division is rooted in history and economic necessity, defense analysts say.
Member states of the United Nations provide troops to the peacekeeping force on a voluntary basis, and the governments of these states are reimbursed for each soldier they provide at the rate of $1,028 per soldier per month. In addition, countries get payments for the equipment they send, whether it is personnel carriers or tanks.
"The fact of the matter is, if you send forces for U.N. peacekeeping, you get a lot of revenues," said Satish Mishra, a senior fellow specializing in politics and governance at the Observer Research Foundation in Mumbai.
India's troops in the United Nations force are mostly from the 1.1 million-soldier Indian Army. The peacekeepers draw their usual army salary, plus additional payments from the Indian government that can more than double that salary.
The Indian government, meanwhile, receives payments from the United Nations in United States dollars, but pays soldiers in rupees, which helps increase foreign currency inflows.
For countries like India that are eager to secure a United Nations Security Council seat, sending troops is seen as a show of goodwill.
"Whether you call it peacekeeping or peacemaking, it all adds to India's case for a permanent seat on the Security Council, as perhaps one of the strongest enforcers of the U.N. writ and a responsible state," said Bharat Karnad, research professor in national security studies at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi.
Western nations are more wary of sending their troops to conflict-stricken areas that they don't view as a crucial part of their foreign policy, while developing countries appear to be more willing to bear the human loss of life in these areas, other analysts said.
"There is a lesser emphasis in developing countries on the human cost of sending peacekeeping forces," said Mr. Mishra. "But whenever developed countries such as the United States have sent troops to foreign countries, the deaths of soldiers have led to a lot of popular resentment against the government."
At the same time, Western countries with seats in the United Nations Security Council may be pursuing their own agenda in a volatile area when they send in their own troops, said Neelam Deo, director of Gateway House, a research institution in Mumbai, and a former ambassador to Denmark and Côte d'Ivoire. Traditionally, "the Security Council member troops follow their own foreign policy agenda," she said.
Still, the bifurcated setup has created some friction, defense experts said. "There is some discontent brewing, for the reasons that the third world countries put their soldiers in harm's way" and Western countries are seen as not willing to do so, said Mr. Karnad . "Sometimes, as it happened in South Sudan, peacekeeping is a difficult business."
Five Indian soldiers were killed on Tuesday while protecting civilians in South Sudan.
"About 30 peacekeepers were escorting a civilian convoy when they were ambushed by some 200 armed, unidentified men near the settlement of Gumuruk in Jonglei," the United Nations said in a statement.
"A firefight erupted as the Indian peacekeepers tried to protect the civilians," the statement said, and Indian peacekeepers "fought courageously." The attack was "a deliberate targeting of the United Nations."
The incident in South Sudan was "extremely tragic and unfortunate," Ms. Deo said, but added that "such incidents are highly uncommon." Generally, she said, sending troops to the United Nations peacekeeping forces allows India to "gain a lot of goodwill" in the countries where they are present, without much loss of life.

HEADLINE: Europe Urged to Make a U-Turn on Austerity

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: George Soros and Jacob Lew are among those calling for Europe&#8217;s leaders to rethink stringent financial policies that they claim are making a bad economic situation worse. 

 BODY:
LONDON - Austerity in Europe is under fire, and not just from protesters.
In recent days, influential voices have joined a chorus of appeals to the Continent's leaders to rethink stringent financial policies that they claim are making a bad economic situation worse.
Advice has ranged from a bruising attack by George Soros, the billionaire international financier, on Germany for squeezing its poorer European partners, to the more polite suggestion of Jacob J. Lew, the U.S. Treasury secretary, that governments should refocus their policies on promoting growth. 
Closer to home, Arnaud Montebourg, the French minister for industrial renewal, warned that a regime of austerity within the European Union was leading to disaster.
Mr. Montebourg, considered on the left of President François Hollande's Socialist government, said policies that killed growth were "absurd and dangerous" and had no support among Europe's citizens.
In Portugal, meanwhile, the Constitutional Court struck down a series of austerity-linked pay and benefit cuts, leaving the government of Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho to find other ways of filling a fiscal hole.
Mr. Soros reprised a familiar theme in a speech in Frankfurt on Tuesday when he said Germany should allow indebted countries of the euro zone to raise money through bonds that would be guaranteed by the entire 17-member currency bloc.
Otherwise, he contended, Germany should ease their burden by leaving the euro and allowing others to issue so-called eurobonds.
Austerity did not work, he said, if every government was taking similar measures at the same time. "You cannot shrink the debt burden by shrinking the budget deficit."
Mr. Soros, the Hungarian-born investor and philanthropist, was speaking as Mr. Lew was concluding a two-day effort to persuade Europe to consider shifting its focus to growth from budget balancing.
As my colleague Annie Lowreywrote, the Treasury secretary's mission highlighted a deep trans-Atlantic gulf on economic policy.
Speaking in Berlin, Mr. Lew said, "The driver for economic growth will be consumer demand, and policies that would help to encourage consumer demand in countries that have the capacity would be helpful."
Annie quoted a Treasury official as saying that, while the Americans did not endeavor to lecture the Europeans, they did focus on the profound need for growth on the Continent, for the good of Europe as well as the world.
Austerity policies have long been challenged on the streets of Spain and Greece, and more recently Cyprus, with protesters questioning the policies of their recession-hit governments.
But in the relatively prosperous economies of northern Europe, particularly Germany, there is resistance to measures that could be seen as financing the profligacy of indebted European partners.
The New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, a consistent opponent of what he has called the "cult of austerity,"said last year that the protesters had it right.
"More austerity serves no useful purpose; the truly irrational players here are the allegedly serious politicians and officials demanding ever more pain," he wrote.
That pain has been most felt in countries such as Portugal, where the conservative government has stuck to the stringent terms of a $100 billion bailout negotiated with international creditors two years ago.
Its austerity program has now been challenged, however, by a Constitutional Court ruling last Friday that cuts to the pay and benefits of government employees were unlawful.
As Raphael Minder wrote in the IHT, Portugal has now become a test case of the limits of the austerity plans that have been prescribed across Southern Europe.
The court's decision, he wrote, has now called into question "how much austerity will be tolerated, not only by disgruntled citizens but also by justices who often act as the guardians of the Continent's cherished social welfare system."
Reviewing the developments in Portugal, Nils Pratley of The Guardian wrote that the euro zone should find some pro-growth strategies and "shed its austerity obsession."
"It's time to try something new," he wrote. "Whether Germany is listening, though, is another matter entirely."

HEADLINE: Moving to a Place Where Strangers on the Street Say Hello

BYLINE: BRYAN STROMER


HIGHLIGHT: Bryan Stromer, a student at the New York City Lab School for Collaborative Studies, is excited to attend Vanderbilt University after experiencing Southern hospitality for the first time during a campus visit. 

 BODY:
My main goal for spring break was to visit Vanderbilt University. Even though I had been admitted in January as a Posse Scholar, I had yet to see the campus for myself. So, my parents and I got on a plane and arrived in Nashville on a Sunday.
It was raining when we arrived. We drove around for a bit and found a great Italian restaurant that rivaled the ones in New York City. As the day progressed, it stopped raining. 
I had heard wonderful things about Nashville, but I could not have imagined how much I would love this place. There are plenty of interesting things to do, and I could sense the vibrant culture when I visited.
Growing up in New York, it is sometimes easy to forget that there is a world beyond the five boroughs. Even some of the airport restaurants in Nashville featured live country music, driving home the fact that this is Music City.
The people were also incredibly nice; strangers on the street would say hello. It was my first time experiencing Southern hospitality!

The next day, I got to set foot on Vanderbilt's campus for the first time. Before this trip, I had only seen Vanderbilt through pictures on its Web site and the university's virtual tour.
When I was planning my visit, I registered for Vanderbilt's 'Dore for a Day program. This allowed me to spend the afternoon shadowing a current student, which gave me an idea of what Vanderbilt is like through a student's eyes.
I arrived a bit early for the 'Dore for a Day program, and while I was waiting for my student host, I saw two admissions counselors that I knew, including the one I had met at a college fair that my high school hosted last year. This was the counselor who told me about the programs Vanderbilt offers and helped me realize that this was where I wanted to go.
It was great to be able to speak to the admissions counselors again as an admitted student.
As a 'Dore for a Day, I got to tour the campus, eat in the dining hall and sit in on a class. The student I was assigned to was extremely knowledgeable and was also studying in Vanderbilt's Peabody College of Education and Human Development. The lecture I attended was informative, and I liked that the professor threw in some comic remarks to make economics seem more interesting.
One of the highlights of my tour was visiting the freshman commons. At Vanderbilt, all of the freshmen live together on a separate section of the campus. This is exciting because it means we will have more time to bond as a class. It was great to see the dorm rooms and to know that this is where I will be living next year.
On the plane ride home, I thought about how this visit had confirmed that Vanderbilt had everything I was looking for in a school and more. I can't wait for move-in day in August.

HEADLINE: Architectural Masterpiece in Moscow Under Grave Threat, Preservationists Say

BYLINE: SOPHIA KISHKOVSKY


HIGHLIGHT: Alarms are raised about the cylindrical house designed by Konstantin Melnikov. 

 BODY:
MOSCOW - The Russian avant-garde architect Konstantin Melnikov's seminal cylindrical housein Moscow, which has inspired architects around the world for nearly a century, is gravely threatened by construction of a large multipurpose complex abutting its tiny backyard, Russian and international preservationists say.
The work has led to "numerous new cracks" to the building's load-bearing and partition walls and signs of damage to its foundation, according to an appeal that Russian architecture and heritage experts addressed to President Vladimir V. Putin and other officials. 
The house is on a side street just off of the central Arbat pedestrian mall, which is known as a busy tourist trap. Real estate continues to be at prime value in Russia even as the country's oil boom has waned. The construction project is the latest to take place in the vicinity of what is regarded as one of modernist architecture's most famous works, completed in 1929 and used by Melnikov as a home and studio when the very act of building a private house in Soviet Russia was revolutionary. 
The letter to Mr. Putin was posted this month onthe Web site of Archnadzor, a Moscow-based preservation watchdog group that is battling developers across the Russian capital. It was accompanied by photographs of the damage, and warned that the "risk of losing a masterpiece of 20th-century world architecture" had "grown significantly" and was magnified by a failure to take measures to prevent the house's collapse. 
"The eyes of the world are on Russia in this important case," Ana Tostoes, the chairwoman of Docomomo International, a grassroots architectural heritage organization, said in a joint statement released with the International Council on Monuments and Sites. The organizations have also appealed to Mr. Putin to intervene. 
Natalia Melikova, a recent master of fine arts graduate from the Academy of Art University in San Francisco, posteda detailed report on the Web site of the United States branch of Docomomo. In it, Konstantin Melnikov's granddaughter, Ekaterina Karinskaya, who lives in the house, says that the construction is part of a willful plan "to simply destroy the house."
Ms. Melikova has returned to Moscow, where she has started the Constructivist Project to try to save the Melnikov house and other endangered sites.
A prolonged dispute over ownership of the house, still not resolved, has kept it from being given official landmark status and the latest in a series of stalled efforts to turn it into a museum is in the earliest stages. 
Architectural heritage is in danger around Moscow. The great-grandson of the Russian engineering design pioneer Vladimir Shukhov warned last month that his grandfather's early Soviet-era radio tower, which architects including Norman Foster have named as one of their greatest sources of inspiration, could soon collapse from neglect.
Tsarist-era buildings are also under constant threat. Archnadzor is fighting to save a mansion that served as the setting for scenes in "War and Peace" and "Anna Karenina." An organization with Kremlin connections has been reconstructing the building. And just outside of Moscow, preservationists are fighting development around Arkhangelskoye, a palatial estate that was once home to Feliks Yusupov, a prince who took part in the killing of Rasputin. They say that construction projects promoted by Russia's defense ministry and the billionaire Viktor Vekselberg would destroy the estate's grounds.

HEADLINE: Obama Likes Some Sin Taxes More Than Others

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama&#8217;s budget continues the Democratic preference for cigarette taxes over alcohol or soda taxes &#8211; even though alcohol and soda consumption may cost society more money than smoking. 

 BODY:
President Obama's budget continues the Democratic preference for cigarette taxes over alcohol or soda taxes - even though alcohol and soda consumption may cost society more money than smoking.
In his budget, Mr. Obama calls for almost doubling the federal cigarette tax, to $1.95 per pack, up 94 cents from the current level. The tax increase would raise about $8 billion a year over the next decade and help pay for early childhood education.
Higher taxes on cigarettes reduce smoking rates, multiple studies have found. Lower smoking rates, of course, bring large benefits for society, by reducing early death and making people healthier. We'll leave to others the debate over whether tobacco taxes today are too low, too high or just right. 
But the Obama budget helps highlight how politically popular tobacco taxes are even though they may pack less of a fiscal punch than other sin taxes.
Why? Smokers tend to inflict damage mostly on themselves. The rise of no-smoking workplaces and restaurants means that secondhand smoke does less damage than it once did. And smokers die early, reducing their long-term use of Social Security, Medicare and other federal benefits. 
Soda and alcohol are both a bit different. From some earlier reporting I did on alcohol:
Right now, the patchwork of alcohol taxes isn't coming close to covering those costs - the costs of drunken-driving checkpoints, of hospital bills for alcohol-related accidents and child abuse, and of the economic loss caused by death and injury. [In 2006] some 17,000 Americans, or almost 50 a day, died in alcohol-related car accidents. An additional 65,000 people a year die from other accidents, assaults or illnesses in which alcohol plays a major role.
And yet alcohol taxes just keep falling, once inflation is taken into account:
Since the early 1990s, the federal tax on wine - $1.07 a gallon - hasn't budged. The taxes on beer and liquor haven't changed either, which means that, in inflation-adjusted terms, alcohol taxes have been steadily falling.
Each of the three taxes is now effectively 33 percent lower than it was in 1992. Since 1970, the federal beer tax has plummeted 63 percent. Many states taxes have also been falling.
Soda drinking does not inflict the same kind of damage that alcohol does, obviously. But soda is probably a bigger drain on taxpayers' money than smoking. From an earlier Economix post:
... obesity appears to raise lifetime health care costs.
You find a lot of agreement among health economists on this point. "Unlike for smoking, lifetime costs are indeed positive," Eric Finkelstein, an economist and health researcher at Duke, says. "The positive costs result because the mortality effect for obesity is much smaller than it is for smoking and the costs start much earlier in life." Amitabh Chandra, a Harvard health economist, agrees: "Obesity is an important determinant of the rise in health care spending."
Dana Goldman, an economist at the Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics at the University of Southern California, has estimated that 3 percent of Medicare and Medicaid spending stems from the rise in obesity since 1978. And the link between obesity and soda - which has no nutritional benefit and whose consumption has soared over that time - may be stronger than the link between obesity and other any factor.
A recent bipartisan budget plan, from former Senator Pete Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, and Alice Rivlin, a Democrat and former budget director, called for a new federal soda tax. The soda industry, no surprise, opposes such a tax.
You can make an argument for or against all kinds of sin taxes. What I find striking is how popular one of them remains - even after sharp increases in recent decades - and how unpopular others remain.
A hat tip to Richard Yeselson, whose tweet on alcohol taxes this morning led to this post.

HEADLINE: Highlights From Obama's Budget Proposal

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Times reporters analyze how the White House&#8217;s budget request would affect federal agencies and programs. 

 BODY:
The White House's budget request for the 2014 fiscal year drew headlines for its proposed changes to how entitlement benefits are calculated in a compromise effort to cut the budget. But how would other departments and programs be affected? While Congress almost never enacts the president's budget as proposed and Republicans oppose many of the specifics, the budget offers a window on Mr. Obama's priorities at the beginning of his second term. Times reporters provided analysis.
 3:20 P.M. | Higher Ed: Changes to Student Loan Interest Rates 
The president's budget proposes that interest rates for new student loans, which are currently set by Congress, instead be tied to the government's cost of borrowing. Once set, the rates would remain the same for the term of the loan, which is typically 10 years. 
Consumer and student advocacy groups have generally supported the idea of a market-based rate, but only if there is a cap. The president's proposal does not provide any limit on how high the rate can rise.
"While in the short term the President's budget includes critical savings for millions of students and their families who will rely on federal student loans to pay for college, we are concerned by the long-term implications," said Anne Johnson, director of Campus Progress, part of the Center for American Progress. "Without a cap, a market-based rate means that future generations of students could face higher levels of education debt as a result of higher interest rates." 
The proposal contains a provision that would expand repayment options so that student borrowers' monthly payments would not exceed 10 percent of their discretionary income. Under the president's budget, interest rates would be pegged to 10-year Treasury notes, plus an extra 0.93 percent for subsidized Stafford loans, an extra 2.93 percent for unsubsidized Stafford loans, and an extra 3.93 percent for loans to parents and graduate students. 
The current rate for subsidized Stafford loans, which go mainly to low- and middle-income students, is 3.4 percent; that rate is due to double this summer. 
This week, Republican Senators Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, and Richard Burr of North Carolina proposed legislation that would have set new student loan rates at the yield on 10-year treasury notes, plus 3 percent. Right now, that would mean an interest rate of 4.75 percent - higher than the 3.4 percent rate on subsidized Stafford loans but substantially lower than the rates on other student loans, all of which are at least 6.8 percent.
 The budget also contains a proposal for a $1 billion Race to the Top competition for higher education, something the administration failed to win from the last Congress. It would maintain Pell grants at the current maximum, $5,645, and undertake a reorganization of science and technology education programs.
- Tamar Lewin 
 2:27 P.M. | Health: More on Medicare Changes 
President Obama's budget would reduce the growth of federal health spending by $401 billion over 10 years. 
The savings include $57 billion of higher payments by Medicare beneficiaries; cuts of $306 billion in projected Medicare payments to health care providers; and $19 billion to be squeezed out of Medicaid, the program for low-income people.
Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, said Wednesday that the president was requesting $1.5 billion to operate health insurance supermarkets, known as exchanges, in 2014. In addition, the administration plans to raise $450 million by charging user fees to insurance companies allowed to sell their products to consumers and small businesses in the exchanges.
The federal government will have the primary responsibility for operating the exchanges in more than 30 states.
Mr. Obama would require high-income Medicare beneficiaries to pay $50 billion of additional premiums for coverage of doctors' service and prescription drugs over the next 10 years. 
In addition, he would require new Medicare beneficiaries to pay co-payments for home health care services, starting in 2017. And he would impose a surcharge on Medicare premiums for new beneficiaries who buy the most generous private insurance policies to supplement Medicare. Such Medigap policies reduce the incentive for beneficiaries to consider the costs of health care services, the White House said.
The home health co-payments and premium surcharges would raise $3.6 billion from 2017 to 2013, the administration said.
Mr. Obama would require drug manufacturers to provide additional discounts, or rebates, to Medicare for prescription drugs bought by low-income beneficiaries. Medicare would thus get discounts similar to those that drug makers now provide to Medicaid.
The White House said this proposal would reduce budget deficits by $123 billion over 10 years. Drug makers have beat back similar proposals in the past, saying they amount to price controls.
In addition, Mr. Obama wants to close the coverage gap, or "doughnut hole,'' in Medicare's prescription drug benefit by 2015, five years sooner than envisioned in the Affordable Care Act. 
This proposal would provide financial relief to many older Americans. In addition, by requiring drug manufacturers to provide larger discounts, the administration said, the proposal would save the government $11 billion from 2015 to 2023.
Under the president's budget, Medicare would also cut payments to clinical laboratories by $9.5 billion over 10 years and slice $15 billion from projected payments to private Medicare Advantage plans offered by companies like Humana and UnitedHealth. The White House said its proposal would improve the accuracy of payments to private Medicare plans.
With his Medicaid proposals, Mr. Obama would impose new limits on payments for medical equipment and supplies. He would also reduce special payments to hospitals that serve large numbers of low-income people.
In his budget, Mr. Obama proposed "small targeted reductions'' in certain health care programs, like immunizations and cancer screenings. The White House said the cuts were justified because the new health care law would provide coverage for nearly 30 million Americans who would otherwise be uninsured.
Mr. Obama seeks $31 billion for the National Institutes of Health, including additional money for research on Alzheimer's disease.
In the wake of recent shootings, Mr. Obama sought $10 million for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to support research on the causes of gun violence and how to prevent it.
He also sought $130 million to expand mental health services, including $50 million to train 5,000 new counselors, psychologists and others who could work with students and young adults.
The budget includes $327 million for the Title X family planning program, an increase of $33 million, to expand services for low-income women.
The White House requested $4.7 billion for the Food and Drug Administration, including new user fees to finance the agency's work on food safety and the regulation of medical devices.
Mr. Obama said he supported "permanent, fiscally responsible'' changes in the way Medicare pays doctors. But he did not say exactly how he would alter the current formula, which would cut physician payment rates by about 25 percent in 2014.
The administration said payments should be linked to performance, so that Medicare would increase payments to doctors who provide high-quality, efficient care, while reducing payments to those who provide low-quality care "at excessive cost.''
The budget seeks $19 billion of savings in Medicaid over 10 years. The president would, for example, cut payments for medical equipment and reduce special Medicaid payments to hospitals that serve large numbers of low-income people.

 2:13 P.M. | Defense: Budget Closes Bases, Keeps Money for Drones 
The Defense Department's proposed $526.6 billion base budget trims money for the Army, which has carried the bulk of the combat operations over the past decade, while calling for $2.4 billion over five years to conduct another round of politically difficult base closings, which Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said would deliver "significant savings" over the long term. 
The inventory of remotely piloted vehicles, commonly called as drones, will grow through 2017 and then level off, Pentagon officials said, and money is preserved for the new way of war as fought by Special Operations forces and in cyberspace.
"This budget continues to balance the compelling needs of supporting troops at war in Afghanistan, implementing the president's defense strategic guidance, and sustaining the quality of the all-volunteer force - all while ensuring we maximize the use of every taxpayer dollar and address internal imbalances," Mr. Hagel said at a Wednesday briefing.
"The costs of infrastructure and overhead, acquisitions, and personnel compensation must be addressed in order to put the Department of Defense's budget on a sustainable path - particularly given the pressures on our top-line budget," he added. 
The proposed budget does not incorporate potential additional cuts under the penalty of sequester, the across-the-board spending cuts that went into effect on March 1. But Mr. Hagel and Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that dealing with the sequester already threatened military readiness. 
"We don't yet know the full impact or the cost of recovery from readiness shortfalls this fiscal year," General Dempsey said. "It is more expensive to get ready than it is to stay ready. Recovery costs will compete with the costs of building our future force."
Sequestration could require a further $41 billion in cuts by Oct. 1. 
One part of Pentagon spending not to be reduced pays for combat operations in Afghanistan. Personnel costs - salaries - were not cut, nor were programs to support wounded military personnel. And the nuclear triad of bombers, land-based missiles and submarines also was protected.
The Army's budget proposal is four percent lower in constant dollars, while the Air Force's increased by three percent and the Navy's, which includes Marine Corps spending, was steady.
Mr. Hagel said the Defense Department would save $34 billion over the next five years by changing Pentagon business practices and by reducing support costs.
At least $8.2 billion would be saved by cancelling weapons purchases or by changing the schedule for their purchases. For example, revisions in how the Army's new Ground Combat Vehicle will be developed and bought will save over $2 billion.

 1:30 P.M. | Education: Universal Preschool, More Money in Budget 
At the center of President Obama's education agenda, which was outlined in his budget proposal, is a program that would guarantee public preschool for all 4-year-olds from families with low and moderate incomes. In order to pay for the plan, the administration has proposed an increase in federal cigarette taxes from $1.01 to $1.95 per pack. That would cover the $66 billion cost of providing preschool over ten years and the $11 billion cost of home visiting programs for poor families.
 The budget also called for a total of $12.5 billion over the next two years to preserve teacher jobs and increase hiring as the economy recovers.
Under the pre-K proposal, Arne Duncan, the secretary of education, told reporters on Wednesday, the federal government would initially support 90 percent of the cost of the programs for 4 year-olds, leaving 10 percent of the cost to states. Over time, the state contribution would rise to about 75 percent, with the federal government funding 25 percent.
"We want to encourage states to have skin in the game," said Mr. Duncan. He added that funding the program with a cigarette tax could have the added benefit of reducing smoking, particularly among young people.
Several other proposals for K-12 education included investments in hiring more science, math and technology teachers, help for struggling schools, encouraging schools to link with colleges and employers to create courses of study in high school, and a school safety program.
While the budget proposed significant cuts for many other agencies, it proposes a 4.6 percent increase in discretionary funding for the Education Department over 2013 spending.
Grover J. Whitehurst, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, noted that the Obama administration was continuing its education policy of using federal funds as incentives to drive its overhaul. Many of the programs require states to comply with administration priorities to get financing.
Even the pre-K program, he said, was a partnership with states in which "it's a game in which not every state is going to play and which will require significant commitments by states to the administration's vision of what quality pre-K looks like." 
"This is a very activist budget," Mr. Whitehurst said. "The administration intends to use the mechanism it has used successfully to impose its policy views widely on states and, in some cases, districts."
Given these kinds of strings, Andrew J. Coulson, director of the center for educational freedom at the Cato Institute, a libertarian policy group, said federal funding would "tend to homogenize pre-K programs." As a result, he said, "we are going to lose the ability to figure out what works and why. The more they are caused to become uniform over time, the less variation and less opportunity there is to see how different policies work."
Kris Perry, executive director of the First Five Years Fund, an advocacy group, said that the administration's program was "not a federal mandate but an initiative with great flexibility for states." Inasmuch as the federal funding is targeted at particular kinds of programs, she said, it would be for high quality pre-school programs.
Mr. Duncan said that children could enter pre-K programs run by public schools, existing Head Start centers, or other community groups. "We are agnostic on who delivers" the education, he said.

 1:16 P.M. | More for Manufacturing, But Will it Create Jobs? 
Once again, President Obama is making the case that manufacturing will be a major component of American middle-class job growth - and that the sector is worth plowing government money into. 
Mr. Obama calls manufacturing a "first priority" in a letter to Congress, noting that manufacturers have added more than 500,000 workers in the past three years after a decade of precipitous decline. 
"Companies large and small are increasingly deciding to bring jobs back to America," Mr. Obama writes, urging Congress to devote federal money to accelerate the trend. His budget requests financing for 15 manufacturing "hubs," manufacturing tax credits and incentives to draw foreign business to the United States. 
Despite the prominence that manufacturing gets in Mr. Obama's budget - the word "manufacturing" appears 88 times, whereas "Medicaid" appears 66 - his proposed figures are small given the scale of the American economy. The manufacturing "hubs" proposal asks for $1 billion. A proposal to strengthen communities with manufacturing bases would get $113 million. A Commerce program increase would get $25 million. The real money comes in restoring funds to federal research and development - the Obama budget devotes $143 billion to it - and in other tax credit and education programs. 
But there are real questions about just how big a driver of jobs growth manufacturing can be. It is true that more companies are bringing jobs back to the United States, in no small part because of real declines in American wages. (The truth is that millions of American workers are less expensive for employers to hire than they were 10 years ago.) 
Still, even with the recent job growth, there are about 2 million fewer manufacturing jobs now than there were right before the economy tipped into recession. There are about 7 million fewer manufacturing jobs than there were in the late 1970s, when employment in the sector peaked.
That is because manufacturing simply requires fewer workers than it once did. Indeed, though the industry has shed jobs, it has not shrunken. Factories have become vastly more productive, as processes that were once done laboriously by hand are increasingly done by machine. 
There's an upside there: Much of the recent job growth has been not in low-wage, low-skill production-line gigs, but in higher-wage, higher-skill positions. But the downside is that manufacturing probably will not be a huge driver of job growth in the coming years, where housing and health care seem like more likely bets.

 12:56 P.M. | E.P.A.: Proposed Cuts to Water Treatment and Superfund 
The Obama White House has offered a pre-emptive reduction in the proposed budget for the Environmental Protection Agency, which always seems to be a favorite target of Republican budget-cutters on Capitol Hill.
The administration's proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 provides $8.2 billion for the E.P.A., a decrease of $296 million, or 3.5 percent, below current year spending. 
The cuts will be felt most deeply by state and local governments, whose federal financing for drinking water and wastewater treatment projects will fall by $472 million. The agency said smaller and underserved communities would be spared, although the broader programs are shrinking. The Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds, will receive $1.9 billion, down from nearly $2.4 billion in the current year.
The budget also trims $33 million from the Hazardous Substance Superfund program, which cleans up the most polluted industrial sites in the nation. The agency said that the cuts would chiefly affect new projects at the sites of older cleanup projects. 
The E.P.A. proposes to save an additional $54 million by eliminating what it calls "outdated, underperforming or duplicative" programs, part of a broader federal effort to streamline government.

HEADLINE: Thatcher as Theater: A Prime Minister Playwrights Couldn't Resist

BYLINE: MATT WOLF


HIGHLIGHT: Five seminal British plays that would never have come about without Margaret Thatcher. 

 BODY:
LONDON - Margaret Thatcher didn't have much time for one of Britain's defining qualities - its abundance of theater - but theater people certainly had plenty of time for her. If only antagonistically.
That's to say that while the former prime minister, who died Monday, incurred the wrath of the likes of Peter Hall, the former artistic director of the National Theater and a fierce proponent of the very principles of state subsidy for the arts that Mrs. Thatcher was against, her personality - and politics - were catnip to dramatists then and even now.
When I first moved to London from New York in the 1980s, critiques of Thatcherism seemed to be de rigueur for playwrights who had almost nothing else in common. (Think David Hare and Alan Ayckbourn, for example.) And when her leadership came to an end, you could almost hear the sighs of relief, but tinged with something approaching disappointment: Who was the cultural community going to kick around in her stead? 
With that in mind, what follows is a crib sheet to five seminal British plays (one is a musical and another a joint entry) that would never have come to fruition without Mrs. Thatcher and her zeitgeist to act as a call to dramatic arms.
 And now that she is gone? Britain's only female prime minister walks among us onstage still: Two of these works are very much still running.
 1. "Top Girls" (1982)/"Serious Money" (1987) 
Two plays from one (supreme) playwright, Caryl Churchill, a Leftist mainstay of the Royal Court Theater, where both these works were first seen, five years apart. "Top Girls" doesn't directly concern the political "top girl" - no, make that "iron lady" - of the time, but its moral compass owes everything to a climate that saw Mrs. Thatcher come to power without necessarily easing the way for women to follow her. Its final word, "frightening," tells playgoers all they need know about the author's point of view.
"Serious Money," in turn, takes a savage moral scalpel to the galloping financial excesses of the age as made possible, the play makes plain, by Thatcher-era economics. Intended as a satire, Max Stafford-Clark's original production was lapped up by the very constituency that the writing lampooned. There were reports at the time of patrons setting 20 pound notes alight at the intermission in glee. Why? Well, because they could.
 2. "A Small Family Business" (1987) 
It's hard to imagine a less placard-waving dramatist than Alan Ayckbourn, whose extraordinary output (more plays, at 77, than he is years old, 74 this week), tends to focus on suburban English families in psychic disarray. But the author, who directed the National Theater debut of this large-scale 1987 play, sends Thatcherism coursing through his depiction here of a community seen to be ceaselessly on the make. Bitterly comic and as often as not just bitter, the play sustains interest today as an attack on a society in merciless thrall to materialism; Ayckbourn being Ayckbourn, it's also fiendishly entertaining, as well.
 3. "The Secret Rapture" (1988) 
David Hare's play transferred (unsuccessfully) to Broadway, was filmed, and has been revived on the West End, but it is most fondly remembered from its dazzling National Theater premiere in 1988, starring Penelope Wilton, Clare Higgins and Jill Baker, and directed by Howard Davies (who later went on to do the film).
Never shy about stating his longstanding antipathy to Thatcher, Mr. Hare here found a stand-in of sorts for the country's leader in the character of the fearlessly pragmatic Marion French, a politician in the ascendant who is given to lines like, "God, how I hate all this human stuff." Sound like anyone we knew?
 4. "Billy Elliot the Musical" (2005) 
Placards actually do get waved in this British stage musical adaptation of the much-lauded Stephen Daldry/Lee Hall film, which sets the artistic yearnings of the young ballet dancer of the title against the backdrop of the miners' strikes that seared Britain in the mid-1980s.
Thatcher, in turn, features in a second-act ensemble number written by Mr. Hall and the show's composer, Elton John, that looks forward to each day as being that much nearer to the death of the union-busting politician who lost the miners their jobs. At Monday night's performance of the ongoing West End production at the Victoria Palace Theater, a vote was taken to see whether the audience would like the number on that night to be kept in or taken out.
By an overwhelming majority, they opted to keep the song, and the show, as is.
 5. "The Audience" (2013) 
Peter Morgan's Broadway-bound play about Queen Elizabeth II's weekly audiences with her various prime ministers across her six-decade reign saves the duologue with Thatcher for well into the second act. That might be because the creative team wanted to build to a climax - or maybe it's because that encounter is in fact the weakest of a lineup of British leaders that, in theatrical terms at least, is stolen by Richard McCabe's funny and wounding portrayal of the comparatively little-known Harold Wilson.
Mr. Morgan's show, too, was performed unchanged on Monday, though rewrites are being discussed for next season's Broadway run. The Thatcher stuff, in my view, is ripest for tweaking, even though, when it comes to closing the book on Thatcher herself, the narrative of her legacy is far from written out.

HEADLINE: Leaked Report to Egypt's President Implicates Army in Torture and Killing of Civilians

BYLINE: LIAM STACK


HIGHLIGHT: The document, which is in Arabic, cites specific cases of civilian disappearances, torture and death at the hands of Egypt&#8217;s military. 

 BODY:
A leaked report published on Wednesday by The Guardian implicates Egypt's armed forces of participating in the disappearance, torture and killing of civilians across the country during the 2011 Egyptian revolution, an uprising in which the military initially professed neutrality before President Hosni Mubarak was removed from power.
The document is a 16-page chapter from a presidential fact-finding commission that submitted its findings in January to President Mohamed Morsi, according to The Guardian. Mr. Morsi is Egypt's first freely elected president and a former high-ranking leader in the Muslim Brotherhood. 
The freelance reporters who obtained the document, Evan Hill and Muhammad Mansour, did not reveal who leaked it to them. The revelation is sure to put pressure on both Mr. Morsi and the military, a dominant force in Egyptian economics and politics that receives more than $1 billion in military assistance from the United States each year. The fact-finding commission was hand-picked by Mr. Morsi, according to The Guardian's report. 
The document, which is in Arabic, cites specific cases of civilian disappearances, torture and death at the hands of the Egyptian military. Portions of the report, including testimony provided by witnesses and family members to the fact-finding commission, have been highlighted and translated as part of an interactive feature on the Guardian Web site. 
Translated portions of the report include the testimony of a man named Abdel Moneim Abdel Hamid Fayyed Allam, who told the commission that his son, a lawyer named Osama Abdel Moneim Abdel Hamid, disappeared after leaving their home in the country on Feb. 1, 2011, to join protests in Tahrir Square in Cairo. Mr. Allam told the commission:
I headed to Cairo to search for him in hospitals and police stations and had a number of lawyers with me, after that, I received a call from a young person called Hani Heikal, and he told me that he was with my son Osama in military prison, and he was tortured with many people, and that Osama died after severe torture, and he does not know where he was buried.
Immediately after his quoted testimony, the document describes how Mr. Allam found his son dead 19 days later: 
[Allam] started searching for his son in the morgue until 19 February 2011, when he was informed by a lawyer that his son Osama was in Zeinhom Morgue, and he went there and recognised him, and he saw his son was misshapen from severe torture, and his skull fractured, and had signs of beating on his body; and [Allam] accused the military intelligence who kidnapped him with general intelligence and the officers who tortured him at the military prison and the Egyptian museum and all who participated in this crime.
The military officially refused to take a side during the 2011 uprising that ousted Mr. Mubarak. After 18 days of street protests the military assumed control of the country, elevating a council of 21 senior officers as the country's supreme leaders. 
But the military's position as a guardian of the revolution was soon badly tarnished by a series of violentcrackdowns on protesters and high-profile accusations of torture and sexual assault in custody, as well as the widespread use of military trials for civilians. 
In 2011, Egypt's military government tried more than 12,000 civilians in front of military courts, a number that far outstripped the number of civilians given such trials during three decades of Mr. Mubarak's autocratic reign. 
While the military may no longer be viewed as a defender of the popular will, the document published by The Guardian is notable because it suggests that the Morsi government may have established evidence of military wrongdoing during the transitional period. This will put pressure on both the country's newly elected leaders and the old barons in the military, who denied the report to an Egyptian newspaper, El Balad, on Wednesday morning. 
However, Egyptian human rights activists quoted by The Guardian said that this leak might not be enough to spark an investigation of the military's activities during the early days of the revolution, because according to a constitution written by Mr. Morsi's political allies last fall and passed in a popular referendum in December, the military maintains the sole authority to investigate allegations of crimes committed by its members. 
The constitution is "a bar forever," said Heba Morayef, the Egypt director for Human Rights Watch.
"We've been arguing from the start that there will never be military accountability within the military judiciary. It's just never going to happen in Egypt," she said.

HEADLINE: 2 Investors Give $35 Million to Brown

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Theresia Gouw of Accel Partners and Charles H. Giancarlo of Silver Lake have donated millions as part of a $160 million fund-raising effort for Brown&#8217;s engineering school. 

 BODY:
Brown University has some well-placed friends in Silicon Valley.
Two technology investors have given a combined $35 million to Brown to help expand its School of Engineering, the university announced on Wednesday. 
The donors, Theresia Gouw, a managing partner of the venture capital firm Accel Partners, and Charles H. Giancarlo, a managing director of the private equity firm Silver Lake, both received undergraduate engineering degrees from Brown. Their gifts, part of a new $44 million pool of donations, kick off a $160 million fund-raising effort for the engineering school.
The money will help Brown build a new facility for the school, which was established in 1847. It will also go toward setting up a "center for entrepreneurship" within the school.
The two investors are not the only financiers to have supported Brown. Brian T. Moynihan, the chief executive of Bank of America, is a trustee of the university. Steven A. Cohen, the hedge fund manager dealing with a government investigation into suspicious trading, is also a trustee.
Ms. Gouw, who graduated in 1990 from Brown and is on the board of fellows, is among the few high-ranking female investors in Silicon Valley. She said her gift honored Barrett Hazeltine, a longtime engineering professor at Brown.
"I feel very fortunate to have gone from a first-generation immigrant on financial aid to being in a position to support the school that has been so significant in shaping my life and career," Ms. Gouw said in a statement released by the university.
Mr. Giancarlo, a trustee of Brown who graduated in 1979, was an executive at Cisco Systems before joining Silver Lake in 2007. He made the gift with his wife, Dianne.
Silver Lake, which focuses on technology, has made headlines recently with a controversial offer to buy Dell.
While Brown enjoys support in financial circles, much Silicon Valley money has flowed to Stanford, which is near headquarters of many technology firms. Last year, Stanford became the first university to raise more than $1 billion in a single year, according to a fund-raising survey.
A significant number of Brown students dream of striking it rich in the business world, according to a recent article in The Brown Daily Herald.
Economics was the most popular concentration in 2012, the article said, citing data from the university's Office of Institutional Research. That's due in part to "genuine intellectual interest," Louis Putterman, director of undergraduate studies in the economics department, told the newspaper.
But he also said students were intrigued by "stories of large fortunes being made on Wall Street."

HEADLINE: U.S. Efforts to Regulate Consultants Face Big Obstacles

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: Federal regulators are under pressure to rein in a multibillion-dollar consulting industry after the firms stumbled during a recent review of foreclosure abuses. But the efforts may be stymied, by the regulators&#8217; cozy ties to the consultants and limited legal authority to penalize them. 

 BODY:
Federal regulators are facing pressure from Capitol Hill to rein in a multibillion-dollar consulting industry after the companies stumbled during their recent review of mortgage foreclosure abuses. But the efforts could be stymied, given regulators' close ties to consultants and limited legal authority to penalize them.
The early signs are discouraging, lawmakers say. After concerns surfaced that a consulting firm was bungling the broad review of foreclosures, regulators wrote to the firm, complaining about the conduct but did not fire the consultant, said Congressional officials with knowledge of the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. 
 The use of consultants, who are paid by the same banks they are expected to help reform, will be examined at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Thursday. Senator Sherrod Brown, the Ohio Democrat leading the hearing, is examining whether regulators inappropriately "outsource" oversight like the foreclosure review to consultants like Deloitte & Touche and Promontory Financial Group.
Since the foreclosure review was scuttled in January, some regulators have been exploring new ways to curb the use of consultants and correct problems that occur, according to testimony prepared for the hearing.
"While the use of independent consultants can be an effective supervisory tool, there are certainly lessons to be learned from our experience, and we believe we can improve the process going forward," Daniel P. Stipano, a senior official at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said in the testimony. The agency plans to "enhance our oversight of the consultants when they are utilized," he said.
But challenges remain. Mr. Stipano is expected to cite legal limitations that undercut the regulator's authority over consultants. Those constraints stem from 2006 when the comptroller's office levied a $300,000 fine against Grant Thornton, a firm that audited the books of First National Bank of Keystone in West Virginia, which collapsed in 1999. Grant Thornton, the comptroller found, ignored "unequivocal, written evidence" that the bank had not accounted for much of its assets, a major discrepancy that the consultant did not flag.
When the firm challenged the fine, a federal appeals court in Washington overruled the comptroller. The court said that the regulator had "exceeded his statutory authority."
At the hearing on Thursday, Mr. Stipano is expected to petition lawmakers for greater authority. In the prepared testimony, he said the comptroller's office "would welcome a legislative change in this area that would facilitate our ability to take enforcement actions directly against independent contractors that engage in wrongdoing."
Even if regulators gain new powers to curb the use of consultants, their ties to the firms may prove difficult to untangle. Since the financial crisis, the comptroller has ordered banks to hire consultants in more than 130 enforcement actions, or roughly 15 percent of the cases, an analysis of government records shows.
Further complicating the relationships, consultants like Promontory have forged close ties to the regulators, routinely hiring from government ranks. Promontory was founded by Eugene A. Ludwig, a former comptroller of the currency. Last week, it hired Mary L. Schapiro, who led the Securities and Exchange Commission until late last year.
In addition to Deloitte and PricewaterhouseCoopers employees, a Promontory executive, Konrad Alt, will testify at the Senate hearing. Mr. Stipano, of the comptroller's office, will be joined by Richard M. Ashton, deputy general counsel at the Fed.
The hearing will occur a week after the Government Accountability Office issued a scathing report faulting regulators for the flawed mortgage foreclosure review. The regulators, the report found, failed to properly coordinate a review of foreclosed loans and potentially allowed some errors to go undetected.
Adding to the scrutiny, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, are pushing regulators to explain what went wrong with the foreclosure review. Regulators stopped the review in January after consultants had scrutinized only 114,000 of the more than 800,000 troubled loans they had been expected to review, the lawmakers said.
When the lawmakers pressed for greater detail on the problems, regulators balked. The regulators, for example, refused to provide the name of the consultant who had been admonished, but not fired, for shoddy work.
In a letter to the regulators on Wednesday, the lawmakers rebuked the Federal Reserve and the comptroller's office for the resistance. "Your staff would not elaborate" even after finding the consultant's work was "so poor that you issued a letter faulting the company and directing it to cure its deficiencies," according to a copy of the letter reviewed by The New York Times.
The letter also criticized the regulators for shielding the banks. When asked to detail the number of illegal foreclosures at each bank, the regulators declined, arguing that the information amounted to "trade secrets."
Lawmakers excoriated the argument, declaring in their letter that "breaking the law is not a corporate trade secret."
The dispute, officials note, occurred because regulators are hesitant to provide detailed information derived from their supervision of banks. Such documents are typically confidential.
The comptroller's office and the Fed declined to comment.
Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, is also attacking the regulators' reliance on consultants. While regulators must grapple with finite resources, forcing them to hire outsiders for certain responsibilities, Ms. Waters argues that federal authorities should adopt stricter oversight measures.
Mr. Alt rejected the notion that Promontory is beholden to banks it helps. "We are working for the regulator," he said. "If we merely told our clients what they want to hear, we would lose credibility."
But Ms. Waters on Wednesday introduced legislation to impose conditions on the use of consultants, including progress reports and detailed cost estimates.
"The situation clearly requires a legislative remedy," she said on Wednesday. "This is not independence - it is work for hire."

HEADLINE: What's Wrong With the 'Chapter 14' Proposal

BYLINE: STEPHEN J. LUBBEN


HIGHLIGHT: A big problem with a proposed change in the bankruptcy procedure is its attempt to penalize the provider of debtor-in-possession financing if the new funding is used to &#8220;overpay&#8221; creditors. 

 BODY:
On Thursday, I am speaking at New York University's Stern School of Business on a panel on Dodd-Frank's orderly liquidation authority. It seemed like an appropriate time to discuss why, although I'm no huge fan of the authority, I also have my doubts about its leading alternative.
I refer tothe "Chapter 14" proposal put forth by the Hoover Institute group at Stanford. 
First, the Chapter 14 proposal throws away most of the benefits of using the existing bankruptcy system by calling for cases to be heard by Federal District Court judges.
Our current bankruptcy court structure plainly has its problems, to put it mildly, but one of the main reasons that Chapter 11 works as well as it does has to do with the experienced bankruptcy judges, particularly in New York and Delaware.
Next, and most important, the Chapter 14 proposal has what can only be called a ridiculous funding mechanism I have previously noted the dubious assumption in Chapter 14 that private debtor-in-possession financing will be available in times of financial distress, especially in the size a large financial institution would need.
But the even bigger problem with Chapter 14, which has gotten very little coverage, is its attempt to penalize the provider of DIP financing if the new funding is used to "overpay" creditors.
For example, if a counterparty received a 50 percent upfront recovery made possible by the DIP financing, and unsecured creditors latter received only 35 percent in the Chapter 14 case, the proposal would subordinate the DIP lenders' claim by that extra 15 percent.
That pretty much kills off any chance of private DIP funding, and even raises some serious doubts about future government DIP funding too. What lucky Treasury employee gets the job of estimating all of these variables, and then facing the consequences if he or she estimates wrongly?
Moreover, it provides exactly the wrong incentives upon the failure of a big financial institution. One of the key reasons to have something likeDIP financing is to stabilize the debtor's business upon failure. In the case of a financial institution, such stability has added systemic benefits too.
But if the lender gets penalized for providing too much stability, there is every incentive to be stingy with the DIP funding. I may be a mere bankruptcy lawyer, but as I understand it, that's the exact opposite of what commentators going back to Bagehothave argued should be done during a banking crisis.
A lot of this discussion seemed to be based on the faulty notion that Chapter 11 DIP financing goes only to pay ongoing operations, while the new Chapter 14 funding would be needed for paying pre-bankruptcy claim. That reflects a basic misunderstanding of how Chapter 11 actually works. After all, when a corporate debtor uses DIP financing to pay "critical trade creditors," or to cure past defaults before assuming an executor contract, it's not really so much about paying for ongoing operations.
If I had to guess, General Motors and Chrysler are looming behind this funding mess in Chapter 14. Those two automakers provide us with the best example of what government-provided DIP financing might look like, and the Hoover people are clearly no big fans of that. 
But the basic reality is that the lender who provides the big bucks to keep a debtor alive gets lots of power in return, whether they be bank or U.S. Treasury. Chapter 14 is fighting against that reality.
And somewhat strangely, Chapter 14 as proposed does very little to address the key issue of speed. Lehman Brothers likely represented the outer edge of what can be done with regard to conducting a quick 363 sale: the sale happened a week after filing. But even that was only enabled by keeping Lehman's broker-dealer out of bankruptcy (more precisely, SIPA) for that week and propped up by the Fed. Not clear that the Fed can do that anymore.
Our next best example is the automotive cases, but even a few weeks in Chapter 11 might well be fatal for a financial institution. But again, the Chapter 14 people don't want to go there.

HEADLINE: In Political Campaigns, Do You Get What You Pay For?

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: Republican and Democratic strategists don&#8217;t like what they see in the campaign money landscape any more than you do, but for different reasons. 

 BODY:
Mark Hanna, the Republican Party political boss, famously declared at the outset of the McKinley-Bryan campaign of 1896: "There are two things that are important in politics. The first is money, and I can't remember the second."
In the wake of the 2002 McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform act and the 2010 Supreme Court decision in Citizens United, things are far more complicated than they were in Hanna's day: now, curiously, some dollars are worth more than others, and the way money gets spent is more important than the amount.
Start with the last presidential election. Most of the nearly half billion dollars - $374 million out of a total of $486 million - doled out by "super PACs" and other independent expenditure committees during the general election was by Republican groups, more than triple the $112 million spent independently in support of President Obama. 
Clearly, this cash advantage did not tip the scales. Stuart Stevens, chief strategist of Mitt Romney's campaign, argues that the huge expenditures by Republican groups were essentially wasted. 
"What we discovered on our side, to our surprise and disappointment, was that there were some superb pro-Romney ads, but there was little impact on voters, not what we would have expected them to have," Stevens told a postelection colloquium on Feb. 5 at the University of Chicago's Institute of Politics.
Stevens argued that the "most important answer" in explaining the ineffectiveness of the super PAC ads "was that they were not coordinated with the campaign. They produced ads that were good as they stood alone, but they weren't directing one message."
Obama, according to Stevens, did not have this problem because he was less dependent on super PAC support and his campaign directly controlled a much higher percentage of the money spent on his behalf. Obama's control of cash empowered his campaign to deliver messages and themes that his strategists wanted to stress with little competition from independent groups pushing for him.
Stevens cited Federal Election Commission reports to show that Obama was able to raise more "effective" dollars than Romney, even though the overall balance favored Romney by $140 million, $1.25 billion to $1.11 billion. The best way to see this is in Figure 1, which shows that, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, the Obama campaign had full control over $683.6 million in 2011 and 2012, or 61.4 percent of Democratic presidential spending, while the Romney campaign had control over $433.3 million, which was 34.8 percent of all Republican money expended during the campaign.
 Figure 1 
Because they controlled over 60 percent of the money spent supporting Obama, his operatives were able to time and design most of the campaign messages conveyed by television, e-mail, phone banks and texting, and through person-to-person voter contact, while Romney's strategists were able to time and design a substantially smaller proportion of the messages promoting their candidate.
These differences are illustrated in two additional charts put together by the Center for Responsive Politics, which show how Romney and Obama deployed their funds. Figure 2 shows that the Obama campaign spent $486.7 million on media while Figure 3 shows that Romney spent less than half that, $236 million, on media.
 Figure 2 
 Figure 3 
The tilt in Obama's favor is in fact even larger than these charts suggest, because the Romney campaign had to spend $76.6 million in the primaries running against Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry and Rick Santorum. With no primary opposition, the Obama campaign was able to devote the entire $683.5 million it raised to winning the general election.
The Romney campaign's cash flow became a critical problem from early April to the late August convention, according to Stevens. Romney had used up almost all the money donated to his primary campaign, and by law could not tap into his general election contributions until after formally receiving the nomination on Aug. 28.
"In key states, Obama was outspending us in the summer by 3 and 4 to 1," said a highly placed Romney operative who spoke on background. "We were struggling to put up 1,000 [Gross Rating] Points in major markets and they would have 4,000. We were getting drowned."
The ability of an unchallenged incumbent president to flood the airwaves during the summer of an election year, combined with the advantage an incumbent has raising general election money a full two years or more before the election, has significant consequences. Early money is crucial to the long-haul development and testing of high-tech voter contact research techniques. An incumbent's built-in edge over out-party challengers, who must first spend millions to win the nomination, is now so strong that it almost guarantees two-term presidents.
In April 2012, when Romney had finally become the nominee, according to the operative who declined to be identified, Romney had $10.1 million left in the bank, one tenth of Obama's $104.1 million.
Top Democratic strategists speaking at the postelection conference in Chicago backed up this argument.
"One of the most significant decisions we made was to bet on the front end of the campaign," said David Axelrod, senior adviser to the Obama campaign. "We had an imperative to define the race and to define Mitt Romney before the conventions, and it was better to take money out of September and October and put it into May, June and July."
Axelrod said the Obama campaign knew Republicans "would have a big primary and we had the time to put things in motion" and "that would ultimately redound to our benefit in terms of organization."
Jen O'Malley Dillon, a deputy Obama campaign manager, said preparations for the 2012 contest began "pretty quickly after the president won his first election." At the Democratic National Committee, where Dillon worked before joining the campaign, "a lot of what we did there was building the foundation for the re-elect. There were a lot of things that were under the radar: the analytics work, building on our internal polling, honing our 50-state strategy."
The timing of the receipt of money is crucial - the earlier, the better - and the freedom to spend money on the general election, as opposed to on winning the nomination, is equally important.
In Chicago, both Stevens and Axelrod raised another series of questions about the evolving role of the super PACs.
Stevens argued that the super PACs in 2012 distorted the primary election, providing huge infusions of cash to candidates whose campaigns were, for all intents and purposes, over:
Campaigns never end because people want campaigns to end. They end because they run out of money. Super PACs took that quality away from the campaign. Super PACs elongated this race in ways we have never seen before.
This was especially damaging to Romney's bid. Newt Gingrich's campaign was kept alive by a total of $20.5 million contributed to the pro-Gingrich super PAC Winning Our Future by Sheldon Adelson, a Las Vegas and Macau based casino operator, and his wife, Miriam, money that was crucial to Gingrich's victory in the South Carolina primary. Rick Santorum's campaign was kept afloat by the $2.25 million given to the pro-Santorum super PAC, the Red, White & Blue Fund, by William Dore, head of Dore Energy, and by the $2.01 million donated by Foster Friess, head of Friess Associates LLC, an investment management firm.
Axelrod also criticized the Republican super PACs for failing to take on Obama directly early in 2012:
Our greatest fear was that the super PAC ads would hit in January and February and March when we were unprepared to deal with them. To this day I still am confused as to why this didn't happen. If I am running a super PAC, I better provide some air cover.
Without saying so directly, Axelrod was criticizing the two groups Karl Rove created, American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS. In defense of American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS, Jonathan Collegio, spokesman for the two groups, wrote in an e-mail to the Times:
We made very clear early on, and publicly, that our ads were going to focus on Obama and his dramatic failure to turn the economy around - and virtually all of our ads did that, to the point that Obama was upside down on the economy by the time of the convention. And despite Obama outspending Romney by $100 million on TV ads over the summer, the Gallup ballot test actually got better for Romney between May and September -all because outside groups were simultaneously pummeling Obama.
If the critique is that we should have run positive ads, that's a failure of understanding the limitations of campaign law. Outside groups cannot effectively run positive ads because the best positive ads feature the candidates themselves, and outside groups can't coordinate with campaigns to generate candidate-to-camera footage.
In a second e-mail, Collegio argued that "the best data" in support of the effectiveness of the super PACS
is just looking at the Gallup trend between the day Santorum left the race and the end of the convention (or start of it, or any time thereabouts). Obama and his super PAC outspent Romney by literally $98 million over that period and the Gallup numbers went from Romney -4 to Romney -2. By his [Stevens'] logic the Obama ads didn't move numbers!
The reality is that the super PAC ads canceled out the Obama ads and the numbers didn't move. Obama tried to pull a Clinton '96 and kill Romney in the cradle but failed because of the super PACs. Romney went into the convention with a good shot of winning.
An examination of the Gallup tracking data does not support Collegio's argument. The Gallup data reveals that for the five days immediately after Santorum withdrew from the contest on April 10, giving Romney the nomination, Romney led Obama by an average of 3.8 points. On Aug. 27, the day the Republican convention began, Obama led Romney by 1 point, 47-46. On Aug. 31, the day after the Republican convention ended, Obama led by 3 points, 48-45. During the three-day Democratic convention, September 4, 5 and 6, Obama held an average 6.3 percentage point lead.
David Winston, president of The Winston Group, a Republican consulting firm, was broadly critical of the Romney campaign and of the Republican super PAC approach. The obligation of the Romney campaign and its allies, Winston said in a phone interview, was to go beyond "simply saying 'here is why the president is wrong,' " to "clearly lay out what the choice was between." When someone is unhappy with their car, Winston said, they don't just junk it, but instead look first to find a better replacement.
In more detail, Winston laid out his critique of the Romney campaign in a postelection analysis available on his firm's Web site:
In 2012, the door couldn't have been more wide open for Governor Romney and Republicans to win a significant victory. The context for this election was a tough one for President Obama. He had had more months of 8% unemployment in his four years than the previous 11 administrations combined. The unemployment rate going into the election was 7.9%, a half a percent higher than Reagan's 7.4%, the highest rate a sitting president has had and gotten re-elected (statistics started to be kept in January 1948). Economic growth had been 2% or lower for each quarter of this year, well below George H. W. Bush's 4.2%-4.5% growth in 1992, when Democrats coined the phrase "It's the economy, stupid," and decisively beat Bush.
Winston continued, arguing that right after winning the primaries,
Governor Romney's campaign decided to focus on making this a referendum on President Obama's record. In contrast, the Obama campaign made the election a choice between the two candidates and their plans for the future. President Obama defined Romney in terms that would allow for a favorable contrast, particularly on economic policies, and in the end, the choice became moving forward with the economic policies of the present (Obama's) or going back to the failed economic policies of the past (Romney's/Bush's). Because Governor Romney focused on Obama's negative record at the expense of defining himself, the Romney campaign never engaged in the needed economic debate that would have given voters a clear understanding of his economic vision for the country, why it would work, and how it differed from both Obama and Bush.
To buttress his point, Winston cited exit poll data showing that 45 percent of the electorate described the economy as "not so good," a segment of the voting public that should have been a prime Republican target. Obama, in point of fact, carried these voters by 13 points, 55-42.
One thing appears clear for both political parties as the next presidential election looms - an election in which candidates on both sides will be running without the advantage of incumbency and facing extended primary battles: the general election candidate with better access to microtargeting and other quantitative research on the day he or she grasps the nomination will have a core advantage.
While the D.N.C. and R.N.C. are the institutions designed to direct research like this, to conduct voter mobilization, to spearhead fund-raising, and to act as broker between competing primary candidates, campaign reform prohibiting party committees from accepting contributions in excess of $32,400 clearly poses an impediment. In the coming years, therefore, candidate-oriented super PACs, which can accept unlimited contributions, are likely to take over much of what the two political parties have done in the past.
"The campaign finance system you see right now is the result of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, the McCain-Feingold bill" of 2002, said Charlie Spies, co-founder and treasurer of Romney's super PAC, Restore Our Future," appearing at a different postelection panel at the Institute of Politics on Feb. 28. "It totally changed the prioritization of where money was put in the political world."
Before McCain-Feingold, Spies said, "you used to be able to have unlimited money going to the parties. So you had parties acting as moderating forces on elections and consolidating resources for the candidates." The McCain-Feingold ban on soft money contributions "was terrible for the political system, it would push money to outside groups; it was strangling the money going to political parties."
The Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United, Spies noted, calmed the fears of big donors worried about possible legal challenges if they made large contributions to outside groups: "Citizens United established a legal precedent" and donors were able to say, "Heck, the Supreme Court is telling us this is O.K. and the Federal Election Commission put out rules on exactly how you could do it."
The one-two combination punch of McCain-Feingold and Citizens United is working to constrict the fund-raising abilities of the political parties. The next step for savvy presidential candidates with strong appeal to the community of big donors will be the very early creation of candidate-oriented super PACs with the specific goal of raising huge sums to finance the sophisticated technical groundwork required for a strong general election campaign.
The ultimate effect of a major campaign reform on the parties and of a major court ruling that opened the floodgates to groups outside of traditional political channels will be to empower institutions and actors with little or no responsibility for, or accountability to, the broader public. 
In other words, the unexpected result of the upheaval in campaign finance over the past decade has been that the parties exercise less control over the process, a trend that will continue. Before your heart leaps, consider what that actually means: less control by the public as a whole.

HEADLINE: Measuring Inflation for Social Security

BYLINE: EDUARDO PORTER


HIGHLIGHT: The president&#8217;s budget plan embraces a chained price index that would slow the increase in benefits, but the cost of living for older Americans may rise more rapidly than the current index, not less. 

 BODY:
 4/11/13 | Updated to restore an omitted paragraph on the effect on the oldest retirees. 
President Obama's proposal to change the inflation measure used to adjust tax brackets and Social Security benefits is, on the face of it, not an unreasonable tool to coax Republicans to sign on to some grand bargain to tackle the budget deficit.
But a more careful look at the details suggests that the president's proposal may not be the most effective way either to raise money or to reform the nation's pension system. 
The "chained Consumer Price Index" that the White House proposes to use is, after all, a more accurate measure of the inflation experienced by American families than the index used today, taking into account that consumers respond to the rise in the price of one good by shifting to cheaper alternatives.
Because it rises more slowly than the current index, the White House estimates that the move would cut the budget deficit by $230 billion over the next 10 years. 
The slower rise of the chained index would slow cost-of-living adjustments of Social Security benefits and some other programs, saving $130 billion over a decade. And it would raise $100 billion in tax revenue by slowing the rise of tax brackets - which are also adjusted for inflation- keeping more taxpayers in higher brackets paying higher marginal rates.
Notably, it is meant to show Republicans that the president's commitment to entitlement reform is for real.
But despite these selling points, the White House's proposal also exemplifies the pitfalls of tweaking government programs while paying perhaps insufficient attention to what the programs are meant to achieve. 
The chained C.P.I. may be a better index to measure prices across the population, but not necessarily for the old - who spend a larger share of their income on health and housing. Economists at the Labor Department have been experimenting for years with a for those over the age of 62. Since 1982 it has risen 0.2 percentage points per year faster than the standard C.P.I. The chained C.P.I., by contrast, has lagged behind the regular index over the longer term by about 0.3 percentage points a year.
Swapping inflation indexes as the White House proposes might also introduce perverse incentives into the system. Experts like Eugene Steuerle at the Urban Institute argue that Social Security must encourage workers to stay longer in the labor force, helping the economy over the long term and reducing the tax burden on younger Americans devoted to supporting the old. That might be done reducing the benefit for early retirees.
Switching to a chained C.P.I. does the opposite: it generates savings from the oldest retirees. The cumulative effect of the chained index would be significant for an 80-year-old, for example, while the benefits of those at or near the retirement age would not be reduced at all.
The proposal does try to alleviate the effect on poorer beneficiaries, offering increases beyond the chained index from age 76 to age 85. But by age 75, the monthly benefit for someone who retired at 65 would still be almost 4 percent less when using chained C.P.I. than when using the conventional index. And it would be about 4.5 percent less at age 95.
Paul Van de Water of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research group, supports the White House's overall proposal. Still, he is uncomfortable with the changes. "Even if you wanted to cut Social Security benefits, this is not the right way to do it," he said. "You would want benefits to go up as people get older because their other sources of income are depleted."
And it's not a great tax proposal, either. Most tax experts in and out of government seem to agree that the most effective way to raise revenue is to broaden the base of taxpayers, rather than to raise marginal tax rates. But slowing the adjustment of tax brackets would effectively raise the rates paid over time by taxpayers across the board.

HEADLINE: A Budget Focus on Inequality

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: The Obama budget proposal includes several proposals to tackle inequality and wage stagnation. 

 BODY:
The great economic focus of the White House, the financial crisis and recession aside, has been inequality.
The hollowing out of the middle class, the yawning gap between rich and poor, and the problem of economic mobility were preoccupations of President Obama long before he set foot in the White House. His 2006 book, "The Audacity of Hope," for instance, contains a whole chapter dedicated to wage polarization, globalization and the plight of blue-collar workers.
The Obama budget proposal released Wednesday, like other White House budgets before it, also emphasizes the problem of inequality and the failure of the American economy to promote a thriving middle class. 
"It is our generation's task to reignite the true engine of America's economic growth - a rising, thriving middle class," it says, calling support for the middle class the "North Star" of policy-making. "It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country - the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead."
The budget includes several proposals to tackle inequality and wage stagnation. 

        
Increasing the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour from its current rate of $7.25, and indexing it to inflation. The White House asserts that this would lift the wages of about 15 million low-wage workers.
        
Creating a "Preschool for All" initiative to provide early childhood education to 4-year-olds from low- and middle-income families. The big idea is that this might improve economic mobility in the future.
        
Increased taxes on wealthy Americans, including taxing carried interest as ordinary income. Hedge-fund managers and the like use the carried interest loophole to pay preferential rates on their earnings.
        
Increased support for manufacturing, which the White House argues might be an important source of middle-class jobs.
        
Making permanent the expansion of the earned income tax credit and child credit, which were due to expire in 2017. The proposal also makes permanent the American Opportunity Tax Credit, which helps families with students pay for college. 
So far, the Obama administration has tackled the issue of inequality in two major ways. It has raised taxes on the wealthy, and it has expanded programs to aid lower-income Americans.
You might not think that the Affordable Care Act had much to do with inequality - it is a health care bill, after all - but it did. Rising insurance costs have eaten away at workers' wages; the law has a number of provisions to try to bend the cost curve. Medical bills are a primary driver of bankruptcy for middle-class families; the law removes the lifetime benefit limit, ends denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions and contains other rules that might help reduce the number of bankruptcies.
Moreover, the law provides free or low-cost access to health coverage to tens of millions of Americans, financed by the government. That might not address the problem of income inequality. But it does address the problem of consumption inequality and perhaps even economic mobility.
Mr. Obama has paid for the Affordable Care Act and other initiatives to push money to lower-income Americans - like an expansion of the earned income tax credit - with higher taxes on the wealthy. He has thus far raised the top marginal tax rate on income to 39.6 percent from 35 percent, reduced deductions for some families and raised taxes on investment income in the January deal to avoid the fiscal cliff, making the tax code more progressive.
But if anything, the plight of the middle class has gotten worse since Mr. Obama took office, a result of long-existing economic trends and the after-effects of the deep recession.
Real median income has continued to decline during the sluggish recovery. It is about 8 percent lower than it was when the recession hit in 2007, and 9 percent lower than it was at its peak in 1999, a period in which economic output has expanded about 24 percent. To translate: the country is getting richer, but the average worker is earning less, and that has been true for well over a decade.
On top of that, the recovery has seen middle-class jobs effectively replaced with low-income jobs. According to research by the National Employment Law Project, low-wage occupations account for 21 percent of job losses during the recession and 58 percent of job growth during the recovery. In contrast, middle-wage occupations account for 60 percent of recession losses and only 20 percent of recovery growth.
But - as always, perhaps - it is not a bad time to be rich. Job growth in high-wage professions has been decent, if not spectacular. And updated research by the economist Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley, shows that the real income of the 99 percent has fallen during the recovery, but surged 11 percent for the top 1 percent of earners, led by a stock-market boom.
Thus, Mr. Obama's policies might not have reduced inequality before taxes and government transfers. But the White House has been aggressive in using taxes and transfers to try to blunt its effects.

HEADLINE: The Answer to Too Big to Fail?

BYLINE: VIKAS BAJAJ


HIGHLIGHT: The new bill would require all banks to have capital equal to 10 percent of their assets. Unsurprisingly, the financial industry doesn&#8217;t like it. 

 BODY:
Senators Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and David Vitter, R-Louisiana, have a new bill that would make banks keep much higher levels of capital. Not surprisingly, representatives for the financial industry are already claiming that such a requirement would ruin the economy.
A draft of the Brown-Vitter bill, which was leaked to Quartz last week, offers a simple and elegant solution to the "too big to fail" problem by requiring all banks to have capital equal to 10 percent of their assets. The measure would also force regulators to impose additional capital requirements on banks with assets of more than $400 billion; that additional capital would increase with the size of the bank, but the total would always be less than 15 percent. 
Forcing the banks to hold more capital makes sense because it makes them less dependent on government bailouts during a crisis. Furthermore, banks are less likely to make brazen gambles when they have their own shareholders' money at stake than when they are primarily betting with the money of depositors, bondholders and taxpayers.

Today most banks have capital that is far below the levels proposed by Mr. Brown and Mr. Vitter. Global banking regulators on the Basel committee, which is working on new capital rules, have proposed setting minimum capital ratios at just 8 percent. Moreover, Basel's ratios are calculated using something known as risk-weighted assets. What that means is banks effectively hold less capital against assets considered less risky and more against capital deemed to be very risky. That may sound reasonable, but as the implosion of supposedly triple-A rated mortgage bonds during the crisis showed, it's difficult to know with certainty which assets are safe and which are not.
Banks, of course, hate the idea of higher ratios because it reduces how much money they make on each dollar of capital. Think of capital as the money you put down to buy a house. If you buy a house for $100,000 and only put down $5,000, when you later sell that house for, say, $120,000 you will have made a profit of $20,000, or four times your initial investment. But if we take the same example and require you to put 20 percent down, or $20,000, your profit would amount to only 100 percent of your starting capital.
But banks don't like to lead with the less-profitable argument. Instead they tend to argue that higher capital ratios would hurt the economy by making loans more expensive or difficult to get. On Wednesday, a group that represents banks, The Clearinghouse Association, put out a study that argues that a 3 percent increase in the capital ratio would lead to a decline in the gross domestic product of more than 2 percent.
Numerous economists have soundly refuted such industry-sponsored studies. In their recent book, "The Bankers' New Clothes," Anat Admati, a professor of finance and economics at Stanford, and Martin Hellwig, director of the Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods, convincingly show how raising capital would lead to a safer and healthier banking sector "at essentially no cost to society."
There's an obvious parallel, here, to wealthy individuals who oppose high-end tax hikes on the grounds that they slow growth, rather than owning up to the fact that they want to keep more of their money.
It's unclear if the Brown-Vitter bill will even get a vote on the Senate floor. Mr. Vitter's office believes that the banking lobby leaked the draft in an effort to ruin its chances. But even if it will face tough political odds, the bill is important in that it offers an opportunity for Washington to engage in an essential economic debate.

HEADLINE: First Hudson Yards Tower Signs Three Major Tenants

BYLINE: CHARLES V. BAGLI


HIGHLIGHT: Related Companies and Oxford Property Group announced that they had completed the financing for a 47-story office tower and signed up three tenants for the building: Coach, L&#8217;Oreal USA and SAP. 

 BODY:
There was a time when developers and city officials thought that the city's financial institutions would lead the development of the rail yards on the Far West Side of Manhattan. 
But with the long-awaited signing of three major tenants for the first office tower at Hudson Yards, it is now clear that the city's tech companies and creative firms are coming to the fore of new development projects.
The developers Related Companies and Oxford Property Group announced Wednesday that they had completed the financing for a 47-story tower at the northwest corner of 30th Street and 10th Avenue and signed up three tenants for the building: Coach, the luxury retailer; L'Oreal USA, the beauty products company; and SAP, a leading software company.
"It says a lot about the city's evolving economy," said L. Jay Cross, president of Related's Hudson Yards development team. "It's about much more than financial services today. This represents the emergence of the creative class as a significant part of the city's corporate landscape."
In recent years, tech firms like Google have settled and grown all along the West Side, where they employ thousands of young people. 
At the same time on Wednesday, the developers closed on their deal with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to build a commercial and residential complex over the rail yard bound by 10th and 11th Avenues, between 30th and 33rd Streets.
Five years ago, the transit authority struck a deal with Related for the equivalent of a small city over what is called the Eastern Yard and an adjacent rail site between 11th and 12 Avenues for $1 billion. But progress has been slow, in part, because of the recession. Both sides now plan to close on the western yard a year from now.
Coach first surfaced in 2011 as a potential anchor tenant for the project. It is buying more than 40 percent of the 1.7 million-square-foot tower for its new headquarters. More recently, SAP signed a lease for the top four floors and L'Oreal completed a deal for a new 402,000-square-foot headquarters.
Related is currently building the foundations for that tower and erecting a separate residential building on the south side of 30th Street.
Officials said that the developer planned to start work on the platform for the rest of the Eastern Yard in January in order to reduce the time it will take to erect the second office tower and attract tenants.

HEADLINE: At Howard University, Rand Paul Argues Republican Case to Black Voters

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky stepped inside an auditorium at Howard University&#8217;s School of Business on Wednesday to deliver a message to young black voters: the Republican Party wants you back. 

 BODY:
Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky stepped inside an auditorium at Howard University's School of Business on Wednesday to deliver a message to young black voters: the Republican Party wants you back.
In a speech focused largely on the history of blacks within the Republican Party, especially in Kentucky, the libertarian-minded Republican argued that blacks were better served by Republicans' free-market policies than the government assistance offered by Democrats.
"The Democrat promise is tangible and puts food on the table, but too often doesn't lead to jobs or meaningful success," he said. "The Republican promise is for policies that create economic growth." 
Recalling a time between the Civil War and the civil rights movement when Republicans and black people were bedfellows in the fight for black equality - electing the first black United States senator, sending the first 20 black members to Congress and ending slavery - Mr. Paul acknowledged that the relationship had languished.
"Now Republicans face a daunting task," he said. "Several generations of black voters have never voted Republican and are not very open to even considering the option." 
Mr. Paul came under fire in his 2010 Senate campaign after he suggested that he opposed the part of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that forced private businesses to end segregation. He later clarified that he would oppose efforts to repeal the law. On Wednesday, he said he had never wavered on supporting the law.
"No Republican questions or disputes civil rights," he said Wednesday. "I've never wavered in my support for civil rights or the Civil Rights Act."
"The dispute, if there is one, has always been about how much of the remedy should come under federal or state or private purview," he said.
Mr. Paul also defended Republican-led efforts to tighten voter identification requirements in the states, which have been likened to Jim Crow-era poll tests. Democrats and voting rights advocates have accused Republicans of using the laws to deter poor and minority voters, who are more likely than other groups to not have government-issued identification.
"I think if you liken using a driver's license to a literacy test you demean the horror of what happened in the '40s and '50s. It was horrific. No one is in favor of that," Mr. Paul said. "But showing your driver's license to have an honest election is not unreasonable."
In pushing for school choice and highlighting his proposal to repeal federal mandatory minimum sentencing laws, which have been shown to have a disproportionate effect on blacks, Mr. Paul got applause from the young audience.
The crowd appeared to be mostly receptive to his speech, although one or two students were kicked out for trying to raise a banner that mentioned white supremacy.
And when the senator questioned whether students knew that Republicans had founded the N.A.A.C.P., a student shouted, "We know our history."
Mr. Paul said that he had not intended to insult the students.
The speech by Mr. Paul, a possible presidential candidate in 2016, fits neatly into Republicans' tactical change after the 2012 elections. After taking a shellacking that included Mitt Romney's losing the presidential race while pulling in only 6 percent of the black vote, Republicans are spending millions of dollars and untold hours trying to establish the G.O.P. as an inclusive party.
The choice of Howard University as a venue for his speech is notable not just for its location three miles from Capitol Hill. Mr. Paul is the first major Republican figure to speak on the school's campus since Gen. Colin Powell delivered the commencement address in 1994. By contrast, Democrats like then-Senator Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey have headlined graduation and charter day ceremonies for several years. President Bill Clinton is this year's commencement speaker.
Byron Jackson, a 2007 Howard alumnus, said he was happy to have heard Mr. Paul speak at Howard. But he said he was disappointed that Mr. Paul did not include specifics about the Republicans' outreach strategy.
"I do appreciate that to have this conversation, he went to what could be the bastion of black liberal politics," he said. 
"But I was hoping that he would have the chance to talk more about exactly how the G.O.P. would continue to engage the African-American community and try to win more black voters," said Mr. Jackson, who became a Republican in 2011 but voted for President Obama.
Mr. Jackson said that the speech was a good start at reaching into black communities, but that Republicans still needed to connect with black clergy and cultivate black Republican political candidates.
"They just need to put a browner face on the party," he said.

HEADLINE: Questions on a Study of the Cost of Federal Regulation

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Do federal regulations really cost small businesses more than $10,000 per worker? 

 BODY:
In late March, Representative Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, announced a new bill promising regulatory relief to small businesses. But what caught The Agenda's eye was Ms. Duckworth's justification for the legislation. "For businesses with less than 20 employees," she said in the press release, "the annual cost of federal regulation can be over $10,000 per worker."
To be precise, it was $10,585 per employee in 2008, according to a 2010 studysponsored by the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy. For large companies, the study says the cost is $7,755 for every employee. And the total cost of federal regulations to the economy was $1.75 trillion in 2008, an impressive figure - if it is true. Certainly it has been accepted as currency by many business and free market advocates; it has been cited by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, and the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Mitt Romney embraced the notion of a $1.75 trillion price tag in his presidential campaign. And, as Ms. Duckworth shows, the outrage the claim inspires is not strictly partisan. 
But the Advocacy study has also come under scrutiny from economists and legal scholars, who have challenged the methodology, the underlying data and the authors' reluctance to share certain details about how they did their work. And while much of the criticism comes from liberal organizations like the Center for Progressive Reform and the Economic Policy Institute (which weighed in twice), here, too, the outrage is not strictly partisan: the Congressional Research Service has also cast doubt on the study's findings. 
Written by W. Mark Crain and Nicole Crain, economists at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., the study tried to calculate all of the costs of all federal regulations on the books in 2008, regardless of when they were first adopted. To do this, the Crains (or "Crain and Crain," as they are known in the academic world) tallied the costs of four categories of regulations and then added them together.
The largest of these categories is economic regulations, which they said carried costs totaling $1.2 trillion in 2008. It also is the source of most of the controversy surrounding the report. The Crains defined economic regulations broadly, to include issues as diverse as trade rules, antitrust policies, consumer product safety obligations and some labor rules. (Labor safety, though, is a separate category.) And because it would be extremely difficult to identify, let alone calculate, costs associated with each economic regulation, the Crains didn't try.
Instead, they used a mathematical formula to try to predict how increases and decreases in regulation would affect a country's economic output, an exercise known as regression analysis. And to measure the amount of regulation, the Crains turned to a global index of "regulatory quality" devised by researchers at the World Bank and the Brookings Institution - and here is where the controversy begins. According to the Crains, countries that score higher on the index have less regulation. But the index is not a systematic accounting of regulations in each country. Instead, according to the index's creators, it captures "perceptions" of how well governments make "sound policies and regulations" that foster economic growth. It does this by surveying experts and relying on polls of business owners and individuals.
But are sound policies the equivalent of less regulation? Not according to one of the index's creators. Evaluating a regulatory environment "is very different from simply measuring whether it is 'stringent' or not," Aart Kraay, a World Bank economist, wrote in an e-mail to the Crains that was later provided to the Congressional Research Service. For example, the Netherlands and Scandinavia had higher scores on the regulatory quality index than the United States in 2008, and, as the Economic Policy Institute noted dryly, these are "countries not typically associated with a lack of regulation." It is also possible that the surveys that make up the index absorb sentiment about regulations that the Crains cover elsewhere - like environmental rules, for example - which would effectively double-count the cost of those rules. (Despite repeated requests, the Crains did not agree to be interviewed for this post.)
Even if a consensus existed on precisely what the regulatory quality index measured, converting a soft concept into a hard number raises other concerns. The formula the Crains used tried to account for other factors, or variables, that could affect economic growth, such as education. However, the economists initially would not share the precise data they used with other researchers. When the Congressional Research Service tried to replicate the Crains' findings using similar, but not identical, supporting data and methods, it found that "the regulatory quality index had no discernible independent effect on G.D.P. per capita, suggesting that the analysis is highly sensitive to the choice of control variables and measures."
The Economic Policy Institute performed a similar experiment and got similar results. "It's basically a case of garbage in, garbage out," said John Irons, who analyzed the study for the Economic Policy Institute. "That $1.2 trillion number is not a reliable number in any sense at all." But Mr. Irons acknowledged that this did not necessarily mean it was too high, only that it was wrong.
The Crains' treatment of economic regulations accounts for about 70 percent of the total regulatory cost for 2008, so that's where critics focused most of their energy. Still, they also found much to dispute in how the researchers treated other regulations. For example, to calculate the cost of environmental, labor safety and homeland security regulations, the authors relied heavily on the Office of Management and Budget, which performs cost-benefit estimates for many regulations.
The government figures are presented as a range, but the Crains told the Congressional Research Service that they used only the high-end figure because the government does not track every rule and because the researchers believe "government agencies tend to be conservative in estimating regulatory costs." But government agencies generally rely on information provided by the regulated industry to estimate costs, and, as the Center for Progress Reform and the O.M.B. itself point out, there is good reason to believe that industries facing regulation tend to overstate those costs.
Nor does the report consider the benefits of regulations, because the Office of Advocacy did not ask the Crains to measure them. The O.M.B. is required by law to tally benefits as well as costs as best it can, and it has concluded that, in general, the benefits of regulations exceed their costs to society. Advocacy is required by law only to "measure the direct costs and other effects of government regulation on small businesses." Even the Crains have acknowledged that this is a skewed foundation on which to base policy.
Before the study was made public, it was reviewed by a pair of economists. Richard Williams, a conservative scholar, raised several questions about the suitability of relying on the Regulatory Quality Index. But later, he cited the study as authoritative, even though he acknowledged that he did not know whether his concerns had been addressed in the final version. In a recent interview, he said he understood the Crains' intellectual impulse. "I think they're right - you want to know how regulations affect G.D.P.," he said. "The theoretical concept was good, but at the time there just weren't good databases." Asked why he cited the study and the $1.75 trillion figure if he had doubts, he responded, "We only have two estimates of the cost of regulations. One is the O.M.B.'s, which is clearly an underestimate. On the other hand, we have this big number, which clearly has problems, but it is a number."
The other reviewer was Robert Litan, a former Clinton administration official. His comments at the time, in their entirety, were, "I looked it over and it's terrific, nothing to add. Congrats." He recently declined to comment further about the study.
The S.B.A.'s Office of Advocacy also declined further comment. It still defends the paper online, where it says "the study demonstrated that small businesses bear a larger burden from regulations than large businesses," but "as with almost any academic methodology, it was not intended to be considered a precise finding." One measure of how independent the Office of Advocacy is from the rest of the S.B.A. and the rest of the Obama administration is that administration officials have publicly, and harshly, criticized the findings. Austan Goolsbee, then the president's chief economic adviser, called them "utterly erroneous."
The office of Ms. Duckworth, the Illinois Democrat, did not have much to say. The bill she introduced would allow a small business to escape a fine for "a first-time error in filling out federal paperwork." Her spokesman, Anton Becker, was happy to talk about that. About the $10,500 figure, he would say only, "The figure cited in the press release is an example of one study's findings from the Small Business Administration."

HEADLINE: Seeking Relief, Banks Shift Risk to Murkier Corners

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG


HIGHLIGHT: As regulators press for banks to be safer, financial firms are transferring the risk of some assets to a less regulated area of Wall Street. 

 BODY:
Banks have been shedding risky assets to show regulators that they are not as vulnerable as they were during the financial crisis. In some cases, however, the assets don't actually move - the bank just shifts the risk to another institution.
This trading sleight of hand has been around Wall Street for a while. But as regulators press for banks to be safer, demand for these maneuvers - known as capital relief trades or regulatory capital trades - has been growing, especially in Europe.
Citigroup, Credit Suisse and UBS have recently completed such trades. Rather than selling the assets, potentially at a loss, the banks transfer a slice of the risk associated with the assets, usually loans. The buyers are typically hedge funds, whose investors are often pensions that manage the life savings of schoolteachers and city workers. The buyers agree to cover a percentage of losses on these assets for a fee, sometimes 15 percent a year or more.
The loans then look less worrisome - at least to the bank and its regulator. As a result, the bank does not need to hold as much capital, potentially improving profitability. 
"I think we are going to see more of these type of trades in the U.S. given the demands by regulators to hold more capital," said Kevin White, a former executive at Lehman Brothers who founded Spring Hill Capital Partners, which is working with banks to structure regulatory capital trades.
Citigroup, Credit Suisse and UBS declined to comment on their trades. Privately, however, bankers acknowledge that while these trades may be pushing risk into a less regulated corner of Wall Street, they also point out that the risk is being moved into a less systemic part of the financial industry than the big banks.
The rule-writing going on as part of the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul may prevent some of these trades, but bankers say this will simply force them to structure the trades differently.
Some regulators say they are concerned that in some instances these transactions are not actually taking risk off bank balance sheets. For instance, a financial institution may end up lending money to clients so they can invest in one of these trades, a move that could leave a bank with even more risk on its books.
Critics point to other reasons to worry. Most of these trades are structured as credit-default swaps, a derivative that resembles insurance. These kinds of swaps pushed the insurance giant American International Group to the brink of collapse in September 2008. Another red flag is that banks often use special-purpose vehicles located abroad, frequently in the Cayman Islands, to structure these trades.
"These trades allow the banks to go to regulators and say the risk is gone," said Anat R. Admati, a professor of finance at Stanford University. "But it's not gone at all; it's just been pushed into a murky corner of the market."
The trades can take many forms, but typically a bank will buy a credit-default swap on some of its loans from a special-purpose vehicle, which is financed by outside investors. If all goes well, the investors receive an annual fee for taking on this risk. But in the worst case, where the loans in the portfolio default, the insurance that the bank has bought kicks in and covers its losses. The investors on the other side are wiped out.
A number of American investment firms like Spring Hill Capital Partners have been trying to find investors for these deals. Glenn Blasius, another Lehman alumni, said he was raising money for the Ovid Regulatory Capital Relief Fund, which will invest in these trades.
The Orchard Global Capital Group has raised a fund to invest in regulatory capital trades, and the New Mexico Educational Retirement Board is among its investors.
In December 2011, Allan Martin, a representative with an investment consultant firm that advises pension funds, met with the New Mexican pension fund over investing through Orchard in a regulatory capital trade, according to the minutes of a board meeting.
Mr. Martin explained to the retirement board that these transactions had been created to allow the banks "to continue to hold the assets on their balance sheet" while selling some of the risk.
At the meeting, Jan Goodwin, executive director of the New Mexico Educational Retirement Board, asked about the use of credit-default swaps, which got A.I.G. into trouble. Mr. Martin admitted that the Orchard deal "has a little flavor of that" but said Orchard had done "a great deal" of due diligence on the underlying collateral, something he said A.I.G. often didn't do.
In an interview, Mr. Martin said that "a lot of clients ask how this is different than A.I.G.," and he said it was because Orchard had a better understanding of the risks involved in the assets it was dealing with.
An executive with Orchard did not respond to requests for comment.
Many major banks have structured these trades. In March, Credit Suisse completed a transaction named Lucerne, after the Swiss lake, in which it bought insurance on a 5 billion Swiss franc portfolio of small and medium-size Swiss business loans, according to people who were briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak on the record because they had signed confidentiality agreements.
Credit Suisse agreed to take a small percentage of the losses, and it lined up American and European investors willing, for an annual fee of roughly 10 percent, to assume the rest of the risk, these people say.
Citigroup cut a deal at the end of last year with the private equity firm Blackstone Group, which insured the big bank against a portion of the losses on a roughly $1 billion pool of shipping loans. The bank used a special-purpose vehicle in Ireland called Cloverie to facilitate the trade, according to people briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak on the record.
For its part, Blackstone put up about $100 million, or 12 percent of the value of the shipping portfolio, to cover any possible losses. If things go well, Blackstone will receive a return of about 15 percent, these people say. If the shipping loans go sour, Citigroup gets Blackstone's money and the private equity firm loses its cash.
Credit Suisse received capital relief on the Lucerne deal, although the exact amount is not known. Citigroup was able to reduce by roughly 90 percent the amount of capital it needed to set aside to cover losses on the shipping portfolio.
One Citigroup executive with knowledge of this trade but not authorized to speak on the record said it was structured to reduce Citigroup's exposure to shipping loans. The fact that it reduced the amount of capital the bank had to hold was "an added bonus."
UBS also recently completed a regulatory capital trade, selling a piece of the risk on a portfolio of roughly 100 corporate loans, according to people who reviewed the transaction but who declined to speak publicly because they had signed confidentiality agreements.
And Citigroup is marketing a second risk capital trade involving shipping loans, according to people briefed on the matter.
"These trades are a good thing," said Richard Robb, a New York money manager whose firm, Christofferson, Robb & Company, has been structuring regulatory capital trades for more than a decade. "The best way to protect the banks against this risk is to move it outside the banking system to wealthy institutions. No one will be coming to bail out our company or our investors if these trades backfire."

HEADLINE: A Hide-Out From the Ordinary

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

 BODY:
IT HAS BEEN SOME TIME since a new store, the brick-and-mortar kind, for those of you who can remember, has set out to do something more surprising than sell clothes. But then, entertaining the customer has become a low-priority line item on most retailers' budgets these days.
Jon Koon, the designer of Private Stock, a label you surely have never heard of, evidently does not have this problem. Mr. Koon is fashion's version of Nick D'Aloisio, the 17-year-old who made a fortune by selling an app to Yahoo last month. Only Mr. Koon, who made his first million at 16 with a customized auto parts business from his home in Queens, wants to be more like Mark Zuckerberg. Before starting his gussied up streetwear line three years ago, he designed air fresheners that look like spinning car rims and other items that fall into the general category of vehicular bling, became a partner in the fashion collection of Young Jeezy and started a denim line with Domenico Vacca. He is now 29. 
This is essential information to know before setting foot in Mr. Koon's Private Stock store, which opened last weekend at 76 Wooster Street in SoHo, a virtual time warp to the pre-recession days of outrageous ostentation and a vastly entertaining space where selling clothes seems to be of the least priority. The first outfit you will encounter is so expensive it is displayed behind glass: a $4,628 deerskin hoodie and matching $1,898 shorts with white gold-plated zippers and a pedigree so complicated it requires an accompanying wall text. (Abridged version: superfine New Zealand deerskin tanned in Italy, then processed in Kyoto, Japan, with a hand ring-spun dying technique to create a floral kimono pattern, then bonded to lightweight chambray in Okayama. Heck, it's even machine washable.)
Like the space, the name Private Stock is intended to suggest something exclusive, tucked away for those in the know and of the means to afford it. But Mr. Koon is also a bit of a showman, and the store is worth exploring because it is so over the top. Some accessories are displayed behind panels of frosted glass that turn transparent at the flip of a switch (like the famous bathroom stalls of the recently closed Bar 89 on Mercer Street). Hanging like paintings on a wall are chairs constructed from leftover garments from Mr. Koon's previous collection -- shirts and jeans were dipped in resin, molded and baked into the shape of a chair. New jeans, mostly produced in limited editions with carefully crafted patches, stitches and washes, are individually displayed in vertical drawers that roll out from the walls.
And visible from a cutout in the center of the store is a large, jaw-dropping koi pond, stocked with fish imported from Japan at a cost of $50,000, in the basement, where there are also showrooms designed for big-fish clients.
''Private Stock likes to be hidden,'' Mr. Koon said. ''We want people to walk in here and feel like they have found something secret, and they don't even want to share it with their friends.''
Because Mr. Koon, a Chinese-American who was born and raised in New York, is superstitious, he incorporated the lucky number eight in most elements of his design. There are 18 fish, 28 light fixtures, and the clothes hangers fit into customized grooves on the racks so that the items hang 6.8 inches apart. Dress shirts cost $248 to $368. Jeans start at $248. A sharp navy Windbreaker costs $448.
You get the picture: Mr. Koon is very precise in his measurements, right down to the shade of white he uses on the walls, a custom matte blend with a powdery finish. He liked that white so much that he painted two framed canvases white on white in the back of the store. That's the only space where there's nothing to see.

HEADLINE: Bieber Backs A Debit Card For Teenagers, From Parents

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
JUSTIN BIEBER earned $55 million in 2012, according to Forbes, but in new videos for the SpendSmart Payments Company, which offers a prepaid debit card for teenagers, the singer talks about his modest upbringing.
''You know when I was a kid, we didn't have a lot of money, so me and my family had to watch the money that we spent,'' Mr. Bieber says in a video directed at his young fans. ''I learned if you have $100 or $100 million -- if you spend more than you have, you're going to go broke.''
Mr. Bieber urges viewers to ''have a talk with your family about money'' in the video. ''Managing your money is important,'' he says, ''and there's a great company that can help you do that called SpendSmart.'' 
The video, by BrandFire in Manhattan, will be shared by Mr. Bieber beginning Thursday on his YouTube channel (more than two million subscribers), Facebook page (more than 52.4 million followers), and on Twitter (more than 37.3 million followers).
Subsequent videos, called ''Real Talk,'' also will feature Mr. Bieber discussing financial literacy and encouraging teenagers to share their videos.
Mr. Bieber is being paid $3.75 million for a 14-month contract, along with potential monthly royalties tied to the growth of active SpendSmart cards, according to documents the company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The deal also, according to the filing, includes a stock option to buy two million shares of SpendSmart stock, which was trading at 38.8 cents a share Wednesday.
Noreen Jenney Laffey, president of Celebrity Endorsement Network, said she would have expected such a deal to earn Mr. Bieber closer to $2 million, but she lauded SpendSmart both for choosing the singer to reach teenagers and for focusing on social media rather than traditional advertising.
''The marketing strategy and the choice of talent for this is brilliant, as is merging it into his social media network,'' Ms. Jenney Laffey said.
The SpendSmart card has a number of features intended to teach teenagers financial literacy while enabling parents to monitor them.
When teenagers use the card, which has a MasterCard logo, parents can be alerted instantly to the purchase through text messages and a smartphone app. Parents may pre-emptively block purchases from Web sites, and instantly lock the card after seeing anything objectionable. Real-time monitoring fosters what SpendSmart, in marketing materials, calls ''teachable moments.''
Introduced in 2009 as BillMyParents, the card was first marketed mainly as a tool to let teenagers shop online with parental oversight. But for many the name BillMyParents equated parents with A.T.M.'s.
Thus, the company renamed the card and company SpendSmart to highlight its ''mission of being a responsible teen spending company,'' said Michael R. McCoy, who became chief executive of the company in 2011.
''Parents have an easier time talking about drugs and alcohol with their kids than the family budget and financial literacy,'' said Mr. McCoy.
The average SpendSmart cardholder is 16, and the card is used most frequently to buy food (especially fast food), followed by gas, technology (like iTunes, electronics and games) and clothing.
A revamped SpendSmart Web site will be frequently updated with articles about financial literacy from Brafton, a content production agency.
There were seven million prepaid cards in circulation in 2012, more than double the number in 2009, according to CardHub.com, which monitors the industry.
A 2012 report by Consumer Reports criticized prepaid cards over exorbitant fees. Among 15 prepaid cards examined in the report, 13 charged monthly fees (from $2.95 to $9.95), 14 charged for A.T.M. withdrawals, 12 charged for checking balances at A.T.M.'s, and five charged for periods of inactivity.
SpendSmart fees include a monthly fee of $3.95; loading fees of $2.95 from a credit card or 75 cents from a checking account (a single scheduled monthly automatic payment from a checking account is free); $1.50 to withdraw from any A.T.M. (in addition to A.T.M. surcharges), and 50 cents for an A.T.M. balance inquiry; $7.95 for a replacement card; and $3 for 30 days of inactivity.
After reviewing the SpendSmart fee schedule, Michelle Jun, a lawyer with Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Reports, said SpendSmart fees were not as high or numerous as those for many prepaid cards, but she still advised against the card.
''We would not recommend that parents use prepaid cards for their teens,'' Ms. Jun said. ''It doesn't help your teen establish a credit history or a relationship with a financial institution, so we recommend going the traditional route and opening up a checking account at your bank or credit union of choice.''
In an appearance on the Fox Business Network in January, John Ulzheimer, president of consumer education at SmartCredit.com, said that fees for the SpendSmart card were lower than those for many cards. But ''that's like saying my broken arm is not as bad as your broken arm'' because it is ''comparing two bad things and trying to say that one is actually better,'' he said.
''If you just take the monthly fee and nothing else -- meaning that you do nothing else punitive so they can hit you with the fees,'' Mr. Ulzheimer said of SpendSmart on Fox, ''you're still paying a little over $47 a year as an annual fee to get access to your own money.''
Before joining SpendSmart, Mr. McCoy ran the consumer credit division for Wells Fargo, and he said that during the height of the recession many consumers ''got in over their heads because they just flat out spent too much.''
SpendSmart could help teenagers avoid the same fate, he said.
''Instead of trying to teach adults better spending habits, I thought, 'My goodness, there has to be a different way,' '' said Mr. McCoy. ''We're helping families to teach youth better spending habits.''

HEADLINE: Obama Budget Whittles Democratic Party Pillars

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama's new budget has opened a debate over what it means to be a progressive Democrat in an age of austerity and defines him as a president willing to take on the two pillars of his party -- Medicare and Social Security -- created by Democratic presidents.
By his gamble on Wednesday in proposing budgetary concessions to Republicans on Social Security, the 1935 creation of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Medicare, the legacy of President Lyndon B. Johnson, Mr. Obama has provoked angry supporters on his left to ask whether he is a progressive at all.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, Richard Trumka, in a blistering statement, called the proposed changes ''wrong and indefensible.'' An e-mail from Representative Alan Grayson, a liberal from Florida, was headlined ''President's Budget Breaks Promise to Seniors.'' 
But to Mr. Obama, cost-saving changes in the nation's fastest-growing domestic programs are more progressive than simply allowing the entitlement programs for older Americans to overwhelm the rest of the budget in future years.
Even so, he emphasized that his support is contingent on Republicans agreeing to higher taxes from the wealthy and new spending, in areas like infrastructure, to create jobs.
The president's views put him at the head of a small but growing faction of liberals and moderate Democrats who began arguing several years ago that unless the party agrees to changes in the entitlement benefit programs -- which are growing unsustainably as baby boomers age and medical prices rise -- the programs' costs will overwhelm all other domestic spending to help the poor, the working class and children.
''The math on entitlements is just not sustainable,'' said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, one of the few Democrats to unequivocally endorse Mr. Obama's budget. ''And if you're not finding ways to reform, where do you squeeze? Well, then you squeeze early-childhood programs, you squeeze Head Start, you squeeze education and veterans.''
''There's nothing progressive about -- and no business argument for -- a business or any other enterprise to invest less than 5 percent of its revenues on the education of its work force, its infrastructure and its R & D,'' Mr. Warner added. ''And that's what we're doing.''
The president's $3.77 trillion budget, with a mix of deficit reduction through spending cuts and tax increases and new spending to spur the economy, projects a $744 billion deficit for the 2014 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. That is down from the $973 billion shortfall projected for this fiscal year, after four years of post-recession deficits exceeding $1 trillion.
Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic minority leader, has arranged for House Democrats on Thursday to hear a debate on Mr. Obama's proposed change in the cost-of-living formula that determines Social Security benefits. The debate will pit the A.F.L.-C.I.O. counsel, Damon Silvers, who opposes the change in the formula, and Robert Greenstein, executive director of the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, which has long supported changes to entitlement programs as part of a bipartisan deal to protect other federal spending on, for example, antipoverty programs, the nation's infrastructure and education.
It has been evident from his first months in office that the pragmatist in Mr. Obama has made him sympathetic to the thinking of Mr. Greenstein and others. In 2009, Mr. Obama considered proposing the change in the cost-of-living formula for Social Security until Democratic Congressional leaders objected.
But now in his fifth budget and the first of his second term, he has decided over some advisers' objections to make that proposal -- and his brand of pragmatic liberalism -- official.
Under the president's budget, the government would shift in 2015 from the standard Consumer Price Index -- used to compute cost-of-living increases for Social Security and other benefits and to set income-tax brackets -- to what is called a ''chained C.P.I.'' The new formulation would slow the increase in benefits and raise income tax revenues by putting some taxpayers into higher brackets sooner, for total savings of $230 billion over 10 years.
While many economists say the new formula is more accurate, opponents say it does not adequately reflect the out-of-pocket health care expenses that burden older Americans. All Social Security beneficiaries would be affected, but Mr. Obama proposes that at age 76 they would get gradual benefit increases to offset the depletion of their private assets or pensions.
In the president's bid to revive bipartisan talks, his budget includes other proposals from his last compromise offer, made in December to Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, before their private deficit-reduction negotiations collapsed. The president's budget would save $400 billion from Medicare over a decade, mostly from reductions to hospitals and other health care providers, but also through benefit and premium changes.
The budget's total 10-year savings would replace the $1.2 trillion in indiscriminate across-the-board cuts, known as sequestration, that took effect March 1 after Mr. Obama and Republican leaders failed to agree on alternative deficit-reduction measures.
By this budget, Mr. Obama has forced the party's internal fiscal debate to go public to a degree not seen since President Bill Clinton pushed Democrats toward the political center. Until now, attention has focused on the Republicans' postelection divisions over defining conservatism.
Mr. Clinton's second-term effort to address the long-term finances of Medicare and Social Security was aborted by his impeachment and then by unexpected budget surpluses that relieved the fiscal pressure to change the programs. Ultimately, Mr. Clinton left office better known for his policy of ''Save Social Security First'' -- that is, save the surpluses to pay the approaching costs of the baby boomers' retirement rather than use them to cut taxes, as Republicans wanted.
Democratic Congressional leaders were muted in their support for the president's plan and were troubled that Mr. Obama had made his overture to Republicans without any sign that they would compromise in return.
Their political concerns seemed to be validated when Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, the head of the House Republicans' campaign committee, said on CNN that the budget was ''a shocking attack on seniors.'' His words were interpreted as a signal that in the 2014 midterm elections Republican candidates will again accuse Democrats of trying to cut Medicare and Social Security, even though Congressional Republicans led by Mr. Boehner have demanded Social Security and Medicare cuts throughout budget talks of the past two years.
The C.P.I change in particular ''was the speaker's idea,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee. ''And for them to turn around and attack the president for including their proposal in his budget is so hypocritical.''
Mr. Boehner, who was dismissive before the budget's release, tempered his criticisms afterward. He told reporters that Mr. Obama ''does deserve some credit for some incremental entitlement reforms that he has outlined in his budget.''
Some Senate Republicans were complimentary, and later Mr. Obama had a dozen of them to dinner at the White House to discuss the budget, immigration and gun controls. He hopes to persuade enough of them to compromise with Senate Democrats on the issues, putting pressure on House Republicans to go along.

Obama's Mix of Taxes and Spending
The president's 2014 budget includes $1.4 trillion in spending cuts and tax increases over 10 years compared with current policies (a 3% budget reduction over that period). Annual deficits would fall to 1.7% of gross domestic product by 2023 but would begin to grow unsustainably after, as proposed cuts to entitlement programs would not be enough to stabilize their cost.

HEADLINE: U.S. Efforts to Regulate Consultants Face Big Obstacles

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
Federal regulators are facing pressure from Capitol Hill to rein in a multibillion-dollar consulting industry after the companies stumbled during their recent review of mortgage foreclosure abuses. But the efforts could be stymied, given regulators' close ties to consultants and limited legal authority to penalize them.
The early signs are discouraging, lawmakers say. After concerns surfaced that a consulting firm was bungling the broad review of foreclosures, regulators wrote to the firm, complaining about the conduct but did not fire the consultant, said Congressional officials with knowledge of the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. 
The use of consultants, who are paid by the same banks they are expected to help reform, will be examined at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Thursday. Senator Sherrod Brown, the Ohio Democrat leading the hearing, is examining whether regulators inappropriately ''outsource'' oversight like the foreclosure review to consultants like Deloitte & Touche and Promontory Financial Group.
Since the foreclosure review was scuttled in January, some regulators have been exploring new ways to curb the use of consultants and correct problems that occur, according to testimony prepared for the hearing.
''While the use of independent consultants can be an effective supervisory tool, there are certainly lessons to be learned from our experience, and we believe we can improve the process going forward,'' Daniel P. Stipano, a senior official at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said in the testimony. The agency plans to ''enhance our oversight of the consultants when they are utilized,'' he said.
But challenges remain. Mr. Stipano is expected to cite legal limitations that undercut the regulator's authority over consultants. Those constraints stem from 2006 when the comptroller's office levied a $300,000 fine against Grant Thornton, a firm that audited the books of First National Bank of Keystone in West Virginia, which collapsed in 1999. Grant Thornton, the comptroller found, ignored ''unequivocal, written evidence'' that the bank had not accounted for much of its assets, a major discrepancy that the consultant did not flag.
When the firm challenged the fine, a federal appeals court in Washington overruled the comptroller. The court said that the regulator had ''exceeded his statutory authority.''
At the hearing on Thursday, Mr. Stipano is expected to petition lawmakers for greater authority. In the prepared testimony, he said the comptroller's office ''would welcome a legislative change in this area that would facilitate our ability to take enforcement actions directly against independent contractors that engage in wrongdoing.''
Even if regulators gain new powers to curb the use of consultants, their ties to the firms may prove difficult to untangle. Since the financial crisis, the comptroller has ordered banks to hire consultants in more than 130 enforcement actions, or roughly 15 percent of the cases, an analysis of government records shows.
Further complicating the relationships, consultants like Promontory have forged close ties to the regulators, routinely hiring from government ranks. Promontory was founded by Eugene A. Ludwig, a former comptroller of the currency. Last week, it hired Mary L. Schapiro, who led the Securities and Exchange Commission until late last year.
In addition to Deloitte and PricewaterhouseCoopers employees, a Promontory executive, Konrad Alt, will testify at the Senate hearing. Mr. Stipano, of the comptroller's office, will be joined by Richard M. Ashton, deputy general counsel at the Fed.
The hearing will occur a week after the Government Accountability Office issued a scathing report faulting regulators for the flawed mortgage foreclosure review. The regulators, the report found, failed to properly coordinate a review of foreclosed loans and potentially allowed some errors to go undetected.
Adding to the scrutiny, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, are pushing regulators to explain what went wrong with the foreclosure review. Regulators stopped the review in January after consultants had scrutinized only 114,000 of the more than 800,000 troubled loans they had been expected to review, the lawmakers said.
When the lawmakers pressed for greater detail on the problems, regulators balked. The regulators, for example, refused to provide the name of the consultant who had been admonished, but not fired, for shoddy work.
In a letter to the regulators on Wednesday, the lawmakers rebuked the Federal Reserve and the comptroller's office for the resistance. ''Your staff would not elaborate'' even after finding the consultant's work was ''so poor that you issued a letter faulting the company and directing it to cure its deficiencies,'' according to a copy of the letter reviewed by The New York Times.
The letter also criticized the regulators for shielding the banks. When asked to detail the number of illegal foreclosures at each bank, the regulators declined, arguing that the information amounted to ''trade secrets.''
Lawmakers excoriated the argument, declaring in their letter that ''breaking the law is not a corporate trade secret.''
The dispute, officials note, occurred because regulators are hesitant to provide detailed information derived from their supervision of banks. Such documents are typically confidential.
The comptroller's office and the Fed declined to comment.
Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, is also attacking the regulators' reliance on consultants. While regulators must grapple with finite resources, forcing them to hire outsiders for certain responsibilities, Ms. Waters argues that federal authorities should adopt stricter oversight measures.
Mr. Alt rejected the notion that Promontory is beholden to banks it helps. ''We are working for the regulator,'' he said. ''If we merely told our clients what they want to hear, we would lose credibility.''
But Ms. Waters on Wednesday introduced legislation to impose conditions on the use of consultants, including progress reports and detailed cost estimates.''The situation clearly requires a legislative remedy,'' she said on Wednesday. ''This is not independence -- it is work for hire.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Health Care and Military Spending Bear the Brunt of Proposed Cuts

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and THOM SHANKER; John M. Broder and Annie Lowrey contributed reporting from Washington, and Motoko Rich from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama's effort to control federal spending would require the largest cuts from the government's biggest programs -- health care and the military -- while preserving or increasing spending on favored initiatives like early education, manufacturing and research.
The president's proposed budget, for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, will be extensively rewritten in Congress, but is designed to reduce the growth of federal health spending by $401 billion over 10 years. 
The budget would require $57 billion in higher payments by Medicare beneficiaries, cut $306 billion in projected Medicare payments to health care providers and squeeze $19 billion out of Medicaid, the program for low-income people.
Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, said Wednesday that the president was requesting $1.5 billion to operate health insurance supermarkets, known as exchanges, in 2014. In addition, the administration plans to raise $450 million by charging insurance companies fees to sell their products to consumers and small businesses in the exchanges. The federal government will have the primary responsibility for operating the exchanges in more than 30 states.
The largest share of the new payments by Medicare beneficiaries, $50 billion over 10 years, would come from additional premiums paid by high-income people for coverage of doctors' services and prescription drugs.
The Defense Department's proposed $526.6 billion base budget is a reduction of $3.9 billion, or 0.7 percent, from the enacted budget for 2012. It includes substantial reductions for the Army, which has carried the bulk of the combat operations over the past decade. The Army's budget proposal is 4 percent lower in constant dollars, while the Air Force's rose 3 percent and the Navy's, which includes Marine Corps spending, was steady.
The budget proposes spending $2.4 billion over five years to conduct another round of politically difficult base closings, which Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said would deliver ''significant savings'' over the long term.
The inventory of remotely piloted vehicles, commonly called drones, would grow through 2017 and then level off, Pentagon officials said, and money would be preserved for the new way of war as fought by Special Operations forces and in cyberspace.
While the budget outlines sizable cuts at many agencies, it proposes a 4.6 percent increase in discretionary funding for the Education Department over 2013 spending.
At the center of Mr. Obama's education agenda is a program that would guarantee public preschool for all 4-year-olds from families with low and moderate incomes. To pay for it, the administration has proposed an increase in federal cigarette taxes to $1.95 per pack from $1.01. That would cover the $66 billion cost of providing preschool and the $11 billion cost of voluntary home-visiting programs for poor families, both over 10 years.
The budget also calls for a one-time outlay of $11.8 billion to preserve teaching jobs and increase hiring as the economy recovers.
The president's budget reflects his determination that manufacturing will be a major component of American middle-class job growth and a worthy recipient of increased federal spending.
In his budget message to Congress, Mr. Obama called manufacturing a ''first priority,'' and he noted that manufacturers had added more than 500,000 workers in the last three years after a decade of precipitous decline.
''Companies large and small are increasingly deciding to bring jobs back to America,'' Mr. Obama wrote, urging Congress to devote federal money to accelerate the trend. His budget requests financing for 15 manufacturing research and training ''hubs,'' tax credits, and incentives to draw foreign business to the United States.
The White House offered a pre-emptive reduction for the Environmental Protection Agency, a favorite target of Republican budget-cutters on Capitol Hill. The administration's proposed budget provides $8.2 billion for the E.P.A., a decrease of $296 million, or 3.5 percent, from current spending.
The cuts would be felt most deeply by state and local governments, whose federal financing for drinking water and wastewater treatment projects would fall by $472 million. The agency said smaller and underserved communities would be spared, although the broader programs are shrinking. The Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds would receive $1.9 billion, down from nearly $2.4 billion in the current year.
On health care, the president would require new Medicare beneficiaries to pay co-payments for home health services, starting in 2017. And he would impose a surcharge on Medicare premiums for new beneficiaries who buy the most generous private insurance policies to supplement Medicare. Such Medigap policies reduce the incentive for beneficiaries to consider the costs of services, the White House said.
The home health co-payments and premium surcharges would raise $3.6 billion from 2017 to 2023, the administration said. Mr. Obama would require drug manufacturers to provide additional discounts, or rebates, to Medicare for prescription drugs bought by low-income beneficiaries. Medicare would thus get discounts similar to those that drug makers now provide to Medicaid.
The White House said this proposal would reduce budget deficits by $123 billion over 10 years. Drug makers have beaten back similar proposals in the past, saying they amount to price controls.

HEADLINE: In Accident, Fed Gives Early Data To Banks

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve alerted bank officials on Tuesday that policy makers were considering a shift on when to begin easing back on stimulus efforts, a day before the news was released publicly, but it insisted there was no evidence traders on Wall Street had benefited from what was called an error.
Markets rallied after the release Wednesday morning of the minutes from the March meeting. They were released five hours earlier than originally planned because a Fed official mistakenly e-mailed them Tuesday afternoon to a host of legislative staff members and bank representatives. 
The disclosure raised eyebrows both in Washington and on Wall Street, and legal and compliance departments at the banks were poring over e-mail records to determine exactly what transpired because of the early release.
Several banks declined to comment. A spokesman for Goldman Sachs said the employee who received the e-mail did not share its contents with anyone or act upon it in any way.
The e-mail went to lobbyists and government relations officials at the banks, rather than to trading desks or senior executives, but the wide distribution underscored the magnitude of the Fed's mistake.
Fed officials discovered the error about 6:30 a.m. Wednesday and immediately briefed Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman. An official for the Fed insisted the error was discovered internally, not because of trading anomalies or because a recipient had alerted regulators.
The minutes are closely watched by traders and investors for any clue about Fed policy, making them among the most market-sensitive documents the government releases. Participants in the multitrillion-dollar bond market follow the zigs and zags of the Fed intently, since even a small move in rates can move bond prices sharply.
At the meeting, the officials discussed moving slightly earlier than expected to scale back their efforts to encourage growth if the economy continued to rebound. Experts interpreted the debate within the Fed as pointing to the possibility of a somewhat less expansive monetary policy later this year, though they were quick to note that the meeting took place before last Friday's report on unemployment and job creation in March, which was much weaker than expected.
Since last year, the Fed has been expanding its holdings by $85 billion a month in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in an effort to keep long-term interest rates as low as possible and spur economic growth.
The minutes were released generally at 9 a.m. Eastern time on Wednesday after officials realized they had mistakenly been distributed the previous day to what they initially described as more than 100 Congressional staff members and trade association officials. But when Fed officials disclosed the list of recipients, it read like a Who's Who of Wall Street firms, including Goldman Sachs, Barclays, JPMorgan Chase, UBS, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, BNP Paribas and HSBC.
''The reason is they were inadvertently sent early to a list of individuals who normally receive the minutes by e-mail shortly after their usual release time,'' the Federal Reserve said in a statement. The error was traced to the Fed's Congressional liaison office and a mistake there by an employee, Brian Gross, who has worked at the Fed for a decade.
''This was human error,'' said a Fed official who insisted on anonymity.
Still, the Federal Reserve's inspector general was asked to review release procedures in light of the incident. The Fed also said it alerted the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Mr. Gross was unavailable for comment.
Until the most recent unemployment report, signs suggested the labor market was gaining steam, a crucial factor in helping Fed policy makers decide when to scale back the bond purchases.
Since Friday's report, however, worries have returned that slow levels of job creation will keep unemployment at elevated levels. The jobless rate was 7.6 percent in March, much higher than normal for this stage of a recovery. And the economy, according to the initial Labor Department report, created only 88,000 jobs in March, a far cry from the 268,000 jobs added in February.
''They were seeing a different world than they're seeing today,'' said Michael Hanson, senior United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Besides the weak jobs figures, recent data for manufacturing have been soft, while consumer confidence remains mixed.
The meeting, on March 19 and 20, came after a series of more positive indicators in January and February, Mr. Hanson said.
The Federal Reserve has said it plans to continue the stimulus efforts until there is ''substantial improvement'' in the labor market outlook.
The minutes of the policy meeting show an array of views. The more dovish Fed officials favored continuing the bond purchases at least through the end of the year, while more hawkish ones argued the purchases should scale back in the middle of 2013 and finish by December.
''Several'' members of the Fed's Open Market Committee ''thought that if the outlook for labor market conditions improved as anticipated, it would probably be appropriate to slow purchases later in the year and to stop them by year-end,'' the minutes said.
Two members of the committee indicated the purchases should continue at the current pace through the end of 2013, while one argued they should be trimmed back immediately. More hawkish Fed officials have said they worry that the stimulus efforts, if continued too long, could artificially push up prices or overheat markets for stocks and housing while increasing the risk of a rapid run-up in longer-term interest rates once the stimulus ends.
Mr. Bernanke has made clear recently that he will favor the program of asset purchases as long as the labor market remains soft and the economy performs far below its potential.
''But it does seem that outside his core supporters, members are wavering,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors. ''But remember, the March payroll data were not known at this meeting, and the tone will likely be different next time. Still, our antennas are twitching a bit.''
Like many experts, Mr. Hanson says he foresees growth slowing in the second and third quarters of 2013, after what he estimates was a 3 percent increase in output in the first quarter.
Most of that is because of tightening fiscal policy from Washington, Mr. Hanson said, as the automatic spending cuts imposed by Congress go into effect.
Despite the more hawkish tone of the minutes, Mr. Hanson said, Bank of America thinks the Fed will be ''buying into 2014, tapering off in the spring and not finishing until the fall of 2014.''

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Director Urges Banks To Retain Loose Money Policy

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Global growth is likely to remain tepid this year and central banks should keep their easy monetary policies in place, the head of the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday. 
''Thanks to the actions of policy makers, the economic world no longer looks quite as dangerous as it did six months ago,'' Christine Lagarde, the I.M.F. managing director, told the Economic Club of New York.
While there were signs that financial conditions were improving, Ms. Lagarde said those changes were not translating into improvements in the real economy.
''In present circumstances, it makes sense for monetary policy to do the heavy lifting in this recovery by remaining accommodative,'' Ms. Lagarde said.
''We know that inflation expectations are well anchored today, giving central banks greater leeway to support growth,'' she added.
She said a three-speed recovery was under way, led by fast-growing emerging economies, followed by countries like the United States that are on the mend, and with the euro zone and Japan trailing.
In January, the I.M.F. trimmed its 2013 forecast for global growth to 3.5 percent from 3.6 percent, and projected a 4.1 percent expansion in 2014. It said the world economy grew 3.2 percent in 2012.
Ms. Lagarde said the exceptionally loose monetary policies of central banks in advanced economies was a concern for emerging economies, which fear a sudden reversal of the large capital flows that have flooded their economies in recent years as investors have sought higher yields.
''Right now, these risks appear under control,'' Ms. Lagarde said, but she urged emerging economies to increase their defenses to deal with possible repercussions when the Federal Reserve and other central banks start to cut back their monetary stimulus.

HEADLINE: A Sure Bet Loses Its Luster

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
Below the streets of Lower Manhattan, in the vault of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the world's largest trove of gold -- half a million bars -- has lost about $75 billion of its value. In Fort Knox, Ky., at the United States Bullion Depository, the damage totals $50 billion.
And in Pocatello, Idaho, the tiny golden treasure of Jon Norstog has dwindled, too. A $29,000 investment that Mr. Norstog made in 2011 is now worth about $17,000, a loss of 42 percent.
''I thought if worst came to worst and the government brought down the world economy, I would still have something that was worth something,'' Mr. Norstog, 67, says of his foray into gold. 
Gold, pride of Croesus and store of wealth since time immemorial, has turned out to be a very bad investment of late. A mere two years after its price raced to a nominal high, gold is sinking -- fast. Its price has fallen 17 percent since late 2011. Wednesday was another bad day for gold: the price of bullion dropped $28 to $1,558 an ounce.
It is a remarkable turnabout for an investment that many have long regarded as one of the safest of all. The decline has been so swift that some Wall Street analysts are declaring the end of a golden age of gold. The stakes are high: the last time the metal went through a patch like this, in the 1980s, its price took 30 years to recover.
What went wrong? The answer, in part, lies in what went right. Analysts say gold is losing its allure after an astonishing 650 percent rally from August 1999 to August 2011. Fast-money hedge fund managers and ordinary savers alike flocked to gold, that haven of havens, when the world economy teetered on the brink in 2009. Now, the worst of the Great Recession has passed. Things are looking up for the economy and, as a result, down for gold. On top of that, concern that the loose monetary policy at Federal Reserve might set off inflation -- a prospect that drove investors to gold -- have so far proved to be unfounded.
And so Wall Street is growing increasingly bearish on gold, an investment banks and others had deftly marketed to the masses only a few years ago. On Wednesday, Goldman Sachs became the latest big bank to predict further declines, forecasting that the price of gold would sink to $1,390 within a year, down 11 percent from where it traded on Wednesday. Société Générale of France last week issued a report titled, ''The End of the Gold Era,'' which said the price should fall to $1,375 by the end of the year and could keep falling for years.
Granted, gold has gone through booms and busts before, including at least two from its peak in 1980, when it traded at $835, to its high in 2011. And anyone who bought gold in 1999 and held on has done far better than the average stock market investor. Even after the recent decline, gold is still up 515 percent.
But for a generation of investors, the golden decade created the illusion that the metal would keep rising forever. The financial industry seized on such hopes to market a growing range of gold investments, making the current downturn in gold felt more widely than previous ones. That triumph of marketing gold was apparent in an April 2011 poll by Gallup, which found that 34 percent of Americans thought that gold was the best long-term investment, more than another other investment category, including real estate and mutual funds.
It is hard to know just how much money ordinary Americans plowed into gold, given the array of investment vehicles, including government-minted coins, publicly traded commodity funds, mining company stocks and physical bullion. But $5 billion that flowed into gold-focused mutual funds in 2009 and 2010, according to Morningstar, helped the funds reach a peak value of $26.3 billion. Since hitting a peak in April 2011, those funds have lost half of their value.
''Gold is very much a psychological market,'' said William O'Neill, a co-founder of the research firm Logic Advisors, which told its investors to get out of all gold positions in December after recommending the investment for years. ''Unless there is some unforeseen development, I think the market is going lower.''
Gold's abrupt reversal has also been painful for companies that were cashing in on the gold craze. In the last year, two gold-focused mutual funds were liquidated after years of new fund openings, Morningstar data shows. Perhaps the most famous company to come out of the 2011 gold rush, the retail trading company Goldline, has drastically cut back its advertising on cable television, lowering spending to $3.7 million from $17.8 million in 2010, according to Kantar Media.
Goldline agreed to pay $4.5 million last year to settle charges brought by the city attorney of Santa Monica, Calif., accusing the company of running a bait-and-switch operation. Goldline did not respond to requests for comment for this article.
But the worst news for gold is probably good news for the broader economy, which, though still struggling to grow, has recovered from its lows.
''As the economy improves, the demand for gold as a financial hedge declines more than the fundamental demand for gold jewelry increases,'' said Daniel J. Arbess, a partner at Perella Weinberg Partners, who sold off his fund's large stake in gold in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Investment professionals, who have focused many of their bets on gold exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.'s, have been faster than retail investors to catch wind of gold's changing fortune. The outflow at the most popular E.T.F., the SPDR Gold Shares, was the biggest of any E.T.F. in the first quarter of this year as hedge funds and traders pulled out $6.6 billion, according to the data firm IndexUniverse. Two prominent hedge fund managers who had taken big positions in gold E.T.F.'s, George Soros and Louis M. Bacon, sold in the last quarter of 2012, according to recent regulatory filings.
''Gold was destroyed as a safe haven, proved to be unsafe,'' Mr. Soros said in an interview last week with The South China Morning Post of Hong Kong. ''Because of the disappointment, most people are reducing their holdings of gold.''
Gold's most vocal bulls say gold doubters are losing faith too easily. Peter Schiff, the chief executive of the investment firm Euro Pacific Capital, said that he still expected gold to hit $5,000 an ounce within a few years because, he said, the world is headed for a period of dangerous hyperinflation.
''People believe the U.S. economy is recovering. It's not,'' said Mr. Schiff.
The most famous investor who is standing by gold is John Paulson, the hedge fund manager who made a fortune betting against the American housing market. His $900 million gold fund reportedly dropped 26 percent in the first two months of this year.
Mr. Paulson's losses were particularly severe because he bet heavily on gold mining companies, which have fallen more sharply than gold itself.
Mr. Norstog, in Pocatello, made a similar mistake. He put his money in a gold fund that was focused on mining company stocks.
''If I had to do it all over again, I would have just bought the gold,'' Mr. Norstog said. ''At least that way I could have run my fingers through the glittering coins.''

HEADLINE: Powers on the Mend

BYLINE: By IAN BREMMER and DAVID GORDON

 BODY:
There have been a lot of alarming headlines for U.S.-Chinese relations of late -- and not for no reason. Recriminations over claims of cyberaggression, trouble for U.S. companies in China, and a worrying security environment in East Asia -- especially around North Korea -- have generated a lot of press. It's vitally important that the U.S. and Chinese leaderships become directly involved in keeping bilateral ties, the world's most important, on track.
But there's an important good news story here as well; one that won't draw as much attention because it points down a less provocative and more promising path. Yes, China is rising; but, surprise, so is America -- and given the deep economic interdependence that both governments acknowledge, that's a recipe for a more constructive longer-term relationship. 
First, the good news from this side of the Pacific. A financial crisis and the deepest recession in decades enveloped Americans in gloom, and even after the recession ended a tepid recovery and surging national debt looked to some symptomatic of a superpower in decline.
Yet several economic and political factors are now reviving talk of America the Resilient, both at home and abroad. A technology-driven U.S. energy boom may be the biggest surprise of all. Resignation over dependence on foreign oil and natural gas has given way to debate over how to best to profit from a glut of new supply. The revolution in production of tight oil and shale gas has fueled U.S. job growth, created conditions for a revival of low-cost U.S. manufacturing, and now offers Washington the chance to use energy -- both exports and technology -- as a tool of foreign policy. Add a housing market turnaround, and these changes set the stage for a dynamic U.S. recovery.
Better still, the political class seems to accept the need to stand out of the way. Even as the sequester and its spending cuts weigh on near-term growth, Congress has mostly abandoned the fiscal brinksmanship of the past two years and is on track to pass comprehensive immigration reform in 2013, providing medium- and long-term economic benefits. And despite President Obama's renewed focus on climate change, his ''all-of-the-above'' energy policy will allow for continued growth of tight oil and shale gas production.
As the United States recovers at home, it becomes a more attractive partner abroad. Asian nations are eager to partner with the United States as an alternative to China, and Europeans are eager for U.S. trade and investment to help lift their economic malaise. The U.S. energy boom has added additional appeal, offering America's friends and allies an alternative to less predictable energy exporters like Russia.
The administration has also set forth an increasingly ambitious trade policy. The Trans-Pacific Partnership and its nascent trans-Atlantic counterpart have the ability to create a trade, investment and regulatory framework to establish free market principles as the bedrock of 21st-century global economics and get beyond the deadlock of the need for universalism in the World Trade Organization.
The other piece of this puzzle is that -- in contrast with the other BRICS, which are all facing trying times -- China's rise continues apace, providing that country's new leadership the self-confidence it needs to build a more constructive relationship with Washington. Yes, the pace of China's expansion has slowed, but its economy, still the star performer among the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), grew by a robust 7.8 percent last year. Over the longer term, China's reform challenges are extraordinary and its future remains uncertain. But the near-term forecast remains sunny and the country's charismatic new president is charting a confident course.
Why is this good news for the relationship? Because U.S.-China is no zero-sum game. There is no new Berlin Wall separating the two countries' fortunes -- and both sides know it. Given the volumes of trade and investment between them, Washington and Beijing will rise or fall together, and neither side has much to gain from the other's weakness and insecurity.
While the U.S. economy looked to be stuck in a ditch, China partly succumbed to the temptation to be a bit more aggressive in asserting its interests -- in East Asia and around the world. But this assertiveness actually diminished China's reputation, and a strengthening United States gives Beijing a clearer incentive for cooperation, particularly since China will still need a strong U.S. commitment to help make the world safe for the flow of global commerce, and perhaps to help China exploit its own considerable domestic reserves of tight oil and shale gas.
Make no mistake: This relationship can't run on its own. There are political constituencies in both countries that can bolster their domestic positions with a more hostile approach to the other side. Cybersecurity, in particular, remains a wildcard to watch. Direct engagement from Presidents Obama and Xi Jinping are needed to give U.S.-Chinese relations the importance and urgency they deserve.
Yet there are already positive developments worthy of note. Beijing acted as a good faith partner on tough U.N. sanctions against North Korea, and for the first time, the Chinese Navy has agreed to participate in naval exercises with the United States and other countries in the Pacific.
These signs give the two leaders something to work with.

HEADLINE: Economies of France and Italy Are Risks to the Euro Zone, a Report Says

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- The struggling economies of France and Italy are out of step with better-performing countries like Germany, raising the prospect of more trouble for the euro zone, the European Union's top economics official warned Wednesday.
France and Italy are among the nations in the beleaguered bloc that need to accelerate the policy changes needed to improve their competitiveness and help the euro zone exit a lingering economic crisis, said Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs. 
The uneven performance of economies using the euro is one of the main reasons for the severity of a debt crisis in which some of the worst affected countries were able to borrow more than they could repay.
While the Union has made some strides in rebalancing its economies, ''it will take some time yet to complete the unwinding of the imbalances that were able to grow unchecked in the decade up to the crisis, and which continue to take a toll on our economies,'' Mr. Rehn said at a news conference.
A failure to address the problems in France could be particularly serious for the well-being of the common currency, Mr. Rehn said during a presentation of an annual report comparing the health and competitiveness of a number of Europe's national economies.
''France is, in terms of its size and geo-economic position, a very significant member of the euro zone and its health has a very direct impact on the overall health of the euro zone,'' Mr. Rehn said.
Mr. Rehn's approach has previously come in for tough criticism from some U.S. officials and the International Monetary Fund, which have warned that his calls for more austerity are self-defeating in cases where it restrains economic growth, leading to wider deficits and making it harder for governments in already weakened economies to pay down debt.
Gross domestic product in the 17-nation euro area is expected to shrink 0.3 percent this year, while the 27-nation Union will grow just 0.1 percent, according to forecasts made by the commission in February.
But Mr. Rehn also echoed calls made earlier this week by the U.S. Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, for Germany, the biggest economy in the euro zone and one of its most robust, to do more to spur spending and help revive growth.
''I still believe, and the commission still believes, that there is much more Germany can do in order to boost its domestic demand,'' Mr. Rehn said.
Germany, he said, should do more to open its service sector to competition, to increase the number of women in the labor market and to lift wages to match greater productivity. Such steps could lead to greater exports from other euro zone economies.
Mr. Rehn characterized Germany's current-account surplus as ''rather high,'' but also said it would decline in coming years. He also noted that Germany's export strength had been largely owing to strong performance outside of the Union, and in particular in Asia.
The German economy is healthy enough not to have been included in the report, which covered 13 E.U. member states described as having macroeconomic imbalances.
Those countries, including Britain, the Netherlands and Hungary, must specify how they plan to remedy their imbalances in annual economic plans that they must submit to the commission by the end of the month.
The commission has recently been given greater oversight of the Union's national economies.
Mr. Rehn's warnings were sternest in the cases of Spain and Slovenia, which he said were suffering from ''excessive'' imbalances.
In Spain, very high levels of debt, both domestically and externally, continue to pose serious risks to growth and financial stability, Mr. Rehn said, and despite significant overhauls, the country still faces ''formidable challenges.''
In Slovenia, there are substantial risks to the stability of the financial sector from high corporate indebtedness that is linked to, and has an effect on, public finances, according to the report.
''Slovenia needs now to proceed swiftly and decisively'' with reforms, Mr. Rehn said.
His report did not cover those countries that are already operating under international bailout programs -- Cyprus, Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Their economies are monitored separately.
Unit labor costs in Italy are increasing compared with those of its peers, translating into a loss of productivity. Its specialized companies are increasingly unable to compete with those in countries like China, the report said, while the Italian banking sector remains burdened by loans in or near default.
''The potential economic and financial spillovers to the rest of the euro area remain sizable, should financial market turmoil related to the Italian sovereign debt intensify again,'' the report said.
France successfully avoided a recession in 2010 to 2011, but its trade balance has been decreasing since 1997 and its external debt rose sharply in 2011, the report said. ''Should these trends continue, they would increasingly push down France's medium-term growth prospects,'' it added.
As in Italy, unit labor costs in France have increased, putting pressure on the profitability of companies and hurting innovation.
''The reduced number of exporting firms, their relatively small size, as well as factors relating to the business environment are also impediments for export performance,'' the report said.
''The profit margin of French companies is the lowest in the euro area,'' it added.
The commission attributed France's weak prospects to the structure of its labor market, where it is too difficult to reallocate workers to more productive areas of the economy.
Mr. Rehn was expected to join the finance ministers from the E.U. member states on Friday for meetings in Dublin.
On Friday morning, ministers from the euro area could give their approval for plans to lend Cyprus &#x20ac;10 billion, or $13 billion, for a bailout. But final legal approval will require the approval of governments in some donor countries, including Germany.
Euro zone ministers also are likely to reach a preliminary agreement on how to use their shared bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, to directly recapitalize troubled banks, as demanded by Ireland and a number of other countries.
Another main area of discussion during the meetings in Ireland will be whether to extend the maturities on bailout loans to Ireland and Portugal.

HEADLINE: U.S. and South Korea Put Forces on Alert for Missile Test by North

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN; Rick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- American and South Korean troops increased alert levels on Wednesday as South Korea's foreign minister warned that North Korea could launch its medium-range Musudan missile ''any time from now.''
Although North Korea has tested many of its short-range Scud and medium-range Rodong missiles, it has never flight-tested the longer-distance Musudan, believed by experts to have a range of 1,550 miles to 2,500 miles. A successful test of the missile would demonstrate the North's potential to hit not only South Korea but also all of Japan and targets as far away as the American military bases on Guam, a Pacific island. 
''Based on intelligence we and the Americans have collected, it's highly likely that North Korea will launch a missile,'' Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se of South Korea said at a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday. He added that such a test would violate United Nations resolutions banning the country from testing ballistic missiles. ''Such a possibility could materialize at any time from now.''
American and South Korean troops raised their level of vigilance, stepping up monitoring and intelligence-gathering activities, officials at the South Korean Defense Ministry said.
Adding to the concerns, North Korea often stages military provocations around important national anniversaries, and Monday is the birthday of North Korea's founder, Kim Il-sung, the grandfather of the current leader, Kim Jong-un.
Japan is also on guard for a potential North Korean missile launching, deploying Patriot PAC-3 missile interceptors around Tokyo as a precaution. The American military has moved two Navy missile-defense ships closer to the Korean Peninsula to monitor any North Korean missile launchings and to intercept the missiles if they threaten the American bases or Washington's allies in the region.
South Korean military officials said that they had detected the movements of not only the Musudan but also of Scud and Rodong missiles to the North's east coast, indicating that the North might fire those missiles together, as it had done before.
Despite warnings from North Korean leaders of impending nuclear war, residents of Pyongyang, the North's capital, gave no sense of panic, with people planting trees and dancing in the plazas ahead of the holiday, The Associated Press, which has a bureau in Pyongyang, reported Wednesday.
The North Korean warnings also appeared to have little or no effect on the small Pyongyang community of foreign diplomats. Last week, the host government told them that as of Wednesday it could not guarantee their safety and urged them to consider evacuating.
A spokeswoman for Catherine Ashton, the top foreign policy official at the European Union, said in Brussels that despite North Korea's ''aggressive rhetoric, we judge that the situation on the ground does not justify evacuation or relocation.'' The spokeswoman, Maja Kocijancic, said this message had been delivered via the Swedish Embassy to North Korea's Foreign Ministry, along with a reminder that under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, North Korea ''has a continuing obligation in all circumstances to protect diplomatic missions and E.U. citizens.''
Besides Sweden, the European Union members with embassies in Pyongyang include Britain, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Poland and Romania.
Tensions continued to affect economic ties between the Koreas. For a second consecutive day, North Korean workers did not turn up for work on Wednesday at the industrial complex the Koreas had run jointly in a North Korean city, Kaesong. About 110 South Koreans returned home on Wednesday, reducing the number of South Koreans staying there to 297.
North Korea suspended operations at the factory park in response to continuing joint American-South Korean military drills and United Nations sanctions imposed for its Feb. 12 nuclear test.
The money earned by North Korean workers at Kaesong has been an important source of badly needed foreign currency for the North Korean government. Wednesday was a payday for North Korean workers, but with the North blocking anyone from the South from entering the industrial zone, South Korean factory owners had no way to pay their North Korean workers.
There were also signs that the tensions were starting to hurt tourism to the North. Officials in Dandong in northeastern China told tour operators to halt overland tourism into North Korea, local travel agents said, according to Reuters.
Regarding another point of friction, South Korea officially blamed North Korea on Wednesday for a series of hacking attacks that paralyzed the computer networks of three broadcasters and three banks, as well as several government Web sites, in the South last month.
The findings by a joint investigation team that included government and civilian experts underscored a new dimension to North Korea's recent threats to attack the United States and South Korea. South Korean officials said their latest investigations confirmed that North Korea's cyberwarfare, once limited to the spreading of propaganda through the Web, was increasingly expanding into more disruptive hacking.
''We have found enough evidence that these recent attacks and the attacks in the past originated in the same group,'' said Chun Kil-soo, an official at South Korea's Internet security agency, during a news briefing on Wednesday. ''We believe North Korea was involved.''
A new wave of cyberattacks started on March 20, when the computer networks of the banks and broadcasters went down. On March 26, similar attacks using malicious codes crashed the Web sites of several provincial governments and anti-North Korea activist groups.

HEADLINE: City Report Looks at Subway Link to New Jersey

BYLINE: By MATT FLEGENHEIMER

 BODY:
The plan to build a new rail terminal beneath Grand Central Terminal had its skeptics. A Second Avenue subway has seemed an impossible dream for decades. So perhaps it is plausible that on some faraway date, a traveler will walk out of a Mets game in Flushing, Queens, board the No. 7 train, ride beneath two rivers, and get off in Secaucus, N.J. 
On Wednesday, more than two years after suggesting the idea to extend New York City's subway service across state lines, the Bloomberg administration released a report assessing the feasibility of operating the No. 7 at Frank R. Lautenberg Station in Secaucus.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg called the proposal ''a promising potential solution'' to a growing travel demand and a dearth of new transit investment, which is ''creating a serious and urgent threat to New York City's economic competitiveness.''
''It would leverage existing investments and be compatible with other proposed projects,'' Mr. Bloomberg said, adding, ''We look forward to continuing to discuss this option, as well as other feasible proposals, with the numerous stakeholders involved.''
The report, prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff, drew on feedback from representatives in the mayor's office, the governors' offices in New York and New Jersey, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and New Jersey Transit -- all of whom would have to work closely to bring about any construction.
But with no precise cost estimate included in the report, the plans attracted immediate skepticism from the transportation authority, which said in a statement, ''We don't see this as an economically viable option.''
That sentiment was echoed last spring, when Joseph J. Lhota, then the chairman of the transportation authority, predicted that sending the subway line to New Jersey was ''not going to happen in anybody's lifetime.''
Proponents of the extension have called a new transit link between the states essential, particularly since Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey scuttled plans in 2010 for a train tunnel under the Hudson River, citing its cost.
A spokesman for Mr. Christie said on Wednesday that the governor was ''intrigued'' when the extension was proposed and would continue to explore its viability.
The report noted that extending the No. 7 train could complement Amtrak's Gateway project, meant to increase tunnel, track and station capacity for the railroad, as well as the authority's plan to extend the No. 7 train to 34th Street and 11th Avenue.

HEADLINE: New Solar Process Gets More Out of Natural Gas

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Energy Department is preparing to test a new way for solar power to make electricity: using the sun's heat to increase the energy content of natural gas.
Researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash., hope by this summer to carry out the test, which entails a process that could cut the amount of natural gas used -- and the greenhouse gasses emitted -- by 20 percent.
''We can reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and the consumer doesn't get hit,'' said Robert Wegeng, the researcher in charge of the project. 
The system is a marriage of chemical engineering and mechanical engineering. The process will work anywhere it is sunny, according to researchers, although it might be more valuable in places where natural gas is relatively expensive, or where a company making electricity would be paid for generating less carbon dioxide.
The project, financed with $4.5 million in federal stimulus money, is still in development, and experts say the technology's costs have yet to be established. The process also is several major steps away from commercial viability.
Using the sun's heat to make electricity is hardly new; as far back as 2007, companies were building plants with parabolic mirrors to boil water into steam and turn a turbine. In Australia, Areva built a plant that helps reduce the amount of coal needed to make electricity by using solar power to preheat the water that the burning coal boiled into steam.
The new system captures solar energy in a chemical form, using the sun's heat to break open the molecules of natural gas (four hydrogen atoms and one carbon atom) and water (two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom) and reshuffle them into something that burns better: carbon monoxide and pure hydrogen. The result also has carbon dioxide, which is inert.
The mixture, called synthesis gas, is a common building block in the chemical industry, but it requires energy to make it, usually from burning natural gas. In the Pacific Northwest design, that energy comes from the sun. Sunlight falls on a mirrored dish that looks a bit like an upturned umbrella, and focuses on a spot where the umbrella handle would be. It heats water and natural gas to 700 degrees Celsius, about 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit. A catalyst breaks the molecules up and the atoms are reassembled.
Laboratory officials say they have improved the efficiency of the process. But they also have introduced a second innovation: before the synthesis gas is sent to a turbine for burning, a new kind of heat exchanger extracts some heat from it. That heat is added to the chemical reactor, further improving the efficiency of the solar side of the process.
If the system starts with one million B.T.U.'s of natural gas, the standard unit for pricing, then the synthesis gas has a value of about 1.25 million B.T.U.'s That means turning $4 of gas into $5.
Michael E. Webber, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Texas at Austin and a co-director of the clean energy incubator there, cautioned that there were still a lot of ''engineering kinks to sort out.'' He called the resulting gas ''a wonderful fuel, but it's a pain in the neck to make.''
The technology might be economical in a place like Japan, where natural gas prices are higher, he said. ''We might as well master the technology and sell it to them,'' he said.
Researchers hope they can find other improvements that will probably be necessary to win commercial acceptance of the technology in North America, where gas prices are low. Mr. Wegeng also said that mass production would drive down prices of the necessary components.
Unlike other forms of solar energy, the hybrid solar/gas plant is intended to supply steady levels of electricity.
''When the sun is shining, you get this solar augment to the fuel,'' said Mr. Wegeng. If clouds roll in, or if the sun sets, then the turbine can burn ordinary natural gas and produce the same amount of electricity. ''You're just using more natural gas,'' he said.

President Obama used the first budget of his second term to sketch out his vision for an economy with more lasting economic growth and less income inequality than the country has experienced in more than a decade.
To pay for a series of programs he deemed crucial to the future and reduce the long-term budget deficit, Mr. Obama also called for cuts to Social Security and Medicare, putting him at odds with many other Democrats. They instead see those programs, created by previous Democratic presidents, as sacrosanct.
Republicans, meanwhile, greeted the budget with criticism, and most parts of it are unlikely to become law. 
But it gave Mr. Obama a chance to lay out his plan for tomorrow's economy, centered on manufacturing, education, alternative energy, infrastructure and science.
''Our economy is adding jobs -- but too many people still cannot find full-time employment. Corporate profits have skyrocketed to all-time highs -- but for more than a decade, wages and incomes have barely budged,'' Mr. Obama wrote in a message addressed to Congress. ''It is our generation's task to reignite the true engine of America's economic growth -- a rising, thriving middle class.''
The budget puts particular emphasis on education and manufacturing. In Mr. Obama's view, both are critical to widespread economic growth.
At the center of his education agenda is a program that would guarantee public preschool for all 4-year-olds from families with low or moderate incomes. To pay for the plan, the administration has proposed an increase in federal cigarette taxes to $1.95 from $1.01 per pack. That would cover the $66 billion federal contribution to the cost of providing preschool over 10 years and the $11 billion cost of home visiting programs for poor families.
The budget also called for a total of $12.5 billion over the next two years to preserve teaching jobs and increase hiring as the economy recovers.
Grover J. Whitehurst, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, noted that the Obama administration was continuing its education policy of using federal money as an incentive to drive its overhaul. Many of the programs require states to comply with administration priorities to get financing.
''This is a very activist budget,'' Mr. Whitehurst said. ''The administration intends to use the mechanism it has used successfully to impose its policy views widely on states and, in some cases, districts.''
On manufacturing, Mr. Obama proposed some small-scale programs, including a $1 billion initiative to build manufacturing ''hubs'' where businesses would partner with universities and federal agencies, and a new tax credit to support communities with manufacturing bases. The White House would also increase federal research and development spending, which benefits manufacturing as well as other industries, like health care and biotechnology, to $143 billion.
Some economists question just how big a driver of job growth manufacturing can be. More companies are bringing jobs back to the United States, in no small part because of real declines in American wages. But even with the recent job growth, there are about two million fewer manufacturing jobs now than there were right before the economy tipped into recession. There are about seven million fewer manufacturing jobs than there were in the late 1970s, when employment in the sector peaked.
Manufacturing simply requires fewer workers than it once did. Factories have become vastly more productive, as processes that were once done laboriously by hand are increasingly done by machine.
As a result, much of the recent job growth has been not in low-wage, low-skill production line work, but in higher-wage, higher-skill positions. But the downside is that manufacturing probably will not be a huge driver of job growth in the coming years, with housing and health care being the more likely bets.

HEADLINE: First Tower at Hudson Yards Site Signs Three Major Occupants

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
There was a time when developers and city officials thought that the city's financial institutions would lead the development of the rail yards on the Far West Side of Manhattan. 
But with the long-awaited signing of three major tenants for the first office tower at Hudson Yards, it is now clear that the city's tech companies and creative firms are coming to the fore of new development projects.
The developers Related Companies and Oxford Property Group announced Wednesday that they had completed the financing for a 47-story tower at the northwest corner of 30th Street and 10th Avenue and signed up three tenants for the building: Coach, the luxury retailer; L'Oreal USA, the beauty products company; and SAP, a leading software company.
''It says a lot about the city's evolving economy,'' said L. Jay Cross, president of Related's Hudson Yards development team. ''It's about much more than financial services today. This represents the emergence of the creative class as a significant part of the city's corporate landscape.''
In recent years, tech firms like Google have settled and grown all along the West Side, where they employ thousands of young people.
At the same time on Wednesday, the developers closed on their deal with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to build a commercial and residential complex over the rail yard bound by 10th and 11th Avenues, between 30th and 33rd Streets.
Five years ago, the transit authority struck a deal with Related for the equivalent of a small city over what is called the Eastern Yard and an adjacent rail site between 11th and 12 Avenues for $1 billion. But progress has been slow, in part, because of the recession. Both sides now plan to close on the western yard a year from now.
Coach first surfaced in 2011 as a potential anchor tenant for the project. It is buying more than 40 percent of the 1.7 million-square-foot tower for its new headquarters. More recently, SAP signed a lease for the top four floors and L'Oreal completed a deal for a new 402,000-square-foot headquarters.
Related is currently building the foundations for that tower and erecting a separate residential building on the south side of 30th Street.
Officials said that the developer planned to start work on the platform for the rest of the Eastern Yard in January in order to reduce the time it will take to erect the second office tower and attract tenants.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: White House Budget Curbs Some Deductions for the Wealthy

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
President Obama is no longer pressing to raise income tax rates on the rich. But that doesn't mean he thinks the wealthy are paying enough in taxes.
Outlining his budget proposals to Congress on Wednesday, Mr. Obama pushed to raise more than $600 billion in new revenue, mainly by curbing deductions for the most affluent taxpayers and forcing million-dollar earners to pay a minimum rate of 30 percent. Under the White House plan, deductions for tax breaks like mortgage interest and contributions to charities would be capped at a maximum rate of 28 percent. The caps would limit the value of the breaks to the top 3 percent of taxpayers who face higher marginal tax rates and generate about $529 billion in additional revenue over 10 years.
Many of the budget proposals, including the limit on deductions, have been made before by the Obama administration. Analysts said Congress was unlikely to adopt them in isolation, but that some Republicans might be open to a broader deal that included measures to close various loopholes in the tax code. 
Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the main part of the tax proposal -- curbing tax deductions for high earners -- could form part of a future deal because they were close to what Republicans have themselves proposed in the past. ''In any agreement that finally comes together this will be the core revenue piece of it,'' he said.
At the same time, the administration formally proposed the so-called Buffett Rule, which would impose a new minimum 30 percent tax rate on households earning incomes above $1 million. It said this could generate an additional $53 billion in revenue over a decade. It is named after Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor, who said in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times that he was paying a lower tax percentage than members of his office.
''This proposal will prevent high-income households from using tax preferences, including low tax rates on capital gains and dividends, to reduce their total tax bills to less than what many middle class families pay,'' according to the White House.
Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center in Washington, said the rule's inclusion in the budget proposal was an indication that the Obama administration was determined ''to make sure that the rich people pay something.''
Tax rates for high-earners were increased this year for the first time in two decades as part of the postelection deal to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff and to help pay for the cost of expanded health care coverage.
Despite those increases, the effective tax burden for the very wealthy remained considerably lower than in past decades, according to Emmanuel Saez, professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. He estimated the recent tax increases could take the total average federal tax rate of the top 0.1 percent of earners to about 40 percent, compared with about 51 percent in 1981. The total tax take from that group had fallen to about 33 percent after the Bush tax cuts.
In its proposal, the Obama administration also proposed a $3 million limit on tax-deferred individual retirement accounts -- another tax measure aimed at wealthy individuals who have been accused of using the accounts to shelter large amounts of money rather than for simple savings.
The White House also proposed, as it has in the past, ending the preferential treatment of private equity and hedge fund profits, known as carried interest. These profits are currently taxed as a long-term capital gain.
The treatment of carried interest has for years been strongly defended by elements of the financial industry, and the White House proposal was quickly attacked on Wednesday by the leading private equity industry trade group. Even supporters of the proposal conceded that it faced stiff political opposition.
''Republicans are never going to sign off on this,'' said Andrew Fieldhouse, an analyst at the Economic Policy Institute.
While most of the proposed tax increases were aimed at higher earners, there were important proposals that would affect all individuals.
The administration proposed higher taxes on tobacco products to pay for early childhood education, raising about $78 billion over a decade.
Its plan for a new cost-of-living formula to reduce future Social Security benefits would also involve indexing income tax brackets to the different measure of inflation. This would effectively increase the money raised by the income tax across the board over the next decade, affecting ''people throughout the income distribution,'' said Donald Marron, director of the Tax Policy Center.
President Obama said he was still committed to lowering the federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent. But he also wanted to close tax loopholes that allow many companies to pay a much lower effective corporate tax rate.
In the budget, he proposed eliminating special tax privileges for the oil, gas and coal industries to save a further $44 billion over 10 years, increased taxation of foreign earnings, and special rules for corporate jets.
The Business Roundtable, a lobbying group that represents major corporations, said it welcomed any cut in corporate taxes, but wanted the reductions to be part of broader reform, and objected to measures that aimed at particular industries.
''Singling out certain industries for taxation is bad tax policy,'' the group said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Seeking Relief, Banks Shift Risk to Murkier Corners

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
Banks have been shedding risky assets to show regulators that they are not as vulnerable as they were during the financial crisis. In some cases, however, the assets don't actually move -- the bank just shifts the risk to another institution.
This trading sleight of hand has been around Wall Street for a while. But as regulators press for banks to be safer, demand for these maneuvers -- known as capital relief trades or regulatory capital trades -- has been growing, especially in Europe.
Citigroup, Credit Suisse and UBS have recently completed such trades. Rather than selling the assets, potentially at a loss, the banks transfer a slice of the risk associated with the assets, usually loans. The buyers are typically hedge funds, whose investors are often pensions that manage the life savings of schoolteachers and city workers. The buyers agree to cover a percentage of losses on these assets for a fee, sometimes 15 percent a year or more.
The loans then look less worrisome -- at least to the bank and its regulator. As a result, the bank does not need to hold as much capital, potentially improving profitability. 
''I think we are going to see more of these type of trades in the U.S. given the demands by regulators to hold more capital,'' said Kevin White, a former executive at Lehman Brothers who founded Spring Hill Capital Partners, which is working with banks to structure regulatory capital trades.
Citigroup, Credit Suisse and UBS declined to comment on their trades. Privately, however, bankers acknowledge that while these trades may be pushing risk into a less regulated corner of Wall Street, they also point out that the risk is being moved into a less systemic part of the financial industry than the big banks.
The rule-writing going on as part of the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul may prevent some of these trades, but bankers say this will simply force them to structure the trades differently.
Some regulators say they are concerned that in some instances these transactions are not actually taking risk off bank balance sheets. For instance, a financial institution may end up lending money to clients so they can invest in one of these trades, a move that could leave a bank with even more risk on its books.
Critics point to other reasons to worry. Most of these trades are structured as credit-default swaps, a derivative that resembles insurance. These kinds of swaps pushed the insurance giant American International Group to the brink of collapse in September 2008. Another red flag is that banks often use special-purpose vehicles located abroad, frequently in the Cayman Islands, to structure these trades.
''These trades allow the banks to go to regulators and say the risk is gone,'' said Anat R. Admati, a professor of finance at Stanford University. ''But it's not gone at all; it's just been pushed into a murky corner of the market.''
The trades can take many forms, but typically a bank will buy a credit-default swap on some of its loans from a special-purpose vehicle, which is financed by outside investors. If all goes well, the investors receive an annual fee for taking on this risk. But in the worst case, where the loans in the portfolio default, the insurance that the bank has bought kicks in and covers its losses. The investors on the other side are wiped out.
A number of American investment firms like Spring Hill Capital Partners have been trying to find investors for these deals. Glenn Blasius, another Lehman alumni, said he was raising money for the Ovid Regulatory Capital Relief Fund, which will invest in these trades.
The Orchard Global Capital Group has raised a fund to invest in regulatory capital trades, and the New Mexico Educational Retirement Board is among its investors.
In December 2011, Allan Martin, a representative with an investment consultant firm that advises pension funds, met with the New Mexican pension fund over investing through Orchard in a regulatory capital trade, according to the minutes of a board meeting.
Mr. Martin explained to the retirement board that these transactions had been created to allow the banks ''to continue to hold the assets on their balance sheet'' while selling some of the risk.
At the meeting, Jan Goodwin, executive director of the New Mexico Educational Retirement Board, asked about the use of credit-default swaps, which got A.I.G. into trouble. Mr. Martin admitted that the Orchard deal ''has a little flavor of that'' but said Orchard had done ''a great deal'' of due diligence on the underlying collateral, something he said A.I.G. often didn't do.
In an interview, Mr. Martin said that ''a lot of clients ask how this is different than A.I.G.,'' and he said it was because Orchard had a better understanding of the risks involved in the assets it was dealing with.
An executive with Orchard did not respond to requests for comment.
Many major banks have structured these trades. In March, Credit Suisse completed a transaction named Lucerne, after the Swiss lake, in which it bought insurance on a 5 billion Swiss franc portfolio of small and medium-size Swiss business loans, according to people who were briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak on the record because they had signed confidentiality agreements.
Credit Suisse agreed to take a small percentage of the losses, and it lined up American and European investors willing, for an annual fee of roughly 10 percent, to assume the rest of the risk, these people say.
Citigroup cut a deal at the end of last year with the private equity firm Blackstone Group, which insured the big bank against a portion of the losses on a roughly $1 billion pool of shipping loans. The bank used a special-purpose vehicle in Ireland called Cloverie to facilitate the trade, according to people briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak on the record.
For its part, Blackstone put up about $100 million, or 12 percent of the value of the shipping portfolio, to cover any possible losses. If things go well, Blackstone will receive a return of about 15 percent, these people say. If the shipping loans go sour, Citigroup gets Blackstone's money and the private equity firm loses its cash.
Credit Suisse received capital relief on the Lucerne deal, although the exact amount is not known. Citigroup was able to reduce by roughly 90 percent the amount of capital it needed to set aside to cover losses on the shipping portfolio.
One Citigroup executive with knowledge of this trade but not authorized to speak on the record said it was structured to reduce Citigroup's exposure to shipping loans. The fact that it reduced the amount of capital the bank had to hold was ''an added bonus.''
UBS also recently completed a regulatory capital trade, selling a piece of the risk on a portfolio of roughly 100 corporate loans, according to people who reviewed the transaction but who declined to speak publicly because they had signed confidentiality agreements.
And Citigroup is marketing a second risk capital trade involving shipping loans, according to people briefed on the matter.
''These trades are a good thing,'' said Richard Robb, a New York money manager whose firm, Christofferson, Robb & Company, has been structuring regulatory capital trades for more than a decade. ''The best way to protect the banks against this risk is to move it outside the banking system to wealthy institutions. No one will be coming to bail out our company or our investors if these trades backfire.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Hollande Creates a Prosecutor for Fraud and Vows to End Tax Havens

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER and DAVID JOLLY; Andrew Higgins contributed reporting from Brussels.

 BODY:
PARIS -- Buffeted by a political scandal, a stagnant economy and angry public reaction to an investigative report about secret offshore bank accounts, President François Hollande on Wednesday announced the creation of a position of special prosecutor to pursue cases of corruption and tax fraud, and vowed to eradicate tax havens ''in Europe and the world.''
As he spoke, one of those tax havens, Luxembourg, announced that it would bow to pressure from its European allies and begin forwarding the details of its foreign clients' accounts to their home governments. Luxembourg, with only half a million people and a banking sector more than 20 times the size of its gross domestic product, is one of Europe's largest financial centers and has been compared to Cyprus, a fellow member of the euro zone that, until recently, had a huge banking sector fueled by foreign money. 
Luxembourg's announcement came a day after five of the biggest European countries -- Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain -- agreed to exchange banking data and create their own automatic tax data exchange. That mechanism would be modeled on the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, passed by Congress in 2010 to track the overseas assets of Americans who might be dodging taxes.
The European governments said they hoped that the information exchange would not only help in catching and deterring tax evaders but also provide a ''template'' for a future, wider multilateral agreement. In a joint letter released Tuesday, they urged the European Union commissioner responsible for taxation, Algirdas Semeta, to work to get all 27 members of the European Union to sign up.
The announcements come a week after the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists announced that it had obtained confidential information relating to tens of thousands of offshore bank accounts and shell companies. The leaked data, which centered on the Caribbean and especially the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands, embarrassed European governments, including Luxembourg, by showing how wealthy citizens routinely hide assets, sometimes illegally, and avoid paying taxes by setting up offshore companies.
The report has set off a scramble by governments to calm public anger over widespread tax dodging by the rich when governments are cutting budgets and calling on citizens to pay higher taxes.
The journalist consortium, a project of the Center for Public Integrity, disclosed confidential information on more than 120,000 offshore companies and trusts and nearly 130,000 individuals and agents, including 4,000 Americans. But the consortium has refused requests by governments for access to the files, saying that it is not an arm of law enforcement. Newspapers working with the group, including Le Monde of France and Le Soir of Belgium, have said they will not hand over data to the authorities.
Britain has been especially embarrassed, because many of the accounts are in the Virgin Islands, the Cook Islands and the Cayman Islands, all British overseas territories. But British officials insist that London cannot tell the local governments what to do. The British cited new arrangements with the Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey to exchange financial and tax information, and said London was already ''in discussions'' with its various overseas territories.
Mr. Hollande's announcement, made on national television, was prompted by a domestic political crisis over official morality in a country with weak rules for public disclosure of the assets of politicians and ministers. In addition to creating the prosecutor position, he ordered cabinet ministers to disclose their finances and asked legislators to do the same. He also promised to create an independent authority to monitor the assets and possible conflicts of interest of senior officials and legislators.
Mr. Hollande said French banks would be required to declare all their global subsidiaries, adding, ''I will not hesitate to consider any country that refuses to fully cooperate with France as a tax haven.''
Mr. Hollande, a Socialist, has been in office less than a year, but his job approval ratings in opinion polls are at a record low, and there is a growing militancy in the opposition against him from both the far left and the center-right. With headlines calling him ''Mr. Weak'' and asking whether he is ''up to the task,'' Mr. Hollande and his aides see Wednesday's announcement as a means to assert authority, change the conversation and regain momentum.
The scandal over Jérôme Cahuzac, the budget minister who lied about having undeclared bank accounts overseas, has gone to the heart of the Socialists' claim to be a scrupulously honest and transparent alternative to the previous administration, led byNicolas Sarkozy. Mr. Cahuzac was fired and expelled from the party, but that the minister in charge of fighting tax fraud had committed it himself has been deeply damaging.
On Wednesday, the European Union issued a report warning Spain and Slovenia about dangerous macroeconomic imbalances, but it offered serious concerns about France as well. France's resilience to external shocks is ''diminishing'' and its medium-term growth prospects are ''increasingly hampered by long-standing imbalances,'' the report said, noting that France's share of European Union exports declined by 11.2 percent from 2006 to 2011, while rising labor costs have damaged competitiveness.
The move by Luxembourg toward disclosure leaves Austria as the lone holdout in the European Union. It pays a 35 percent withholding tax on the interest income of accounts held by foreigners in Austrian banks to their country of residence, but refuses to disclose the account holders' identities.
Luxembourg acknowledged that it was negotiating a bilateral information exchange with the United States as part of the 2010 Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, which was a crucial development in its decision to come clean with Europe.
''The heart of it is that they'll be providing account data to the United States,'' said Ben Jones, a tax expert in London at Eversheds, a global law firm. ''If they get to that point, they can hardly continue keeping it from Europe.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Flaw in Obama's Budget Approach

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: In his budget, President Obama should have made a stronger case for what he would like to accomplish, then found the means to pay for it, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
From the White House, we need a clearer articulation of what the federal government does and why this makes sense. Instead, the president has allowed the debate to become dominated by excessive paranoia about deficits and by extremist demands to shrink government in a radical and inappropriate manner.
This tension reflects the three ways to think about medium-term fiscal policy - the relationship between government spending and revenue over the next decade or two. You can figure out the budget deficit that it is possible to finance by selling government bonds, and use this as your basic constraint. Or you can stipulate the maximum acceptable level of government revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product, and work out the implications of that. Or you can define what government should do, and figure out how to finance these activities in a responsible manner. 
The first way of thinking becomes paramount when countries have any form of serious fiscal crisis. For example, in some parts of Europe today - what is called the euro zone periphery - the market appetite for government debt is very limited. As a result, the governments have to think hard about the deficits that they can finance through any combination of assistance from other governments - either directly or through an indirect mechanism, such as the International Monetary Fund - and through the market. 
All countries need to pay some attention to the sustainable level of government deficit (this is a flow, best thought of as the difference between government spending and revenue in a year). This is what adds up to government debt (a stock of outstanding obligations at any point in time, for example at the end of the year). But countries also differ considerably in the extent to which market pressures force them to make bringing down the budget deficit a priority.
Greece and Portugal have a fiscal crisis. They need to cut spending or raise revenue in a hurry. (Of course, if their euro zone neighbors are willing to be more generous, that will make their fiscal adjustments less painful.)
The United States does not need to take any such actions on a precipitate basis. The demand for its government debt around the world remains high. Despite the extreme assertions - or wishful thinking - from apocalyptic commentators, reports of the death of United States Treasury obligations have been greatly exaggerated.
Chinese officials like to announce that their country intends to develop its currency, the renminbi, as a reserve asset available to investors in a way that will rival the United States dollar. No doubt this is their intention, but achieving this goal is not so easy. 
First China needs to reform its financial sector, then it must increase the protections afforded to overseas investors. When the going gets tough, who will get the rainy-day cash you stashed in China - you or the Chinese authorities?
The second view of budgets holds that it is of paramount importance to cap the size of the federal government budget relative to the economy. Republicans on Capitol Hill discuss a potential cap of around 17 or 18 percent of G.D.P. - and a significant number of them would like to enshrine this limit in a constitutional amendment.
A major problem with this approach is that the United States population is aging. As this demographic shift occurs, if we maintain social insurance - Social Security and Medicare, primarily - at or close to current levels, there is a natural tendency for government transfers to increase relative to the size of the economy.
This is not because of any sinister plot, but rather some simple mathematics. We insure each other, fairly modestly, against outliving our assets or our families' ability to support us. As we expect to live longer today than did people in the past, we each expect to receive more benefits (this is a statement about probabilities; of course, we do not know which of us will live to be 95 or require what kind of medical attention when we reach 85). 
This is an insurance policy, mediated by the government, the value of which has increased - and we should pay higher premiums.
If we pay more in and receive more when we retire, this will increase government revenue and increase government spending. But if you cap government revenue at 17 or 18 percent of G.D.P., that cannot happen. If that cap really binds, the value of social insurance per person must shrink over time.
The recent budget prepared by Paul Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Budget Committee, would make drastic cuts in Medicaid, Medicare and other programs in order to reduce the budget deficit to zero by 2023 without increasing taxes. This budget merges insistence on immediately eliminating the budget deficit - as if this were Greece - with a strong desire to shrink the size of government.
The third approach is to figure out what you want government to do - in terms of defense, social insurance, infrastructure investments, assistance for poor children and anything else. Once you know that, you know how much revenue you need - and you should also figure out the least distorting way to raise revenue. (Or you can increase taxes on activities that you want to discourage, like smoking, for example, because of how that affects people's health and drives up health care costs for everyone.)
When there is a budget deficit - as in the United States today - this can be brought under control in a responsible and measured manner. Limiting government spending while ensuring a broad tax base is entirely consistent with achieving robust economic growth over the coming decades.
But who talks about the budget in those terms? The recent Senate budget proposal contained some elements of this alternative approach, but it's hard to say that this framing of the budget issues came through loud and clear.
Unfortunately, President Obama, in his budget proposal unveiled on Wednesday, did not reinforce the need to think first and foremost about what we want government to do. Rather than laying out any kind of vision for what the government should do over the next decade or two, the president put forward what he asserts is a viable compromise with the Republicans - some tax increases and some cuts to Social Security (by changing how cost-of-living adjustments are calculated, the real value of future pensions would be reduced).
I sincerely doubt that such a compromise is possible - Congressional Republicans have dug in too deeply against higher taxes, in terms of higher rates and any package of measures that would produce a net increase in federal government revenues relative to the size of the economy.
People who don't like social insurance - or perhaps just dislike any role for government - have been preparing for this moment for a long time. They have spent many years trying to convince people that there is an immediate fiscal crisis and that government must shrink.
Social insurance is under severe political pressure. The House Republicans want to phase it out for many people - and President Obama appears willing to acquiesce.
The White House should instead focus on explaining to people how social insurance works - and why it offers irreplaceable value. There was no affordable private health insurance for 85-year-old Americans before Medicare was created. And there will be none when Medicare is swept away.

HIGHLIGHT: Women&#8217;s increasing role in Syria&#8217;s conflict; questions about the overhaul of Indonesia&#8217;s military; new Auschwitz prosecutions; oil in Kurdistan; and a dramatic end to Malaga&#8217;s Champions League appearance. 

 BODY:
 NEWS Of all the mysteries surrounding the emergence of a new and deadly strain of avian influenza around Shanghai, one of the biggest is why China's hundreds of medical and veterinary labs did not spot the problem sooner - or if they did, why it was not disclosed. Keith Bradsher reports from Hong Kong. 
A long-debated move by Western nations to expand support for Syria's opposition gained momentum on Wednesday, with the United States poised to increase its nonlethal aid to rebel groups and pressure building to lift a European Union embargo on sending arms to Syria. Michael R. Gordon reports from London, and Mark Landler from Washington.
As the Syrian uprising drags into its third year, women are taking an increasingly active role in the conflict, on both sides. Eva Sohlman reports from Antakya, Turkey.
Buffeted by a political scandal, a stagnant economy and angry public reaction to an investigative report about secret offshore bank accounts, President François Hollande on Wednesday announced the creation of a position of special prosecutor to pursue cases of corruption and tax fraud, and vowed to eradicate tax havens "in Europe and the world." Stephen Erlanger and David Jolly report from Paris.
A deadly prison raid by soldiers in Indonesia has raised questions about what progress has been made in overhauling the military since the collapse of President Suharto's rule in 1998. Joe Cochrane reports from Jakarta.
Germany's Central Office for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes compiled a list of 50 former guards who worked at the concentration camp in Poland and might be brought to court. Chris Cottrell reports from Berlin.
For three days since she died in a London hotel suite at the age of 87, an outpouring of sympathy, respect and reverence from those who have hailed Mrs. Thatcher as Britain's greatest peacetime prime minister has been accompanied by a parallel, and deeply antagonistic, critique. John F. Burns and Alan Cowell report from London.
Genel Energy, the oil exploration company headed by Tony Hayward, the former chief executive of BP, announced Wednesday that it had made a significant oil find in Kurdistan. Stanley Reed reports from London.
A high-level British minister warned businesses Wednesday that the government might have difficulty maintaining its opposition to quotas for women on company boards after a report showed that the steady advance in female representation at the highest levels of British corporate life might have ground to a halt in the last six months. Stephen Castle reports from London.
 ARTS As Venezuela rushes toward an election on Sunday to replace its deceased president, Hugo Chávez, the opposition has an unlikely musical ringer on its side: Willie Colón, the Bronx-born salsa star with Puerto Rican roots. William Neuman reports from Caracas.
 SPORTS Dortmund scored two goals in stoppage time in its Champions League match, allowing the German club to advance to the semifinals. Rob Hughes reports from London.

HEADLINE: Part 4: Answers to Your Questions on Making the Final College Decision

BYLINE: MARIE BIGHAM and MARK KANTROWITZ


HIGHLIGHT: Marie Bigham, a veteran college counselor, and Mark Kantrowitz, an expert on paying for college, answer select reader questions about where to enroll. Part 4. 

 BODY:
 The Choice has invited Marie Bigham, a former college admissions officer and veteran college counselor, and Mark Kantrowitz, a financial aid expert, to answer your questions about comparing financial aid offers and deciding where to enroll in the blog's virtual Guidance Office, a forum for college applicants and their families seeking expert advice. 
The moderated Q. and A. session, which began Monday, will continue throughout the week.
In this fourth installment of answers, the panelists respond to questions about comparing specific schools, whether parents should forbid their children to choose an expensive college, and work-study options. 
Some questions and answers have been edited, including for length and style. - Tanya Abrams
 N.Y.U., Northeastern or Rutgers? 
 Q. 
 What is best for a chemical engineering major? Going to New York University and taking out $80,000 to $90,000 in loans for a five-year program with bachelor's degrees in chemistry and biomedical engineering? Going to Northeastern and taking out $25,000 to $30,000 in loans for a chemical engineering honors, five-year co-op program? Or going to Rutgers, no loans, for its chemical engineering honors program with a minor or extracurricular program in television and film? Please advise.
- Campbell
 A. 
 Mr. Kantrowitz: Assuming the median starting salary of about $66,000 for a chemical engineering major, the debt from an N.Y.U. degree would involve monthly loan payments of as much as 20 percent of the graduate's gross income over a 10-year repayment term. This compares with up to 7 percent for the Northeastern degree and no debt for the Rutgers degree.
If student loan payments consume more than 15 percent of your income, you will struggle to make the payments and may even default on your debt. Aim to devote less than 10 percent of your income to repaying your student loans. Total debt at graduation should be less than your expected annual starting salary, and ideally a lot less.
Given that these are all good colleges with good programs, the choice is simple: go to the college that will put you in the least debt. That will give you more flexibility in your employment choices, allowing you to pick a job that is a better fit for your career goals, even if it pays less. Also, students who graduate with no debt are twice as likely to go on to graduate school as students who graduate with some debt.
 Ms. Bigham: You have so many great options that, beyond cost, I'm not sure that one outweighs the other. Do you want two degrees but lots of debt? Do you want an honors program plus co-op, which can lead to great job opportunities, and some debt? Or do you want honors and no debt? Are you a Yankees fan or a Red Sox fan?
Personally, I'm a big fan of co-op programs like the one at Northeastern because you get valuable and marketable job experience before graduating. Before making your decision, ask each college if hands-on work experience, like the Northeastern co-op program, is available to all students. Ask if there are opportunities for engineering students to get involved with television and film. I bet that you can get very similar educational experiences at all three outstanding colleges.
 Parental Vetoes 
 Q. 
 This is both a philosophical and a practical question. My son is deciding between two out-of-state schools, both known for the major he wants to pursue, engineering. One is less expensive and is offering him a scholarship. The other isn't offering him a penny, and that means he'll come out with twice the debt. Of course, he likes that one more, despite us airing our concerns. As parents to an almost 18-year-old, do you say no or do you let him go where he wants and shoulder that financial burden for years to come?
- Water polo mom
 A. 
 Ms. Bigham: I can think of many times that my parents told me no, over my protests, for something that I really wanted.
Sometimes what I wanted was trivial, like going to a party or extending my curfew. But I recall a very serious conversation with my parents about what they could and could not afford for college. They made it clear to me that they would not jeopardize their long-term financial health by dipping into retirement savings, nor would they allow me to jeopardize my own by taking out too much debt for college when I had less expensive options at hand.
It can't be fun to tell your child no, but as the adult, you have a longer view of life and how significant debt could hinder your son in the future.
Talk with your son about the implications of having oversize college debt versus minimal debt. Talk about his potential salary and how much debt repayment would take from that salary. Talk about graduate school and how that could add to his debt load. This is a great opportunity to teach him about finances and decision making.
 Mr. Kantrowitz: Parents are often torn between doing what is in their child's best interest and giving in to their child's dreams. There are rarely any easy answers.
Sometimes it helps to prepare a decision matrix in which the options are listed in the rows, with one column for positive outcomes and one column for negative outcomes. This can help clarify your thinking and your son's thinking.
If the negative consequences of one choice are very harmful, like graduating with an unaffordable level of debt, you need to step in and stop your son from making a bad decision. Protecting him from harm is your responsibility.
Consideration of college costs is also a good opportunity to engage in some financial literacy training. Go beyond the rule of thumb that total student loan debt at graduation should be less than the annual starting salary. Have your son look up the average starting salary for his preferred major. Then have him create a budget based on that salary, typical expenses and the monthly loan payments under standard 10-year repayment for each college. This will help make the choices more tangible.
Also have him calculate the difference in total debt at graduation and ask whether his preferred college is worth the extra debt. If he reaches the right decision on his own, he will be happier than if you decide for him.
 Financial Aid After Freshman Year 
 Q. 
 My daughter was accepted at Cooper Union. Do you think they will guarantee her a tuition-free education for the next four years? Her financial aid letter does state that she received the $160,000 award. Does this statement mean a lock-in?
- Phil
 Q. 
 I am a high school senior who has been accepted to a few colleges. Part of the financial aid for one college is a need-based scholarship that they say does not need to be paid back. Can I count on receiving this same scholarship/aid for all four years?
- Julie
 A. 
 Mr. Kantrowitz: Cooper Union is one of a handful of colleges that offer free tuition. It has been experiencing some financial difficulties and will begin charging tuition for graduate students in fall 2013, but undergraduate tuition for this year's incoming class will remain free for all four years.
Even with the free tuition, however, students are still responsible for room and board, books and supplies, and miscellaneous living expenses that can total about $20,000 a year. So free tuition doesn't necessarily mean that the college is entirely free. But with financial aid, the average net price is about $17,000 a year, much less than at other private, nonprofit colleges in New York.
Most colleges do not guarantee that the student will receive a similar amount of financial aid in subsequent years. Students apply for financial aid one year at a time, and the amount of aid depends on the college's policies and changes in the family's financial circumstances.
About half of all colleges practice front-loading of grants, which means that the mix of grants and loans will be more generous for the freshman year than for the sophomore, junior and senior years. The net price for the freshman year may be much lower than the net price as an upperclassman.
Ask the financial aid office whether the college front-loads grants. Will you get a similar amount of grant aid in subsequent years if your financial circumstances stay the same? If not, how much will the grants decrease?
If you do not get a clear answer, try asking several juniors and seniors how their grants compare with those they received as freshmen. 
 Ms. Bigham: You should contact the financial aid offices at the colleges you are considering to ask about this practice of front-loading aid. My experience is that aid packages remain more or less stable, unless your family's financial circumstances change significantly.
Unfortunately, some colleges will reduce your aid package after your first year, or change the grant (the free money) to a loan (the money you pay back). Keep in mind that you will have to reapply for aid each year.
I certainly hope that Cooper Union can continue its practice of offering free tuition to undergraduates. Many congratulations for being admitted there.
 Harvard, Princeton or Williams? 
 Q. 
 I am a high school senior and have been accepted to Harvard, Princeton and Williams, much to my pleasant surprise. Needless to say, I feel incredibly blessed but now am having a painful time making a decision.
Since I am a low-income student, I received near-full rides at all three schools, so financial aid should not be the determining factor in my decision. I am largely undecided as to my major but am thinking about engineering, economics or environmental science. Coming from a highly competitive high school with limited course selections and worn-out teachers, I value a solid liberal arts education with engaging and friendly professors focused on undergrad teaching and a collaborative, rather than competitive, atmosphere. Also, I am not a big sports/Greek person, so those things need not be a factor in considering the social vibe of the school. Thank you so much for any advice!
- Sarah H. Lee
 A. 
 Ms. Bigham: First of all, a million congrats! Clearly you are a talented and interesting student who could add tremendously to a college community.
The best thing you can do to decide among these superb choices is to visit, if possible. Ask the colleges if they can finance your visit.
All three of these colleges are amazing, but they are also very different. Do you prefer a rural setting (Williams), a suburban setting (Princeton) or an urban setting (Harvard)? Do you want only small classes, or a variety of class sizes?
Ask all of the colleges about internship and research opportunities. Ask current students about the social vibe and about the collaborative versus competitive nature of the colleges. My favorite question to ask current students is: "If you had to do it all over again, would you still choose this college? Why or why not?"
If you can't visit the campuses, ask the admissions offices to connect you with current students via phone, e-mail or social media.
Read the student newspapers, which can be found online. These can give you a glimpse into the day-to-day life at the college: the controversies, the celebrations, campus speakers, student events, even crime reports.
Most of all, be proud of yourself for making it to the end of this process. You can't make a bad choice!
 Mr. Kantrowitz: Go to M.I.T. instead.
All kidding aside, you don't have any wrong choices. You will get an excellent education at any of these colleges.
Which college you choose will depend largely on your personal tastes. Visit the colleges when classes are in session to see how you like the atmosphere and how well you fit in. Talk to many students. Stay overnight in the dormitories. Read the student newspaper. Try to understand the college's culture and traditions.
Offer to buy a random student lunch if she agrees to tell you everything that is wrong with the place. Read student reviews of the colleges on Web sites like College Prowler and College Confidential. 
 Work-Study Aid 
 Q. 
 Our son was accepted to an Ivy. Part of the financial aid package includes two jobs, each 10 to 12 hours a week (one work-study, one not). I am concerned that working 20-24 hours every week is a lot if he wants to do well at such a school, and would limit opportunities to do other things. Any thoughts?
- Chris
 A. 
 Ms. Bigham: I'm a big fan of the Federal Work-Study Program and work-study jobs in general.
For students who want or need to work during college, a Federal Work-Study job is often better than a job off campus. Work-study jobs can sometimes be tied to your major or career interest. Also, colleges understand the ebb and flow of a student's life and may be more flexible when you need time to study.
My students have reported that having a work-study job helps them organize their time, and in some cases, it gives them built-in study time.
That said, two work-study jobs that equal a part-time job is excessive. Students should be students first, if that's financially possible. Ask the financial aid office if it intended to give your student two jobs, because I haven't seen that happen before.
 Mr. Kantrowitz: Working more than 12 hours a week is excessive. Some student employment will improve academic performance by forcing you to learn time-management skills. But working more than 12 hours a week takes away too much time from academics.
Based on data from a 2009 follow-up to a 2003-4 longitudinal study on beginning postsecondary students, 75 percent of students enrolled in bachelor's degree programs who worked one to 12 hours a week during their freshman year graduated with a bachelor's degree in six years, compared with 69 percent of students who did not work.
But graduation rates declined significantly with additional hours of work:

        
1-12 hours a week: 75 percent graduated in six years
        
13-24 hours a week: 60 percent
        
25-39 hours a week: 49 percent
        
40 or more hours a week: 32 percent
In other words, students who work full-time are half as likely to graduate as students who work 12 hours or less. 
Ask the college's financial aid office why it awarded your son two jobs, and express your concern about half-time employment making it more difficult to schedule classes and focus on academics. Perhaps they made an error in assembling your financial aid package, or perhaps they assumed that you would accept only one job.
If you have to choose one of the two jobs, I recommend the Federal Work-Study job. Federal Work-Study earnings are exempt from FICA taxes (but still subject to income taxes) and do not count against future aid eligibility. 
If the financial aid officials say they intended to award two jobs, ask them to replace one of the jobs with grants.
 Ms. Bigham and Mr. Kantrowitz are no longer taking questions. However, if you would like to further discuss financial aid and choosing a college, please use the comments box below.

HEADLINE: Citigroup Sells Turkish Unit as It Pares Global Operations

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Citigroup agreed on Thursday to sell its consumer banking business in Turkey to the local lender DenizBank as it continues to reduce its operations outside of the United States. 

 BODY:
LONDON - Citigroup agreed on Thursday to sell its consumer banking business in Turkey to the local lender DenizBank in its latest move to offload international assets. 
DenizBank, which was itself acquired by the Russian firm Sberbank for $3.5 billion last year, will acquire assets worth around $650 million and customer deposits totaling $800 million, according to a company statement. The price for the deal was not disclosed.
Shares in the Turkish bank rose 9.5 percent in afternoon trading in Istanbul on Thursday.
The move by Citigroup to sell its Turkish consumer banking unit comes as the financial giant is paring back its operations outside of the United States. 
In December, Citigroup announced plans to pull back or sell its consumer banking businesses in several emerging markets, including Pakistan, Romania and Paraguay.
The efforts are part of a plan by Citigroup's new chief executive, Michael L. Corbat, to cut yearly costs by $1.1 billion by 2014. The plan also includes 11,000 layoffs across the bank's global operations. 
As Western banks revamp their businesses in the wake of the financial crisis, many are reducing their worldwide footprint in countries where they cannot compete with local rivals. 
The British bank HSBC also has announced a series of disposals in recent months, particularly in developing economies like Pakistan and Colombia.
The deal for Citigroup's Turkish consumer banking business is expected to close in the third quarter of the year.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Budget

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today&#8217;s Times, plus a look at what&#8217;s happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times: 
What does it mean to be "a progressive Democrat in the age of austerity"? Jackie Calmes writes that it's the debate President Obama set off Wednesday with his budget proposal for 2014, in which he puts cost-saving changes to Medicare and Social Security - signature Democratic entitlement programs - on the table with demands for concessions from Republicans on taxes and spending. The president had dinner with a group of Senate Republicans on Wednesday night to press his case on the budget, gun control and immigration.
A Democratic senator has reached a deal with a Republican colleague that will allow the full Senate to begin considering legislation requiring background checks for gun purchases, Jennifer Steinhauer writes in explaining the deal, how it came together and the outlook in the Senate. 
As advocates for an overhaul of immigration laws rallied on Capitol Hill and around the country, an evenly split bipartisan group of eight senators announced a legislative deal on Wednesday. Julia Preston and Ashley Parker explain a central tenet of the proposed bill that would link a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants to enforcement goals for border control.
The nomination process for Sri Srinivasan to serve on the powerful federal appeals court in Washington is going much smoother than it did for Caitlin Halligan, who withdrew from consideration in March. Jeremy W. Peters reports that Mr. Srinivasan appears headed toward easy confirmation after he breezed through a Senate committee hearing on Wednesday, despite differences between Democrats and Republicans over using the filibuster on judicial nominees.
The Postal Service is blaming Congress for forcing the agency toshelve plans to cut mail delivery to six days a week from five, a move it said was necessary to cut costs, Emmarie Huetteman writes.

HEADLINE: Speak Up, the Internet Can't Hear You

BYLINE: DAVID STREITFELD


HIGHLIGHT: People expressing their opinion on the Internet are not exactly in short supply. But there is an increasing sense that the time is ripe to develop and implement technology that allows for commenting across sites. Maybe it will make us better people. Or drive us crazy. 

 BODY:
The Internet might have looked very different than it does today. When Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina were building Mosaic, the browser that practically created the Web in 1993, they included the ability to annotate any page. Discussions immediately sprang up. Butthey quickly realizedthat the server to host the annotations would have had to scale to enormous size, which was not practical. So they took the feature out.
What would the Web have looked like if annotation had managed to stay in? Maybe a million conversations would have bloomed, and some of the furious divides that plague this country would have been bridged. Or maybe it just would have been a deafening free-for-all, cranking up all the cranks. 
Twenty years later, there is a vast amount of discussion on the Web, much of it in the form of comments and reviews. But it is generally hosted by corporations - Facebook, Google, Amazon - that are selling ads or products, which kind of undermines the democratic spirit of give and take. When the companies fail, like Myspace did, the content simply goes away.
Maybe that is why there is now a renewed appetite for exploring ways of facilitating commenting across the Internet that give more control to individuals. Many of those interested in seeing that happen - including start-ups, academics, libraries and early adopters - came to San Francisco this week forthe I Annotate conference. It was a discussion about discussion.
"Why now?" asked Dan Whaley, founder ofHypothes.is, a start-up that hosted the conference with help from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. "The Web is more mature. Browsers are better. There's the potential of interoperability, of openness. We can create a parallel Web that is a conversation about the world as it found through the Web."
An overlay of commentary would improve discovery. One scientist at the conference said that in biomedicine, there were 150 to 250 new articles a week, which means that if everyone in the field read them, they would never have time to do any research. Annotations could help drive the best papers to the forefront of attention.
Give Mr. Whaley, who in 1995 was a co-founder of the first travel company on the Web, credit for thinking big. Hypothes.is is no mere app that helps you buy some trinket. It wants to create an incentive for people to do their work to the highest standard, and make it harder to spread work that does not meet that standard. A preliminary version of its annotation system was introduced at the conference; a bigger roll-out will happen at the end of the year.
Many start-ups have tried to develop commenting systems, as Hypothes.is readily acknowledges. A prominent effort during the first Internet boom was Third Voice. It offered free software that allowed users to essentially place sticky notes on Web sites. Only other Third Voice users could see the comments, which were hosted on the start-up's computers.
Web site owners did not like it, for obvious reasons; users were hard to control. Third Voice failed in 2001, but some of the issues that plagued it - How do you encourage useful comments while restricting trolls? When does criticism boil over into attacks? - are still around.
One thing Hypothes.is has going for it is that it is a nonprofit organization. "If you want to create a conversation layer over the entire Web, you can't own it," Mr. Whaley said. "People won't trust it."
But then, there are all sorts of ways to do annotations, including more targeted ventures. One of the start-ups presenting at the conference was RapGenius.com, which is getting both traction and attention. It started out as a music commentary site, where fans annotated the lyrics. Then the musicians started showing up to annotate their lyrics. Now it has branched out to other documents, like "The Great Gatsby," the manifesto of the Los Angeles police officer-turned-killer Christopher Dorner and Archibald MacLeish's poem "Ars Poetica," which is annotated in images.
"We're developing a social network that is specifically around close-reading texts," said Jeremy Dean of Rap Genius.
He was peppered with questions. What about copyright? What about trolls? Once a text is annotated, is there less desire to work on it by a new crop of readers? That might ultimately make the site rather static. And what is the business model here?
"I'm a Ph.D. in English," Mr. Dean said. "I just started working here a month ago. I don't have a great answer to that." Nevertheless, Silicon Valley is excited: Marc Andreessen has invested $15 million in it. Annotating's moment could finally be here.

HEADLINE: Ex-KPMG Partner Is Charged in Insider Case

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Federal prosecutors revealed a brazen two-year insider trading scheme involving Scott London, a former senior partner at the accounting giant KPMG, and a longtime friend. 

 BODY:
 11:05 p.m. | Updated 
The payments came in various forms. There were envelopes of $100 bills wrapped in $10,000 bundles. There were expensive tickets to a Bruce Springsteen concert. There was a 2011 Rolex Cosmograph Daytona valued at $12,000.
Bryan Shaw, a jeweler in the Los Angeles area, bestowed these gifts upon Scott I. London, a senior executive at the accounting giant KPMG. It was the least that he could do for Mr. London, who routinely gave him secret information about KPMG's clients. Mr. Shaw traded on the tips, earning more than $1 million in illegal profits. 
 Prosecutors filed criminal charges against Mr. London on Thursday, laying bare a brazen two-year insider trading scheme. Mr. Shaw was not criminally charged, but named in a related civil action brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In recent days, both men have publicly confessed to their misconduct.
"As a leader at a major accounting firm, London's conduct was an egregious violation of his ethical and professional duties," said Michele Wein Layne, director of the S.E.C.'s Los Angeles office.
Early this year, Mr. Shaw turned against Mr. London after investigators confronted him with evidence of insider trading. He became a government informant, recording telephone conversations and in-person meetings to help the authorities build a case against Mr. London.
"He viewed it as an unfortunate but necessary part of the process to making things right," said Nathan J. Hochman, a lawyer for Mr. Shaw. Last month, Mr. Shaw participated in a sting operation to ensnare Mr. London. The F.B.I. provided Mr. Shaw with $5,000 in cash, which was placed in a manila envelope and then wrapped in a black paper bag. Mr. Shaw met Mr. London in the parking lot outside of a Starbucks and handed him the bag.
Federal agents took photographs of the exchange, and included one of them in the government's complaint. Two weeks later, two F.B.I. officials showed up at the home of Mr. London, who admitted his crimes.
The sting was an ignominious end to what had been a flourishing friendship in the San Fernando Valley. Mr. London and Mr. Shaw met in 2005, shortly after Mr. Shaw joined the North Ranch Country Club in Westlake Village, Calif. They frequently golfed together and socialized with each other's families.
Mr. London, a former college baseball player at California State University, Northridge, spent his entire career at KPMG. He worked at the firm for about 29 years, rising to a senior partner in the firm's Los Angeles office, where he supervised more than 500 accountants and oversaw the audits for some of its most important clients. He established himself as a player in Los Angeles business circles, joining the board of the city's Chamber of Commerce and serving as chairman of the Los Angeles Sports Council.
Meanwhile, Mr. Shaw's family-owned jewelry business was sputtering, having been particularly hard hit by the financial crisis. Mr. London said that in 2010, he began to give Mr. Shaw confidential information about his clients because of Mr. Shaw's deteriorating economic situation.
Over two years, Mr. London secretly passed confidential information to Mr. Shaw about several KPMG clients, including Herbalife, the nutritional supplement company; the footwear manufacturers Skechers and Deckers Outdoor Corporation; and Pacific Capital Bancorp, the government said.
Late Thursday, KMPG's chief executive, John B. Veihmeyer, said that the firm would soon be bringing legal action against Mr. London.
The tips started with leaks about companies' quarterly earnings announcements, but escalated into more lucrative secrets about pending mergers and acquisitions.
The case surfaced earlier this week, when KPMG issued a statement saying that it had fired the partner in charge of its audit practice in Southern California because of an insider trading violation and that it was resigning as auditor for two companies - Herbalife and Skechers - because its independence had been compromised.
Even before the government filed its charges, Mr. London and Mr. Shaw had publicly confessed to their misconduct.
"I regret my actions in leaking nonpublic data to a third party," Mr. London, 50, of Agoura Hills, Calif., said in a statement on Tuesday. "What I have done was wrong and against everything that I had believed in."
Mr. Shaw, 52, of Lake Sherwood, Calif., said he accepted "full and complete responsibility for what I have done and know that I will spend the rest of my life trying to make up for my tragic lapses of judgment."
Herbalife proved to be an especially fertile source of illegal tips. The company's shares have been volatile because of a public feud between prominent investors - William A. Ackman, who has a big bet in place against the company, and Carl C. Icahn, who owns a big stake - over the value of its stock.
In a telephone conversation that Mr. Shaw secretly recorded in February, Mr. London discussed rumors that Herbalife might be a takeover target, and outlined a classic strategy of insider trading schemes.
"What we ought to do is, when I know that it's going to start happening, what you do is you start just buying in small blocks, right, so it doesn't draw attention and then, you know, then it doesn't look unusual at all," Mr. London said.
Though Mr. Shaw was struggling financially, he rewarded Mr. London handsomely for the tips. He paid Mr. London more than $50,000 in cash, according to prosecutors, which he usually delivered in bags outside his store, Shaw Diamond Company, on Ventura Boulevard in Encino.
Mr. Shaw also routinely covered the cost of dinners and concerts they attended with their families, including a Springsteen show. All told, Mr. London received more than $100,000 worth of kickbacks.
Federal authorities opened an investigation last fall, after the brokerage firm Fidelity raised red flags about activity in Mr. Shaw's account.
Last summer, Fidelity froze the account, and Mr. Shaw called Mr. London in a panic, expressing worry that they had been found out.
"Mr. Shaw said that Mr. London reassured him that there was no reason for concern, and explained that insider trading was like counting cards at a casino in Las Vegas," the government's complaint said. "If you were caught, they simply ask you to leave because they cannot prove it."
 Lynnley Browning and Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.

HEADLINE: Where the Spies Are: A Training Camp for Automotive Paparazzi

BYLINE: BENJAMIN PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: Brenda Priddy has been taking auto spy photos for two decades. Now she&#8217;s ready to train a new crop of automotive paparazzi. 

 BODY:
Brenda Priddy, an auto spy photographer, is starting a camp for people who dream of joining the ranks of car paparazzi. Starting on July 7, Ms. Priddy will lead would-be car spies through the basics of her craft in a four-day camp in the Nevada desert.
July may sound like a miserable time to be in such a hot place, but Ms. Priddy said that it's the busiest time of year as far as car testing goes. 
"It was hard to find hotel rooms because the car companies had them all booked," she said. "That's a good sign."
Even Jim Dunne, a car spy extraordinaire who tweaked executive noses by buying land adjacent to Chrysler's desert test track, never went this far. 
But apparently, there is a big demand for spy photos of not-yet-released models. Hard-core auto fans are not satisfied just to see the latest Corvette or Ferrari the moment it is unveiled; they want to see it sooner, while it is being tested. That has given rise to the profession of automotive paparazzi. The audience Ms. Priddy and other spy photographers work to please spans the globe.
Spy photo opportunities arise from manufacturers' need to test cars in extreme temperatures. The cars are driven many miles in very hot and very cold climates to ensure durability. To mask them from prying eyes, they are usually covered in camouflage, like panels hiding the grille and defining shapes or, more recently, patterned camouflage that breaks up lines and makes shapes and lines difficult to see.
Two decades ago, Ms. Priddy was a homemaker in suburban Phoenix. Then one day, she spotted a not-yet-released Mustang on the road and snapped a picture. She sent the photo to Automobile magazine and began a new career. When she first started, her children were young, so her trips were shorter and she often took them along.
"The kids would come to the desert with mom, and I told them it was vacation," she said. The tradition has continued. One daughter, now in her 20s, stopped by to visit on her way home from Burning Man last year.
Ms. Priddy's photos have since appeared in The New York Times, AutoWeek, Car and Driver, and Road and Track, and on the Web sites LeftLaneNews.com and autos.sympatico.ca. Syndication sends the images all over the globe.
Her favorite stalking ground is the area around Death Valley, where European automakers can count on hot weather for extreme testing. (American companies tend to use their own test tracks and proving grounds, but not always.) After learning which roads manufacturers prefer for testing, Ms. Priddy spends months staking them out.
Other car spies have different techniques. In his 2011 book, "Car Spy," Mr. Dunne recalls one instance in which he donned a white coat, grabbed a clipboard, stuffed a pocket protector full of pens and strode boldly into Pontiac's secret sanctum to snap pictures of future models.
Ms. Priddy's campers will meet at an undisclosed location in the desert about 125 miles from Las Vegas, near a Western-style saloon that she said often attracts car testers.
"Generally, the testers leave something at the bar every year," she said, adding that everything from trim pieces to the entire front clip of a Mercedes adorn the walls as decoration. "You never know what you'll find or who you'll end up sitting next to."
She will show her brood of aspiring photographers the places where engineers gather, as well as the top-secret garages where they store their vehicles. Then they will be on their own to seek secret lens fodder. At the end of the day, they will return to base, and she will critique the results.
Campers should probably not expect romance. Those who follow Ms. Priddy's steady stream of social media posts already know that her work life is not all dolce vita. She regularly complains of noisy neighbors in cheap motels and emergency visits to small-town laundromats. She's away from her home in Arizona for long periods, so domestic crises can pop up. She also has issues with her dog. Ms. Priddy has developed a special relationship with the engineers who test the cars. They're not her biggest fans and often take pictures of her, too.
Ms. Priddy's trainees, who have to be at least 21 years old, will pay a $775 course fee, room and board and the cost of renting their own cars. In return, she will show campers the ropes and give them an official wristband.
"I don't bail people out of jail, so people have to be responsible for themselves," she said, pointing out that she emphasizes safety and obeying the letter of the law. "No high-speed chases."

HEADLINE: Senate Republicans Describe Cordial, if Not Convincing, Dinner With Obama

BYLINE: JONATHAN WEISMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Senate Republicans described the dinner Wednesday with President Obama as casual, but most said they came away unmoved by his arguments. 

 BODY:
President Obama threw his second dinner party of the year for Republican senators Wednesday night, but if the first such venture in March yielded a few rounds of "Kumbaya," the second was apparently more "Hit the Road Jack."
 "It certainly promotes a relationship that's more conducive to getting something done," said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, chairman of the Senate Republican Conference and a dinner guest at the White House. "But you also come away from it realizing how far apart we are." 
 Mr. Obama's continuing charm offensive is aimed at finding some bipartisan accord with the Senate on major deficit reduction legislation, an agreement that could isolate House Republican leaders and drive them back to the bargaining table. But the window for that so-called Grand Bargain is extremely narrow. A showdown looms this July, when Congress must raise the government's statutory borrowing limit, and political currents will grow only stronger as the 2014 Congressional elections approach.
 But at this point, even some Republicans say the president doesn't have a bargaining partner. 
 "The problem is that even amongst Republicans - and Democrats also - there's no consensus," said Senator John Boozman, Republican of Arkansas, who also attended the White House dinner. "It depends on who you talk to in the Republican caucus Senate, or the Republican caucus House, or the Democratic caucus, House or Senate. There's such a disparate sense of what we need to do."
 That discord has been evident for much of the week. On Wednesday, the president released his broad budget plan for fiscal 2014, which included substantial changes to Medicare and Medicaid, as well as a new way of calculating inflation that would slow down the growth of many government benefits, including Social Security. Those proposals were supposed to be an overture to Republican leaders, who have been loudly demanding presidential leadership to slow the growth of entitlement programs.
 While most Republican leaders dismissed the proposals as far too tepid, Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, who is chairman of the committee charged with electing House Republicans, called it "a shocking attack on seniors."
 The House speaker, John A. Boehner, told reporters Thursday that he disagreed with Mr. Walden's assessment, and that the two "had a conversation about it."
 The Club for Growth, a conservative political action committee, added Mr. Walden on Thursday to a list of Republicans the group hopes to challenge with a more conservative Republican next year.
 Mr. Boozman said the president and the senators met for several hours Wednesday in casual conversation that was "almost like sitting around a cafe table." Some senators started fairly uptight, "just because of the power of the office," he said, but Mr. Obama "was very, very relaxed with this group."
 The meal "was very tasty," said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee.
 That didn't mean Mr. Obama broke through, however.
 "Honestly, we have strong disagreements based on the budget and economics," said Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida. "We have a difference of opinion on the role of government, but it was respectful, honest and open."
But, he added, "I don't think any minds were changed."
"It's fine that people talk," Mr. Rubio said, shrugging. "You're not going to change anybody's principles."

HEADLINE: Romney Visits New York to Thank Donors

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney hit Manhattan on Thursday for what several people with knowledge of his trip described as a &#8220;thank you&#8221; tour for donors and fund-raisers from his recent presidential campaign. 

 BODY:
Since losing the 2012 presidential election, Mitt Romney has pumped his own gas (with wind-tousled hair), navigated Costco with his wife, Ann (stocking up on everything from bottled water to paper towels) and welcomed grandchildren 19 and 20 (twins, from his youngest son, Craig). 
And on Thursday, Mr. Romney hit Manhattan for what several people with knowledge of his trip described as a "thank you" tour for donors and fund-raisers from his recent campaign.
In the afternoon, Mr. Romney attended a large meeting with fund-raisers at Weil, Gotshal & Manges - a law firm on Fifth Avenue that was a finance team meeting spot during the campaign - and in the evening, he is expected to attend a smaller dinner for top fund-raisers and donors at the home of Stephen A. Schwarzman, chief executive of the Blackstone Group. 
Though the visit was largely designed for Mr. Romney to express his gratitude to donors and others who helped raise money for his campaign, one person with knowledge of the meetings said that at the dinner, attendees were hoping discuss ways to keep him part of the political conversation.
"We'll be plotting out the future, keeping Mitt relevant, talking about 2016," this person said. "Not for Mitt, but if he can keep this group of fund-raisers together, that's a powerful calling card to Jeb Bush or Chris Christie."
With a few exceptions, Mr. Romney has kept a low profile since the November election. He returned to the political spotlight most recently in March, when he addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington and received a warm welcome.
Attendees at the dinner are expected to include some of his top money men: Joshua Harris, a co-founder of Apollo Global Management; Emil W. Henry Jr., a former Treasury official under President George W. Bush and an economic adviser to the Romney campaign; Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets; David H. Koch, who, along with his brother, is a major benefactor of conservative causes; Wilbur L. Ross Jr., an investor; Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital; Dan Senor, a senior policy adviser to Mr. Romney's campaign who also advised Representative Paul D. Ryan, the vice presidential nominee; Paul Singer, founder and chief executive of Elliott Management Corporation; and Spencer Zwick, Mr. Romney's finance chairman and a founder of Solamere Capital.
In June, Mr. Romney will host a retreat in Park City, Utah, for his donor and fund-raising base, which at least two 2016 hopefuls - Mr. Ryan and the New Jersey governor, Chris Christie - are expected to attend. The gathering is being sponsored by Solamere, the investment firm co-founded by Mr. Zwick and Mr. Romney's oldest son, Tagg.
In addition to helping out Solamere, where Mr. Romney recently took on a modest role as chairman of the executive committee, an associate said Mr. Romney's retreat would allow him to play a larger role in 2016 Republican politics.
"I can guarantee you whatever 2016 hopefuls he invites, they will show up," the associate said.

HEADLINE: Now You See the Risk, Now You Don't

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Seeking to project strength, banks sometimes shift risk without actually moving assets. | Lawmakers could be stymied in efforts to rein in banking consultants. | A KPMG executive who was fired by the firm leaked secret information to a friend on the golf course. | The Federal Reserve&#8217;s meeting minutes March were released early to banks by mistake. 

 BODY:
Banks are reducing risky assets to show regulators how strong they are. But sometimes the assets don't actually move - the bank just shifts the risk, DealBook's Susanne Craig reports. "As regulators press for banks to be safer, demand for these maneuvers - known as capital relief trades or regulatory capital trades - has been growing, especially in Europe."
Banks like Citigroup, Credit Suisse and UBS have used such trades to make their assets look less worrisome, allowing them to hold less capital. "Rather than selling the assets, potentially at a loss, the banks transfer a slice of the risk associated with the assets, usually loans. The buyers are typically hedge funds, whose investors are often pensions that manage the life savings of schoolteachers and city workers. The buyers agree to cover a percentage of losses on these assets for a fee, sometimes 15 percent a year or more." 
Some regulators express concern that these transactions sometimes do not actually take risk off bank balance sheets. Most of the trades are structured as credit-default swaps, the instruments that pushed the American International Group to the brink in 2008. "These trades allow the banks to go to regulators and say the risk is gone," said Anat R. Admati, a professor of finance at Stanford University. "But it's not gone at all; it's just been pushed into a murky corner of the market." Still, bankers point out privately that the transactions can move risk to a less systemic part of the financial industry than the big banks.
REGULATING CONSULTANTS WON'T BE EASY | Lawmakers are increasingly concerned about a multibillion-dollar consulting industry, which will be the focus of a Senate Banking Committee hearing at 10 a.m. on Thursday. But efforts to rein in the consultants, who are paid by the banks they are expected to reform, could be stymied, "given regulators' close ties to consultants and limited legal authority to penalize them," Ben Protess and Jessica Silver-Greenberg report in DealBook.
"The early signs are discouraging, lawmakers say. After concerns surfaced that a consulting firm was bungling the broad review of foreclosures, regulators wrote to the firm complaining about the conduct, but did not fire the consultant, said Congressional officials with knowledge of the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly."
Some regulators have been exploring ways to curb the use of consultants since the foreclosure review was canceled in January, according to testimony prepared for the hearing. Daniel P. Stipano, a senior official at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said in the testimony that the agency planned to "enhance our oversight of the consultants when they are utilized." But he is also expected to cite legal limitations undercutting the regulators' authority over consultants, stemming from an episode in 2006 when the comptroller's office levied a fine that was ultimately overruled.
TIPS ON GOLF COURSE LED TO AUDITOR'S DOWNFALL | Scott I. London, the former KPMG executive who was fired by the accounting firm, leaked secret information to Bryan Shaw, a longtime friend and frequent golf partner, DealBook's Peter Lattman reports. Federal agents secretly photographed Mr. London accepting a cash payment in exchange for the information about companies he audited, according to a person with direct knowledge of the case.
The government learned of suspicious trading in Mr. Shaw's brokerage accounts, ultimately leading KPMG to resign this week as the auditor for the nutrition supplement maker Herbalife and the footwear manufacturer Skechers. "Mr. Shaw began cooperating with the authorities and turned against Mr. London, according to the person with knowledge of the case," Mr. Lattman writes. "Mr. London and Mr. Shaw have each admitted to the insider trading scheme. Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles and securities regulators are expected to bring charges against the two by the end of the week, another person briefed on the case said."
The scandal is casting a harsh spotlight on the accounting industry. "Accounting firms are being forced to take a fresh look at their practices," Lynnley Browning reports in DealBook, "as new rules requiring more transparency by the firms are already being considered."
ON THE AGENDA | President Obama is expected to meet with bank chief executives including Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Brian T. Moynihan of Bank of America, Michael L. Corbat of Citigroup and Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, according to Reuters. A House Financial Services subcommittee conducts a hearing at 10 a.m. on legislative proposals regarding derivatives. Dennis Crowley, co-founder of Foursquare, is on Bloomberg TV at 1 p.m.
FED MISTAKENLY GIVES DATA EARLY TO BANKS | Minutes from a Federal Reserve meeting in March "were released five hours earlier than originally planned because a Fed official mistakenly e-mailed them Tuesday afternoon to a host of legislative staff members and bank representatives," The New York Times reports. "The disclosure raised eyebrows both in Washington and on Wall Street, and legal and compliance departments at the banks were poring over e-mail records to determine exactly what transpired because of the early release." Still, the central bank insisted that "there was no evidence traders on Wall Street had benefited."
Banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase were among the recipients. The Carlyle Group, Guggenheim Partners and the hedge fund King Street also got the information early, according to a list compiled by The Wall Street Journal.

HEADLINE: Gentle Treatment Yields Fuel Economy Rewards With Hyundai Sonata Hybrid

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: The new Hyundai Sonata Hybrid works better than the car it replaces, but how much better depends upon how you drive it. 

 BODY:
 3:38 p.m. | Updated 
Hyundai showed off its mildly refreshed, more fuel efficient 2013 Sonata Hybrid at Harlem's Dinosaur Bar-B-Que on Wednesday. A ride up the Sawmill River Parkway into the Hudson Valley demonstrated that the new Sonata is capable of very impressive mileage, but only if you drive it the right way.
Don't expect major changes to the Sonata Hybrid - the only visual cue is new alloy wheel designs. But fuel economy jumps from 36 to 38 miles per gallon combined (36 city/40 highway). John Shon, the product manager for the Sonata and Santa Fe, said in an interview that the mileage gain was made without significant hardware changes to the car. 
Improvements came to the hybrid's electric side. Its LG Chem-developed lithium-polymer battery pack is five pounds lighter and its rating of momentary peak power delivery - the burst that the battery can supply to the electric motor - has increased to 47 kilowatts, from 34. A new housing cuts intrusion into trunk space. The electric motor of the '13 model is rated at 35 kilowatts, up from 30. And the hybrid starter generator's continuous power rating jumps to 8 kilowatts from 6.4; its maximum peak power remains unchanged. Regenerative braking performance has also been tweaked.
The 2.4-liter gas engine is the only loser - it drops from 166 to 159 horsepower, bringing net horsepower down to 199 from 206. 
The overall result is better fuel economy and a hybrid that can operate in all-electric E.V. mode for a longer time, Mr. Shon said. Hyundai has had some problems with its mileage claims, though Mr. Shon said he was "fairly confident" that the revamped Sonata Hybrid would live up to its window sticker rating. He added, however, that E.P.A. driving cycles, with gentler acceleration than was generally seen in the real world, tended to grade hybrids optimistically.
On a trip up to Rockefeller State Park Preserve in Westchester County, the Sonata Hybrid was almost preternaturally quiet. The changes from electric to hybrid mode were barely perceptible. There's enough power, but not much road or steering feel. It's no sports car. Backing off the accelerator at highway speeds will often switch the car temporarily into E.V. mode (provided the battery has enough charge), suggesting that a light foot on downgrades will yield dividends at the gas pump. The Sonata Hybrid can reach 75 miles per hour on electric power, but its range on batteries alone is limited to about two miles.
The drive to and from the park proved a study in contrast. Driving aggressively, I achieved 33.9 m.p.g. in 30 miles of highway and local driving. But James MacPherson, an auto writer and experienced hypermiler, reached 51.1 m.p.g.
The Sonata Hybrid wins points for quality materials, clear displays (with plenty of eco information related to the hybrid drive), good rear legroom and a large trunk. The base car sells for $26,445, including delivery, and the Limited model (adding such features as navigation and a rear backup camera) for $31,345.
Hyundai also showed the new 2013 Santa Fe lineup at the Harlem event. The bigger Veracruz has been dropped from the lineup, and there's an expanded role for the third-generation Santa Fe crossover S.U.V., which is available in three versions. The Sport model (with two 4-cylinder engine choices) is the base vehicle. The V-6 Santa Fe is offered as the Limited (six passengers) and GLS (seven) in long-wheelbase versions that have grown 8.5 inches over all.

Museums
American Folk Art Museum: 'Artist and Visionary: William Matthew Prior Revealed' (through May 26) William Matthew Prior (1806-1873), the subject of this fascinating exhibition, painted portraits in the ''American primitive'' mode. His paintings of solemn, pie-faced tots, stiffly posed yet animated by some inner mystery, are especially compelling. But he had the chops to paint like a well-trained academician too. He was also an abolitionist who, at some risk to his reputation, painted portraits of black people; they are among his best works. He was also into spiritualism, and he was a savvy entrepreneur. He was, altogether, a most remarkable character. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson) 
&#x2605; Asia Society: 'The Artful Recluse: Painting, Poetry, and Politics in 17th-Century China' (through June 2) With the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644, China's intellectual elite, many of them artists who worked in the imperial government, were thrown into a tailspin. Confucian ethics demanded filial devotion to the old regime. But how were they to demonstrate it? One way was to remove themselves from active life and signal their resistance through art. How they did so is the subject of this compellingly fine-grained painting show. Some artists sacrificed their lives for principles; others used recluse status as a career move. The emotional weight, psychological depth, and intellectual complexity of the work of this time is what comes through here. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter)
Brooklyn Museum: 'LaToya Ruby Frazier: A Haunted Capital' (through Aug. 11) This preternaturally mature body of work by a 31-year-old photographer connects bedrooms and streetscapes, the suffering of loved ones and the afflictions of a ''distressed municipality'' (the state's official term for Ms. Frazier's hometown, Braddock, Pa.). Simultaneously introspective and extroverted, it's composed of arresting black-and-white photographs that sometimes look like studio portraits or social documentaries but aren't fully at home in either category. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Life, Death and Transformation in the Americas' (continuing) For generations, one of the first things visitors to Brooklyn Museum encountered was the Hall of the Americas, the two-story rotunda right off the main lobby. And when you were in it, you knew you were home. A few years ago during renovations, the museum put the Americas material in storage, but now it's back in new galleries on the fifth floor. The look is very different -- ultraminimalist Arctic white and sky blue -- but the 102 objects, from a collection that is a jewel in Brooklyn's crown, are utterly gripping. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Gravity and Grace: Monumental Works by El Anatsui' (through Aug. 4) Born in Ghana and long a resident of Nigeria where he maintains a productive studio, El Anatsui has for the past decade been creating spectacularly large, fabric-like sculpture from countless numbers of liquor-bottle caps linked together with twists of copper. The work weaves together ideas about colonialism, politics and economics, and is absolutely gorgeous. The Brooklyn show, which originated at the Akron Art Museum in Ohio, also includes a number of the artist's earlier and now-overlooked carved wood pieces, which are well worth studying. 200 Eastern Parkway, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
The Frick Collection: 'Piero della Francesca in America' (through May 19) Reuniting six panels from an altarpiece by Piero, this ravishing show approximates an intimate quattrocento chapel in the Frick's grand Oval Room. At the center of the installation is a seventh painting, the Clark Art Institute's ''Virgin and Child Enthroned With Four Angels,'' which comes from a different altarpiece in the painter's hometown, Sansepolcro, and exemplifies Piero's uncanny orchestration of figures, architecture and religious symbolism. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'Gutai: Splendid Playground' (through May 8) The first large, in-depth examination of Japan's best-known postwar art movement is a mind-shifting event that brings together all the mediums it encompassed, brilliantly interwoven. The eccentrically made paintings suggest that Japan produced Abstract Expressionism's strongest second generation, the artists who most convincingly and directly extended Pollock's innovative drip technique. But the show reveals little-known precedents for Happenings, Minimalism and various strains of Post-Minimalism. It should permanently dislodge any notion of postwar modernism as a strictly Western phenomenon. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Roberta Smith)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: The Hugo Boss Prize 2012: Danh Vo' (through May 27) Known mostly for attenuated, elliptical works, this year's Hugo Boss recipient opts for density and robustness with a display of some 4,000 items that once belonged to the artist Martin Wong (1946-99). Installed wonder-cabinet style in a shelf-lined gallery, the items range from art to artifact to tchotchkes; leap across cultures; and trickle from high to low, where racial stereotypes and kitsch frequently take over. It gives us an artist who has decided to function as a curator and an archaeologist and to keep the honor of his prize in motion. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'Zarina: Paper Like Skin' (through April 21) ''Paper is an organic material, almost like human skin,'' the artist Zarina Hashmi has said. In her exhibition at the Guggenheim, it's that and more: paper is sculpture, poetry, currency and, above all, a kind of permanent home for a nomadic spirit. Her art speaks poignantly, though sometimes opaquely, of relocation and exile; works like the 2001 woodcut ''Dividing Line'' reference the violent 1947 partition of India and Pakistan, while ''Ten Thousand Things,'' a set of small paper collages recreating works from her oeuvre, nods to Duchamp's museum-in-a-suitcase. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423 3500, guggenheim.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'No Country: Contemporary Art for South and Southeast Asia' (through May 22) American museums are increasingly collecting contemporary art from outside the Western Hemisphere, and the Guggenheim, supported by the financial corporation UBS is leading the pack. This inaugural show in the acquisitions campaign highlights work from South and Southeast Asia. Certain artists -- like Amar Kanwar, from India, and Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook, from Thailand -- have international reputations. Others, like the sculptor Tang Da Wu, from Singapore, and the painter Aung Myint, Myanmar, both born in 1940s, are less familiar. Nearly all the work of the roughly two dozen artists refers in partisan, political and personal ways to specific histories. The inclusion of those histories in our art museums is long, long overdue. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Cotter)
International Center of Photography: 'Roman Vishniac Rediscovered' (through May 5) After World War II, Roman Vishniac's widely published photographs of Orthodox Jews living in Eastern Europe in the 1930s came to signify in popular imagination the human essence of what the Nazi's genocidal program destroyed. Drawn from an archive of more than 30,000 items donated to the museum over the past two decades by his daughter, Mara Vishniac Kohn, this exhibition rounds out and fills in Vishniac's story. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Jewish Museum: 'As it were ... So to speak: A Museum Collection in Dialogue With Barbara Bloom' (through Aug. 4) Ms. Bloom, invited to organize a show from elements of the museum's collection, has turned to the Talmud for inspiration. Weaving together real and fictional narratives, historical and literary sources, she creates new and often ambiguous contexts for ceremonial and decorative objects like Torah pointers, Kiddush cups and spice containers. Somehow she manages to quote Nietzsche, Freud, Leonard Cohen, Joan Didion, the Bible and various Wikipedia entries, all without losing her own probing, skeptical voice. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'African Art, New York, and the Avant-Garde' (through Sept. 2) Timed to the centennial of the Armory Show of 1913, this exhibition tells the story of African art's debut in cutting-edge New York museums and galleries with exceptional candor. It makes clear that early-20th-century Americans received Modern art and African art as a single import, derived from French and Belgian colonies, distilled in Paris and presented on these shores by a few tastemaking dealers and collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'James Nares: Street' (through May 27) Far from pedestrian, this show revolves around a ravishing, 61-minute video projection by the artist James Nares. Called ''Street,'' it consists of long, slow-motion pans of people going about their business on the sidewalks and streets of New York City. To go with it, Mr. Nares combed through the museum's permanent collection and came up with a fascinating array of thematically related photographs, prints, paintings and drawings having largely to do with human and vehicular traffic. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Photography and the American Civil War' (through Sept. 2) As intellectually fascinating as it is emotionally wrenching, this exhibition is sure to be remembered as one of the great museum photography shows ever. Its more than 200 photographs include expansive images of battlefields and war-ruined towns; wallet-size portraits of soldiers; preciously framed daguerreotypes; political campaign buttons; a doctor's documents of horrifically wounded soldiers; portraits of loved ones in lockets; and a series depicting the hanging of five co-conspirators in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln by the photographer Alexander Gardner. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: Impressionism, Fashion and Modernity (through May 27) The title may suggest a double-dose of pandering, but the show itself is a stunning combination of great paintings, ravishing gowns, historical clarity and pitch-perfect contextualizing. Demonstrating how the Impressionists and more conservative painters alike used the latest fashions to define their sitters as real people, it builds fascinating webs of new information and viewpoints around some of the best-known, most beloved paintings of all time, quite a few of which don't often travel to this country.

&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Path of Nature: French Paintings from the Wheelock Whitney Collection, 1785-1850' (through April 21) ''Sparkle with repose'' was the effect the British artist John Constable said he was after in his landscapes. His French contemporaries had the same idea. Today, Constable's a star. But León Pallière? Adrien Dauzats? Alexandre-Hyacinthe Dunouy? Only wonkish scholars are likely to know their names. Lucky for them, and for us, that one of those scholars is Whitney Wheelock III, who has a passion for French art from the years between neo-classicism and Romanticism, and a special love for gleaming little oil sketches done out of doors. In 2003 he gave his pictures to the Met, where 50 of them, along with some exquisitely funky genre paintings, make up this small gem of a show. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Morgan Library & Museum: 'Drawing Surrealism' (through April 21) This sensational show of 165 works by 70 artists from 15 countries traces the movement from its early automatist stirrings to the doorstep of Abstract Expressionism. Expanding the field of players with numerous new names, it also has a wonderful clarity, organized according to the techniques that the Surrealists commandeered (collage and photography), breathed life into (frottage, decalcomania and exquisite corpse) and frequently crossbred. It may be among the best encapsulations of Surrealism you will ever see. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Smith)
Morgan Library and Museum: 'Degas, Miss La La and the Cirque Fernando' (through May 12) Viewers catching their first glimpse of ''Miss La La at the Cirque Fernando'' will tend to agree with an early Degas biographer who called the painting ''one of his most surprising canvases.'' But after a close look at this curious 1879 picture of an aerialist hanging from a rope by her teeth (on loan from the National Gallery in London, and displayed with related studies, sketchbooks, circus programs and other ephemera), they will recognize Degas's skeptical eye and classical perspective on modern entertainment. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Edvard Munch: The Scream' (through April 29) A version of Edvard Munch's ''Scream'' has been on view at this museum since the fall, having come almost straight from the auction block. Protected by a Plexiglas box, like the Mona Lisa, it has been given a prominent perch opposite van Gogh's ''Starry Night'' in the fifth-floor painting and sculpture galleries. It's rare chance to get acquainted with ''The Scream'' in person and in context. The museum has built a mini-exhibition around the work, surrounding it with Munch paintings and prints that amplify its motifs and mood. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Projects 99: Meiro Koizumi' (through May 6) It would be hard to find another work of contemporary art that protests war with such soulful grace as Meiro Koizumi's ''Defect in Vision'' (2011), the main attraction of this small show. This 12-minute, black-and-white video dramatizes a final conversation between a kamikaze pilot and his wife, both of whom are blind, as they eat together in a small, old-world-style dining room. It is a riveting meditation on the doomed, myth-saturated mind of Japan's warrior class in the last days of World War II. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Bill Brandt: Shadow and Light' (through Aug. 12) With nearly 160 works ranging from photographs of London in the 1930s and during World War II to nearly abstract Surrealist nudes from the 1950s and '60s, this impeccable survey makes a strong if slightly over-edited argument for Brandt as one of the founders of modern photography. It sticks to vintage prints and brings a wonderful lucidity to a persistent balance of art and humanity that is, as it is frequently described: strange, mysterious and irresistible. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Performing Histories (1)' (through Aug. 5) An awareness of the uprisings, protests, occupations and revolutions erupting around the globe is present in ''Performing Histories (1),'' a show of video, film and photographic work recently acquired by MoMA. Insurrection and resistance pervade the Romanian artist Ion Grigorescu's film ''Dialogue With Ceausescu'' (1978), while the feminist personal as political is employed in Martha Rosler's ''She Sees in Herself a New Woman Every Day'' (1976) and Sharon Hayes's four-channel video ''The Interpreter Project'' (2001). Andrea Fraser's two videos connect politics and the museum. In one she describes how scientific philanthropy in the 19th century directed wealth to museums and other public institutions rather than the poor, while another video delves into how MoMA itself interacted with revolutionaries and communists, like the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera.

Neue Galerie: 'German Expressionism 1900-1930: Masterpieces From the Neue Galerie Collection' (through April 22) German Expressionism was a messy, complicated movement, with numerous stylistic and philosophical variations. It's not easily corralled into a tidy overview, despite the best efforts of the Neue Galerie in this collection show. The installation sorts everything into two groups, using the rubrics of ''primitivism'' and ''modernity.'' ''Primitivism'' seems to mean the gallery of jarringly bright, vigorously brushy paintings by members of the Brücke and the Blaue Reiter; under ''modernity'' are Neue Sachlichkeit portraits by Otto Dix, George Grosz, Christian Schad and others, made with caustic humor and an eye for the grotesque. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; New Museum: 'NYC 1993: Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star' (through May 26) History is written by the winners, which in contemporary art usually means the market. It's often also written by people who weren't on the scene and have to take the winners' word for what happened and what mattered. Such is the case with this retrospective show that too often favors the currently best-selling survivors of a fraught era over many now less well-known on-the-ground players. There's good art here, but the spirit of a furiously skeptical utopian moment -- very high, very low -- rarely breaks through the institutional nostalgia. And the chance to probe some market myths -- exactly how political was that 1993 ''political'' Whitney Biennial? -- is lost. Like all surveys of the immediate past, ''NYC 1993'' will get everyone kvetching, and it's a must-see, if only to find ways to bring the story into the present differently. Nari Ward's 1993 installation ''Amazing Grace'' in the New Museum's next-door space is for the ages. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Rubin Museum of Art: 'Radical Terrain' (through April 29) The third and last of three beautifully produced, back-to-back mini-surveys in the series Modernist Art From India, this exhibition combines landscape painting done in India in the years following independence in 1947 with recent work by young artists -- some South Asian, most not -- that corresponds to or comments on the older art. Small in size and unfamiliar in content, the show is large with history. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Blues for Smoke' (through April 28) As a musical category blues is hard to pin down, and this show makes the job harder, which seems to be its point. It's saying: blues isn't a thing; it's a set of feelings, a state of mind, maybe a state of grace. In origin, it's African-American, developing with gospel and jazz, and folding into R&B, funk and hip-hop. But it has long since become a transethnic, transcultural phenomenon bigger than music, an enveloping aesthetic that includes art. And when you have art by the likes of Zoe Leonard, Kerry James Marshall, Rachel Harrison, Martin Wong, William Pope.L, Alma Thomas, Wu Tsang and David Hammons, you cannot go wrong. Whitney Museum of American Art, (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum: 'Jay DeFeo: A Retrospective' (through June 2) The American artist DeFeo, who died in 1989 at 60, is famous for a single work, a gargantuan painting -- nearly 12 feet tall -- called ''The Rose,'' which she labored on exhaustingly for eight years, even after it had been extracted out of her San Francisco studio with a forklift. In the absence of other evidence, many people tend to see the piece as the sum of her accomplishment, but to this view the Whitney's tenderly shaped and visually absorbing survey says: No. There's more, and different. ''The Rose'' may have been the pivot point of her career -- DeFeo herself said as much -- but streams of inventive, if less spectacular work, work flowed toward it and from it.

Galleries: 57th Street
&#x2605; Philip Guston: 'A Centennial Exhibition' (through April 20) On the 100th anniversary of this Abstract Expressionism best-known apostate, this large exhibition includes one of his last abstractions but concentrates on the indelible figurative work of his last decade -- the 1970s -- which did so much to inspire the painters of the 1980s. Several paintings are refreshingly unfamiliar, including ''Alfie in Small Town,'' which commemorates a placid West Highland terrier who once called this gallery home. McKee Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 688-5951, mckeegallery.com. (Smith)
Joe Zucker: 'Empire Descending a Staircase' (through April 27) This is something of a comeback show for one of the most restless and ambitious painters to emerge from the 1970s, who habitually combines eccentric painting processes with weird subject matter and weirder materials. On crumbling drywall in lush tones of gray, his latest works depict the fluted columns and capitals -- usual to important buildings since the Greeks -- in a state of collapse. You can almost see the dust rising. Mary Boone Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue near 57th Street, (212) 752-2929, maryboonegallery.com. (Smith)
Galleries: Chelsea
&#x2605; Luigi Ghirri: 'Kodachrome' (through April 20) The photographs of Luigi Ghirri (1943-92), as seen in this show of selections from his 1978 book, ''Kodachrome,'' sometimes bring to mind American color photography by William Eggleston and Joel Sternfeld but have a dreamier quality and a more persistent sense of artifice. Images that at first seem to be ordinary vacation shots gradually reveal an eerie obsession with symmetry. Elsewhere, ocean vistas and Alpine landscapes turn out to be restaurant murals, billboards or postcards. In the book Mr. Ghirri writes of a ''labyrinth, the walls of which are ever more illusory ... to the point at which we might merge with them.'' Matthew Marks, 526 West 22nd Street, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com. (Rosenberg)
Miroslaw Balka: 'The Order of Things' (through April 20) The single rousingly portentous sculpture here involves black liquid continually gushing from suspended, industrial-size hoses into a pair of giant bins made of rusty steel plate. Since its title refers to a book by the French philosopher Michel Foucault, you know that big ideas are afoot. Maybe it is an allegory of the mindlessly self-perpetuating machinery driving modern civilization. Something like that. Gladstone, 530 West 21st Street, (212) 206-7606, gladstonegallery.com. (Johnson)
Al Held: 'Alphabet Paintings' (through April 20) Al Held (1928-2005) was one of the last and best of the big-impact abstract painters to emerge from the postwar era. ''Alphabet Paintings'' is an exhilarating show of seven paintings dating from 1961 to '67, a transitional period during which Mr. Held based compositions on simple, geometric shapes and, more remarkably, letters of the Roman alphabet. At 8 ½ by 12 feet, ''The Yellow X'' (1965) is spectacular. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, (212) 242-7727, cheimread.com. (Johnson)
Justin Matherly: 'All industrious people' (through April 27) The concrete casts in Mr. Matherly's first solo at Paula Cooper are modeled on stone reliefs from Mount Nemrud, an excavated temple in Turkey. Mr. Matherly seems most interested in its iconography of power transmitted through touch; his steles show the Hellenistic king Antiochus I receiving divine authority through handshakes with the gods. At the same time, a platform made of metal walkers suggests weakness and precariousness; nearby, smudged inkjet monoprints based on photographs reduce the features of the Nemrud site to blurry abstractions.

Galleries: Other
Judith Braun: 'May I Draw' (through April 21) The small invariably symmetrical graphite drawings that dominate this exhibition are almost impossibly exquisite. Some are calligraphic; others suggest butterfly wings, spider webs or jellyfish; still others explore eccentric, subtly erotic geometric relationships. The most elaborate doubles and redoubles the artist's mantra: ''Oh May I Draw as Jane Writes,'' leaving little doubt that the Jane in question is Austen. Joe Sheftel Gallery, 24A Orchard Street, Lower East Side, (212) 226-4900, joesheftelgallery.com. (Smith)
Paul D'Agostino: 'Twilit Ensembles' (through April 21) A Manhattan gallery debut inadvertently forms a kind of David and Goliath contest. Supposedly weightier, more serious paintings and collages are outdistanced by a series of modest comical drawings in stenciled ink whose main characters are derived from paint splatters on the artist's studio floor. They deftly mine territory between Marcel Duchamp and Dr. Seuss and could be developed into children's books for adults. Pocket Utopia, 191 Henry Street, between Clinton and Jefferson Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 375-8532, pocketutopia.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (ongoing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info.

Out of Town
'Albrecht Dürer: Master Drawings, Watercolors, and Prints from the Albertina' (through June 9) Albrecht Dürer had it all: the eye of a Raphael, the brains of a Leonardo, the looks of a cleaned-up Kurt Cobain. Traditionally, the category of great artist implies great painter, and Dürer was that, though there's reason to think that he was at his most inventive, involved and expansive in his works on paper. Evidence for that argument is in this startlingly generous loan exhibition of more than 100 works on paper that includes some of his best known images. National Gallery of Art, on the National Mall, between Third and Seventh Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Cotter)
'Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Art and Design, 1848-1900' (through May 19) A large and well-done survey of paintings, drawings, books, furnishings, textiles and even stained glass includes such classics as John Everett Millais's ''Ophelia'' and Henry Wallis's ''Chatterton.'' It also enables a clear assessment of England's ever-popular mid-19th-century art movement, whose legacy is fittingly full of contradictions. Using brazenly modern colors, the brotherhood nonetheless turned toward the past, fashioning a nostalgic, literary, costume-heavy, clichéd style that demeaned women. The best works here are the landscapes, which are unfortunately in short supply. National Gallery of Art, on the National Mall between Third and Seventh Streets NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Smith)
Smithsonian American Art Museum: 'The Civil War and American Art' (through April 28) On the surface, this probing, perspective-altering exhibition, one of many events commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, looks straightforward, even ordinary. We know most of the paintings and photographs on sight; they're classics. What we know less well is their meaning within the context of the nation's single greatest internal catastrophe, and that's what the show is about. It travels to the Metropolitan Museum of Art this spring, running from May 21 to Sept. 2. Eighth and F Streets NW, Washington, (202) 633-7970, americanart.si.edu. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Smithsonian American Art Museum: 'Nam June Paik: Global Visionary' (through Aug. 11) Including a large and fascinating trove of material from the Nam June Paik archive, acquired by the Smithsonian from the artist's estate in 2009, this survey of the avant-garde musician, multimedia wizard and video art pioneer (1932-2006) looks startlingly current despite the preponderance of analog televisions and other obsolete hardware. It makes clear that contemporary artists like Christian Marclay, Jon Kessler, Cory Arcangel, Ryan Trecartin and Haroon Mirza owe a great deal to Mr. Paik's tweaked TV sets and frenetic, technically innovative videos. Eighth and F Streets NW, Washington, (202) 633-1000, americanart.si.edu. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Yale University Art Gallery (continuing) In a museum era dominated by vying forces of bad economics and compulsive building, it's a miracle when something comes out right, which makes the opening of the splendidly renovated and expanded Yale University Art Gallery a happy event. The angels of art, design and budgetary planning were on duty. Everything worked. The country's oldest university art museum has arrived at a kind institutional ideal of opposites in balance: an encyclopedic teaching museum, big enough to get lost in, small enough for intimate art encounters. New galleries of Indo-Pacific art are a particular attraction, but so are other collections, including one of the countries premier holdings in American art and a small, matchless display of very early Italian Renaissance painting. A special exhibition, ''Societe Anonyme: Modernism for America,'' made up of Yale-owned material, is on view through July 14. 1111 Chapel Street, New Haven, (203) 432-0600, artgallery.yale.edu.

Last Chance
Mark Dion: 'Drawings, Prints, Multiples and Sculptures' (closes on Saturday) This exhibition provides a panoramic view of the interests, imagination, erudition and mordant wit of an artist who has spent more than two decades blurring the boundaries between art, archaeology and science, exposing both the natural order of things and our tendency to disrupt it. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com. (Smith)
Charles Harlan: 'Cave' (closes on Sunday) In his second gallery solo, this young New York artist pushes the ready-made to new extremes of scale but still keeps it simple, squeezing a corrugated steel culvert 10 feet across and 15 feet long into a space that barely holds it. Inspired by Nancy Holt's pipe sculptures and Richard Serra's heft, the work eats space, alters sound and creates a precarious cavelike opening. And, when struck by the afternoon sun, it seems to acquire a series of shining, almost-neon ribs that turn out to be seams. JTT, 170 Suffolk Street, near Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 574-8152, jttnyc.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Inventing Abstraction: 1910-1925' (closes on Monday) The pursuit of the holy grail of early modernism at its most feverish is presented as a multiple-medium, multinational effort in this dizzying, magisterial cornucopia. The 350-plus works by 84 artists encompass painting, sculpture, music, poetry, dance, film and photography; alternate between the tentative and the prescient; and capture something of both the terrors and thrills of the project, with clusters of paintings by Kazimir Malevich and Piet Mondrian among the high points. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; 'Painted on 21st Street: Helen Frankenthaler From 1950 to 1959' (closes on Saturday) As revealed by this fabulously unruly exhibition, the little-known work leading to Frankenthaler's 1952 ''Mountains and Sea'' -- famous cornerstone of color Field painting -- should be an immutable part of art history. Equally inspiring is the display of the better-known varieties of wild beauty that it unleashed. Altogether we see a fearless young woman, unencumbered by rules or ideology, making free with painting's materials and history, bending other artists' styles and motifs to her own highly individual expressive needs. Gagosian Gallery, 522 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-1717, gagosian.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; Dieter Roth. Björn Roth (closes on Saturday) Concentrating on the collaborations of the Swiss-German maverick Dieter Roth (1930-98) and his son Bjorn, this sprawling show adds a veneer of class to the inauguration of Chelsea's latest oversize trophy gallery. Numerous large, messy works noisily navigate the border between art and life. But the best does so quietly: the 128-monitor video piece ''Solo Scenes'' simply records the elder Roth living out life in his studio-home in Basel.

HEADLINE: Save Wounded Knee

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BRINGS PLENTY. 
Chief Joseph Brings Plenty, a former chairman of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, teaches Lakota culture at the Takini School on the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation.

 BODY:
WOUNDED KNEE, S.D.
THE Lakota Sioux word ''takini'' means ''to die and come back'' but is usually translated more simply as ''survivor.'' It is a sacred word long associated with the killing of scores of unarmed Lakota men, women and children by soldiers of the United States Army's Seventh Cavalry in the winter of 1890.
Wounded Knee was the so-called final battle of America's war on its Native peoples. But what happened was hardly a battle. It was a massacre. 
A band of several hundred Lakota led by Big Foot, a chief of the Mnicoujou Sioux, was intercepted and detained by troops as they made their way from the Cheyenne River Reservation to Pine Ridge for supplies and safety. After a night of drinking, the bluecoats were disarming warriors the next morning when a shot went off. Soldiers opened fire with their Hotchkiss machine guns. At least 150 but perhaps as many as 300 or more Lakota died.
Our fight to survive as a people continues today, a struggle to preserve not just our culture and our language but also our history and our land. Though I now live on the western reaches of the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation, I grew up in Pine Ridge, among my Oglala kin just a few miles from Wounded Knee. One member of my family survived the killing; others died.
The killing ground stirs great emotion in all of our people -- memories of bodies frozen into twisted shapes, of those who were hunted down and murdered as they fled, and of those who escaped in bitter cold across wind-swept plains. These stories have been handed down to us and live within us.
One story I remember vividly was told to me when I was about 8 by a tribal elder, a very old woman whose mother had survived the bloodshed as a child. The old woman's mother told her how her own mother had gathered her up when the bullets started flying. Just then, a young horse warrior galloped past and took the child up in his arms to help her escape. As she looked back, she saw her mother shot down, her chest torn open by bullets. She told her daughter that she remembered tasting the salt in her tears. The old woman told me all this after I had knocked over a saltshaker. Salt still reminded her of her mother.
There are many such stories. The spiritual power of the place explains why members of the American Indian Movement took it over in 1973 to call the nation's attention to the economic and cultural injustices against our Native brothers and sisters.
Now, our heritage is in danger of becoming a real-estate transaction, another parcel of what once was our land auctioned off to the highest bidder. The cries of our murdered people still echo off the barren hills -- the cries we remember in our hearts every day of our lives. But they may finally be drowned out by bulldozers and the ka-ching of commerce.
The Wounded Knee site passed from the Oglala into private hands through the process known as allotment, begun in the late 1800s, by which the federal government divided land among the Indians and gave other parcels to non-Indians. The idea was to shift control of our land from the collective to the individual and to teach the Lakota and other Native Americans the foreign notion of ownership. But to us, the policy was just another form of theft.
The private owner of the Wounded Knee site, who has held title to the 40-acre plot since 1968, wants to sell it for $3.9 million. If the Oglala of Pine Ridge don't buy it by May 1, it will be sold at auction.
The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation is one of the poorest places in the United States, and the Oglala, who are deeply in debt, would be hard-pressed to meet the price. Many elders properly ask why any price should be paid at all. The federal government should buy this land and President Obama should then preserve it as a national monument -- just as he did last month at five federally owned sites around the country, including one in Maryland honoring Harriet Tubman and the Underground Railroad.
The massacre site has great meaning not just for the Lakota but for all First Nations -- and every American. Wounded Knee should remain a sacred site where the voices of the Ghost Dancers, who more than a century ago danced for the return of our old way of life, still echo among the pines, where the spirits of our elders still walk the hills, and where ''takini'' still has meaning: the survival of our collective memory.

HEADLINE: Bold On Both Ends

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
It's time to entertain the possibility that President Obama is a right-wing extremist. After all, look at where he's taking the country over his second term.
We're living in a country where 53 percent of children born to women under 30 are born out of wedlock, according to government data. Millions of people, especially men, are dropping out of the labor force. Nearly half the students who begin college are unable to graduate within six years. The social fabric for people without college degrees is in shambles.
Yet President Obama is not offering proposals commensurate with those problems. Under his budget, domestic discretionary spending would be lower as a share of G.D.P. than it was under Reagan, both Bushes and Nixon. When it comes to this category, Obama's budget would take us back to Eisenhower levels. 
The president is increasing total revenues to a historically high 20 percent of G.D.P. by 2023. Federal spending would remain at a way-above-average 22 percent of G.D.P. But Washington still can't seem to devote enough money to address the challenges faced by the less-educated and ease the segmentation of America. That's true even after you account for the domestic programs that are outside the discretionary budget category and have their own funding stream, like the new early childhood initiative.
I generally come to celebrate, not criticize, this budget. Obama has the guts to take on special interests in his own party. He works hard to reduce inequality. He understands that entitlement programs represent a fundamental threat to the sustainability of the welfare state. He understands that politics can only work if the president transcends his base and builds a majority coalition. His budget should put to rest those crazy claims that he is some sort of Norwegian socialist.
But being moderate means throwing away ideological blinders and facing reality. Right now, America faces two giant problems: social unraveling today and cataclysmic debt tomorrow. This budget takes small steps to address both problems when big strides are needed.
So where do we go from here? That's easy. First, we have the same kabuki debate we've been having for the past few decades. This debate is organized around the following trade-off: more revenue in exchange for more spending cuts.
This debate will probably go nowhere. Republicans feel as if they've already given away the store on new revenue, so they are not going to be compromising. President Obama needs to show Democrats that this budget is the endpoint, not a starting point, for a further rightward drift. He doesn't have much room to compromise either.
The kabuki debate will probably end, as it usually does, with gridlock and name-calling. But then we can move on to Debate B. This debate would be organized around a different trade-off -- not a balance between taxing and spending, but a balance between greater discretionary spending in exchange for structural entitlement reform.
In this framework, Democrats would get a lot of the good ideas that are in the Obama budget, but they'd be bigger and more aggressive. We'd take the pre-k initiative, the spending on scientific research and the infrastructure spending. But then we'd throw on top other programs. Make more men marriageable (by helping them earn a reliable wage). Rebind the social fabric in atomized communities (social entrepreneurship funds). Maybe expand a national service program to give more young adults discipline, orientation and connections.
Republicans would get structural entitlement reform. Here, too, we could build on the ideas in the Obama budget, like chained Consumer Price Index for Social Security and the expansion of means-testing for Medicare. Then we could throw on other modest structural reforms: Combine Medicare Parts A and B and further limiting Medigap plans in order to induce seniors to make more cost-conscious decisions. Repair federal pensions and the disability system. Means test Social Security and raise the Medicare eligibility age for affluent workers.
This deal wouldn't represent the moderation of the mushy middle. It would represent muscular moderation that is bold on both ends. Persuade majorities that discretionary spending is not just foreign aid and earmarks. It's the government's best shot at boosting social mobility. Remind Americans that their country can't be a rising nation if we have an entitlements system fit for an aging and declining one.
Right now, we are the North Korea of fiscal policy. We're living under the insane sequester that cuts those programs we should be increasing and spares exactly those old-age programs we should be reforming. Both parties should have incentive to get to a new fiscal regime.
Party leaders could postpone the debate about tax revenues. They could accept higher deficits short term. Most important, they could embrace a deal-making framework that would direct attention toward urgent needs: discretionary programs for now, structural entitlement reforms that accumulate over time.

HEADLINE: Drop in Jobless Claims Counteracts March Data

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, easing fears of a marked deterioration in the labor market after a surprise stumble in job growth in March. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 42,000 to a seasonally adjusted 346,000, the Labor Department said on Thursday, unwinding a jump in the previous week that appeared related to difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal variations.
It was the largest weekly drop since mid-November. Economists, who had expected first-time applications for jobless aid to fall only to 365,000, said the decline suggested that the sharp slowdown in employment growth in March had been an aberration.
''We will see more job creation this month than we did in March, and today's jobless claims numbers are consistent with that expectation,'' said Robert A. Dye, chief economist at Comerica.
Employers added only 88,000 workers to payrolls in March -- the smallest number in nine months -- after a solid 268,000 increase in February.
Economists said the jobless claims data suggested that the slowdown in job creation reflected seasonal hiring being brought forward rather than underlying weakness in the labor market.
''All the March employment report provided a hint of is that jobs that normally would have got hired in March, some of them got hired earlier in February,'' said Michael H. Strauss, chief economist at Commonfund.
Jobless claims are now back at the lower end of their range for this year, suggesting the labor market recovery remains on track.
The four-week moving average for new jobless claims, a better measure of labor market trends, increased 3,000 to 358,000. It remains close to a level economists normally associate with payroll gains of about 150,000 a month.
A second report from the Labor Department showed little sign of inflation. Import prices slipped 0.5 percent last month after rising 0.6 percent in February.
In the 12 months to March, import prices dropped 2.7 percent. Prices last month were subdued by a drop in the cost of petroleum and a strong dollar.

HEADLINE: Russia Skips Hybrids in Push For Cars Using Natural Gas

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Igor A. Samarsky of the southern Russian city of Krasnodar gets fuel economy on his 1998 Lada sedan that would make a Prius owner green with environmental envy.
For all of 120 rubles -- about $3.80, or a little more than a gallon of regular unleaded fuel in the United States -- he can drive 140 miles. The Toyota hybrid would need three gallons of gas to drive that distance.
The only drawback in Mr. Samarsky's mind is his wife's lingering fear that the car, which runs on methane gas, will explode on the way to the grocery store.
''My wife was afraid, but I didn't mind,'' Mr. Samarsky, a mechanic, said of the methane fuel kit he installed himself by placing a high-compression tank in the trunk and a hose snaking to the engine. 
''She said, 'I won't drive this car, it will blow up.' But then she saw the savings, and she calmed down.''
Gazprom, the state-owned energy monopoly better known for heating houses and powering factories in Europe, is making a bet that natural gas cars are an alluring market for future growth, at home in Russia and in other European countries that have bought its gas. All the ingredients are in place for adoption of natural gas vehicles in Russia, the world's second-largest gas producer after the United States, with economic and environmental payoffs.
Economically, it's no contest at the pump compared with gasoline because natural gas, whose main component is methane, is so abundant and cheap in Russia. It costs about $2 a gallon less than gasoline. (For such comparisons, compressed gas is measured by its cost for a volume containing the same amount of energy as a gallon of gasoline.)
Lax regulations in Russia have already provided a foothold for natural gas for cars. Even before the auto industry officially joined in, do-it-yourself kits were readily available. Unlike the hybrids and plug-ins produced by brand-name automobile companies, many of the natural gas cars in Russia are aftermarket conversions. In Russia, a complete system can be bought for less than $1,000 at a roadside repair shop in parts of the country where natural gas is commonly used, like the region around Krasnodar.
Natural gas fuel systems in the United States, in contrast, are handled with extraordinary care. High standards are set for the tanks of compressed gas.
An advocacy group, Natural Gas Vehicles for America, estimates certified aftermarket kits are available for about 40 models of cars and trucks and cost $12,000 to $18,000.
Four factory-equipped natural gas and dual-fuel cars are for sale in the United States today: the Honda Civic NG, the Dodge Ram 2500, the Chevy Silverado and the Ford F-250.
Long-haul truckers, fleet car operators and railways are adopting methane, Dave McCurdy, president of the American Gas Association, said in a telephone interview.
In Russia, natural gas has been adopted by lower-income and rural drivers, along with farmers and operators of light-duty trucks, said Yevgeny N. Pronin, director of the National Gas Motor Association of Russia, and also an executive at Gazprom in charge of marketing gas for transportation.
Gazprom, though, would like to see wider adoption. A large Russian carmaker, Russian Machines, this year announced a policy, endorsed by Gazprom, to include natural gas systems as standard on buses and light utility trucks, like the Gazelle.
The Russian government and Gazprom, though, are just now pressing aggressively for a switch to natural gas at home, where prices are about tied with the United States as the lowest in the world.
The wholesale price for natural gas at the Henry Hub in Louisiana, a standard contract for gas in the United States, was $3.33 per million British thermal units in February; the government-set domestic natural gas tariff in Russia this year is expected to average $3.87 for the same quantity.
This is about a quarter of the wholesale price of natural gas in other industrialized countries, like Britain or Germany, according to a study of Russia's gas market released by Bank of America Merrill Lynch in February, meaning vehicle owners in Russia and the United States have the most to gain from converting to natural gas from gasoline or diesel.
The biggest issue in Russia, as it will be in any country that tries a conversion, is where drivers can refuel.
In both the United States and Russian conversions, a dashboard switch allows a driver to choose the fuel type, and most drivers keep their gasoline tanks filled as a reserve.
The United States has about 170,000 gasoline stations but only 1,200 filling stations where methane is sold. The Department of Energy estimates 112,000 vehicles in the country run on natural gas.
Russia, with a population just less than half that of the United States, has only 267 natural gas filling stations and an estimated 86,000 natural gas vehicles, according to a fact sheet prepared by Gazprom.
''Gazprom considers the natural gas fuel market development as a profitable core business,'' Gazprom said in a statement. ''The company is planning to establish a vast natural gas market on this basis.''
Gazprom's strategy for promoting natural gas as a vehicle fuel has focused until now principally on its export markets in Europe, where greater demand could help prop up prices undercut by a global glut in natural gas supply, including from American shale gas production. But because Gazprom links its natural gas prices to oil prices in Europe, it cannot compete on price for transportation fuel.
Gazprom in Europe highlights the environmental advantages of methane compared to gasoline or diesel, which are substantial.
It sponsors an annual natural gas-powered car rally through Europe, called the Blue Corridor, to encourage the construction of natural gas filling stations and the easing of regulations.
Just this week, during a visit to Germany by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Gazprom signed an agreement with Volkswagen to become the exclusive fuel supplier to the German carmaker's natural gas racecars, the methane-burning rockets on a new racing circuit for ecologically clean gas cars, called the Volkswagen Scirocco R-Cup. Nine races are planned this year.
For the everyday driver, of course, a chief concern is still arriving in one piece.
''The first issue is that people are afraid their car will blow up,'' Mr. Pronin of Gazprom said.
In relatively wealthy areas, like Moscow, few people want to risk it for the sake of fuel economy. Methane is stored in a gaseous but highly compressed form. The pressure inside an automobile methane tank is about 100 times as great as that in a tire.
Russians still recall, with shudders, the fear of bursting tanks on substandard methane-fueled cars in the late 1980s.
The Soviet Union made a push to adopt natural gas in cars, to free up crude oil for export and ease the late-Soviet economic crisis. By dictate, central planners created 400 natural gas filling stations, most now defunct.
In 1989, the Soviet Union even tested a passenger jet powered by natural gas, the Tupolev-155, which packed, unnervingly, a large liquefied natural gas tank in the rear of the plane in place of the last rows of seats. It never went into production.
Aleksei Y. Bankovsky, a chief mechanic at Italgas, a shop offering vehicle conversions outside Moscow, dismissed such catastrophic fears.
In fact, the tanks cannot explode: for that, oxygen would need to mix with the methane inside and have a source of ignition. Tanks are hardened against crashes and designed to vent rather than burst in fires.
Lower-quality tanks do, though, sometimes rupture from the pressure of being filled. Then, bits of tank and car go flying.
''It's unpleasant but not fatal,'' he said, unless somebody is smoking nearby.

HEADLINE: Cybersecurity: A View From the Front

BYLINE: By TOOMAS HENDRIK ILVES

 BODY:
HELSINKI -- The changes in the digital world today represent a dramatically sped-up version of the changes the world underwent in a century of industrialization. It is a paradigm transformation of our world: Notions of a nation's size, wealth, power, military might, population and G.D.P. mean something altogether different from what they meant a generation ago.
These relations are in constant flux, and old assumptions no longer hold. Today, a small, poor East European country can be a world leader in e-governance and cybersecurity.
In February, the United Nations praised Estonia's e-Annual Report system, by which entrepreneurs can submit annual reports electronically, as the ''best of the best'' e-Government application of the past decade. Last autumn, Freedom House ranked Estonia first in Internet freedom for the third year in a row (the United States and Germany were second and third). 
At the same time, Estonia is also remembered as the first publicly known target of politically motivated cyberattacks in April 2007, which inundated the Web sites of Parliament, banks, ministries, television stations and other organizations.
Disruptive as the attacks were, they were by today's standards primitive, consisting of ''distributed denial of service'' attacks (DDoS), which essentially overload servers with signals from hijacked, hacker-controlled PCs. Six years later, as computing power and IT dependency have increased hugely, cyberattacks are far more sophisticated and our vulnerabilities are far greater.
Yet those attacks were a blessing -- Estonia took cybersecurity seriously earlier than most. In 2008, NATO opened its Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence, to enhance NATO's cyberdefense capability, in Tallinn.
Cybersecurity needs to be taken seriously by everyone. We continue to think of cyberthreats in military or classical warfare terms, when in fact cyber can simply render the military paradigm irrelevant. The whole information and communication technologies (ICT) infrastructure must be regarded as an ''ecosystem'' in which everything is interconnected. It functions as a whole; it must be defended as a whole.
Today, almost everything we do depends on a digitized system of one kind or another. Our critical infrastructure -- our electrical, water or energy production systems and traffic management -- essentially interacts with, and cannot be separated from, our critical information infrastructure -- private Internet providers, lines of telecommunications and the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (Scada) systems that run everything from nuclear power plants to delivery of milk to our supermarkets.
Understanding that cybersecurity means defending the entirety of our societies, we need to re-examine many assumptions of security. In cyberwarfare, it is much harder to identify the attacker, and therefore to know how to retaliate.
In a modern digitalized world it is possible to paralyze a country without attacking its defense forces: The country can be ruined by simply bringing its Scada systems to a halt. To impoverish a country one can erase its banking records. The most sophisticated military technology can be rendered irrelevant. In cyberspace, no country is an island.
This requires rethinking some of our core philosophical notions of modern society: the relations between the public and private spheres, between privacy and identity.
At a time when the greatest threats to our privacy and the security of our data come from criminal hackers and foreign countries (often working together), we remain fixed on the idea that Big Brother, our own government, is the danger.
This may have been true in the past, when only national governments had the ability to monitor citizens. Today, as we know, a single hacker can access the most intimate details of your digital and nondigital life, your finances and your correspondence.
This is a clear case of market failure. A bank that builds identity theft and fraud into the cost of doing business is an example of market failure. A power company that treats a cyber-induced power outage as an act of God, no different from a tornado or earthquake, demonstrates market failure.
If the private sector is unwilling to take the necessary steps to guarantee the integrity of its online activities, the government must step in to fulfill its most fundamental task -- to ensure the security of its citizens; that is, to provide them with a secure identity.
Identity lies at the core of security online. Virtually all breaches of computer security involve a fake identity, be it stealing a credit card number or accessing the internal documents of the European Commission. A three-digit security code on the back of a credit card does not provide you with a secure identity, nor does an ordinary computer password. The fundamental question is whether you can be sure the person you interact with online is who he claims he is.
The key to all online security is a secure online identification system. But a nebulous fear of an imagined Big Brother prevents citizens in many places from adopting a smart-chip-based access key that would afford them secure online transactions.
In Estonia, the government has become the guarantor of secure transactions online, while identity is authenticated by a body independent of the government. We use a two-factor identification system in which the ID is protected by both a chip and a password. A binary key or public key infrastructure guarantees securely encrypted transfer of information. Thus far, our system has proved secure. Even during the DDoS attacks of 2007, our digital government system remained online and intact.
Precisely because we offer a verifiable and reliable identification system, Estonia has gone further than any other country in investing in digitizing the basic processes of society. A quarter of the electorate votes online; 95 percent of tax returns are done online, and 95 percent of prescriptions are filled online.
By the end of 2012, Estonians gave more than a hundred million digital legal signatures. Citizens, as legal owners of their own data, have access to their digital medical and dental records. And we have more and more e-services available every year.
In the future, we hope to connect our digital services and make them interoperable with our neighbors in Northern Europe. In the longer run, we're looking toward uniting systems in all of Europe. Ultimately, government data will move across borders as freely as e-mail and Facebook and follow the international flows of commerce and trade.
The job of cybersecurity is to enable a globalized economy based on the free movement of people, goods, services, capital and ideas. This can only be accomplished if identities are secure.
Undoubtedly the most effective means by which our societies could be safeguarded from cyberattacks would be to roll back the clock -- to go back to the pen, typewriter, paper and mechanical switch. We should give up on mobile phones, iPads, online banking, social media, Google searches -- everything we have become accustomed to in the modern world. But that won't happen.
Cybersecurity is not just a matter of blocking bad things a cyberattack can do; it is protecting all the good things that cyberinsecurity can prevent us from doing. Genuine cybersecurity should not be seen as an additional cost, but as an enabler, guarding our entire digital way of life.
Toomas Hendrik Ilves is the president of Estonia. He is speaking Friday at the Forum for New Diplomacy hosted in Paris by the International Herald Tribune and the Académie Diplomatique Internationale.

HEADLINE: Obama's Biggest Battle May Be Unwinnable Obama's Biggest Battle May Be Unwinnable

BYLINE: By CHRYSTIA FREELAND | REUTERS

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- Pity Barack Obama. Everything in his life experience prepared him to be the president who would take on the big challenge of the 21st century: rising income inequality and the hollowing out of the middle class.
His peripatetic youth taught him about the price of plutocracy. In an interview unearthed by Zachary A. Goldfarb of The Washington Post, Mr. Obama, plugging his autobiography, ''Dreams From My Father,'' recalled that experience in 1995 for The Hyde Park Citizen, his neighborhood edition of a newspaper that bills itself as the ''Premiere African American Weekly'' in Chicago. 
''My travels made me sensitive to the plight of those without power and the issues of class and inequalities as it relates to wealth and power,'' he said. ''Anytime you have been overseas in these so-called third world countries, one thing you see is a vast disparity of wealth of those who are part of the power structure and those outside of it.''
As an adult, he didn't take the obvious and lucrative path for an editor of the Harvard Law Review: a high-flying Wall Street career. Instead, Mr. Obama returned to Chicago and continued to focus on the issues of the underclass he had first addressed there as a community organizer.
Mr. Obama's swift political ascent soon propelled him back into the world of the plutocrats, but even as he was pocketing their donations, he worried about coming to share their worldview.
In ''The Audacity of Hope,'' his second book, Mr. Obama writes that the financiers and lawyers who backed his 2004 run for the U.S. Senate were ''smart, interesting people'' who weren't looking for a quid pro quo for backing him.
Even so, Mr. Obama feared that hanging out too much with the superrich would skew his perspective. He was concerned, he wrote, about losing sight of the ''frequent hardship of the other 99 percent of the population -- that is, the people that I'd entered public life to serve.''
It is worth noting that Mr. Obama was writing about the 99 percent in 2006 -- well before the Occupy Wall Street movement introduced that term into our collective discussion and before Mr. Obama's presidential campaign introduced him into the national debate.
All of which meant that when Mr. Obama got to the most powerful political office in the world, he arrived intellectually and psychically equipped to take on the issue that America's leading economists -- and, being a wonk, Mr. Obama consulted many of them -- were, at that moment, identifying as the big new economic fact of our time.
As things turned out, Mr. Obama didn't start his presidency by addressing income inequality head on: the small matter of a global financial crisis had to be taken care of first.
But even in the face of the gravest economic meltdown since the Great Depression, Mr. Obama pressed on with one of his key initiatives to level America's playing field: health care reform.
That drive, which cost so much political capital and yielded such a complex, emotionally unsatisfying result, is critical evidence of Mr. Obama's commitment to the 99 percent: health care had been the big missing piece in America's social safety net, a gap that became more dangerous as incomes and job security deteriorated for the middle class.
To understand the significance of Mr. Obama's health care drive, it is worth remembering that there was another huge item still left on the liberal to-do list that a different president might have focused on: climate change. Among the president's affluent backers, the green agenda trumped everything else, but for Americans experiencing ''frequent hardship,'' the financial devastation of medical bills was the more urgent problem, hence Mr. Obama's choice.
In 2012, Mr. Obama campaigned on his willingness to name inequality as the problem, and won on his promise to fix it.
''What drags down our entire economy,'' he said last spring, ''is when there is an ultrawide chasm between the ultrawealthy and everyone else.''
With his budget plan this week, Mr. Obama made good on that pledge. In the apt summary of Derek Thompson of The Atlantic, the haiku version of the president's proposal is ''tax the rich, spare the poor, remember the young.'' He wants to raise taxes at the top, including closing some of the loopholes that have enriched the plutocrats, help the poor, with measures like increasing the minimum wage, and increase opportunity for the young, with early childhood education.
Put these measures together with health care reform, recall the current American aversion to taxes and the country's sorry fiscal state, and this amounts to a rather muscular attack on income inequality.
That's where the pity comes in. Within the constraints of American politics and the American economy, Mr. Obama is addressing the issue he cares about most with a lot of energy. The tragedy is that the problem is still getting worse.
Wall Street has surged to pre-crisis highs, even as median incomes stagnate. At the very, very top, incomes are higher, and wealth is greater, than ever before.
But for the 99 percent, unemployment remains crippling, and perhaps even more worrying, the jobs that are coming back aren't as good as the jobs they are replacing.
As Annie Lowrey of The New York Times has pointed out, the National Employment Law Project did a study last year that showed lower-wage occupations were 21 percent of recession losses, but 58 percent of recovery growth. Meanwhile, mid-wage jobs were 60 percent of recession losses, but only 22 percent of recovery growth.
The problem is not, as the left sometimes complains, that Mr. Obama doesn't care, or that he isn't trying hard enough.
It is that the issue he has long been focused on has become more deeply entrenched and harder to fix over the past three decades. A diagnosis isn't enough; doing something about it requires transformational leadership and a transformational agenda. Liberals need their own Margaret Thatcher, and they haven't found her yet.

HEADLINE: Ex-KPMG Partner Is Charged in Insider Case

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
11:05 p.m. | Updated
The payments came in various forms. There were envelopes of $100 bills wrapped in $10,000 bundles. There were expensive tickets to a Bruce Springsteen concert. There was a 2011 Rolex Cosmograph Daytona valued at $12,000.
Bryan Shaw, a jeweler in the Los Angeles area, bestowed these gifts upon Scott I. London, a senior executive at the accounting giant KPMG. It was the least that he could do for Mr. London, who routinely gave him secret information about KPMG's clients. Mr. Shaw traded on the tips, earning more than $1 million in illegal profits. 
Prosecutors filed criminal charges against Mr. London on Thursday, laying bare a brazen two-year insider trading scheme. Mr. Shaw was not criminally charged, but named in a related civil action brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In recent days, both men have publicly confessed to their misconduct.
''As a leader at a major accounting firm, London's conduct was an egregious violation of his ethical and professional duties,'' said Michele Wein Layne, director of the S.E.C.'s Los Angeles office.
Early this year, Mr. Shaw turned against Mr. London after investigators confronted him with evidence of insider trading. He became a government informant, recording telephone conversations and in-person meetings to help the authorities build a case against Mr. London.
''He viewed it as an unfortunate but necessary part of the process to making things right,'' said Nathan J. Hochman, a lawyer for Mr. Shaw. Last month, Mr. Shaw participated in a sting operation to ensnare Mr. London. The F.B.I. provided Mr. Shaw with $5,000 in cash, which was placed in a manila envelope and then wrapped in a black paper bag. Mr. Shaw met Mr. London in the parking lot outside of a Starbucks and handed him the bag.
Federal agents took photographs of the exchange, and included one of them in the government's complaint. Two weeks later, two F.B.I. officials showed up at the home of Mr. London, who admitted his crimes.
The sting was an ignominious end to what had been a flourishing friendship in the San Fernando Valley. Mr. London and Mr. Shaw met in 2005, shortly after Mr. Shaw joined the North Ranch Country Club in Westlake Village, Calif. They frequently golfed together and socialized with each other's families.
Mr. London, a former college baseball player at California State University, Northridge, spent his entire career at KPMG. He worked at the firm for about 29 years, rising to a senior partner in the firm's Los Angeles office, where he supervised more than 500 accountants and oversaw the audits for some of its most important clients. He established himself as a player in Los Angeles business circles, joining the board of the city's Chamber of Commerce and serving as chairman of the Los Angeles Sports Council.
Meanwhile, Mr. Shaw's family-owned jewelry business was sputtering, having been particularly hard hit by the financial crisis. Mr. London said that in 2010, he began to give Mr. Shaw confidential information about his clients because of Mr. Shaw's deteriorating economic situation.
Over two years, Mr. London secretly passed confidential information to Mr. Shaw about several KPMG clients, including Herbalife, the nutritional supplement company; the footwear manufacturers Skechers and Deckers Outdoor Corporation; and Pacific Capital Bancorp, the government said.
Late Thursday, KMPG's chief executive, John B. Veihmeyer, said that the firm would soon be bringing legal action against Mr. London.
The tips started with leaks about companies' quarterly earnings announcements, but escalated into more lucrative secrets about pending mergers and acquisitions.
The case surfaced earlier this week, when KPMG issued a statement saying that it had fired the partner in charge of its audit practice in Southern California because of an insider trading violation and that it was resigning as auditor for two companies -- Herbalife and Skechers -- because its independence had been compromised.
Even before the government filed its charges, Mr. London and Mr. Shaw had publicly confessed to their misconduct.
''I regret my actions in leaking nonpublic data to a third party,'' Mr. London, 50, of Agoura Hills, Calif., said in a statement on Tuesday. ''What I have done was wrong and against everything that I had believed in.''
Mr. Shaw, 52, of Lake Sherwood, Calif., said he accepted ''full and complete responsibility for what I have done and know that I will spend the rest of my life trying to make up for my tragic lapses of judgment.''
Herbalife proved to be an especially fertile source of illegal tips. The company's shares have been volatile because of a public feud between prominent investors -- William A. Ackman, who has a big bet in place against the company, and Carl C. Icahn, who owns a big stake -- over the value of its stock.
In a telephone conversation that Mr. Shaw secretly recorded in February, Mr. London discussed rumors that Herbalife might be a takeover target, and outlined a classic strategy of insider trading schemes.
''What we ought to do is, when I know that it's going to start happening, what you do is you start just buying in small blocks, right, so it doesn't draw attention and then, you know, then it doesn't look unusual at all,'' Mr. London said.
Though Mr. Shaw was struggling financially, he rewarded Mr. London handsomely for the tips. He paid Mr. London more than $50,000 in cash, according to prosecutors, which he usually delivered in bags outside his store, Shaw Diamond Company, on Ventura Boulevard in Encino.
Mr. Shaw also routinely covered the cost of dinners and concerts they attended with their families, including a Springsteen show. All told, Mr. London received more than $100,000 worth of kickbacks.
Federal authorities opened an investigation last fall, after the brokerage firm Fidelity raised red flags about activity in Mr. Shaw's account.
Last summer, Fidelity froze the account, and Mr. Shaw called Mr. London in a panic, expressing worry that they had been found out.
''Mr. Shaw said that Mr. London reassured him that there was no reason for concern, and explained that insider trading was like counting cards at a casino in Las Vegas,'' the government's complaint said. ''If you were caught, they simply ask you to leave because they cannot prove it.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Blacklists an Iranian and Businesses Over Violation of Sanctions

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE

 BODY:
The United States blacklisted an affluent Iranian business executive and what it described as his multibillion-dollar money laundering network on Thursday, accusing them of selling oil for Iran in violation of the Western economic sanctions imposed over Iran's disputed nuclear program.
The Treasury Department, which administers the government's Iran sanctions, said the executive, Babak Morteza Zanjani, had conspired with First Islamic Investment Bank of Malaysia and what the department called an international network of front companies stretching halfway around the world ''for moving billions of dollars on behalf of the Iranian regime.'' 
The announcement, coming just a few days after diplomatic talks with Iran over the nuclear issue adjourned with no sign of progress, was the second high-profile Treasury action against accused violators of the Iranian sanctions in less than a month.
On March 14, the Treasury blacklisted a Greek shipping tycoon, Dimitris Cambis, over what it called his scheme to acquire a fleet of oil tankers on Iran's behalf and disguise their ownership to ship Iranian oil.
''As international sanctions have become increasingly stifling, Iran has resorted to criminal money-laundering techniques, moving its oil and money under false names and pretenses,'' said David S. Cohen, the Treasury's undersecretary who oversees the sanctions effort.
In a statement, Mr. Cohen said the action announced on Thursday reflected what he called the government's commitment to ''exposing and thwarting Iran's attempts to evade international sanctions and abuse the global financial system.''
The Treasury action also applied to a Swiss-based Iranian oil trading company, Naftiran Intertrade, which the Treasury said was owned by the National Iranian Oil Company, which has already been blacklisted.
The American sanctions freeze the assets of blacklisted individuals and companies and prohibit American dealings with them. Foreign companies that do business with any names on the blacklist run the risk of American penalties as well.
A senior Treasury official, speaking on the condition that he not be identified by name, said it was a sign of Iran's desperation that it had been forced into a money-laundering relationship with Mr. Zanjani that had been relatively easy to trace.
''These are Rube Goldberg-type networks, in efforts to try to get access to revenues, and not being able to do so in a way that escapes our attention,'' the official said.
Mr. Zanjani, who is the chairman of more than 60 companies known collectively as the Sorinet Group, based in the United Arab Emirates, did not immediately respond to e-mail requests for comment.
But it is not the first time that he has been accused of violating Western sanctions on Iran, an accusation he has denied.
Last December, the European Union identified him as a ''key facilitator of Iranian oil deals'' and forbade European Union companies or individuals from doing Iran-related business with him. Mr. Zanjani said at the time that he had done nothing wrong. ''This is a mistake,'' he was quoted by Reuters as saying.
The United States and the European Union have been using increasingly onerous economic sanctions against Iran as part of their effort to force the country to make concessions in the protracted dispute over its enrichment of uranium, which it has continued in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions requesting a halt to the enrichment.
The West has accused Iran of seeking the capacity to build nuclear weapons, an accusation that the Iranians have denied.
The sanctions have basically banished Iran from the global banking system, caused a severe devaluation in its currency and sharply reduced its ability to sell oil, the country's most important export.
Iranian leaders have called the sanctions useless bullying that will only harden their resolve to prevail.
At the same time, the lack of diplomatic progress to resolve the dispute has increased sentiment among Iran's critics for even tougher economic sanctions, including a trade embargo, and has resurrected warnings from the Obama administration that ''all options are on the table'' -- a reference to possible military action if Iran is thought to be close to the ability to make a weapon.
President Obama said last month that his administration believed it would take ''over a year or so'' for Iran to achieve that ability, and sanctions advocates said the Treasury's focus on starving Iran financially appeared to be part of that calculus.
''The Obama administration is committed to targeting the oil-related payments that are essential to Iran's ability to replenish its dwindling foreign exchange reserves,'' said Mark Dubowitz, the executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based advocacy group that has pushed for stronger sanctions.
Mr. Dubowitz said, ''The administration is in a race to intensify the pressure, and try to reach a diplomatic deal, before Iranian nuclear physics wins.''

HEADLINE: South Korea Moves to Defuse Tensions With the North

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea appeared to ease its stance on North Korea on Thursday by calling for dialogue to help defuse tensions, as its president moved to calm foreign investors whose confidence the North has tried to shake with increasingly belligerent maneuvers.
''We hope the North Korean authorities come out to the dialogue table,'' Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae, South Korea's point man on the North, said in a nationally televised statement that deplored the North's recent decision to suspend the operation of an industrial park the two Koreas have run together for eight years in the North Korean town of Kaesong. ''We strongly urge North Korea not to stoke the crisis on the Korean Peninsula any further.''
Mr. Ryoo stopped short of calling his statement an official proposal for dialogue. But it was a considerable softening in tone by President Park Geun-hye's government. 
Until now, South Korea has categorically rejected any early dialogue with the North, believing that doing so amid a torrent of North Korean threats to attack the South would amount to capitulation and would only embolden the North's brinkmanship. On Monday, Mr. Ryoo said the South had no intention of talking with North Korea anytime soon because it was unlikely to bring about "concrete results." On Tuesday, Ms. Park vowed to end a "vicious cycle" of South Korea's answering North Korea's hostilities with compromise.
''Rather than being an offer for dialogue, this is a public declaration that the problem of the Kaesong industrial complex and the North's escalating belligerent acts should be resolved through dialogue,'' Mr. Ryoo said on Thursday after reading his statement.
In London, foreign ministers from the Group of 8 industrialized nations issued a toughly worded statement in which they condemned ''in the strongest possible terms'' North Korea's development of nuclear weapons and ballistic-missile technology.
The rising tension in the region featured prominently during the meeting, which concluded with a communiqué condemning North Korea's ''current aggressive rhetoric,'' appealing to the country to abandon its nuclear weapons program and calling on it to ''refrain from further provocative acts.''
Its rocket launchings last April and December ''seriously undermine regional stability, jeopardize the prospects for lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula and threaten international peace and security,'' said the declaration from the foreign ministers of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States.
At a news conference after the meeting, William Hague, Britain's foreign secretary, who led the talks, highlighted a pledge by the ministers ''to strengthen the current sanctions regime and take further significant measures in the event of a further launch or nuclear test'' by the North. He added that the ministers were trying not to stoke tensions or feed the ''paranoid rhetoric'' from North Korea.
On Thursday, North Korea renewed its threat to attack the United States and its allies with missiles."The arrows indicating the merciless retaliatory strikes have already been drawn directing at the U.S. mainland, U.S. military bases in the Pacific and all other bases where the U.S. imperialist aggression forces station,'' the Secretariat of the North's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea said in a statement released through the country's official Korean Central News Agency.
''The powerful strike means'' have been put in their places and ''the coordinates of targets put into the warheads,'' said the committee, which usually deals with relations with South Korea. ''Just pressing the button will be enough to turn the strongholds of the enemies into the sea of fire.''
Hours before Mr. Ryoo spoke, President Park invited a group of foreign investors, including members of the American Chamber of Commerce in South Korea, to a luncheon in her presidential Blue House, assuring them that it was safe to invest in her country.
''Some of you may be worried because North Korea has been escalating tensions,'' she said. ''But South Korea has achieved a dramatic economic growth and democratization in the past 60 years despite the provocations and threats from North Korea.''
She said a joint South Korea-American military deterrent against the North and international diplomacy involving regional powers, including China, would help prevent the crisis from getting out of control. She said South Koreans ''understand the motives behind the North Korean threats and remain calm'' despite repeated crises on the peninsula that so often looked ''shocking to the outside world.''
Following Mr. Ryoo's statement, there was confusion within the government over whether it amounted to a change in official stance, according to South Korean media outlets. But they quoted anonymous government officials as saying that the statement was tantamount to a proposal for dialogue.
In a front-page article, the mass-circulation JoongAng Ilbo newspaper reported that there was criticism against ''the turnaround toward dialogue'' because it could send ''a wrong signal to the North that the South was capitulating.'' But in its editorial, the daily praised a ''brave'' initiative to defuse tensions and urged North Korea to accept the offer for dialogue.
Despite an almost daily drumbeat of belligerent rhetoric from the North, including warnings of a nuclear war on the peninsula, people here in Seoul have shown few signs of outward anxiety. They believe that North Korea will not be reckless or suicidal enough to launch a full-scale war against the South and its American ally, whose mutual defense treaty with South Korea obligates it to fight for the South in a new Korean War.
Instead, South Koreans, while expecting their leaders to be firm against North Korean provocations, oppose overreacting to North Korean rhetoric because they believe it would hurt their top priority, economic stability, analysts said.
That delicate challenge for Ms. Park was highlighted by signs that investor confidence in South Korea had been rattled by recent events.
General Motors said last week that further increases in tensions would prompt it to consider eventually relocating its production out of South Korea. The country's main stock index slipped to its lowest point since November last week, although it has inched up for a third straight day on Thursday.
North Korea on Tuesday tried to add to the tension by warning foreigners in South Korea that they should consider evacuating because the peninsula was moving toward a nuclear war. No foreign embassy in South Korea has followed upon the warning, Cho Tae-young, spokesman for the South Korean Foreign Ministry, said on Thursday.
But jitters remained in South Korea amid concerns about possible North Korean missile tests that South Korean officials said could come as early as this week.
South Korea will try to shoot down North Korean missiles with its Patriot antimissile battery should they threaten to hit its territory, Kim Min-seok, the spokesman for its Defense Ministry, said on Thursday. Mr. Kim said the North could launch missiles around Monday, the anniversary of the birth of Kim Il-sung, the late founder of North Korea and grandfather of the current leader, Kim Jong-un.
North Korea appeared to be moving several missiles repeatedly on its east coast in an apparent effort to confuse South Korean and American intelligence, the South Korean national news agency Yonhap quoted anonymous government sources as saying.

HEADLINE: Lust For Gold

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
News flash: Recent declines in the price of gold, which is off about 17 percent from its peak, show that this price can go down as well as up. You may consider this an obvious point, but, as an article in The Times on Thursday reports, it has come as a rude shock to many small gold investors, who imagined that they were buying the safest of all assets.
And thereby hangs a tale. One of the central facts about modern America is that everything is political; on the right, in particular, people choose their views about everything, from environmental science to gun safety, to suit their political prejudices. And the remarkable recent rise of ''goldbuggism,'' in the teeth of all the evidence, shows that this politicization can influence investments as well as voting. 
What do I mean by goldbuggism? Not the notion that buying gold sometimes makes sense. Gold has been a very good investment since the early 2000s, and it's probably not all bubble. One way to think about this is that gold is like a very long-term bond that's protected from inflation; and actual long-term inflation-protected bonds have also seen big price increases, reflecting a general perception that there aren't enough alternative good investments.
No, being a goldbug means asserting that gold offers unique security in troubled times; it also means asserting that all would be well if we abolished the Federal Reserve and returned to the good old gold standard, in which the value of the dollar was fixed in terms of gold and that was that. And both forms of goldbuggism soared after 2008.
In the wake of the financial crisis -- and to a considerable extent even now -- to watch business news on TV, especially on Fox, was to see a lot of talking heads touting gold, not to mention many, many ads from the likes of Goldline. Many Americans were convinced: A third of those polled by Gallup in 2011 declared that gold was the best long-term investment.
At the same time, calls for a return to the gold standard proliferated, and not just among marginal figures. Indeed, the 2012 Republican platform effectively demanded a return to gold, calling for a commission to ''investigate possible ways to set a fixed value for the dollar'' (which it took as self-evidently desirable), and making it clear that the preferred route involved a ''metallic basis'' for the currency.
So the financial crisis of 2008 brought a surge in gold fever (although that surge has abated a bit since 2011). But why?
After all, historically, gold has been anything but a safe investment. Sometimes it yields big gains, as it did in the late 1970s and again between 2001 and 2011. But that 1970s run-up was followed by an epic plunge, with the real value of gold falling by more than two-thirds.
Meanwhile, the modern world's closest equivalent to the classical gold standard is the euro, which puts European countries back under more or less the same constraints they faced when gold ruled. It's true that the European Central Bank can print money if it chooses to, but individual countries, like nations on the gold standard, can't. And who would hold up these countries' recent experience as an example of something we'd like to emulate?
So how can we rationalize the modern goldbug position? Basically, it depends on the claim that runaway inflation is just around the corner.
Why have so many people found this claim persuasive? John Maynard Keynes famously dismissed the gold standard as a ''barbarous relic,'' noting the absurdity of yoking the fortunes of a modern industrial society to the supply of a decorative metal. But he also acknowledged that ''gold has become part of the apparatus of conservatism and is one of the matters which we cannot expect to see handled without prejudice.''
And so it remains to this day. Conservative-minded people tend to support a gold standard -- and to buy gold -- because they're very easily persuaded that ''fiat money,'' money created on a discretionary basis in an attempt to stabilize the economy, is really just part of the larger plot to take away their hard-earned wealth and give it to you-know-who.
But the runaway inflation that was supposed to follow reckless money-printing -- inflation that the usual suspects have been declaring imminent for four years and more -- keeps not happening. For a while, rising gold prices helped create some credibility for the goldbugs even as their predictions about everything else proved wrong, but now gold as an investment has turned sour, too. So will we be seeing prominent goldbugs change their views, or at least lose a lot of their followers?
I wouldn't bet on it. In modern America, as I suggested at the beginning, everything is political; and goldbuggism, which fits so perfectly with common political prejudices, will probably continue to flourish no matter how wrong it proves.

B.B. King (Tuesday) The blues eminence B. B. King deserves a royal return to New York. Since he began recording in 1949, this string-bending singer-songwriter has performed some 15,000 concerts, reaped armfuls of Grammy and Hall of Fame accolades, supported numerous philanthropic causes and founded a string of well-run music lounges. He headlines a lone night at the boisterous Times Square incarnation. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (800) 745-3000, bbkingblues.com; sold out. (Anderson) 
&#x2605; Bomba Estéreo (Saturday) The ebullient quintet from Bogotá wraps traditional Colombian cumbia rhythms around psychedelic electronic beats, to whirlwind results. Its percussive fusion is a growing phenomenon in the American festival circuit: in the past few years Bomba Estéreo has performed on the sweltering dance stages of Bonnaroo, Coachella and South by Southwest. ''Elegancia Tropical'' (Soundway), the band's latest album, was released last fall. With Numasbala. At 7:30 p.m., Stage 48, 605 West 48th Street, Clinton, (212) 957-1800, stage48.com; $25. (Anderson)
Crossroads Guitar Festival with Eric Clapton (Friday and Saturday) The guitarist known as Slowhand picks up his occasional rock and blues festival -- which serves as a benefit for the Crossroads Center, his drug and alcohol rehabilitation center in Antigua -- with a bumper crop of famed six stringers: B. B. King, John Mayer, Buddy Guy, Robert Randolph, Gary Clark Jr. and many more. The lineup conspicuously skews male; rumors abound that Mr. Clapton will kick off the two-day affair with an acoustic set and a jam with the Allman Brothers. At 7:30 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (866) 858-0008, thegarden.com; $350 remaining. (Anderson)
Dengue Fever (Saturday) The Los Angeles rockers' dynamic fare is infused with contemporary Southeast Asian pop and turbulent surf psychedelics. Led by the photogenic frontwoman Chhom Nimol, the cheery group made history in 2005 as the first Westerners to tour Cambodia since Pol Pot's violent regime. With Bochan. (This event will be streamed live through Le Poisson Rouge's streaming channel.) At 7:30 p.m., Le Poisson Rouge, 158 Bleecker Street, near Thompson Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 505-3474, lepoissonrouge.com; $17 in advance, $20 at the door. (Anderson)
Fitz and the Tantrums (Tuesday) Piano-tinkling Motown soul gets an infusion of Bowie-esque hauteur from the singer Michael Fitzpatrick, who spars with the vocalist Noelle Scaggs, in this vivacious ensemble from Los Angeles. Their debut effort, ''Pickin' Up the Pieces'' (Dangerbird), bursts with danceable hooks. With Hunter Hunted. At 8 p.m., the Studio at Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600, websterhall.com/events; sold out. (Anderson)
&#x2605; Mika (Friday) The classically trained dance-pop chameleon glides onstage as ably as the Scissor Sisters while beseeching the disco gods above with a Freddie Mercury-worthy lilt. His 2012 record, ''The Origin of Love'' (Island/Casablanca), is a nod to Los Angeles rock from the 1970s with coy electro overtones; the overall effect is still theatrical yet sincere. At 9 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (800) 745-3000, musichallofwilliamsburg.com; sold out. (Anderson)
&#x2605; Muse (Monday and Tuesday) For a band once widely considered a Radiohead facsimile -- especially as it released its 2003 mainstream smash, ''Absolution'' (Warner Brothers/WEA) -- Muse has veered in a different course ever since, packing its art-rock discs with dramatic, arena-baiting hooks atop symphonic and progressive experimentation. Its 2012 release, ''The 2nd Law'' (Warner Brothers), cavorted in the band's most epic spaces yet, complete with disco and dubstep interjections. With Biffy Clyro. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (866) 858-0008, thegarden.com; $32.50 to $65. (Anderson)
&#x2605; Shuggie Otis (Thursday through April 20) The R&B singer and multi-instrumentalist committed rock and roll heresy in the mid-'70s when he declined an offer to join the Rolling Stones on tour. His popular singles ''Strawberry Letter 23'' (recorded by the Brothers Johnson) and ''Inspiration Information'' -- as well as stellar R&B genes from his father, the bandleader pioneer Johnny Otis -- kept him a strong solo draw for most of the decade. This month Epic and Legacy Records will release the out-of-print ''Inspiration Information'' album and ''Wings of Love,'' with 14 previously unreleased tracks. Thursday and April 20 at 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (800) 745-3000, bbkingblues.com; $42 in advance, $50 at the door; sold out on Thursday.

Graham Parker and the Rumour (Sunday) The British rocker Mr. Parker and his reunited band support the recent release of ''Three Chords Good'' (Primary Wave), their invigorated first album since ''The Up Escalator'' (Stiff) of 1980. They also had small and fairly self-immolating roles in Judd Apatow's recent film, ''This Is 40.'' April 14 at 7 p.m., Gramercy Theater, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (800) 745-3000, livenation.com; $29.50 remaining. (Anderson)
______ Jeans (Saturday) Not much less abrasive than its (unprintable) full name, this torpidly hefty band from Allentown, Pa., tweaks grunge heaviness with sludge-metal's potent thrum; the result is a generally unholy union akin to Mudhoney fusing with Eyehategod. Its third album, ''King of Jeans'' (Sub Pop), breaks the tension with occasional, portentous spoken growls. With Roomrunner and Yi. At 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (800) 745-3000, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Anderson)
Rick Ross (Friday) The rapper's much-anticipated fifth studio album, ''God Forgives, I Don't'' (Maybach/Def Jam), landed last year after numerous delays. So far this year the brusque ''Teflon Don'' has made headlines for surviving a drive-by shooting and contributing a widely condemned lyric to Rocko's underground single ''U.O.E.N.O.,'' on which he seems to condone rape. At 7:30 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, Uniondale, on Long Island, (800) 745-3000, nassaucoliseum.com; $40 to $125. (Anderson)
&#x2605; Suuns (Monday) The prog-rockers from Montreal take Hemingway-like economy with their tunes, stacking small fragments of dissonant melody into dense, enormous waves. Their debut album, ''Zeroes QC,'' merely suggested the sensational power of their live jams; the follow-up, ''Images Du Futur'' (both Secretly Canadian), carried a sinister pace and came closer to their thundering stage experience. With Weeknight. At 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (800) 745-3000, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Anderson)
Martha Wainwright (Wednesday) A member of the genetically blessed McGarrigle-Wainwright musical clan, Ms. Wainwright is a confessional folk-rock singer-songwriter of reedy, quiet strength. Her live covers CD, ''Sans Fusils, Ni Souliers, à Paris: Martha Wainwright's Piaf Record'' (V2), revealed prodigious abilities for jazz crooning as well.

HEADLINE: A Busy California Port Seeks to Grow, but a Neighbor Objects

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
LONG BEACH, Calif. -- Just before officials at the Port of Los Angeles unanimously approved a plan for a vast new railyard last month, the mayor of Long Beach was incensed. How dare they, he angrily asked at a public meeting, value the lives of residents on Los Angeles's side of the border more than those who live in his city.
It was a provocative statement from the mayor of this city of nearly half a million people, where the port, one of the busiest in the nation, has long driven the economy. For years, Mayor Bob Foster said, he has favored development projects in the region, looking for ways for the port to bring in more business. But the $500 million project by the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway would increase traffic and pollution and have a devastating effect on residents in adjacent working-class neighborhoods, he said.
''This is really taking advantage of poor people for the advantage of others,'' Mr. Foster said in an interview. ''The city of Los Angeles and a major corporation are really treating Long Beach in a deplorable manner -- one city is literally ignoring another city's residents. We're asking them to be clean and to be a good neighbor and help mitigate this, but they're basically thumbing their nose at us.'' 
The fight over the proposed railyard, which would serve as a large center for trains that move shipping containers from the Port of Los Angeles to other parts of the country, is the region's biggest battle yet over threatened competition from the expansion of the Panama Canal, set to be completed by 2015.
Community activists say the project's supporters have ignored the negative effects it would have on the neighborhood already hurt by pollution, but those who back it contend that it is the most environmentally friendly way to grow businesses in the region and maintain the port's dominance.
''We have to start moving things faster and cleaner, and we have to have the infrastructure to do that as close to the port as you can, which is what this does,'' said Wally Baker, the chairman of Beat the Canal, a coalition of industry and labor groups supporting projects that they say will bring thousands of jobs to the area. ''The last thing we want to do is create more uncertainty. That's the kind of goofy thing that drives business away from California.''
The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach have long been economic engines for the region, which is now home to the nation's largest hub of distribution warehouses that sort the imported goods before they are sent to retailers across the country.
Roughly 40 percent of the country's container imports, including cars, clothing and household items, mostly from Asia, pass through the two ports, making it the sixth-busiest harbor in the world. Many here worry that competition with ports on the East Coast is the most important threat, because so many of the products that arrive in Long Beach and Los Angeles are on their way elsewhere, often crisscrossing through a web of trains and trucks to get to consumers in the East.
Other ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are rushing to make significant changes to compete with the widened Panama Canal. Last year, the Obama administration moved to speed up the review process to deepen the harbor for many of the ports, saying that deeper harbors would help to create new jobs and strengthen the economy.
Mr. Baker's group has estimated that the ports could lose 100,000 jobs once the Panama Canal expansion allows larger ships to bypass California and go directly to the East Coast. Without the canal's expansion, these larger ships could not fit through the waterway. And while Mr. Foster and Long Beach port officials have said that they do not see an immediate threat in the expansion, Los Angeles officials seem to disagree.
David Arian, a retired longshoreman and the vice president of the commission that oversees the Port of Los Angeles, called the railyard ''essential to our future.''
''It is the only way to stay competitive, it's the only way to deal with the canal,'' he said during the hearing in March to approve the project. ''It's the only way we're going to get that market share.''
Officials from the port declined to comment further, concerned that they could provide more fodder for a lawsuit from the plan's opponents.
The ports have long been known as the biggest contributors to air pollution in the region, with local officials complaining that such pollution has caused an epidemic of asthma, stunted lung development in children and chronic lung disease in adults.
But in recent years the ports have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to clean up their operations. In 2006, they approved policies that now ban the use of any truck built before 2007. Both ports are also expanding plans to require some of the ships to shut down their power generators, which run on diesel fuel, and instead ''plug in'' and use the electric power grid at the docks.
The railyard project, known as the Southern California International Gateway, would create a 153-acre cargo depot just off Interstate 710 along the western edge of Long Beach, bordering Los Angeles. Roughly 5,500 trucks would use it daily, according to a report by the Los Angeles Harbor Department.
Los Angeles port and railway officials say that taking trucks off the local freeway and shortening the distance they must travel will improve the air quality and lower the health risk for the region. They have also promised to spend $100 million on energy-efficient machinery and other technologies for the project.
''We have a plan that helps the region as a whole, both with jobs and the economy, and in addition the environmental impact is better, not worse,'' said Lena Kent, a spokeswoman for the rail company.
''Why in the world would you not want to get behind a project that does all that?''
But Andrea Hricko, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California who has evaluated the effect of pollution in the area, dismissed the claim as misleading, because the railyard would increase capacity in the region over all.
The railyard would replace a handful of trucking and other industrial companies that sit on the large plot of land just behind the working class residential neighborhood of West Long Beach, which local residents already refer to as the ''diesel death zone'' because of its proximity to so many trucks.
The local park was mostly empty one recent afternoon, perhaps because it was impossible to escape the smell from the exhaust coming from the trucks several feet away.
''People in this neighborhood completely lose,'' Ms. Hricko said. ''There is no question about it, you cannot have thousands of trucks coming in each day and say that is an improvement.''
Mr. Foster, Long Beach's mayor, said that he wanted a buffer park between the railyard and residential areas, along with a stronger commitment to zero emission technology for the future and money to help residents install better windows and air filtration systems.
John Cross, who has lived in the neighborhood for more than 60 years and is now the president of the West Long Beach Residential Association, dismissed the idea that because the area is already near an industrial site, more should be added.
''If you have a pile of you-know-what, you don't just add more on it because it's there,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Jersey Shore, Damaged by Sandy, Is Ready to Run

BYLINE: By JEN A. MILLER

 BODY:
When Joe Gigas, the executive director of the New Jersey Marathon, returned to his home in Long Branch after evacuating for Hurricane Sandy, he found that the ocean had ripped off one side of his house and sucked out the contents of four rooms.
Still, only a week after the storm, he announced on the races' Facebook page that the New Jersey Marathon and the Long Branch Half Marathon would be contested in 2013, although he did not know how, or where. 
Unlike the New York City Marathon, which was scheduled for Nov. 4, less than a week after the storm, the New Jersey races had the benefit of time. Gigas had six months to meet with eight Monmouth County municipalities, rework the courses so they avoided damaged roads and broken boardwalks, haggle with USA Track & Field over differences in maps -- the national organization's map showed the marathon course to be 200 meters short of 26.2 miles -- and then have the races certified, all by May 5.
USA Track & Field measured and certified the courses Thursday. Without certification, runners would not be able to use their race times to qualify for elite races like the Boston Marathon.
''It's still raw,'' Gigas said last month. ''Homeowners are not back in their houses yet. I'm not back in my house yet.'' (Gigas said he was living in a rental.)
When he approached town officials about the marathon this year, their reaction, he said, was not no but whether it would be safe. All eight towns eventually signed off on it.
The two races start at the Monmouth Park racetrack in Oceanport, and the first miles wind through Oceanport and Monmouth Beach, which were flooded by Sandy. More than half of Oceanport's 2,400 homes were damaged. In Monmouth Beach, the course will pass many houses that look fine on the outside but have Dumpsters and storage units in the driveway, because of the work that needs to be done on them. Some houses will be on jacks, as they are being raised to meet new elevation requirements set by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
For Adam Schneider, the mayor of Long Branch, there was no question the races would be run. He said they would uplift residents, many of whom have parties along the racecourse. Then there is the economic benefit, which is especially needed this year. The half marathon and the full marathon end in Long Branch, and Schneider estimated that 15,000 people line the final miles to the finish.
''It's a relatively early spring day, and if we didn't have a race, there would be very few people in town,'' he said. ''Instead, we're busting from the seams.''
He said he would be a part of it, too, running the Long Branch Half for the fourth time.
Ninety percent of the two courses will remain the same, but rerouting the other 10 percent was tricky. The half marathon runs through three towns, the full marathon through eight. Gigas had to obtain approval of the new routes from each police department and town government before submitting them to USA Track & Field.
Some landmark features of the marathon had to be sacrificed. In Asbury Park, it is typically run on the boardwalk, through the Grand Arcade of Convention Hall, where Bruce Springsteen has often rehearsed before touring, and the vestibule of the Casino, a former concert and amusement hall razed several years ago. Boardwalk repairs are scheduled to be completed by the end of April, but that did not leave enough time for the new course to be certified. Instead, runners will go down Kingsley Street and make the cross into Ocean Grove over a narrow pedestrian bridge. Because of that detour, there will be no wheelchair race in the full marathon this year.
Gigas said the bridge was not the only factor making this year's course less than ideal. The route also requires an abrupt turn around at a cone in Ocean Grove, which can throw off runners' pace and cadence. Among them will be Oz Pearlman, a New York City magician and two-time winner who set the course record in 2011 with a time of 2 hours 28 minutes 19 seconds.
Jen Matz, who spent her childhood summers at the Jersey Shore, will be running the Long Branch Half for the first time. She ran the Seaside Half Marathon two weeks before Hurricane Sandy, which destroyed a family member's home in Lavallette, farther south on the Jersey Shore. Matz, who grew up in Monmouth County, but now lives in South Carolina, is running to promote the shore area. She said she would write about it on her blog at runnerstrials.com.
''Maybe things don't look exactly like they did, but the Jersey Shore is still a great place to go and race,'' she said. ''I want to draw attention to that.''
So far, registrations for the half marathon are slightly down from last year, but those for the full marathon are up 15 percent. Gigas expects about 3,500 people to run the marathon, the most in its 17-year history.
''I never really got that phrase Jersey Strong,'' said Gigas, who grew up in New Hampshire. ''But watching these municipalities deal with this, and then there's me asking, 'Can I run through your town?' No one said no. It's that Jersey can-do attitude.''

HEADLINE: Weather and Holiday Hinder March Retail Sales

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
As cold weather lingered across most of the country, Americans shopped modestly in March.
Retailers reported that a benchmark sales figure rose slightly during the month, as shoppers held back on spending because of cold weather across the nation, particularly in the Midwest and East Coast, and continued fears about the economy.
Retail analysts and industry executives, however, said they expected sales to pick up in April. 
According to a preliminary tally of 15 retailers by the International Council of Shopping Centers, sales in stores open at least a year rose 1.4 percent in March, or 2.2 percent excluding drugstores. That was below expectations, said Michael Niemira, chief economist at the council.
Sales in stores open at least one year is a prime measure of a retailer's financial health, because it excludes stores that open or close during the year.
Weather was a factor, with March being the coldest in seven years. The comparison with March 2012 was especially tough, since last year had the warmest March on record, according to Planalytics, a weather research firm.
''Wintry weather conditions persisted deep into March, depressing spring apparel, home and garden and seasonal merchandise sales,'' said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. At the same time, the payroll tax increase that took effect in January and the uncertain economy have weighed on spending, he said.
Analysts often like to combine March and April to get a clearer picture of shoppers' habits, because of volatile weather patterns at that time of year and the effect of the Easter holiday, which moves around the calendar.
Mr. Perkins said he expected April to be stronger, as the weather improves and customers respond to strong fashion trends such as colorful jeans and prints. An earlier Easter, which meant one fewer selling day in March if stores were closed or a low-sales day if they stayed open, will also help April results, he said. In addition, shoppers should benefit from tax refunds and falling gas prices.
The number of retailers reporting monthly sales has been shrinking. Big names like Target, Macy's and Nordstrom have recently stopped reporting. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, has not reported monthly sales in several years.
With the shrinking list, Costco Wholesale, which posted a 6 percent sales gain in February, now accounts for about two-thirds of the revenue in the tally. In total, the retailers that report monthly data represent about 6 percent of the $2.4 trillion in retail industry sales.
A clearer picture of retail sales will emerge when the government reports retail sales figures on Friday. Costco Wholesale's sales rose 4 percent in March, short of analysts' expectations for a 5.2 percent rise.
TJX, which operates TJX and Home Goods stores, said revenue in stores open at least a year fell 2 percent, while analysts expected a 1 percent drop. The company said that the drop was a result of the weather and the Easter shift, and that they expected a stronger April.
''Overall business trends improved as the weather became warmer,'' TJX's chief executive, Carol Meyrowitz, said. ''April is off to a good start.''
L Brands, formerly Limited Brands, the parent of Victoria's Secret and Bath and Body Works, said their revenue figure was flat, above the drop expected by analysts.
Gap said its sales fell 1 percent, a smaller drop than the 2.1 percent analysts expected. The company said the earlier Easter had hurt results.

Previews and Openings
'The Assembled Parties' (in previews; opens on Wednesday) Nobody could accuse Richard Greenberg of slacking this season. Within weeks of unveiling his take on ''Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' and a month ahead of the ''Far From Heaven'' musical adaptation for which he wrote the book, Mr. Greenberg introduces this new work. Directed by Lynne Meadow for Manhattan Theater Club, it focuses on a well-heeled Upper West Side Jewish family whose stability is threatened at the dawn of the 21st century. The cast includes Jessica Hecht, Judith Light and Jeremy Shamos. Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (David Rooney) 
'The Big Knife' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) Following last year's sterling revival of ''Golden Boy,'' the Clifford Odets appreciation season continues with this production from Roundabout Theater Company. The caustic 1949 work drew on Odets's firsthand experience as a Hollywood screenwriter to observe the machinations behind the studio management of a star embroiled in a scandal that threatens to end his career. Doug Hughes directs an ensemble headed by Bobby Cannavale and Marin Ireland, along with the veterans Richard Kind and Chip Zien. American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Rooney)
'Bunty Berman Presents...' (previews start on Friday; opens on May 9) The New Group had a hit in 2008 with Ayub Khan-Din's ''Rafta, Rafta...,'' a delightful comedy about Indian families in England's working-class North West. The same playwright returns with another ellipsis, this time attached to a Bollywood-style musical about a 1950s Bombay film producer whose star is fading, along with that of his once adored leading man. Mr. Khan-Din wrote the book and lyrics, and shared composing duties with Paul Bogaev. After doing a bang-up job on the earlier work, Scott Elliott again directs. Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'The Call' (in previews; opens on Sunday) No, it's not a stage version of the Halle Berry girl-in-peril movie. Tanya Barfield's politically charged drama concerns a couple whose choice to adopt a child from Africa leads them to question their identity as white Americans. Leigh Silverman directs the co-production between Playwrights Horizons and Primary Stages, with a strong cast that includes Kelly AuCoin, Kerry Butler, Eisa Davis, Crystal A. Dickinson and Russell G. Jones. Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Rooney)
'Collapse' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) As the title suggests, Allison Moore's comedy depicts a world falling apart. Widely produced at theaters across the country over the past two years, the play centers on four middle-class people trapped when the Interstate 35W bridge in Minneapolis collapsed into the Mississippi River in 2007, their woes further fueled by the global financial crisis the next year, post-traumatic stress disorder and sex addiction. The production comes courtesy of the Women's Project, with Jackson Gay directing. New York City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Rooney)
'The Dance of Death' (in previews; opens on Thursday) A New York company whose mission is to shake the starch out of classical theater, Red Bull presents this new Strindberg adaptation by Mike Poulton, best known for his 2003 take on Turgenev's ''Fortune's Fool.'' Joseph Hardy directs Daniel Davis, Laila Robins and Derek Smith in the savage battle of wills that ensues when a figure from the past intrudes on the sour marriage of a military captain and a former actress on an isolated island. Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 352-3101, redbulltheater.com. (Rooney)
'Furry' (opens on Thursday) If those makeshift Times Square costumes of Cookie Monster, Buzz Lightyear and Spider-Man didn't already make you a tad uneasy, William Burke's new play should do the trick. It's about a mentally unstable man in an Elmo suit looking to expand his turf among the Midtown tourists by any means necessary, with Sun Tzu (''The Art of War'') and Margaret Wise Brown (''Goodnight Moon'') as his mentors. Jack, 505 1/2 Waverly Avenue, at Fulton Street, Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, jackny.org. (Eric Grode)
'Here Lies Love' (in previews; opens on April 23) You were expecting a conventional bio-musical from a creative team that includes the maverick musicians David Byrne and Fatboy Slim, the director Alex Timbers and the choreographer Annie-B Parson? Exploring the abuse of power, this show deconstructs the journey of the former Filipina first lady and shoe hoarder Imelda Marcos as an immersive dance-club experience. The audience stands throughout, weaving among the performers in a 360-degree scenic and video environment. Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Rooney)
'I'll Eat You Last: A Chat With Sue Mengers' (in previews; opens on April 24) One fabulous larger-than-life broad who blazed through the 1970s takes on another in this solo vehicle by John Logan (''Red''), fresh off rejuvenating the James Bond franchise with his screenplay for ''Skyfall.'' Though fans can lament that Bette Midler won't be singing in her first Broadway appearance in more than 30 years, Miss M should find ample scope for her irrepressible wit in this portrait of the Hollywood superagent, renowned for her stellar client list, her parties, her caftans and her sailor-mouth vocabulary. Joe Mantello directs. Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Jekyll & Hyde' (in previews; opens on Thursday) The indefatigable composer Frank Wildhorn was a short-term tenant on Broadway with ''Wonderland'' and ''Bonnie & Clyde.'' But this show, which features a book and lyrics by Leslie Bricusse, ran for almost four years in its 1997 production and went on to play across the globe. Starring as Robert Louis Stevenson's 19th-century London medic with the dangerous personality disorder is Constantine Maroulis, with Deborah Cox as the kindhearted prostitute Lucy. Directed and choreographed by Jeff Calhoun, the production plays a 13-week engagement at the end of its national tour. Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway at West 46th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Rooney)
'Julius Caesar' (in previews; opens on Friday) Gregory Doran, the recently appointed artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, conceived this fresh twist on the political tragedy after reading margin annotations in a copy of the text passed around by prisoners on Robben Island, among them Nelson Mandela. Performed by an all-black British cast and featuring live contemporary West African music composed by Akintayo Akinbode, this reinterpretation traces parallels between ancient Rome and Africa's turbulent history over the past half-century. Harvey Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org. (Rooney)
'The Last Will' (in previews; opens on Wednesday) Austin Pendleton directs (and stars in) this final chapter in Robert Brustein's trilogy examining the life of William Shakespeare, presented by the Abingdon Theater Company. Following ''Mortal Terror'' and ''The English Channel,'' the play speculates on the mysteries of Shakespeare's later years back in Stratford. It posits that a fatal illness clouded his ability to distinguish fact from fiction, prompting him to accuse his neglected wife of cuckolding him with his brother, while Richard Burbage urged the addled playwright to return to London and resume working. June Havoc Theater, Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-2055, abingdontheatre.org. (Rooney)
'Macbeth' (in previews; opens on April 21) Two figures clinically survey the action, but the speaking roles are the exclusive domain of Alan Cumming in this feverish reimagining of the Scottish play as the obsessive torment of a haunted psychiatric patient. The Tony-winning director John Tiffany (''Once'') and Andrew Goldberg (''The Bomb-itty of Errors'') stage the audacious National Theater of Scotland production, seen briefly in New York last summer at the Lincoln Center Festival. It lands on Broadway for 73 performances, giving a wider audience the chance to watch the polysexual Mr. Cumming ply his erotic skills on himself as an incentive for murder. Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Mayday Mayday' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on April 22) The last time Tristan Sturrock was on the stage of St. Ann's Warehouse, he was playing the extremely active male lead in ''Brief Encounter.'' Who would have guessed that just a few years earlier, with a baby on the way, he was crumpled at the base of a wall with a broken neck? This solo show demonstrates how he got from there to here. It's directed by Katy Carmichael, who would know a thing or two about the subject matter: She was the pregnant wife at the time. St. Ann's Warehouse, 29 Jay Street, at Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org. (Grode)
'The Memory Show' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on April 30) Perhaps the success of ''Next to Normal,'' which dealt with bipolar disorder, has paved the way for musical treatments of other health woes. This piece by Zach Redler and Sara Cooper also follows a family (here a mother and a daughter) as it grapples with the mother's illness (Alzheimer's disease). Joe Calarco directed Catherine Cox and the up-and-comer Leslie Kritzer in a Barrington Stage Company production in 2010, and now all three are doing the same for the adventurous Transport Group.

'Motown: the Musical' (in previews; opens on Sunday) He has been a boxer, a record store owner and perhaps the greatest hit-making producer of all time, so why shouldn't Berry Gordy add Broadway book writer to his résumé? He has a decent safety net in the form of the peerless Motown song catalog, which includes several tunes he had a part in writing. Expect to see and hear Smokey, Diana, Marvin and many, many, many others, all directed by Charles Randolph-Wright and supported by a relatively luxurious 18-piece orchestra. Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Grode)
'The Nance' (in previews; opens on Monday) A stock figure of traditional burlesque, the nance was a stereotypical sissy usually played by a heterosexual performer. That's not the case in Douglas Carter Beane's new play, which stars Nathan Lane in the title role of a man juggling his career as a beloved stage headliner with a messy secret life in the gay underground of 1930s New York. Jack O'Brien directs an ensemble that reunites Mr. Lane with his ''Producers'' cast mate Cady Huffman. Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Nikolai and the Others' (in previews; opens on May 6) The always inventive David Cromer directs a large cast that includes Blair Brown, Michael Cerveris, Alvin Epstein, Kathryn Erbe, John Glover and Stephen Kunken in this latest excursion into history from Richard Nelson. Set in Westport, Conn., during a spring weekend in 1948, the play considers the questionable ways in which American art was financed at the start of the cold war. It focuses on a gathering of Russian émigrés, including George Balanchine and Igor Stravinsky, retracing the roots of their collaboration on the ballet ''Orpheus.'' Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Orphans' (in previews; opens on Thursday) Alec Baldwin returns to Broadway post-''30 Rock,'' flanked by Ben Foster and Tom Sturridge in Lyle Kessler's 1983 drama about two almost feral brothers holed up alone in a run-down North Philadelphia row house, and the wealthy kidnapped criminal who becomes a surrogate father to them. A week into rehearsals the production made headlines when Shia LaBeouf abruptly exited after backstage disagreements; Mr. Foster stepped in to take his place. Daniel Sullivan directs. Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Pippin' (in previews; opens on April 25) The 1970s redux on Broadway didn't fare well last season, with neither ''Godspell'' nor ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' sticking around long. But Diane Paulus managed to make the countercultural relic ''Hair'' feel vital and relevant in her thrilling 2009 revival. So she might also be the right person to give a fresh take on Stephen Schwartz and Roger O. Hirson's 1972 show about a restless royal heir seeking his ''Corner of the Sky.'' First seen at the American Repertory Theater, where Ms. Paulus is artistic director, the show features Matthew James Thomas, Patina Miller, Terrence Mann, Charlotte d'Amboise and Andrea Martin, with circus and acrobatic elements created by Gypsy Snider of the Montreal-based troupe 7 Fingers. Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Plenty of Time' (in previews; opens on Thursday) John Shévin Foster, under the auspices of the New Federal Theater, has taken the conceit of ''Same Time, Next Year'' -- a decades-spanning look at the annual tryst carried on by one couple -- and transposed it to the racial ferment of the late 1960s. Here it is a Black Panther (Jackie Alexander, who also directs) and a Southern debutante (Traci Tolmaire) who try to keep the flame burning over more than 30 years. Castillo Theater, 543 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 941-5800, castillo.org. (Grode)
'The Rascals: Once Upon a Dream' (previews start Monday; opens on Thursday) First seen in December at the Capitol Theater in Port Chester, N.Y., this show, written by Steven Van Zandt, who is also a co-director and co-producer, ''fondly traces the band's story with the 1960s very much in view,'' Jon Pareles wrote in his review for The Times. Billed as a ''hybrid of a rock 'n' roll concert and a Broadway show,'' this production reunites the original band members -- Felix Cavaliere, Eddie Brigati, Dino Danelli and Gene Cornish -- for a concert performance that also outlines the group's history through archival footage, filmed re-enactments and narration. Expect to hear hits like ''It's a Beautiful Morning,'' ''Good Lovin' '' and ''Groovin'.'' Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Nicole Herrington)
'Richard III: Born With Teeth' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on April 21) The logo for this modern-day adaptation by Epic Theater Ensemble actually crosses out the name of Shakespeare's hunchbacked usurper, replacing it with that apocryphal natal dental factoid from the play. (What's the big deal? One out of every 2,000 to 3,000 babies is born with teeth, and how many of those order the execution of a pair of preteens?) It's part of the National Endowment for the Arts program Shakespeare for a New Generation. Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 270-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Grode)
'The Testament of Mary' (in previews; opens on April 22) Before it became a searing novella, the Irish author Colm Toibin's eloquently humanized first-person account of the post-Crucifixion years of Mary, mother of Jesus, was an acclaimed monologue performed at the Dublin Theater Festival in 2011 by Marie Mullan under the direction of Garry Hynes. This new production, starring Fiona Shaw, is the latest chapter in the long and fruitful creative partnership between Ms. Shaw and the director Deborah Warner, whose work together was last seen on Broadway in a blazing ''Medea'' in 2002. Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'The Trip to Bountiful' (in previews; opens on April 23) The director Michael Wilson has a distinguished history staging the work of Horton Foote, most recently with ''Dividing the Estate'' and ''The Orphans' Home Cycle.'' In his production of Foote's 1953 drama, Cicely Tyson returns to Broadway for the first time in 30 years to play Carrie Watts, a role that has won acclaim for Lillian Gish, Geraldine Page and Lois Smith. The lead character is an elderly Texas woman determined to make one final journey to her hometown, against the wishes of her family. Starring alongside Ms. Tyson are Cuba Gooding Jr., Vanessa Williams, Condola Rashad and Tom Wopat. Stephen Sondheim Theater, 124 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
Broadway
'Ann' Holland Taylor wrote and stars in this solo show about Ann Richards, the straight-shooting onetime governor of Texas. Ms. Taylor's engaging performance goes beyond impersonation, though the script is neither a dramatically shapely piece of writing nor a deeply probing character study (1:55). Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, lct.org. (Charles Isherwood)
'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may occasionally feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Katie Finneran and Anthony Warlow (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Breakfast at Tiffany's' Holly Golightly does not. Go lightly, that is. Everyone in this lugubrious stage adaptation of Truman Capote's beloved 1958 novella gives the impression that what they're doing onstage is hard labor. Sean Mathias directs Richard Greenberg's adaptation with a cast that includes Cory Michael Smith, George Wendt and as Holly, Emilia Clarke (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Kinky Boots' Cyndi Lauper has created a love-and-heat-seeking score that performs like a pop star on Ecstasy. This Harvey Fierstein-scripted tale of lost souls in shoe business, in which a young factory owner (Stark Sands) teams up with a drag queen (Billy Porter), sometimes turns into a sermon. But it's hard to resist the audience-hugging charisma of the songs (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Lucky Guy' Nora Ephron's elegy and valentine to the rough-and-tumble of big-city newsrooms and scoop-hungry reporters, starring Tom Hanks as the columnist Michael McAlary, is written with a true fan's avidity. Directed with bells and whistles by George C. Wolfe, this is less a fully developed play than a boisterous swapping of fond anecdotes about the end of a life and the end of an era (2:00). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Nice Work if You Can Get It' Every now and then a bubble of pure, tickling charm rises from the artificial froth of this pastiche 1920s musical, directed by Kathleen Marshall and featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin. But mostly the production, starring Matthew Broderick, registers as a shiny, dutiful trickle of gags and production numbers (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella' This ultimate and most enduring of makeover stories, via the team who gave us ''Oklahoma!,'' has been restyled by the director Mark Brokaw and the writer Douglas Carter Beane into a glittery patchwork of snark and sincerity, with a whole lot of fancy ball gowns. Laura Osnes and Santino Fontana are the appealing leading lovers (2:20). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike' Portraying a woman mired in what appears to be a permanent midlife crisis, the marvelous comic actor Kristine Nielsen provides much of the laughing gas in Christopher Durang's uneven but intermittently delightful riff on Chekhovian themes. David Hyde Pierce and Sigourney Weaver also star in Nicholas Martin's production, smoothly transferred from a sellout run Off Broadway (2:30).

&#x2605; 'All in the Timing' One of the zestier plates of theatrical tapas to be had. This 20th-anniversary production of David Ives's popular anthology of mini-plays, directed by John Rando, leaves you feeling lighter, but not emptier. There's nutrition in these sketches about (gulp!) relativity and randomness, and surprising substance in their silliness. Carson Elrod leads a bouncy cast (1:45). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, primarystages.org. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Buyer & Cellar' Jonathan Tolins has concocted an irresistible one-man play from the most peculiar of fictitious premises -- an underemployed Los Angeles actor goes to work in Barbra Streisand's Malibu basement -- allowing the playwright to ruminate with delicious wit and perspicacity on the solitude of celebrity, the love-hate attraction between gay men and divas, and the melancholy that lurks beneath narcissism. In the capable hands of the director Stephen Brackett and the wickedly charming actor Michael Urie, this seriously funny slice of absurdist whimsy creates the illusion of a stage filled with multiple people, all of them with their own droll point of view (1:30). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (866) 811-4111, rattlestick.org. (Rooney)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
&#x2605; 'Donnybrook!' This revival of Johnny Burke and Robert E. McEnroe's 1961 musical (itself an adaptation of ''The Quiet Man,'' the 1952 St. Patrick's Day perennial about an Irish-American boxer's fraught courtship of a redheaded spitfire), jettisons the most dated, disturbing and indulgent elements of the movie but retains the essential sentimental blarney. With a fine cast and crisp direction by Charlotte Moore, the result is as fresh as a morning after rain in the west of Ireland (2:15). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Andy Webster)
&#x2605; 'Forbidden Broadway: Alive and Kicking' Gerard Alessandrini's essential satirical cheat sheet to Broadway musicals returns after a three-year absence, packing polished brass knuckles. A precisionist cast of four provides vocal cartoons as evocative as Al Hirschfeld's caricatures. This show not only tickles but also pierces the Achilles' heels of the productions under scrutiny (1:40). At the 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Webster)
&#x2605; '_______ Up Everything' The unprintable title of this winsome rock musical is trying way too hard to shock and awe. But then, so are all the show's characters, who are Brooklyn faux-hemians desperately trying to prove their anti-establishment bona fides. Poking fun at the pasty-white underbelly of Brooklyn's hipster crowd is like shooting free-range ducks in an artisanal barrel, but with catchy music and a talented cast, this show still does so exquisitely well (1:35). Elektra Theater, 669 Eighth Avenue, at 42nd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, fueonstage.com. (Catherine Rampell)
'Fuenteovejuna' Sometimes, when your boss starts raping and pillaging in the office, the grunts just have to beat him to death with a calculator. If that premise is confusing, so is the rest of a new adaptation of this 17th-century classic play, about a gallant Spanish town that rose up and killed its tyrannical overlord but refused to implicate anyone in his death. The production retains its original Spanish (with English subtitles) but has been poorly grafted onto a modern-day office setting (1:20). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 225-9999, repertorio.org. (Rampell)
&#x2605; 'Good With People' A beautiful, deceptive wisp of a play, David Harrower's two-character drama, set in a Scottish hotel, is a story of how people haunt their own lives, failing ever to be entirely present no matter where they are. Blythe Duff and Andrew Scott-Ramsay are the entire (and excellent) cast. George Perrin directs with light and icy fingers (1:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Brantley)
'Hit the Wall' Ike Holter's impassioned evocation of the Stonewall Riots and Eric Hoff's vigorous production are strongest when stylized interpretation eclipses conventional realism. A hit in Chicago last year, the drama is being staged just a stone's throw from Christopher Park in Greenwich Village where the events depicted occurred, amplifying the historical echoes of the sweltering June night in 1969 when drag queens, gay men and lesbians pushed back during a routine police raid. While the freewheeling play traffics in stereotype and anachronism with mixed results, it adopts a vernacular that speaks sincerely and directly to today's gay youth, inviting them to honor the earlier generation that broke the chains of marginalization and invisibility (1:35). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Rooney)
'The Last Five Years' Jason Robert Brown has mounted a stylish production of his two-character musical about the waxing and waning of young love. Adam Kantor and Betsy Wolfe play aspiring artists whose paths diverge. Their story is told in songs that are skillfully written but, like his characters, are on the generic side (1:25). Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Isherwood)
'The Madrid' Edie Falco, whose face usually seems like an open window, pulls down the blinds in Liz Flahive's muted, murky play about a runaway kindergarten teacher, directed by Leigh Silverman. Ms. Flahive has a poet's hand for echoing imagery. But this production often feels paralyzed in its contemplation of the mystery of everyday lives (2:10). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Brantley)
'My Name Is Asher Lev' Aaron Posner's adaptation of Chaim Potok's novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place -- the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic community in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30).

&#x2605; 'Old Hats' Bill Irwin and David Shiner, the peerless neo-vaudevillian jesters behind the long-running hit ''Fool Moon,'' have concocted a winning new compendium of nifty clown routines.

&#x2605; 'Passion' Staged by John Doyle, a minimalist with a scalpel, this hypnotic revival of Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine's musical study of love beyond reason comes across as a pulsing collective fever dream, while reminding us that startling clarity can come from such dreams (1:45).

&#x2605; 'The Revisionist' As a Polish Holocaust survivor in Jesse Eisenberg's somewhat implausible new play, Vanessa Redgrave reminds us why she's considered the greatest actress of her generation. She inhabits her character with precision and authority, making us feel like humble, privileged trespassers in an exotic world. Mr. Eisenberg almost holds his own portraying her graceless young American cousin (1:45). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (866) 811-4111, rattlestick.org. (Brantley)
'Shaheed: The Dream and Death of Benazir Bhutto' Anna Khaja plays eight characters in her one-woman show that mixes fact and fiction to understand the complicated, contradictory person that was Benazir Bhutto. Ms. Khaja, who wrote the script, is a better actress than writer, and some of the characters seem thin. Still the show reminds us of why Bhutto was so interesting (1:30).

&#x2605; 'Talley's Folly' Danny Burstein and Sarah Paulson give performances of translucent feeling in this loving Roundabout Theater Company revival of Lanford Wilson's 1979 romantic pas de deux about two misfits in 1944 Missouri trying to find a mutual rhythm. Directed with sympathy and insight by Michael Wilson (1:35). Laura Pels Theater, Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org.

'Women of Will' Mixing casually delivered scholarly exposition with intensely rendered performance, this impassioned exploration of Shakespeare's heroines by Tina Packer traces their evolution through their language. When Ms. Packer and her co-star, Nigel Gore, get down to the business of acting, it's not just poetry in motion, it's thought made flesh. Eric Tucker directs (2:30).

&#x2605; 'Patti Issues' In his funny, tender coming-of-age monologue, Ben Rimalower traces the obsessive Patti LuPone fandom that provided him with an empowering role model. That inspiration proved perhaps most useful to Mr. Rimalower in processing the fallout after his father kicked down the closet door and bailed on the family. While on one hand, this is the story of many young gay men's propensity for diva worship, the tartly observed show goes several steps further by exploring the wide-eyed experiences that result when the acolyte gets to interact with his idol (1:00).

&#x2605; 'Then She Fell' Inspired by Lewis Carroll's ''Alice'' books, this transporting immersive theater work occupies a dreamscape where the judgments and classifications of the waking mind are suspended.

'Totally Tubular Time Machine' This show is less a play or musical than a big, campy, drinking party, with a little bit of singing thrown in. Held at an '80s-theme dance club in Midtown, it features celebrity impersonators who wander through the crowd handing out party favors (lollipops from Katy Perry, trucker hats from Justin Bieber) and taking turns at karaoke. The impersonations come with varying degrees of similitude and singing talent (2:00). Saturdays only. Culture Club, 20 West 39th Street, (212) 921-1999, totallytubularnyc.com. (Rampell)

HEADLINE: Texas House Bill Proposes Dropping Algebra II From Diploma Standards

BYLINE: By MORGAN SMITH. 
msmith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
As Texas re-examines what students must learn to earn a high school diploma, a single math course has attracted more attention than any other part of the state's curriculum.
Under a bill that was overwhelmingly passed by the House and is now before the Senate, Texas would drop algebra II as a core diploma requirement. The bill would severely cut back exit tests, and lower the number of courses students must take in math and science.
The proposed changes come as some policy experts are challenging the role of the advanced math in preparing students for college and career. But it has raised alarm from business leaders and national advocacy groups concerned about how the changes might affect academic achievement in the state, particularly for low-income and minority students. Elsewhere in the country, many states are raising curriculum standards to meet the increasing demands of employers. 
Representative Jimmie Don Aycock, a Killeen Republican who is in his first term as chairman of the House Public Education Committee, was among those who questioned the value of an Algebra II requirement.
Mr. Aycock recently led the House in the vote to undo the current default curriculum, which requires four years each in science, social studies, English and math in favor of a plan that would require only three years of science, math and social studies. Students who completed those requirements could choose humanities, vocational or technical courses.
The proposed legislation's most controversial element is the elimination of second-year algebra as a requirement, a policy in place for students who entered ninth grade in 1999 and later. The course would still be required for students who opt for a college-preparatory curriculum.
During the House debate on the measure, which would also lower the number of state-mandated standardized tests to 5 from 15, Mr. Aycock, a veterinarian and former school board member, said the new plan would help keep more students engaged.
Mr. Aycock questioned whether the idea that advanced algebra was an indicator of students' potential was ''causational or observational.'' He said he did not believe second-year algebra should be ''the determining factor in a student's future.''
Only two of the House's 150 members voted against the measure.
In reconsidering advanced algebra, the Legislature is bucking a national trend -- toward more stringent math courses -- that it helped begin a decade ago.
''You were out front in terms of adopting these requirements, and now you are certainly the place where there is the greatest debate and the most serious attempt to scale them back,'' said Mike Cohen, the president of Achieve, an organization of governors and business leaders that advocates college- and career-ready graduation requirements nationwide.
The state adopted what were among the country's most stringent graduation requirements in 2006, leading a national march toward tougher standards. Since 2004, when Arkansas was the only other state with a second-year-algebra requirement, according to Achieve's data, 21 other states have adopted the course into their standards. Three others -- New Jersey, Maryland and West Virginia -- are considering ways to increase the rigor of high school math.
If Texas moves away from those requirements, Mr. Cohen said, it will threaten the progress it has made in closing gaps among white, black and Hispanic students. In the last decade, black, Hispanic and low-income students have gone on to postsecondary education in higher numbers.
But some education researchers caution against overstating the importance of advanced algebra in preparing for college and career success.A seminal study bolstering the connection between second-year algebra and student achievement came from two researchers at the Educational Testing Service, Anthony Carnevale and Alice Desrochers, who followed high school students from 1988 to 2000. The study showed that completing the course increased students' chances of getting a higher-paying job.
But Mr. Carnevale, now the director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, said that although he still believed that advanced algebra was ''pivotal,'' policy makers had heard the study's conclusions ''much too loudly'' as a call to increase standards.
''It is becoming a problem because we keep upping the ante, and standards never get high enough, and at some point nobody's going to graduate from high school except the two kids that are going to Harvard,'' he said.
The challenge for educators, said James Stone, the director of the University of Louisville National Research Center for Career and Technical Education, was to get students ''to learn the math they really need.'' Mr. Stone said his research on high school curriculum and scores on the ACT entrance test suggested that students did not need advanced algebra to be college-ready in math.
The mathematical concepts that students needed to master to earn a college-ready ACT score, he said, were covered in beginning algebra and geometry, courses typically taken in middle school.
''Having a chance to apply the skills over and over again, that's where you really learn it deeply,'' he said. ''Unfortunately because it's easy, we'll define rigor as more classes, and that's what led us to this conundrum.''
Mr. Aycock's bill awaits the approval of the Senate, where in spite of similar proposals from leaders there, signs of opposition are appearing. Publicly, Gov. Rick Perry, who could ultimately veto such legislation, has stayed out of the fray. A spokeswoman issued a statement saying that while Mr. Perry supported efforts to re-evaluate the state's high school curriculum, he intended to ''protect the academic rigor that prepares students for career and college.''
Walter Jackson, a high school principal completing his 20th year in Alief Independent School District, said the state's re-examination of graduation requirements should not be interpreted as a retreat.
Pointing to improvement the state has made in graduation rates and standardized test scores over the past decade, he said the state was "not running from something we haven't been successful in.''
''We are trying make opportunities more relevant, more accessible, and more immediate," he said. ''The world is changing, conditions of the world are changing, the workforce has changed, and we are trying to keep up with the changing standards in this global economy.''

HEADLINE: Oil's Financial Ties to Texas Legislators

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH. 
kgalbraith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
During a legislative hearing this year related to hydraulic fracturing, Representative James L. Keffer, Republican of Eastland, made a reference to what he thought was an unfair portrayal of the industry in the film ''Promised Land.''
''My wife's seen it, she didn't like it, so don't go if you haven't,'' Mr. Keffer said at the hearing, which featured testimony from oil and gas representatives. 
Friendliness toward the drilling industry is typical for Texas, where many lawmakers receive campaign contributions from oil and gas groups or have investments in drilling companies. The three elected members of the Railroad Commission of Texas, which oversees the oil and gas industry, have received significant contributions from the very industry they regulate.
Critics say that the industry exerts excessive control over elected officials, especially in boom times. But lawmakers and the drilling industry say that the donations are the way things operate. And lawmakers say that they make their decisions based on the best interests of the state.
Mr. Keffer, who heads the House Energy Resources Committee, holds an interest in a fund that specializes in mineral rights. His broad stock portfolio includes shares in well over a dozen oil and gas companies, according to a 2011 filing with the Texas Ethics Commission. He received nearly $73,000 in the 2011-12 election cycle from the industry, according to the left-leaning nonprofit group Texans for Public Justice.
Mr. Keffer said outside groups watch lawmakers' actions, and ''if I start looking like I'm just an oil and gas guy, then my credibility is destroyed.''
The energy, natural resources and waste sector gives more money to Texas candidates than any other economic sector does, according to Texans for Public Justice. The group identified nearly $20 million in donations from groups and people with oil and gas connections to state legislators and other elected officials during the 2011-12 campaign cycle. (Alternative energy's donations were negligible, the group said.)
Political contributions and personal involvement are hardly unique to the drilling industry, supporters say. ''Individuals' areas of expertise are a valuable asset to the people of Texas,'' Deb Hastings, executive vice president of the Texas Oil and Gas Association, said in an e-mail.
But environmentalists feel outgunned.
Many state policies, on issues like air and water pollution, ''are inexorably or inextricably woven to benefit the oil and gas industry,'' said Tom Smith, the Texas state director of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. Environmentalists often resort to trying to mitigate bad policies, he added.
Mr. Smith did praise Mr. Keffer for pushing through a bill last session that required disclosure of many of the chemicals involved in hydraulic fracturing.
The House Energy Resources Committee's members include Representative Tom Craddick, Republican of Midland, a business development representative for an oil field supply company; Representative Myra Crownover, Republican of Denton, the committee's vice chairwoman, who receives industry royalties; and Representative Tony Dale, Republican of Cedar Park, who is the president of an oil and energy consulting firm.
Oil and gas accounted for more than 8 percent of the state's gross domestic product in 2011, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, so it is not surprising that many lawmakers are in the industry. It is also nothing new. Many former governors, including George W. Bush, have been oilmen.
There have been efforts afoot in the Legislature to tighten the rules on industry donations to Railroad Commissioners, but the commissioners say that such rules would be stricter than those for other elected state officials.

HEADLINE: Waiting and Waiting for Green Cards

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Vishal Sankhla, an Indian engineer, is among those at the center of a storm over how to fix the nation's immigration system.
Mr. Sankhla got a master's degree in electrical engineering nine years ago from the University of Southern California, followed by a job at Cisco, then at a start-up that attracted $4.5 million in financing from Silicon Valley investors. There was only one wrinkle: he was in the country on a temporary work visa, with no idea whether or when he would get permanent residence.
He remains in limbo, which preoccupies him almost as much as running his business. ''It's a constant distraction,'' said Mr. Sankhla, who is 32. ''You can't really settle down because your visa status is uncertain.''
Silicon Valley is battling in Washington to make the immigration process easier for thousands of people like Mr. Sankhla, many of them Indian engineers, while also pushing to hire many more guest workers from abroad. 
Rarely has the industry been so single-mindedly focused on a national policy issue, with executives like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and John T. Chambers of Cisco personally involved. Its efforts seem to be paying off, as a group of eight senators negotiate details of a comprehensive immigration deal to be announced early next week.
Several lobbyists and advocates who have spoken to Senate staff members say they are optimistic about at least two items high on their wish list: a fast-track green card line for math and science graduates like Mr. Sankhla, no matter which country they come from, and a near doubling of the visas for temporary workers.
''I think we are going to get a balanced outcome, which takes advantage of the value that immigrants bring to the economy and be protective of U.S. workers,'' said Scott Corley, director of Compete America, an industry coalition that includes Google and Intel.
The contentious piece of this is the potential increase in temporary workers from abroad. Critics fear that is a ruse for lowering wages. Those critics are likely to get at least one boon from a revamped law: a requirement that companies try to find qualified American workers before hiring from abroad. The law may also make it more expensive to bring in guest workers.
The new immigration measure will almost certainly fix a situation that keeps people like Mr. Sankhla stuck in limbo for so long. The current law limits how many green cards can be issued to people from any single country, no matter how populous.
That effectively means that applicants from countries like India and China, with a large supply of young engineers often educated in American universities, wait far longer for permanent residence than those from almost every other country. The temporary employment visa, usually an H-1B, has become a kind of way station for them.
The Senate is considering eliminating the per-country quotas for those who graduate from United States universities with math, science and engineering degrees. The debate in Congress perfectly illustrates how immigration law, codified in 1965 and last revamped substantially in 1990, has lagged behind the demands of a rapidly changing economy. Unemployment in the technology industry hovers below 4 percent, far less than the national average.
In that climate, temporary visas are in such heavy demand that the total number available for the coming year -- 65,000 for skilled workers and 20,000 for those with a master's degree or higher -- were snatched up in less than five days. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services said Monday that it had received 124,000 applications in that time and had resorted to a lottery to make the final cut.
The measure being considered by lawmakers could nearly double the H-1B visas allotted yearly and possibly admit more temporary workers during periods of high demand, said several advocates who have discussed the matter with Congressional staff members and who declined to be named because the final language has not yet been released.
''If you were the human resources vice president of the United States, you would want to have a rule that says if things get busy and you need skilled people you can bring in people,'' said Dan Siciliano, a law professor at Stanford. ''At the same time you would want a way to bring highly skilled people in and perhaps at your choosing convert them to status that lets them stay much longer.''
A vast range of American organizations seek H-1B workers for technical jobs, from the Boston Red Sox baseball team to the chain store Nordstrom to technology companies like Google and Microsoft. Some of the largest blocs of H-1B petitions are taken by outsourcing companies, which makes them even more contentious, and critics say those firms import engineers with basic skills and pay them poorly.
''It invites employers to play a game of wage arbitrage,'' said Ron Hira, assistant professor of public policy at the Rochester Institute of Technology and a critic of the program. By Mr. Hira's calculation, nine out of the 10 largest chunks of H-1B petitions went to outsourcing companies, including Cognizant, which is based in New Jersey, followed by the Indian firm Tata Consultancy Services.
Guest workers themselves can be subject to unfair labor practices under American law. In one of the largest cases, Tata Consultancy Services recently settled a $29 million class-action lawsuit in California, in which it was accused of seizing the federal tax refunds of about 12,800 temporary workers from 2002 to 2005.
The settlement will award an average of $1,600 to each worker. Tata did not admit to any wrongdoing. A company spokesman declined to comment on its use of H-1B visas, citing forthcoming quarterly earnings.
A 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office found that half of all H-1Bs were brought in at entry-level wages. The new bill may require companies to pay higher wages for temporary workers. It is unclear whether that would apply only to outsourcing firms.
Supporters of the program point out that new H-1B workers admitted every year represent less than 1 percent of the total American work force, and that outsourcing firms represent a minority of employers. Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, concluded that in the last five years, the 25 largest outsourcing firms accounted for 7 percent to 27 percent of all new H-1Bs issued.
As for the rest, many are used by would-be immigrants to find jobs and then wait for green cards.
Mr. Sankhla switched from an H-1B to another temporary category reserved for people of ''extraordinary ability,'' which allowed him to continue with his start-up, Viralheat, which is based in San Mateo, Calif., and mines consumer sentiment on social media platforms like Facebook. Among his 16 employees, nearly half are on temporary visas while they wait for green cards. Mr. Sankhla's own green card application was rejected once. He is trying again.
A new immigration law will have a great impact on his entire family. His wife, an engineer at Netflix, is on an H-1B visa, and his brother, headed here from Bombay, has one, too.

HEADLINE: A Festival Now Comfortable in Its Skin

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
In any life there are moments of acute awareness when you suddenly realize the degree to which you've grown up. The Tribeca Film Festival, which begins its 12th season on Wednesday, is experiencing such a flash.
This year's opening-night film, Tom Berninger's ''Mistaken for Strangers,'' is not the usual blaze of Hollywood glamour but a documentary that follows a Brooklyn indie rock band, the National, on tour. The choice of a rock 'n' roll documentary to begin the festival is a sign that Tribeca, which barged into New York on a mission of community redevelopment after Sept. 11 emptied Lower Manhattan, has resolved its identity crisis. Like a gawky, loudmouth kid who has matured into a poised adolescent, it has nothing left to prove. 
The festival, which I've covered since its inception in 2002, peaked in size in 2006. Since then it has shrunk, become more artistically discriminating and has snugly woven itself into the city's cultural fabric; it's aware that it doesn't have to be the biggest and the best, it only has to be good. This year's closing-night film isn't a fireworks explosion like ''Marvel's The Avengers'' last year but a restoration of Martin Scorsese's dour, still underappreciated ''King of Comedy'' from 1983.
Along with feature films that include 53 world premieres from 37 countries (France leads the list of foreign contributors), Tribeca is introducing an innovative section, Storyscapes, involving five interactive projects. Geoffrey Gilmore, who programs Tribeca with Frederic Boyer and Genna Terranova, is especially enthusiastic about these adventures in what he calls ''nonlinear storytelling.'' ''Robots in Residence,'' in which robots collaborate with the audience to shoot and direct a documentary is a typically iconoclastic experiment.
Movies, of course, are still Tribeca's meat and potatoes and will be for the foreseeable future. Because this festival is squeezed uncomfortably between winter events like Sundance and New Directors/New Films and the Cannes Film Festival in the spring, it has had to fight for prime content. But the quality of the work has steadily risen.
I well remember the festival's early days, when mention of it made some film publicists wrinkle their noses in disgust, as though a parvenu had crashed a party. But the time is long past when Tribeca could be described as a catch basin for the runoff of other festivals.
An unusual number of the best films this year are coming-of-age stories about boys and young men that create a less-than-cheery composite picture of teenagers around the world. Matt Wolf's documentary ''Teenage,'' a fascinating agglomeration of archival clips of youth since the early 20th century purports to describe how teenage culture came into existence (there is even a segment on Hitler Youth), but it takes too many tangents to tell a coherent story and largely overlooks the commercial aspects of youth marketing.
More to the point is Sam Fleischner's ''Stand Clear of the Closing Doors,'' a probable front-runner in the competition for best world narrative feature. Filmed in the Rockaways last fall and based on a true story, this ur-New York movie follows an autistic 13-year-old undocumented Mexican boy from Queens who escapes into the subway system after his mother scolds him for missing classes.
Much of the movie was shot in the subway and surveys the phantasmagoric underground melting pot through the eyes of the mostly silent boy (played by the newcomer Jesus Sanchez-Velez), who is barely able to scrape together four quarters to buy a bag of potato chips and has difficulty finding a restroom. As his mother embarks on a desperate search, the boy is not so much scared as dazed. The story carries him through Halloween and the arrival of Hurricane Sandy, when the trains shut down; in the film's eeriest moments, he find himself alone in an empty station.
''Stand Clear of the Closing Doors'' is as intense and indelible an immersion in the real New York as I have seen in a long time. It may be crude, but it is completely, exhilaratingly alive.
From Norway comes Hishan Zaman's ''Before Snowfall,'' which also stars a young nonprofessional actor (Taher Abdullah Taher) as a Kurdish Iraqi teenager obliged to carry out an honor killing after his older sister flees an arranged marriage. If the blank performance of Mr. Taher impedes sympathy, the movie is visually splendid, and its portrayal of primitive retribution that knows no geographical borders is haunting.
''Harmony Lessons,'' a powerful film showing out of competition, observes the cruel pecking order and bullying at a school in rural Kazakhstan where a 13-year-old loner is persecuted by older classmates who operate an extortion racket. His accumulated rage leaks out in his trapping of lizards and his methodical torture of cockroaches. The movie, a critical hit at the Berlin Film Festival, is Emir Baigazin's directorial debut, and the cool, formally elegant work reveals him to be a major emerging talent.
Just as impressive is Lenny Abrahamson's perfectly observed ''What Richard Did,'' whose title character (Jack Reynor) is a popular teenager from an affluent Dublin family who accidentally kills his girlfriend's ex-boyfriend in a scuffle after a party. The film is rich with agonizing moral questions, as Richard debates whether to turn himself in while hoping that no witnesses will betray him. The movie recently swept up several awards from the Irish Film and Television Academy.
Daniel Patrick Carbone's ''Hide Your Smiling Faces,'' in the world narrative competition, is an evocative portrait of two brothers dealing with a death while growing up in the rural Northeast. As it observes the bored, restless boys ambling through the landscape, it has the same moody intensity as the childhood scenes in Terrence Malick's ''Tree of Life.''
Lance Edmands's ''Bluebird,'' which opens the narrative feature competition, aims for a similar immersion in a place but tries a little too hard for atmosphere. Set in a Maine logging town after a child is found in a coma on a school bus, it features sober performances by a cast that includes John Slattery and Margo Martindale. Aspiring to be another ''Sweet Hereafter'' it halfway succeeds. And the use of late '50s pop hits, especially Thomas Wayne's ''Tragedy,'' contributes to the mournful ambience.
Worth noting is the American premiere of ''Wadjda,'' the first feature film shot entirely in Saudi Arabia by a Saudi woman, about a rebellious girl who refuses to conform to social norms. The screening will be followed by a conversation between the director, Haifaa al-Mansour, and Zainab Salbi, the founder of Women for Women International, moderated by Gloria Steinem.
Among the documentary competitors I've seen Dan Krauss's devastating film ''The Kill Team,'' is a formidable contender. The story of Adam Winfield, an American soldier in Afghanistan whose efforts to alert the military to a kill-for-sport game in which soldiers conspired to kill Afghan civilians -- staging the murders to look like ''good shoots'' -- investigates the psychology of trained warriors who don't see their victims as fully human. Like Kirby Dick's recent documentary ''The Invisible War,'' about rape in the armed forces, it portrays the United States military as a reflexively self-protective institution that punishes whistle-blowers.
Opening the documentary competition, ''Big Men'' is an industrial exposé by Rachel Boynton (''Our Brand Is Crisis'') of misbehavior by African oil companies in cahoots with American corporate interests. It's an infuriating, all-too-familiar story of ambition, greed and corruption.
This year's festival includes the usual share of new work by reputable filmmakers. Leading the list is Richard Linklater's ''Before Midnight,'' the third and deepest in the much-loved ''Before'' series starring Ethan Hawke as an American author and Julie Delpy as his longtime French lover. In this installment the lovers, touring Greece, have reached early middle age. Though still unmarried, they are burdened with family obligations (they have twin girls). The biting, sometimes funny back-and-forth dialogue between these strong-willed people becomes an Everyman-Everywoman argument that is likely to spur debates among couples who take sides in this seesawing conversation.
Some other name directors contributing work include David Gordon Green (''Prince Avalanche''), Mira Nair (''The Reluctant Fundamentalist''), Neil Jordan (''Byzantium'') and Neil LaBute (''Some Velvet Morning''). Tribeca's history of probing celebrity portraits (''Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work,'' ''Carol Channing: Larger Than Life'') continues with films about Moms Mabley, Gore Vidal, Richard Pryor, Elaine Stritch, Muhammad Ali and the poet James Broughton.
Many of the other regular features of Tribeca are back, including a sports film festival and Tribeca Talks, panel discussions featuring Clint Eastwood, Darren Aronofsky, Mr. Linklater, Mr. Hawke and Ms. Delpy, among others. Also returning will be the outdoor drive-in (where the films will include ''Lil Bub & Friendz,'' about a feline Internet star) and a street fair for families.
The Tribeca Film Festival wouldn't be what it is without a little circus around the edges.
The Tribeca Film Festival runs Wednesday through April 28 at a variety of sites; tribecafilm.com/festival.

HEADLINE: New Yorkers Brace for Cuts in Unemployment Benefits

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Federal benefits for New Yorkers who have been unemployed for more than six months have been gradually disappearing. Now, the ones that remain are shrinking.
Starting this week, benefits for more than 140,000 New York State residents will be cut by almost 11 percent as a result of the budget stalemate in Washington. New York is one of the first states to carry out the cuts, which are a result of automatic budget cuts known as sequestration, which mandated an $85 billion across-the-board reduction in spending on military and domestic programs.
For Stephanie Cozart, a stage actress in Manhattan, that means a cut to $361 per week from the $405 she had been receiving since last fall. If she does not find work by the end of September, when the cuts expire, the loss would amount to $1,100. 
''It just seems really mean and really dumb, given that everyone knows that unemployment benefits stimulate the economy,'' said Ms. Cozart, who is married and has a 7-month-old daughter. ''I don't save my unemployment benefits. I spend them on diapers and baby food and so forth.''
As part of the cutbacks, every state was ordered to reduce the benefits paid to people who have exhausted their 26 weeks of regular unemployment benefits and have begun collecting what are known as emergency unemployment benefits. New York is one of 14 states that was ready by early April to reduce the payments, according to Jason Kuruvilla, a spokesman for the federal Labor Department. The cuts will be proportionally larger in states that take longer to start making them.
Though the budget cuts were uniform, the effect on the unemployed is not. People collecting regular benefits are unaffected. And those collecting emergency benefits in states like Connecticut that have been slower to implement the cuts may find work before losing any benefits. Connecticut expects to make the cut in mid-June, when it will amount to about 19 percent of a weekly payment, or about $112 out of that state's maximum benefit of $591. New Jersey officials said they did not know when payments would shrink in that state or by how much.
''They're inequitable,'' said Maurice Emsellem, a policy co-director of the National Employment Law Project, which has lobbied to preserve the additional benefits that lawmakers in Washington approved when unemployment soared after the financial crisis.
A study released this month by his group reported that five million Americans have been out of work for 27 weeks or more and that the average duration of unemployment nationwide is now 37 weeks.
In New York, as in many other states, the maximum duration of unemployment benefits stretched to 99 weeks at the depths of the recession. But as the state's unemployment rate has declined, so has the availability of benefits.
At the end of last year, New York stopped offering a sort of last-resort program known as extended benefits that lasted for up to 20 weeks. Now, the longest an unemployed New Yorker can collect benefits for is 79 weeks.
But some who only recently started collecting emergency benefits, like Ms. Cozart, may only collect them for a maximum of 37 weeks. For most of that period, the benefits would be reduced by the automatic cuts.
The $44 a week that Ms. Cozart will lose may not sound onerous in New York City, where it would barely cover one prix fixe dinner during Restaurant Week. But advocates for the unemployed point out that they had to lobby for years in Albany to obtain the $5 increase in weekly unemployment benefits that New Yorkers are scheduled to receive next year.
That increase, the first since 2000, will raise the maximum weekly benefit in the state to $410. But it still will be at least $180 lower than the maximum benefit in Connecticut or New Jersey.
Ms. Cozart's last role was as Aunt Gert in an Off Broadway revival of ''Lost in Yonkers,'' and she had hoped to find another acting job. But with a baby to feed and clothe and a husband whose job does not provide health insurance, she said she had begun considering office jobs.
''I would much rather have a job that paid well and provided health benefits than be sort of scrimping and saving,'' said Ms. Cozart, 42. Referring to the cut in her weekly benefits, she said: ''$40 a week adds up. It just made me see red, made me really angry.''
For Patricia Torres, 29, the cut will just be the latest indignity that has followed the loss of her job selling wireless phone service in Downtown Brooklyn in June. Ms. Torres, who said she earned $60,000 a year before she was dismissed, said she had to move out of a Manhattan apartment she shared with a roommate and back in with her grandmother and ailing grandfather.
She said she ran through her savings in the first few months of unemployment and has defaulted on the student loans she took out to study fashion design and marketing. She has no health insurance because the cost to continue coverage provided by her former employer was $800 a month.
Without insurance, she said, she could no longer afford to see her regular doctors or buy all the medicines they have prescribed. Instead, she visits a city-financed clinic at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, she said.
Most of the jobs she finds in her searches offer low pay and meager benefits, if any, she said.
''My résumé is pretty strong, which is why I get the interviews,'' Ms. Torres said. ''But they don't want to pay me anything. They want me to work for minimum wage, which is less than I get from unemployment'' -- though by a narrower margin than before this week.
''I've worked every single day since I was 17 years old,'' she said. ''For the first time, I need help and they're taking it away.''

HEADLINE: Goldman Invests in Upstart Online Broker

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Motif Investing, a firm based in a San Mateo, Calif., announced on Friday that it had raised a $25 million round of financing from investors including Goldman 

 BODY:
An upstart online broker has attracted a prominent backer: Goldman Sachs.
Motif Investing, a firm based in a San Mateo, Calif., announced on Friday that it had raised a $25 million round of financing from investors including Goldman. Darren Cohen, a managing director in Goldman's principal strategic investments group, is joining the start-up's board "as an observer," Motif said in its announcement. 
"This deal provides us with great expertise," Hardeep Walia, the co-founder and chief executive of Motif, said in an interview. "Raising money is hard enough these days. It's always better when you have strategic money from people who understand the industry really well."
Goldman isn't the only big name associated with Motif, which opened its doors last June. Sallie L. Krawcheck, a former executive of Bank of America and Citigroup, is on the board. Arthur Levitt Jr., a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was an adviser to the online broker before joining the board in February.
Mr. Levitt, who works as an adviser to Goldman, made introductions for Motif and was "very, very important in getting this deal done," Mr. Walia said.
In addition to Goldman, the venture capital firms Foundation Capital, Ignition Partners and Norwest Venture Partners, which already were invested in Motif, participated in the latest financing round.
Billing itself as an online evolution of investment clubs, Motif allows investors to buy a bucket of stocks centered on a theme, like healthy food, inflation or even rebuilding after Hurricane Sandy. The company charges a flat fee of $9.95 to buy a so-called motif, a portfolio of up to 30 stocks.
In February, the company began allowing investors to create their own portfolios from scratch, and said those investors would ultimately be eligible for royalties if others wanted to buy their themed portfolios.
Mr. Cohen, the Goldman managing director, said in a statement that Motif "has taken an innovative approach to traditional investing."

HEADLINE: The Impact (if Any) of the Fed's Dual Mandate

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: The Federal Reserve has been effective in holding inflation to a target. But it is not clear whether fighting inflation and fostering job creation can be effectively pursued in tandem. 

 BODY:
Eric Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, made a compelling case on Friday morning that the Fed's dual mandate doesn't really matter. 
That was not the point of Mr. Rosengren's talk. He set out to defend the unusual operating instructions that require the Fed to seek maximum employment in addition to the standard focus of a central bank, maintaining price stability.
In particular, he argued that over the last 20 years, the Fed has controlled inflation more successfully than central banks that operated under a single mandate. The chart below shows the Fed has held price inflation close to the 2 percent annual pace that the Fed, like most other central banks, regards as most healthy.
So, the Fed is pretty effective at controlling inflation. The dual mandate doesn't seem to be doing any harm. But it doesn't seem to be doing much good, either.
As Mr. Rosengren put it, over the last two decades, "the U.S. has a tighter inflation range and a broader unemployment range than many other countries with a single inflation mandate." In other words, countries with single-mandate central banks have seen less fluctuation in unemployment rates than the United States. 
The last few years offer the most striking example. Inflation has remained at or below the Fed's 2 percent target, while unemployment has remained far too high.
Mr. Rosengren and other Fed officials argue that the central bank is doing what it can to increase the pace of job creation. But those efforts have proved insufficient in part because the Fed's 2 percent target limits the amount by which it can cut interest rates during a downturn, and it has run out of room. As a result, the Fed has turned to less effective tools to stimulate the economy, like asset purchases.
We don't know, of course, how the Fed would have behaved under a single mandate. Perhaps it would have acted less forcefully to reduce unemployment. And comparisons with other central banks, and other countries, go only so far because monetary policy is only one factor that influences changes in unemployment. 
Perhaps Mr. Rosengren is right to argue that "a dual mandate may help to ensure that employment gets an appropriate weighting in the central bank's assessment of appropriate policy, particularly during times when employment ranks first in terms of economic woes."
But it's hard to find the evidence.

HEADLINE: How Social Security Cuts Could Affect Children

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: Those beyond retirement age are not the only beneficiaries of Social Security. Children are among those whose payments would be reined in by a proposed change in the inflation formula. 

 BODY:
President Obama's budget includes a controversial - at least on the left - change in the way Social Security benefits are adjusted for inflation that would save the government about $130 billion over 10 years, but would reduce payments for tens of millions of Americans over time. 
The switch, to a "chained consumer price index," would allow Social Security benefits to grow more slowly. That might more accurately reflect the overall growth in prices for things like home rentals, electronics and food. But it might not more accurately reflect the price inflation that older Americans tend to experience, as my colleague Eduardo Porter has pointed out. 
The change would mean less money for the elderly. But it would also mean less money for children.
One underappreciated point is that Social Security benefits millions of children and working-age Americans, as well as older adults. According to calculations of census data performed by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning Washington research group, Social Security keeps about 21 million Americans above the poverty line every year. About a third of those people are younger than retirement age, and about 1.1 million of them are under age 18. 
It is not just those very low-income families that benefit, either. As of 2011, about six million children, or 8 percent of all people under 18, lived in a household receiving Social Security benefits. In part, that is because so many households with children also include a grandparent. But more than four million children are direct recipients of benefits, too, often because they have a deceased or disabled parent. 
President Obama's chained C.P.I. proposal does include protections that would prevent benefit reductions for many of the most vulnerable households. Means-tested benefit programs - like the Supplemental Security Income program - would not be affected, for instance. And economists believe that the switch to chained C.P.I. would have a negligible impact on the poverty rate over all, while reducing poverty for the very old. 
Nevertheless, reductions in Social Security benefits would mean reductions in family incomes, including those of millions of families with children. And children who qualify for Social Security benefits because they have a disabled, deceased or retired parent or guardian would see slower-growing benefits too.

HEADLINE: Wells Fargo Profit Rises 22%

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Wells Fargo reported earnings of $5.2 billion in first-quarter profit as it continued to notch record gains. 

 BODY:
Wells Fargo posted a 22 percent increase in first-quarter profit on Friday as the bank, which is the nation's largest home lender, continued to notch record gains even while its mortgage machine slowed. 
The bank, which benefited from recent effort to curb expenses, reported earnings of $5.2 billion, or 92 cents a share, compared with $4.25 billion, or 75 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. The results outpaced estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, who had forecast earnings of 88 cents a share.
 For Wells, which is based in San Francisco, it was the 13th consecutive rise in quarterly earnings and the eighth consecutive record.
"Wells Fargo delivered outstanding first-quarter 2013 results for our shareholders," the bank's chief executive, John G. Stumpf, said in a statement.
In a downside for the bank, however, its revenue slipped slightly, to $21.3 billion, compared with $21.6 billion in the period a year earlier.
And the bank's mortgage business, riding years of record gains, finally showed it was unable to sustain the gains.
The bank's mortgage banking income, for example, slipped 3 percent. And while handling $109 billion in mortgage originations might be a feat for some banks, it represented a 16 percent drop for Wells Fargo.
The results could present problems for Wells Fargo, whose fortunes rise and fall with the mortgage market. The bank now creates roughly a third of all mortgages in the country.
The results could also signal a flattening out of the broader mortgage market. As the Federal Reserve cut interest rates in recent years, it prompted millions of borrowers to refinance their home loans to reduce costs.
Now, that pipeline of borrowers could dry up, unless interest rates once again drop significantly or the housing market makes a fuller recovery. Refinancing accounted for 65 percent of Wells Fargo's mortgage origination in the first quarter, down from 76 percent in the period a year earlier.
Still, the bank's lending business showed some signs of strength. In the first quarter, that business helped lead the growth, as the banks overall loan portfolio grew 4 percent. And profit in the community banking division, which includes Wells Fargo's retail branches and mortgage business, climbed 24 percent, to $2.9 billion.
"Loans and deposits demonstrated continued growth in a challenging economic environment," Mr. Stumpf said.
But the strong returns were spread across the bank. The unit that caters to corporations showed improvement, with profits rising 9 percent. The bank also reported a 14 percent profit gain in its wealth management business.
It was a welcome sign for the banking industry.
Wells Fargo, along with JPMorgan Chase, kicked off bank earnings season. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street giants will report next week.

HEADLINE: Britain to Go After Companies Exploiting Unpaid Interns

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: For many young workers, the only hope of starting out in a career is to take an unpaid internship. But some companies are getting something for nothing &#8212; with as many as 100,000 people working without pay in Britain alone. 

 BODY:
LONDON - Companies accused of using unpaid interns to do full-time work are facing investigation by Britain's tax authorities to determine whether they are breaking the country's minimum wage law.
Intern Aware, a group that campaigns for the rights of interns, on Friday welcomed a decision by Jo Swinson, the employment minister, to hand over the group's list of 100 alleged offenders to the tax collector.
In a letter to the group, Ms. Swinson said the list would be treated as intelligence to identify employers who were breaking the rules. 
The London-based group represents one of a number of campaigns that have sprung up around the world to expose abuse of the growing phenomenon of unpaid internships.
"The movement is growing in various places around the world, including the United States, France, Canada and Australia," Gus Baker, the organization's co-director, told Rendezvous.
As full-time work becomes scarcer for young people in Europe and elsewhere, a growing number face the prospect of working for nothing in the hope that their unpaid internships will turn into paid employment. Indeed, it has become a defining characteristic of this generation, wrote Teddy Wayne in The New York Times last month. 
"The notion of the traditional entry-level job is disappearing," Ross Perlin, the author of "Intern Nation: How to Earn Nothing and Learn Little in the Brave New Economy," told Mr. Wayne. 
Steven Greenhouse, the doyen of labor reporters in the U.S., wrote last year on the U.S. experience:
"While unpaid postcollege internships have long existed in the film and nonprofit worlds, they have recently spread to fashion houses, book and magazine publishers, marketing companies, public relations firms, art galleries, talent agencies - even to some law firms."
Mr. Baker of Intern Aware said there was a growing culture of unpaid internships in Britain and elsewhere that campaigners said was leaving young people who were eager to get into the job market open to exploitation. He said 100,000 people were working without pay in Britain alone.
Legitimate internship programs are designed to give would-be employees supervised workplace experience, sometimes with the prospect of future employment.
Even in those cases, fair wage activists are concerned that unpaid internships offer a potential advantage to those from more affluent families with the resources to fund them, excluding poorer applicants from the best job opportunities. 
The companies on the list that is going to the tax man are accused of hiring interns to do work that would otherwise have to be paid for, contrary to the law.
In Britain, many of those working for no pay may be legally entitled to receive the minimum wage, which is on a sliding scale according to age, rising to £6.19, or $9.50, an hour for workers over 21. 
A spokesman for the British government's department of business said, "Internships can be a valuable way of helping young people get into work and realize their ambitions."
But he reminded employers that if interns were regarded as workers under minimum wage legislation then they were entitled to be paid. He said that any complaints about exploitation would be fast-tracked to the tax authorities. 
However, as Steve Greenhouse noted in his article on the U.S. situation, unpaid interns are loath to file complaints for fear of jeopardizing their future job prospects.
The British activists have not revealed which companies are on their target list. 
But the British newspaper The Independent has just highlighted one unpaid job on offer at Reading F.C., an English premier league soccer club.
It noted that the club, owned by a wealthy Russian businessman, paid its top players the equivalent of $2.3 million a year, while an advertised one-year internship for a "performance analyst" offered neither salary nor expenses.
 Are unpaid internships an inevitable part of the 21st century labor market? Or are some companies exploiting vulnerable job-seekers to get something for nothing? Tell us what you think. And let us know of your personal experiences.

HEADLINE: Former Credit Suisse Executive Pleads Guilty to Inflating the Value of Mortgage Bonds

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Kareem Serageldin, a former senior trader at Credit Suisse, admitted in court on Friday that he fraudulently inflated the value of mortgage bonds as the housing market collapsed. 

 BODY:
A former senior trader at Credit Suisse Group pleaded guilty on Friday to charges that he fraudulently inflated the value of mortgage bonds as the housing market collapsed, becoming one of the highest-ranking Wall Street executives to admit to crimes related to the 2008 financial crisis. 
Kareem Serageldin, the former Credit Suisse trader, admitted to mismarking their positions to avoid losses in their investment portfolio at the end of 2007. He appeared in Federal District Court in Manhattan a week after being extradited from Britain.
During the court hearing, Mr. Serageldin, 39, said that after discovering that members of his team were fudging the value of its bond portfolio, he made the fateful decision to participate in the fraud rather than put an end to it. 
"Why did you do that?" asked Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein. 
"To preserve my reputation in the bank at a time when there was great financial turmoil," he said. 
Judge Hellerstein asked Mr. Serageldin numerous questions about his misconduct, at one point suggesting that the bank turned a blind eye to the scheme. 
A Credit Suisse spokesman, Jack Grone, referred to an earlier statement from securities regulators commending the bank for immediately reporting the wrongdoing and cooperating with the investigation. Sean P. Casey, a lawyer for Mr. Serageldin at Kobre & Kim, declined to comment. 
Federal prosecutors first charged Mr. Serageldin, an American citizen living in London, in February 2012, and urged him to return to the United States to face the charges against him. Two of Mr. Serageldin's underlings, David Higgs and Salmaan Siddiqui, pleaded guilty to participating in the conspiracy and cooperated with the government. 
The assets overvalued by the three former Credit Suisse traders were mortgage-backed securities, the complex bonds that caused hundreds of billions of dollars in losses across the banking system and brought global markets to its knees. 
The traders inflated the value of the bonds to increase their 2007 year-end bonuses, prosecutors said. Mr. Serageldin secured a cash bonus of more than $1.7 million and a stock award of more than $5.2 million. 
"While the real estate market was imploding and the financial crisis emerging, Kareem Serageldin and his co-conspirators concealed significant subprime mortgage-related losses in order to secure multimillion-dollar paydays," Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said.
Mr. Serageldin, the former global head of structured credit in Credit Suisse's investment banking division, pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy to falsify books and records. The charge carries a maximum sentence of five years. His sentencing is set for Aug. 2. 
Credit Suisse rescinded Mr. Serageldin's stock award after uncovering the fraud. He agreed to forfeit about $1 million - the approximate after-tax amount of his cash bonus. 
The government's investigation originated in early 2008 when the bank disclosed that it was taking a $2.65 billion write-down after discovering Mr. Serageldin's team had misstated the value of mortgage securities on their books. Credit Suisse suspended the team and reported them to the authorities.

HEADLINE: What Happens if You Don't Pay Your Taxes

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: There are lots of nonmonetary penalties, like being denied a hunting or medical license or having your driver&#8217;s license suspended. 

 BODY:
People who commit tax fraud can face big fines and even imprisonment. Just ask the recently released Wesley Snipes, who had served most of a three-year sentence for not filing his taxes. The timing of his release, just ahead of the tax filing deadline, may not have been an accident; the Internal Revenue Service appears to ramp up publicity of its tax fraud cases right before April 15, a 2010 study found. 
An author of that study, Joshua D. Blank, has a new paper out about another aspect of the tax enforcement machine: all the other, nonmonetary penalties that can hit you if you don't pay your taxes in full.
You've probably heard of similar measures hitting other kinds of scofflaws. If you're convicted of a drug felony, for example, you can be denied the right to vote, serve on a jury or work in a hospice. 
Depending on where you live, if you shirk on your taxes, you might:

        
have your medical or law license suspended;
        
be denied a hunting or fishing license;
        
have your passport revoked;
        
have your driver's license suspended, and your renewal of your vehicle registration denied;
        
be deported;
        
be denied housing assistance;
        
be barred from a government contract and government employment;
        
have your liquor license revoked (if you're a restaurant).
And perhaps most crushingly, you can:

        
be denied the right to operate a concession, ride or booth at Minnesota's annual state fair.
Professor Blank, who teaches at the New York University School of Law, says these types of collateral penalties can promote compliance, perhaps more effectively than heaping on additional monetary fines. He also argues that governments should publicize them more aggressively, just as the I.R.S. does for big celebrity tax fraud trials.

HEADLINE: A Chat With Raj Chetty, Clark Medalist

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: The 33-year-old public economist answers questions about how he chooses his research topics and what he&#8217;s working on now. 

 BODY:
This afternoon, we caught up with Raj Chetty, the 33-year-old Harvard economist who is the latest winner of the John Bates Clark Medal, a prestigious award for economists under the age of 40. Mr. Chetty is a public economist whose work has addressed topics including the returns from education, tax policies and savings behavior, often by parsing huge troves of data. This interview was lightly edited for clarity. 
 Q. 
 Tell me about how you choose your research topics, the research topics that won you this award. 
 A. 
 I think a lot of what I do is inspired by the real world - reading the newspaper, thinking about what people are talking about and experiencing. Those tend to be broad social and economic questions. How can we improve the education system? How can we reduce inequality of opportunity? They also tend to be budget issues, or questions about pension systems, retirement savings and so forth. I'm motivated by practical questions. And then I try to find a rigorous, data-based and mathematical way to approach those questions.
 Q. 
 And that's tended to be through these really big data sets.
 A. 
 In my view, the reason that the economics profession has had such a hard time answering these fundamental questions - like what type of tax system is the best, or how do you reduce unemployment - is that we in the social sciences can't run experiments like you can in the laboratory sciences. You really can't do it. 
So my approach and the approach of other applied economists has been to seek these enormous data sets, whether they be from the private sector or the government or elsewhere. You can see the impact that these enormous data sets are having in the private sector. And my research is saying, you can use such data sets to answer public policy questions in fruitful ways too, because with those enormous data sets, you can run quasi-experiments within them.
 Q. 
 What are you working on now? 
 A. 
 I'm broadly interested in the inequality of opportunity in the United States, and we hope to have a new paper out in a few months on that. And as you know, I'm interested in the role education might play in giving kids an opportunity to move up in the income distribution.

HEADLINE: Inflation Is Miserable. Unemployment Is Worse.

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: A new study finds that unemployment lowers people&#8217;s sense of well-being about four times as much as inflation. 

 BODY:
Unemployment makes people unhappy, according to economic research. So does inflation. But here's the part the economists are paid for: evidence that unemployment makes people more miserable than inflation. 
About four times as miserable, according to a new paper.
That's a big difference with potentially significant implications for central bankers, who have long treated lower inflation as their primary goal.
The paper is based on surveys of Europeans between 1975 and 2012, a stretch of time that includes periods of high inflation and high unemployment. It was presented on Friday by David G. Blanchflower, an economist at Dartmouth College, at a conference held by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. 
Higher unemployment and higher inflation correlate with lower levels of reported well-being, the research shows. But the impact of unemployment is much larger. A one percentage point increase in unemployment lowers well-being nearly four times as much as an equivalent rise in inflation, the paper says.
A 2003 paper by Justin Wolfers, an economist at the University of Michigan, reached a similar conclusion using survey data from the United States.
Monetary policy sometimes involves direct trade-offs between unemployment and inflation. Driving down the pace of price increases tends to drive up unemployment, while allowing faster inflation can help to stimulate job creation.
It is easy to treat the two measures as equivalent. The economist Arthur Okun coined the term "misery index" in the 1970s for the sum of the inflation rate and the unemployment rate. The Fed's dual mandate enshrines the same equal weighting.
And in practice, central banks including the Fed treat inflation as much more important - in part because economists argue that suppressing inflation improves the stability of economic growth, thereby limiting unemployment over time.
Professor Blanchflower said central banks had it backward.
"It makes sense for central bankers to target unemployment, given that unemployment hurts more than inflation does," he said.

HEADLINE: To Celebrate a Landmarks Law, Planting Flags in a Tiny New York

BYLINE: JAMES BARRON


HIGHLIGHT: As part of a project to highlight the 50th anniversary of a landmarks law, 109 yellow flags will mark the city&#8217;s historic districts on the Queens Museum of Art&#8217;s Panorama. 

 BODY:
David Grainger is walking on the water again. One foot is upstream from the Manhattan Bridge and the other foot is downstream from the Williamsburg Bridge, and he is reaching over the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway to plant a yellow flag at the intersection of Pierrepont Street and Hicks Street in Brooklyn Heights.
His feet are covered in protective blue booties. The booties protect the water, which is not water at all but dark-blue paint on wood. 
He is standing on the surface of the Queens Museum of Art's Panorama, the 9,335-square-foot diorama of the city built for the 1964 World's Fair. The yellow flag is one of 109 that he is putting in place as part of a project to highlight the city's historic districts and the 50th anniversary of the municipal law that made them possible.
 "The flags give some sense of place to viewers, residents and visitors," said Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel, an author and preservationist who has organized the NYC Landmarks50 Advisory Committee to mark the anniversary of the law in 2015. "The Panorama is all about all of New York. It describes graphically and quickly the reach of the landmarks movement. People might say there are 109 that encompass 30,000 properties. Does that sound like a lot? It represents less than 3 percent of all of the properties in New York City."
The World's Fair straddled two important moments in the history of historic preservation: The demolition of the old Pennsylvania Station in 1963 and the approval of the landmarks law in 1965. 
The Landmarks50 Advisory Committee has a long list of members that includes Simeon Bankoff, the executive director of the Historic Districts Council; Kent L. Barwick, a former chair of the landmarks commission and president emeritus of the Municipal Art Society; Peg Breen, president of the private New York Landmarks Conservancy; Vin Cipolla, president of the Municipal Art Society; Andrew S. Dolkart, director of the Historic Preservation Program at Columbia University; the architecture critic Paul Goldberger; and the designer Massimo Vignelli, who created the group's logo.
Ms. Diamonstein-Spielvogel said one of the committee's goals was to highlight the significance of historic preservation in shaping the city since the 1960s. 
"I think it reflects the growth and importance of the landmarks movement, which I consider to be one of the most important national movements after things like human rights, civil rights, gay rights," she said. "Down that same line is the historic preservation movement. It cuts across all economic lines. There isn't a neighborhood, certainly not in New York, that doesn't have a range of organizations public and private devoted to this."
On the Panorama, there is a one-district, one-flag policy. So there was one flag for the 75 blocks of the Upper West Side/Central Park West district, one flag for the one-block West 71st Street Historic District and one for each of the other districts, which are spread across all five boroughs. 
 "As the flags go up," said Mr. Bankoff of the Historic Districts Council, who watched as Mr. Grainger planted the flags, "you see how many historic districts there are compared to how large the city is. On the one hand, there are people who say there's too much preservation, and on the other, you look around and see how few areas are protected and how much more there is to be done."
Mr. Bankoff said the district in Brooklyn Heights - the one Mr. Grainger had stretched to reach - was the city's first, designated in November 1965. Four more districts, all in Manhattan, came into being the next year.
By this time Mr. Grainger, an art installer, hunting for the place to plant the flag for the Fillmore Place Historic District in Williamsburg, was on his knees in the East River.
It is territory Mr. Grainger knows well - he repainted the water several years ago, and lately has been vacuuming off dust that has accumulated since then - and territory that Mr. Bankoff approached with apprehension.
"I'm terrified I'll trip over the Verrazano," he said.

HEADLINE: A Mortgage Holiday for Some Borrowers Hurt by Hurricane

BYLINE: MIREYA NAVARRO


HIGHLIGHT: The federal government announced that borrowers with home loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration could suspend mortgage payments for up to one year while they repair their homes. 

 BODY:
Thousands of homeowners whose properties were damaged by Hurricane Sandy and cannot make their mortgage payments have gotten another reprieve - the federal government announced Friday that borrowers with home loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration could suspend mortgage payments for up to one year while they repair their homes. 
Homeowners with federally backed loans had already been given a payment delay period of six months that was due to expire April 30. About 286,000 homeowners with F.H.A. loans in the areas affected by the storm, including more than 95,700 in New York and about 32,513 in New Jersey, are now eligible for the new 12-month relief.
Shaun Donovan, the secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, said borrowers would also be able to work out repayment plans to avoid having to pay the missed payments in a lump sum at the end of the delay or forbearance period. Mr. Donovan said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled mortgage finance companies that guarantee most loans, are offering similar accommodations.
"This would ensure that families don't face a crisis when this period ends," he said.
Mr. Donovan spoke at a news conference in the Manhattan office of Senator Chuck Schumer, who urged banks to "follow the cues of the government agencies" and defer payments as well. Private loans with no federal backing account for a relatively small percentage of all mortgages.
