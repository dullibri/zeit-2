HEADLINE: NATO's Cousin Organization Will Meet on Crisis

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 20

 BODY:
Amid criticism that they have not yet developed a coherent response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, key Western European governments are to meet here Tuesday under the auspices of a little-known defense organization that has long been overshadowed by NATO.
The Western European Union, as it is known, comprises nine countries that are members of both the European Community and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But unlike NATO, which can operate only in Europe and North America, the Western European Union has no geographical restrictions on its activities. 
''This is our main appeal today,'' an official of the organization said. ''Our charter says we can respond to threats to peace 'in whatever area this threat should arise' as well as to threats to our economic stability. It's tailor-made for the current crisis.''
With both foreign and defense ministers expected to attend Tuesday's session, experts said the organization aimed to coordinate European naval activities in the Persian Gulf and to provide a political umbrella for governments wary of becoming involved militarily in the crisis.
After the meeting, foreign ministers of the 12-nation European Community - the nine nations of the Western European Union plus Greece, Ireland and Denmark - are also to meet here to discuss the fate of some 7,700 Community citizens who are trapped in Iraq and Kuwait.
While working together diplomatically, however, Western European nations have so far failed to develop a common military strategy, with Britain alone in joining the United States in an international force protecting Saudi Arabia and only France also sending naval reinforcements to the gulf.
Several governments nonetheless now seem willing to act more forcefully. The Netherlands today ordered two frigates to the gulf. Warships sent by Italy and Belgium to the eastern Mediterranean may also move into the gulf if given the green light by the Western European Union.
Belgium said any decision to send its three minesweepers into the gulf would depend on the Western European Union's stand.
Spain, which is allowing American aircraft to use United States bases in its territory to refuel on their way to Saudi Arabia, has already alerted several warships in expectation of the Paris meeting. Portugal and Luxembourg, the remaining members of the organization, have so far not disclosed their plans.
 
Bonn Won't Send Warships
BONN, West Germany, Aug. 20 (Reuters) - West Germany will not send any warships to the Persian Gulf because such action would violate its Constitution, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said today.
He told reporters that Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Government and party leaders had agreed unanimously that a military operation in the gulf region would be contrary to the Constitution, which bars West Germany from sending warships on combat missions outside NATO's area.
But he said the meeting, which included the opposition's candidate for chancellor, Oskar Lafontaine, favored a constitutional amendment to allow West German forces to go to the gulf as part of a United Nations force.

HEADLINE: Looking for Better Life, They Found Welfare

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NASHUA, N.H., Aug. 20

 BODY:
Cecelia D. Fernandes and her husband moved to New Hampshire 10 months ago, seeking a better place to raise their two children. They left a second-floor apartment in Lowell, Mass., looking for a backyard and lower rents.
Ms. Fernandes found the backyard, but she found something else she was not looking for: New Hampshire's economy had declined so much that she was unable to keep her family above the poverty line after she and her husband separated in January.
She is just one of many New Hampshire residents who have entered the halls of welfare offices for the first time in the past year. A Federal Agriculture Department report recently found that applications for welfare have risen 38 percent in New Hampshire, while food stamp applications have jumped 54 percent, the highest rise of any state in the country. 
 
A Regional Slowdown
New Hampshire's plight has been a direct consequence of a regional economic slowdown that has touched all the New England states, pushing up unemployment, slowing wage growth and depressing real estate prices after years of spectacular growth. But state officials say the economic decline has been particularly hard and fast in New Hampshire, and that people who migrated to the state only a year ago are discovering a chilly job market.
Officials at the state's Division of Human Services recently concluded a six month study to discover the roots of the state's sharp increase in welfare applicants. The three most typical situations, the study found, involved families who were splitting up, people who had been laid off or had lost income such as child support, and those who had moved to the state but had been unable to find a good job.
Ms. Fernandes qualifies in the first category. She and her husband are getting a divorce. She gave birth to her third son 12 days ago, but has managed to hold down an $8,500-a-year job as a preschool aide in Lowell, a 20-minute trip away. She is not looking for a better-paying job because one of her children will attend the preschool with her beginning in September, off-setting her child-care costs.
When her husband recently started sending child support payments of $112 a week, she went off welfare but still relies on $70 a week in food stamps. And she has moved into a two-bedroom apartment in Nashua that has a backyard. ''There's room for the children to play outside, so it's nice,'' she said.
 
Named Best Place to Live
Ms. Fernandes's story is a common one in Nashua, where state officials report that applications for welfare and food stamps have jumped more than 50 percent in the past year. Only a few years ago, Nashua was bursting with civic pride when Money magazine ranked it as the best place to live in the country, citing its strong economy, low crime rate and arts and leisure attractions. Today, the city's unemployment stands at 7.1 percent, up from 2.9 percent in 1989.
Madeline Avilus, a 37-year-old mother of two who is separated from her husband, applied for welfare benefits for the first time a year ago when she lost her job working for a temporary-employment agency. Ms. Avilus, who had moved from Massachusetts to New Hampshire three years ago, had been working through the agency for Lockheed Sanders, a defense electronics subsidiary of the Lockheed Corporation that relies almost entirely on federal contracts. ''I was hoping that it would lead to a full-time job at Sanders, but then the company started laying people off,'' Ms. Avilus said.
''A year ago, this place was supposed to be the best place to get a job. People told me there were lots of jobs and career opportunities. But now there are no jobs,'' said Ms. Avilus, who is applying for financial assistance at a local technical college where she wants to study to be a paralegal.
 
Looking for Work
Jessica Creekmore moved from Massachusetts to New Hampshire four months ago because she had heard that the cost of living was lower. But as a 21-year-old mother of two children who is pregnant with her third child, Ms. Creekmore is applying for welfare and food stamps because her husband, from whom she is separated, has stopped sending child-support payments.
Unable to find a job, Ms. Creekmore said she needs to find work that pays enough to cover her child care costs, which she estimates at $170 a week. ''I wouldn't apply for welfare if I could get a job and do day care, too, but I can't do both at the same time,'' she said.
Ms. Creekmore, who estimates that she is about one month pregnant, has not seen a doctor yet about her pregnancy because of the expense, but she is applying for Medicaid so that she can seek medical care. She has gotten clothes for her family at the Salvation Army in Nashua.
Except for a three-month period a year ago, this is Ms. Creekmore's first experience with welfare and food stamps. ''It's my own fault,'' she said. ''I got married too young. I had kids too young. I'm pregnant again, and I don't believe in abortion. It's all my own fault.''

HEADLINE: Time Squeezes Iraq

 BODY:
A frustrated and besieged Saddam Hussein now makes a liar of his Foreign Minister and affronts law and Islamic custom by interning ''foreign guests'' in Iraq and Kuwait. In fact, as President Bush said yesterday, thousands of innocent citizens are now hostages. Small wonder that some Americans respond viscerally, urging armed reprisals or even a declaration of war. 
A less heated reading is that Iraq's latest outrage is more desperate than menacing. It affords no reason suddenly to deviate from the strong, sound policies that Mr. Bush and the world are still arraying against this outlaw regime. Once military forces are in place opposing Iraq, the strength that will free hostages and end the crisis is the strength to be patient.
Pessimists fear that time is on President Hussein's side, that leaks will spring in the oil embargo against Iraq and that Americans won't support a prolonged siege in the Persian Gulf. These assumptions are highly debatable. Iraq's economy and morale are already being squeezed, its ports closed by a growing international armada that will soon total more than 100 ships.
Baghdad has yet to gain a single major ally. On the contrary, the massive deployment of planes, ships and troops to Saudi Arabia seems already to have achieved its purpose, of deterring wider Iraqi adventurism. The United Arab Emirates now joins in asking American military help.
The policy intended to force Saddam Hussein to disgorge Kuwait is not an American but an international effort, and that policy has already won the support of an impressively united United Nations. It has condemned Iraq's use of foreigners as human shields, an affront that has helped nudge France closer to the American view on the need for multinational enforcement of a U.N. embargo. And as Mr. Bush noted yesterday, for the first time since World War II the Soviet Union and the United States are again allies against aggression.
Its pipelines closed and its supply routes through Jordan in doubt, Iraq turned to Iran for trade and aid. But the humiliating gift to Teheran of disputed territory gained little for President Hussein except the ability to shift 140,000 Iraqi soldiers to the southern frontier.
And now he maneuvers in ways that suggest he is groping to try to undo a monumental miscalculation. Dispersing hostages as human shields to scattered bases bespeaks fear of attack, not lust for vengeance. He implies that, if pressed solely by Arabs, he just might leave Kuwait. And he abruptly offers to free all hostages and accept U.N. peacekeepers if the U.S. withdraws forces from Saudi Arabia.
These quick shifts argue that Saddam Hussein does not believe time is on Iraq's side. Mr. Bush, and the world, can draw encouragement from these gyrations. The once-unthinkable idea that Iraq would yield up Kuwait with little to show for its conquest now seems conceivable, if the world maintains its strength - and patience.

HEADLINE: Try International Law in Dealing With Iraq

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It might be useful to consider Iraqi behavior from three different points of view: legal, moral and political.
Legally, there is no doubt that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait violated the United Nations Charter, which forbids the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. However Iraq might have viewed Kuwait, to the other members of the United Nations it was a member and a state.
But the United States must have peculiar problems in applying these provisions in light of our actions in Grenada, Panama and Nicaragua. To imagine that the countries of the Middle East are not familiar with this recent history is naive. 
The responses to this violation of law by Iraq are being made by the United Nations itself, whose Security Council has decided to institute an embargo. There are legal problems regarding the Council's authority, shown by our own violation of the equivalent sanctions imposed by the Council against Southern Rhodesia before it became Zimbabwe. Again, it would be naive to imagine the people in the Middle East and elsewhere are unaware of the hypocrisy apparent in our righteous rhetoric.
Morally, there is an even more muddled situation. Kuwait is not morally entitled to independence or the continuation of its preinvasion Constitution any more than Iraq is morally entitled to take the country over. The wealth of the Middle East results primarily from nature's distribution of oil, regardless of the moral stature of the elites controlling territory.
Nor were the British and others impelled by moral imperatives when supporting clan leaders as ''sovereigns'' of territories detached from the Ottoman Empire. It is hard to understand why the happiness of the greatest number of people in the advanced industrial states, and their thirst for cheap oil, is a better guide to moral righteousness than the ambitions of Arab leaders or the Arab people as a whole. In my opinion, the moral analysis leads to no clear result at this time.
Politically, the picture is, if anything, even more muddled. No doubt short-term American political interest would be served by the elimination of Saddam Hussein from Middle Eastern politics, but whether that would serve our long-term interests will not be clear, unless we know who would succeed him, what the impact of the methods used to displace him would be on the area's other political actors and other factors.
In any case, that elimination is probably not feasible except by luck or an intrigue that would be more likely to fail than succeed and would be almost certain to fail in the long run, even if it succeeds in the short. The Iranian lessons of Mohammed Mossadegh and the Shah, with the ultimate rise of fundamentalism and the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini as its result, must not be forgotten.
Nor is it clear that destroying Saddam Hussein will destroy his poison gas stocks and nuclear facilities or that his successor will care less for those tools than he. Do we plan to conquer Iraq and occupy it? Really?
Finally, the economic, social and other implications of our re-entering the Middle East as a military presence seem in danger of being underestimated. We withdrew in some disarray from Lebanon when the oversimplifications that guided military policy became clear, and Lebanon is now bordering on anarchy; the Palestine Liberation Organization is back. It is not clear what air and naval power will do to the play of politics, and the strategist Karl von Clausewitz showed more than a century and a half ago how military activity not coordinated with a rational political program is self-destructive. Have our leaders in mind a realistic plan for our withdrawal and for the future of Iraq under Saddam Hussein? Or are we once again engaging in short-term wishful thinking?
I suggest that America's clearest advantage now lies in the international law we have disparaged for 10 years and more, and in the legal institutions that remove these questions from national discretion and place them on the international agenda, however frustrating the process may be.

HEADLINE: FOREIGN AFFAIRS;
Steady Against Saddam

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis

DATELINE: MINORCA, Spain

 BODY:
Early in the Persian Gulf crisis, Secretary of State James Baker retorted to the suggestion that the invasion of Kuwait was an Arab issue, for the Arab states to settle. ''No,'' he said, ''it is a world issue.'' So it remains.
It is about power and domination. It isn't essentially about the legitimacy of Kuwaiti emirs nor their country's right to independence. Nor is it about the price of oil. The price of oil was going up anyway, because of OPEC's agreement and mostly because the U.S. and others have grown sloppy about applying the 1970's lessons of excessive dependence. 
True, there would probably have been little world reaction had it not been for the oil and wealth at stake. But it is straightforward realism, not hypocrisy, to see that the oil and wealth concerned make the difference between another nasty aggression in an unstable region and the future of the world.
No country would be unaffected, no economy would be reliable, no development plans sustainable if President Saddam Hussein of Iraq could achieve his ambition of becoming master of the gulf. The Arab regimes in the area are in imminent danger, which is why they welcome Western protective force. But the U.S. would lose not only its world power status but its ability to govern its own destiny if it were unwilling to confront the menace.
This central issue must be clearly understood before the temptation grows to bog down in arguments about cost, strategic options and Arab history. The choice is not whether to confront President Hussein or to seek a tolerable compromise; it is whether to accept the challenge now or later, in much worse circumstances.
The enormous military buildup being established against him is not an extravagance. In strictly military terms, it is sound. The Soviets displayed in their invasions of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and Afghanistan in 1979 the military truism that force has the best chance of rapid success if it's overwhelming. That still holds. The opposite approach of sidling into battle, as the U.S. did in Vietnam, is the most dangerous.
But the Soviet campaigns also showed that brilliant military operations aren't enough. The political objectives must be evident and widely acceptable. This is the case in the gulf as long as the United States keeps its cool resolve and its determination to rally international support.
Saddam Hussein's craven use of hostages does not change the stakes. It is right to denounce him for that and to do all possible to extricate the hapless foreigners caught in his adventure.
But we must not repeat the grave mistake of the American Embassy hostage crisis in Teheran. The hostages' ordeal was enormously prolonged by the frenzied American reaction, proving to hostage-takers that they had stumbled on a much more potent weapon against the U.S. than they had imagined.
The hostages' value to President Hussein should not be enhanced by public wailing and media hysterics.
This is not to say that the United States can only counterattack. America and the rest of the world do not want to go to war. President Bush should continue to make that very clear, despite the shouts of Rambos like the editorialist of The Orange County Daily Pilot, in California, who wrote: ''America has spent $300 billion a year to build up its military. Let's put it to use.'' The limit on the capacity of firmly enforced sanctions and international isolation to wear Saddam Hussein down and prove his mistake depends on us, not on him. It is already a form of surrender to say that democracies haven't the stamina to keep up the pressure and must strike or quit.
Steadfastness is also the answer to emotional Arab populations that are cheering the Iraqi dictator. They are applauding him for bravura, for giving vent to their frustrations, but they don't applaud losers. He can only count on them as long as they think he will win.
The turmoil of the Arab world is deep and intricate. Saving kings and sheiks won't stabilize it. In any case, their era is hastening to a close. But the Arab dreams of renewing past glory can only be approached now by working with others for mutual benefit. It was the culture of Islamic civilization when Europe was backward that brought it pre-eminence. Arab intellectuals should remind their people of the real strength of their roots.
It isn't too early for the West to start thinking of post-Saddam relations with the Arabs on a higher, less cynical plane. Meanwhile, it must make sure Saddam fails.

HEADLINE: Subway Improvements Will Be Delayed

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
Repairs to subway stations and tunnels, train yards and other New York mass-transit centers will be delayed for at least a year, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced yesterday.
About $500 million in capital projects planned for the next two years will be postponed, and $335 million of those projects may be eliminated if the city is unable to sell the New York Coliseum by the end of 1991, said Mortimer L. Downey, the agency's executive director.
Under a 1985 agreement between the city and the transportation authority, which jointly own the Coliseum, money from the sale of the four-acre Coliseum site was to be used for transit system improvements in the city and the region. Most of the money was to have gone to the New York City Transit Authority; the rest to suburban commuter railroads. 
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority oversees the Transit Authority, the Long Island Rail Road, the Metro-North Commuter Railroad, the Metropolitan Suburban Bus Authority and the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority.
 
Service Will Be Affected
''There will be impacts on service because of these delays,'' Mr. Downey said. ''Delaying the station projects is contrary to our goals of improving the stations and increasing ridership. But there's no other way to raise the money at this time.
''We'd expected this deal to close years ago,'' he added. ''We'll have to defer $170 million in projects that would have started in 1990 to 1991, and pay for them with money we know will be available next year. If the Coliseum doesn't close in 1991, we'll have to cancel the $335 million in projects permanently or from this five-year capital program. If it does close next year, we would have the funding in 1991 for all $500 million.''
The reduction in capital programs for the Transit Authority would be $299 million and for the suburban railroads, $36 million. As a result of the delay, the agency's 1990 capital spending will be cut from $1.5 billion to $1.2 billion.
The delays in capital improvements will cause additional problems for the Transit Authority, which announced last week that its operating-budget deficits were rapidly increasing.
 
Fares Could Increase
The deficits, which the agency estimated would be $109 million this year and more than $200 million in 1991, are likely to mean service cuts and fare increases, agency officials said. The growing deficits are a result of the New York area's weak economy; a sharp rise in subway fare-beaters, estimated at 6 percent of riders, and a 3.4 percent decline in ridership in the first half of 1990.
The Coliseum was put up for sale in February 1985, but litigation over various development proposals for the site have delayed the sale. If pending lawsuits are resolved and the site is sold by next spring, the capital program could move ahead, Mr. Downey said. ''If it's not sold by then, we have to assume it won't happen,'' he said.
The projects that are affected are part of an $8.6 billion, five-year capital program that began in 1987. In addition to the delay announced yesterday, the agency has had ''a small shortfall in Federal funds,'' Mr. Downey said. It had expected to receive $2 billion from the Federal Government for the five-year program, but will get only $1.9 billion, he said.
''Every other piece of the plan has fallen into place,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Board of Estimate Approves Rockaway Housing Complex

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
A proposed housing complex with 7,500 condominium apartments on a two-mile stretch of beachfront in the Arverne section of Rockaway in Queens was approved last night by the New York City Board of Estimate.
The site, which was cleared of run-down beach bungalows more than 20 years ago through urban renewal, is the largest vacant property available for development in the city.
The developer, Oceanview Associates, bid $90 million last year to buy the 308 acres of city-owned land. It also agreed to provide as much as $300 million to create streets, sewers, playgrounds, garage space, parks, a firehouse and other public works. 
In its last meeting before its demise under the new City Charter, the board voted 9 to 2 to approve the project. Before the vote, city officials said the city had agreed to pay a substantial portion of the cost of the public works, including building two schools, and some of the cost of new roads and sewers. In all, the city's share would come to about $138 million and the developer's share would be about $180 million, said Felice Michetti, the Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development.
 
Holtzman Votes No
City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman cast the only votes against the proposal. Ms. Holtzman said she was concerned because the financial arrangements had shifted significantly recently, with the city picking up more of the burden. Ms. Holtzman also cited criticisms of the proposal from state environmental officials, who said that not enough attention had been paid to the potential effects of beach erosion and water pollution.
Ms. Holtzman said she favored redeveloping the vast stretch of land at Arverne, ''but I'm not prepared to write a blank check.''
Borough President Claire Shulman of Queens, a longtime proponent of the plan, said she was more concerned ''about the environment of the people who live in the Rockaways.''
Mrs. Shulman said the complex would help revitalize the area, one of the poorest in the city, and would give the Rockaways ''a shot in the arm.'' #3- and 4-Story Town Houses Most of the apartments would be in three- and four-story town houses, with the remainder in mid-rise buildings. When the plan was announced last year, city officials said the apartments would sell at market rates, at prices ranging from $155,000 to $180,000, and would be affordable to families with annual incomes of at least $60,000.
Ms. Michetti said yesterday that plans now call for apartments near the beach to sell for an average of $177,000 and for those farther from the beach to sell for an average of $135,000. To buy the more expensive apartments, a family would need an annual income of about $65,000, and to buy the less expensive ones a family would need an annual income of about $52,000, city officials said.
Some civic groups, particularly those involved with the Nehemiah program in Brooklyn, which produces low-cost subsidized row houses for families with incomes of about $33,000, had sought city support last year to build about 3,200 low-income town houses at Arverne.
But the Koch and Dinkins administrations, along with Mrs. Shulman and many residents of the Rockaways, supported market-rate housing. They contended that the Rockaway peninsula already contained more than its fair share of city housing projects and other low-income housing.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Reinstates Funds to Bolster Tourism

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins announced yesterday that he was reinstating city funds for the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau in an effort to halt the downturn in tourism.
''I realize how vital your efforts are to this city's economy,'' he said in a speech to the group's board yesterday. ''That's why I have reversed the decision of the previous administration to eliminate city funding of the C.V.B., and I have insured that your organization gets a share of the revenue generated by the increase in the hotel tax.''
During the Koch administration, the bureau's budget was cut by nearly one-third in the city's budget squeeze.
''We were getting about $1.2 million the last year,'' said Marshall E. Murdaugh, the president of the bureau. ''This was at a time when cities like Miami, Los Angeles and San Francisco had identified tourism as a growth industry that needed to be nurtured.''
Earlier this year, the Dinkins administration helped win passage of state legislation that permits one-quarter of 1 percent of the 21.5 percent hotel tax to go for tourism. City officials said the bureau was to get three-quarters of the money from that share of the tax, while the city would get the rest.
The bureau is to receive about $3 million a year, which with other funds will give it an annual budget of $7 million to $9 million, Mr. Murdaugh said. He said tourism, which the United States Travel Data Center estimates generates about $10 billion a year for the city, was ''generally down or flat.''
He said the funds would allow the bureau to double its sales staff to 10 people, reopen the visitors center in Times Square and open a Washington office to attract more conventions to New York.

HEADLINE: Richard Strout, 'TRB' Columnist And Capital Reporter, Dies at 92

BYLINE: By JOAN COOK

 BODY:
Richard L. Strout, the acerbic nonconformist who wrote the ''TRB From Washington'' political column in The New Republic for 40 years and was Washington correspondent for The Christian Science Monitor for more than 60 years, died Sunday at the Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington. He was 92 years old and lived in Washington.
Mr. Strout had been in the hospital since Aug. 8, when he suffered a fall, said Richard J. Cattani, editor of The Monitor.
As the pseudonymous TRB from 1943 to 1983, Mr. Strout was one of the country's most widely followed liberal columnists. He once compared Senator Joseph R. McCarthy to ''a mist that carries lethal contagion,'' and in 1958 he wrote of Vice President Richard M. Nixon, ''He is out for the kill and the scalp at any cost.'' 
''When I took the job, I was advised that the column was easy to write,'' he said in 1968. ''Just get mad at someone once a week and spit in his eye.''
 
A Passionate Liberal
But Mr. Strout's voice was seldom merely angry. His liberalism was passionate and his outlook broad. In his first column, at the height of World War II, he called for a national statement of postwar aims, saying, ''When a man dies, he wants to die for something important.''
''The rich stay rich in the U.S., and the poor, poor, and the gulf between them hardly changes,'' another column began. ''America's disparity of income is the single most significant and sinister social fact in the nation. Everything comes back to that.''
Mr. Strout succeeded Kenneth Crawford as the column's writer. The name TRB, the initials of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit system in reverse, was coined by Bruce Bliven, the magazine's onetime editor, who used to rush copy to the printer by subway in the days when it was published in New York.
Mr. Strout shunned entangling alliances with Washington politicians and avoided the round of Georgetown cocktail parties. He covered 12 Presidents, from Warren G. Harding to Ronald Reagan, and national scandals from Teapot Dome to Watergate. He characterized Calvin Coolidge as ''a sharp, unimaginative Yankee who took lots of naps'' and Herbert Hoover as ''a towering figure in many ways, caught in a Greek tragedy he never understood.'' The greatest President, he wrote, was Franklin D. Roosevelt, ''a superb combination of Machiavelli's lion and fox.''
 
To Washington in a Model T
Richard Lee Strout was born in Cohoes, N.Y., on March 14, 1898, and raised in Brooklyn. After graduating from Harvard University in 1919, he worked his way across the Atlantic on a grain ship and began his career as a confidential assistant to the editor of The Sheffield Independent in England. He returned to the United States in 1921 and worked briefly for The Boston Post, then moved to The Monitor.
In 1923, after receiving a master's degree in economics from Harvard, he drove his Model T Ford to The Monitor's Washington bureau, where he remained until his retirement in 1984.
He won many awards, including a Pulitzer Prize for lifetime achievement in 1978 and the George Polk Memorial Award for national reporting in 1958.
In his last TRB column, on the crisis in Soviet-American relations in April 1983, he wrote: ''Presidents come and Presidents go. You can measure passage of time, I think, by counting the things we knew couldn't happen.'' After listing events like school desegregation and the election of a Catholic President, he added, ''And there was another absolute: America couldn't lose a war.''
Mr. Strout's first wife, Edith Mayne, died in 1932.
He is survived by his wife, the former Ernestine Wilke; four daughters, Elizabeth Zimmmerman of Minneapolis, Mary Rubeiz of Geneva, Phyllis Norris of Santa Cruz, Calif., and Nancy Dulaney of Washington; a son, Alan M. of Weston, Mass., 11 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: New Direction in Physics: Back in Time

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
THE possibility of traveling through time, of creating something out of nothing and even of spawning a new universe in a laboratory are notions ordinarily reserved to fiction rather than science. But a rash of articles in some of the most prestigious scientific publications suggests that theoretical physicists have begun to take such outlandish ideas seriously.
Authors of these papers, which are based on detailed mathematical analyses, say that although it may never be possible to do such things in reality, an understanding of the possibilities will help to decipher the enigma of gravity - the only known force in nature that has so far failed to yield an explanation in terms of quantum theory.
Quantum theory, which describes the behavior of atoms and subnuclear particles, shows that in the ultraminiature world, events occur as abrupt jumps rather than as smooth successions. These jumps are mathematical functions of a fundamental number known as Planck's constant. 
Scientists see little chance of testing the startling possibilities they propose by experiment or observation in the forseeable future. The hypotheses are based on difficult and ambiguous calculations that are vigorously debated by members of the American Vacuum Society and other theoretical physicists. Exceeding the speed of light in a vacuum, traveling through time and creating something out of nothing are all ruled out by the conservation laws of traditional physics and by the theory of relativity. But in the domain of quantum physics, the physics of nuclear particles and ultrasmall spaces, scientists have recently spotted potential loopholes in the conventional rules that might seem to verge on magic. Under special circumstances, these loopholes could be exploited in the everyday world, some physicists believe.
Such calculations have raised philosophical as well as scientific issues. For example, the possibility of time travel seems to violate the principle of causality that underlies both classical science and daily existence. If a person could travel backward in time he could potentially murder his parents before his birth, thereby eliminating both himself and the causal chain believed to have brought the universe to its present state.
Three years ago Dr. Kip S. Thorne, a theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, caused a stir among theoretical astrophysicists by suggesting the possibility of building a time machine. Dr. Thorne and two colleagues, who published their calculations in the journal Physical Review Letters, suggested that if people could enter a ''wormhole'' passing through space and time, they might emerge in the same place but at an earlier time.
In Dr. Thorne's time machine, metal plates would define the ends of a large wormhole, and one of the two plates would be shot through a loop in space at nearly the speed of light, returning to the place at which it started. Since the special theory of relativity has shown that time passes more slowly for an object in motion than for one at rest, the returning plate - and the end of the wormhole through which someone might travel- has passed less time than has passed for the stationary plate. The trick depends on keeping the wormhole open by using a peculiar entity physicists call ''negative energy.''
Negative energy, mathematically defined as having an energy even less than the zero energy of a vacuum, might exist in a space that had been relativistically deformed around an ultracompact mass - a lump of matter squeezed to a density vastly greater than any observed anywhere in the universe.
One of the difficulties raised by Dr. Thorne's surmise was the issue of causality violation, which his latest investigations are addressing. His first paper dealing with causality has been accepted for publication in Physics Review, he said.
''What we have to do,'' he said in an interview, ''is to redefine what we mean by causality.'' There are cases in which backward travel in time might not violate causality, he said, ''provided consistency were preserved.''
Analysis on Changing History Dr. Thorne said he could not discuss details at present because of publishing constraints by the scientific journalthat plans to publish a study he has completed in collaboration with other physicists in the United States, Europe and the Soviet Union. But a former student of Dr. Thorne, Dr. Ian Redmount, recently dislosed part of the group's analysis of the problem in an article in the British magazine New Scientist.
Dr. Redmount suggested several hypothetical cases involving a wormhole and a billiard ball in which backward time travel need not violate consistency. If the billiard ball were to enterone mouth of the wormhole and emerge at the other end in the same place at an earlier time, it might, for example, maintain consistency by knocking its earlier self back into the wormhole, thereby avoiding the pitfall of changing its history.
The negative energy Dr. Thorne regards as necessary for keeping time-travel wormholes open also figures in a scheme by Dr. Alan H. Guth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for creating new universes in the laboratory.
Dr. Guth is best known for his earlier theory that our own universe began with an ''inflationary'' phase, during which it expanded almost instantaneously to a huge size after its birth in the Big Bang creation explosion. During the inflationary phase, Dr. Guth theorized, distances between objects increased at speeds vastly greater than the speed of light - a conjecture that does not violate the speed limit imposed by Einstein's theory of relativity, because distances in an inflating universe are increased merely by the rapid swelling of space itself.
In their recent investigation, Dr. Guth and his colleagues at M.I.T. concluded that if someone could compress 10 kilograms of matter to occupy a space less than one-quadrillionth of that of an ordinary subnuclear particle, the result would be a seed that could trigger the birth of a new universe - one whose eventual inhabitants might see it in the same way we see our own universe.
A 'False Vacuum' The seed, Dr. Guth says, would consist of a spatial region of ''false vacuum'' - a region charged with the negative energy essential to driving the inflation of the infant universe. Starting from virtually nothing, the expanding space in such a universe would create for itself all the particles of matter and energy that make up a universe like our own.
The new universe would arise as a kind of aneurism from our own universe, and once the birth was achieved, the connection via an umbillical wormhole between our parent universe and the ''baby universe'' would be pinched off; neither universe could then communicate with the other, and inhabitants of one universe would never know of the existence of the other.
Dr. Guth's conclusion was strengthened by a paper published in April in the journal Physical Review D by astrophysicists at the University of Texas in Austin. Dr. Willy Fischler, Dr. Joseph Polchinski and a student, Dr. Daniel Morgan, investigated Dr. Guth's ''baby universe'' theory using an different approach.
Dr. Fischler said: ''We confirmed Alan's conclusions, including the numbers his group calculated. Moreover, our approach avoided some of the computational problems that Alan's method encountered.
''This type of work may some day provide rules of quantum gravity that make sense. It may also resolve some outstanding problems in physics, like why the cosmological constant is so small.''
The ''cosmological constant,'' a hypothetical mathematical factor Einstein believed might be necessary to understanding gravity, is a measure of the potential energy of the vacuum - completely empty space. Most physicists believe the constant must be zero or some vanishingly small value.
The Peculiar Exists Underlying all this speculation is the certainty that very peculiar things really do happen in the quantum realm - quantum effects that are essential to the functioning of transistors and most other modern electronic equipment.
Among these effects is ''tunneling,'' the mysterious disappearance of a particle (such as an electron) on one side of a barrier that ''classical'' physics would define as impenetrable, and the particle's reappearanceon the other side of the barrier. Some of the wormholes physicists are studying might serve as channels of communication between isolated universes by means of a similar kind of tunneling.
The renowned British astrophysicist Stephen W. Hawking of Cambridge University and Dr. Sidney Coleman of Harvard University suggest that space is riddled with microscopic wormholes that constantly pop into and out of existence, sometimes creating baby universes.
''The sea of baby universes in which our universe moves,'' Dr. Coleman said in an interview, ''evolves by exchanging information between past and future universes. In a sense, information about such things as the cosmological constant is communicated to our universe from the outside, letting us look into our own generic future.''
Controversy Acknowledged ''Stephen Hawking and I have perhaps worked this out correctly, or perhaps we've made fools of ourselves. I won't tell you this subject isn't controversial,'' he added.
Among the physicists who sharply disagree with this interpretation is Dr. Fischler of the University of Texas.
But there seems to be little disagreement about some of the factors in their calculations, including that of negative energy.
According to quantum theory, the vacuum contains neither matter nor energy, but it does contain ''fluctuations,'' transitions between something and nothing in which potential existence can be transformed into real existence by the addition of energy.(Energy and matter are equivalent, since all matter ultimately consists of packets of energy.) Thus, the vacuum's totally empty space is actually a seething turmoil of creation and annihilation, which to the ordinary world appears calm because the scale of fluctuations in the vacuum is tiny and the fluctuations tend to cancel each other out. But experiments using giant particle accelerators have shown that every conceivable kind of subnuclear particle (along with its antimatter equivalent particle) is constantly popping into existence in the vacuum only to be immediately reunited with its antiparticle in mutual annihilation.
These short-lived ''virtual'' particles can be converted into a real particle by supplying it with the needed energy a task made possible by modern particle accelerators.
Fluctuations Observed In 1948 a Dutch physicist, Hendrick B. G. Casimir, theorized that if two electrically conductive metal plates are held close enough together in a vacuum, they distort the normal quantum fluctuations in the vacuum between them, and the result is a measurable attraction between the plates. Experiments in the 1950's confirmed the Casimir prediction. Theorists have since concluded that because of the distortion in fluctuations, the vacuum between the conducting plates contains negative energy.
Two of the most surprising new studies were reported in separate papers published this spring in Physics Letters B by Klaus Scharnhorst of Humboldt University in East Berlin and Gabriel Barton of the University of Sussex in Brighton, England. Using different approaches, the two physicists concluded that Casimir plates would exhibit another strange property: light passing through the vacuum between them would travel very slightly faster than does light in an ordinary vacuum.
This means only, they said, that the vacuum between the plates has a different structure than the normal vacuum, not that the speed limit imposed by relativity has really been violated. Some theorists have noted that the theory of relativity has not been violated because the new work merely suggests that the speed limit for light must be slightly raised in special circumstances. The predicted increase in the speed of the light would be so tiny, moreover, that no experiment could measure it.
Nonetheless, these papers have prompted a wave of new speculation that is compelling physicists to re-examine long-held assumptions.
In a comment on the work published by the British journal Nature, Dr. Stephen M. Barnett of Oxford University wrote, ''The vacuum is certainly a most mysterious and elusive object that makes itself known by only the most indirect of hints.''

HEADLINE: A Treat for Night Owls in Poland

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARSAW

 BODY:
It is midnight on a Wednesday and the line is forming for lemon-flavored Perrier, imported muesli, German beer and even Arab cheese. The counters gleam, the blue-frocked saleswomen beam, and business is transacted at a pace that startles people in this service-starved city.
Welcome to Michel Badre, Warsaw's first 24-hour convenience store. There are no Slurpees or Big Gulp beverage containers here. Yet in a city where they roll up the sidewalks by 10 P.M., the late-night, premium-priced impulse purchase has become the latest consumer phenomenon.
The business is the brainchild of Michel Badre, a French businessman from Strasbourg who hopes to become Poland's first national franchiser. Mr. Badre said he had never heard of America's ubiquitous 7-Eleven stores. But he knows that franchise arrangements like those pioneered by McDonald's translate in any language into billions of dollars - for the franchiser. 
Even so, turning Western ideas into reality in Poland will not be easy. Simple activities in the Western world, like making change, can be complicated for Polish store owners. And training sales help in the fine art of service has already proved tricky for Mr. Badre.
Yet he and his two Polish partners have come up with imaginative ways to cope with these and other obstacles. They hope to open 12 Michel Badre stores in Poland within a year.
Just as McDonald's strives to create a french fry that tastes the same in the capital of the Soviet Union and in Moscow, Idaho, Mr. Badre is prepared to offer the same consistently enticing brand of pate de foie gras throughout Poland.
''What we're trying to do is import a different method, a different image of commerce, another way of looking at things,'' said Mr. Badre, who was interviewed during one of his recent visits to Warsaw.
 
A Problem With Change
Mr. Badre's concepts are novel in food retailing in post-Communist Poland. Although private shops are taking hold in some of the major cities, the majority of stores in Warsaw are still Government-owned enterprises where the floors are dirty and the attitude of employees toward customers ranges from indifference to resentment.
Want a plastic bag? It's an extra cost. And most purchases cannot be concluded without that quintessential Polish ritual: the requirement that customers fish through every pocket to provide the necessary change.
Mr. Badre's formula seems to be working. Although Government statistics show Poland in a deep recession, the crowds are flocking to his store, opened this summer on one of Warsaw's major thoroughfares.
 
'A Tremendous Difference'
''There is a tremendous difference here,'' said Zbigniew Komon, a technician at the Warsaw phone company who says he is a regular customer. ''The sales assistants are very nice, there is a wide selection of goods, and everyone who works here is trying to help you. It's especially good that they are open on Saturdays and Sundays. Before, it was hardly possible to buy anything on the weekends.''
Mr. Badre said that 30 Polish investors had made offers for the chance to display the Michel Badre name and tricolor emblem, but Mr. Badre has not signed any agreements yet. Franchisers have to agree to buy 75 percent of their merchandise from Mr. Badre and would be subject to regular inspections to assure that they are meeting the standards set by the prototype store in Warsaw.
The venture was begun in July 1989, when a restaurateur in Strasbourg who bought wine from Mr. Badre, a food and beverage executive, introduced him to Slawomir Rudnicki, who was exporting flowers from Poland to Finland.
Mr. Badre had the notion that the collapsing Communist system in Poland offered opportunities for Western investors. Mr. Rudnicki was eager to participate in a food retailing venture and he brought in a friend, Dariusz Robicki, who helped the company obtain its choice location in Warsaw. The Frenchman and the two Polish partners together initially invested more than $700,000.
 
Imported Even the Paint
Although Mr. Badre professes to be pleased with the results so far, he said it had not been easy to turn his ideas about business into reality in Poland. Renovation of the first location in Warsaw, for example, turned into a nightmare of delays and shoddy workmanship and the company ended up importing building supplies and even paint from France.
Instilling the Western ideal of service with a smile has also presented problems. Juliusz Baranowski, the store's manager, said he had to dismiss three salespeople on the staff of 36 for rudeness to customers. He said several more dismissals were imminent for the same reason.
Mr. Baranowski, who worked previously at Warsaw's state-run radio factory, said it had taken time to convince his employees that it was not appropriate to smoke at the counter or to continue personal conversations when a customer walked in.
Still, Mr. Baranowski has come up with some innovative strategies for overcoming this country's obstacles to service-oriented retailing.
 
New Policy on Making Change
The Michel Badre store has a policy, which is not always observed, that the cashier, not the customer, will provide the change for each purchase. That is not as easy as it sounds. The present exchange rate for the Polish zloty is 9,500 to the dollar, and each customer spends tens of thousands of zlotys in 100- and 500-zloty denominations.
That makes it difficult for shopkeepers to make change. Mr. Baranowski says his store uses more 100-zloty notes daily than the central bank has available for all the stores in Warsaw. To avoid shortages, he said, he has an arrangement with nearby restaurants to buy up their small bills at the end of each evening's business.
 
Seeking Local Suppliers
Lining up local suppliers is also potentially nettlesome, one reason the chain imports nearly all its products. Mr. Baranowski says he is prepared to sell Polish goods, ''but only of quality.''
His first attempt to do business with Poland's state-run dairy monopoly proved disappointing. High-quality milk is hard to find in Poland and Michel Badre has been doing a brisk business selling far more expensive milk imported from France. Still, Mr. Baranowski thought he could make a better profit by signing a contract with a local dairy that could consistently deliver milk that was not spoiled or contaminated.
After a brief search, Mr. Baranowski found such a supplier, but he has failed to strike a deal despite negotiations that included a guaranteed 10 percent premium for the dairy above the payments made by its other customers. The reason: Mr. Baranowski said the dairy cooperative just did not want to bother to change its delivery schedule.
 
'He's Very Critical'
The Polish partners say the store's success stems, in part, from Mr. Badre's discerning eye for detail.
''It's only natural that because Mr. Badre lives in the West, he can organize a store better than we do in Poland,'' Mr. Rudnicki said. ''He's very critical and he spots a lot of things that you can change right away. When there are two saleswomen talking and they don't stop their conversation when a customer comes in; when a salesperson can't explain one of the products in the store, this is important. We see it, too, but it doesn't strike us as much.''
Still, Mr. Rudnicki says it will be a few years before capitalism makes inroads in Poland.
''If it's difficult to change the way of behavior for politicians, it's all the more difficult to change the behavior of the people,'' he said. ''If people behaved in one way for 45 years, it's going to take at least half that time again to reverse it. In the West it is simple: You give people a lot of money and they work better. Here, it's not the same. One in a hundred reacts to such an incentive. You have to have patience.''

HEADLINE: U.S.-Russian Shoemaking Venture Set

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
In a major consumer goods venture with the Soviet Union, a Long Island company has a preliminary agreement to help Russians produce 50 million pairs of shoes over the next decade.
The M.A.L. Sales Corporation of North Merrick, L.I., said it hoped to sign a final agreement in Moscow next month with Kimray, a Soviet shoemaker, and the Ministry of Light Industry of the Republic of Russia, to convert a factory to produce shoes for sale in both Russia and the West.
M.A.L., which specializes in making arrangements between American shoe retailers and domestic and foreign suppliers, will arrange for the Russians to buy American shoe manufacturing equipment, for the transportation and setting up of the equipment and for training some 600 Russian workers to use it. 
 
A Decade of Shoemaking
The 50 million pairs of leisure and work shoes to be produced over the next 10 years are expected to have a wholesale value of about $5 billion, according to Steve Wald, an M.A.L. consultant. But, he said, M.A.L. could not estimate now how much the deal might eventually be worth. The company expects to make money from the equipment sale and training contract and later to share in the revenue from the shoe sales.
M.A.L. expects to be paid in Russia with rubles and hard currency and to get additional hard currency from the shoes to be sold to the West, Mr. Wald added. ''Eventually, if all goes well, we hope to be hard-currency self-sufficient, but that may take some time,'' he said.
''The shoes will be in the economy price range,'' Mr. Wald said. ''That means that a canvas-and-leather jogger shoe will sell for the equivalent of $20. Later, we will also be making work shoes.'' Both the leisure shoe and the work shoe are said to be the types of footwear most in demand in Russia.
Initial goals are for production of 25,000 pairs of shoes daily and after two years this will be raised 100,000 a day, said Bert Cunningham, assistant to Stephen Latham, the Nassau County Commerce Commissioner.
 
'A Unique Deal'
''We think that this is a unique deal,'' Mr. Wald said. ''It all began when Martin Lorber, M.A.L.'s president, attended a seminar last April in Moscow jointly sponsored by the Harvard University Graduate School of Business and a Soviet Government institute. Both Mr. Lorber and I went back to Moscow in July for more discussions. And now a committee of seven Russian officials, Mr. Lorber and other M.A.L. executives are visiting American shoe-import facilities, retail stores and manufacturing plants to get an idea of what they might need for this project.''
Russia may also make arrangements to import shoes from other countries later, Mr. Cunningham said. But the raw materials for the Russian-made shoes, particularly leather, will not be imported, for Russian supplies are said to be ample.

HEADLINE: Talking Business with Lipsky of Salomon Brothers;
Help for Dollar Called Unlikely

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
The dollar has reached a new low against the German mark and it is close to touching its record low against the Swiss franc.
John Lipsky, the director of international research for Salomon Brothers in London, says he expects the dollar will continue to fall, but he does not foresee a dramatic decline. Mr. Lipsky says, however, that the Federal Reserve Board has little policy leeway on the dollar because help for the currency, through higher interest rates, is unlikely with the economy so near a recession.
 
Q. Will the dollar continue to fall?
 
A. We expect to see the dollar continue to weaken somewhat further in the coming weeks. It's likely that monetary policy shifts will continue to drain support from the U.S. currency. Specifically, we think that additional modest easing of U.S. short-term interest rates is likely while, in contrast, higher interest rates are expected in both Japan and Germany. 
 
Q. Do you expect the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates when the Federal Open Market Committee meets today?
 
A. No, we wouldn't expect to see an immediate move because of the uncertainty surrounding the Middle East situation. But once that is clarified, we would expect to see the Federal Reserve move cautiously.
 
Q. Why will the Fed wait?
 
A. There is the possibility that some more serious disruption of oil supplies could result in much more significant rises in prices. Significantly higher oil prices would have inflationary consequences and in those circumstances one would think the Federal Reserve would want to proceed cautiously.
 
Q. Do you mean that if oil prices rise much further, the Federal Reserve might not ease interest rates even if the economy is near a recession?
 
A. Certainly that could temper monetary policy. During the previous oil shocks, monetary policy was tightened considerably. However, we don't consider that the current situation is directly comparable and we don't expect to see price rises of the magnitude that we saw then.
One of the factors that has weakened the dollar is the perception that the Fed is caught in a dilemma that significantly limits its room for maneuver.
The threat of higher prices and the weakening dollar points to caution or even a tightening of monetary policy. But the significant weakness of the economy and the increasing likelihood of a recession points in the other direction.
 
Q. How much further will the dollar fall?
 
A. We don't think that we're going to see dramatic additional declines. We think it's likely that the dollar will eventually test the Deutsche mark's 1.5 level. And we think that eventually we'll move to the low 140's against the yen. [The dollar closed yesterday in New York at 1.5641 marks, just above its new record low of 1.5495. Against the yen, the dollar closed at 146.51.] If a deterioration in the Middle Eastern situation does lead to much more serious problems on oil, the dollar could well benefit. The United States is still significantly more self-sufficient in energy than Japan and most Continental European countries. And, further, we think the recent weakness of the dollar certainly already reflects much of the anticipated shifts in interest rate differentials.
 
Q. Why hasn't the dollar weakened as much against the yen as it has against European currencies?
 
A. The yen has lagged for two principal reasons. First, with the risk of a more serious disruption of energy supplies, Japan is by far the most exposed of the major industrial economies because Japan relies by far most heavily on imported energy sources.
Second, with the renewed weakness of the Japanese equity markets, there is some concern on the part of investors that the Bank of Japan may not follow through in tightening policy despite the bank's own justification for doing so. In the German case, there seems to be much less doubt that the Bundesbank will act, if and when it sees fit, to tighten policy.
Now, eventually we think that it is very likely that the Bank of Japan will move to tighten rates. And that will ultimately lead to a strengthening of the yen.

HEADLINE: Bush's Warning to Iraq Spurs Gain by Dow

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
President Bush's warning yesterday that he would hold the Iraqi Government responsible for the safety of American hostages being held in Kuwait and Iraq helped give the stock market its first lift since Wednesday.
But in a sign that investors remained cautious, trading volume continued sluggish and buying turned selective.
The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue-chip issues climbed by 11.64 points, to 2,656.44.
But Peter G. Grennan, senior vice president of Lehman Brothers Inc., pointed out that only four stocks -I.B.M., Exxon, Texaco and Chevron -accounted for about 75 percent of the gain, with the three oil issues accounting for most of that. 
Stocks opened higher in Tokyo today, but drifted down in slow trading, and the initial gain was wiped out by late afternoon. The Nikkei average of 225 stocks closed at 26,297.84, down 192.63 points, or 0.73 percent.
 
Volume Declines by 39%
In the United States, trading activity sank to 129.6 million shares, down sharply from the abnormally high 212.6 million shares in Friday's ''double witching hour,'' when stock options, index options and index futures all expired. Declining issues outran advancing ones yesterday, 920 to 629, with 203 stocks falling to new lows.
''Three hundred more stocks were down than up,'' Mr. Grennan remarked. ''It was a selective, blue-chip energy rally.''
Commenting on the President's strong remarks, Mr. Grennan said, ''The firmer he is, the better the market will like it.''
Asked why the market was up, Michael Metz, chief market analyst for Oppenheimer & Company, said: ''Is it up? Far more stocks are down than up.''
With many issues selling at depressed levels because of strong declines on Thursday and Friday, yesterday brought ''selective bargain hunting,'' Mr. Metz said, but ''an obvious low level of conviction.''
He pointed to the low trading volume and that ''few stocks participated in the advance - oils and a few leaders, like Wal-Mart, Bristol-Myers Squibb and I.B.M.
''Investors and traders didn't have the courage to go for the secondary names,'' Mr. Metz continued. ''They chose to stick with the high-visibility brand-name companies.''
I.B.M., benefiting from a favorable mention in Barron's, rose by 7/8 in heavy trading, to 102 1/4, representing at least 10 percent of yesterday's rise in the Dow.
Chevron surged by 1 3/8, to 80, its high point for the day. Texaco climbed by 1 3/4, to 65 5/8, its high point yesterday. And Exxon gained 5/8, to 52 3/4, only slightly off its high for the day. Together, the three accounted for about 65 percent of the Dow's rise.
The rest of the Dow industrial stocks changed only slightly. USX, which has a large oil component, rose by 5/8, to 33 1/8, while Du Pont, which also owns a huge oil company, increased 1/4, to 37 5/8.
Oil stocks may be rising, but prices in general may not follow. H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company, said, ''Some institutional investors are beginning to speculate that the impact of the 1990 oil shock on the general price level may be a lot smaller than many people originally assumed.''
The Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, meets today amid speculation that the Federal Reserve will take little action to pump more money into the steadily weakening economy.
''I think very little will happen,'' Mr. Heinemann said. ''The Fed will continue to hold short-term interest rates at approximately the present level. The result of this will be a further tightening of money supply.''
On a more positive note, he argued that ''you have the potential for a very large reduction in interest rates once the Middle East crisis is settled - assuming it's settled.''
 
Wal-Mart Rises to $28.25
Bristol-Myers Squibb, a market favorite that fell by 1 5/8 last week, gained 3/8, to 60. Wal-Mart, another market stalwart, which dropped by 1 7/8 last week, rose by 1/4, to 28 1/4.
Fannie Mae, a quasi-Government agency that buys mortgages and then resells them and the only one among the 10 most active stocks to change as much as a point, fell by 1 1/8 yesterday, to 29 3/4, after sliding by 3 points last week. Freddie Mac, a Fannie Mae competitor, fell 3 1/8, to 59 1/4, after falling by 5 5/8 last week. Their weakness was thought to be related partly to Congressional sentiment to reduce their Government ties.
Gitano, the apparel manufacturer, plunged by 4 7/8, to 19 3/8, also hitting a new low of 19 after Goldman, Sachs & Company downgraded the stock.
In a broad decline among the high-technology issues, Compaq Computer fell by 2 3/8, to 47 3/4; Hewlett-Packard by 1/4, to 34 3/8; Digital Equipment by 5/8, to 66 3/8, and on the Nasdaq, Microsoft, the software producer, by 4 3/4, to 55 1/2.
Despite the oil crisis, the Dow transportation index rose by 6.38, to 930.29, with most transportation stocks showing strength. UAL rose by 3, to 104 1/2, after The American Banker reported that Gerald Greenwald, head of a union effort to buy the airline company, would meet in Tokyo this week with several Japanese bankers. Union Pacific, which has important oil interests, also rose, by 2 7/8, to 73 3/8.
Among other market averages, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose by 0.68 point, to 328.51. The Nasdaq composite index fell 4.90, to 388.59 after hitting a new low for the year of 388.31. The American Stock Exchange's market-value index fell by 2.32, to 331.29, after also reaching a new low for the year of 330.82.

HEADLINE: Eli Lilly's Spending Plans

 BODY:
Eli Lilly & Company said yesterday that it would spend $540 million over the next five years to build drug laboratories and plants near the company headquarters in Indianapolis.
Lilly, which has said that its earnings will grow 22 percent this year from $939.5 million in 1989, expects to add 500 employees at the new site in the first phase and 500 more by the end of the 1990's. It currently has 3,000 employees in Indianapolis.
The pharmaceutical company said the expansion, which will eventually cost $1 billion, will include $120 million for a new biotechnology laboratory, $145 million in other projects to be completed by 1994, and $90 million in site improvements and utilities.
The technology center will also house Lilly's previously announced $150 million synthetic human insulin plant and a $35 million administration building already under construction.
Analysts said Lilly's plans reflected the relative strength in the pharmaceutical industry at a time of weakening in the overall economy. ''Lilly's products are not sensitive to economic downturns; they are not discretionary spending for consumers,'' said Robert H. Uhl at Salomon Brothers. Ronald Nordmann at Paine Webber Securities said other large pharmaceutical companies like Merck & Company and the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company had also made significant investments in biotechnology.
Eli Lilly's shares fell 37.5 cents yesterday, to $72.625, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Fall in Quiet Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities dipped in very light trading yesterday, as dealers awaited further developments in the Middle East.
''There is a lot of talk about what might happen in the Middle East, but people are too tired of getting whipped around to trade on talk,'' one Government bond trader said.
Worries about the Persian Gulf crisis were especially evident during overnight trading in Tokyo, where traders pushed yields on the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent benchmark bonds of 2020 up close to 9 percent.
 
Mark Helps U.S. Rates
But as activity shifted to Europe and then to the United States, prices stabilized and then turned up slightly, aided by a rise in the value of the dollar against the West German mark. Comments from President Bush indicating that he was remaining firm on the need to curb the Federal budget deficit and a very small drop in oil prices also helped. 
''Everybody is pleased that the market more or less held its own,'' said William V. Sullivan, Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
''But let's not blow what happened out of proportion,'' Mr. Sullivan cautioned. ''Activity was very light, and the Fed is likely to leave monetary policy on hold for the next few weeks. As a consequence, we don't expect any major breakout now.''
Members of the Federal Reserve Board's policy-making Open Market Committee will meet in Washington today to discuss monetary policy.
Despite widespread economic weakness, most analysts expect the Fed will delay any reduction in short-term interest rates until conditions in the Middle East stabilize or improve.
 
'Overwhelmed' Traders
While the central bank might like to ease policy, the threats of war and an oil-related jump in inflation have effectively tied the Fed's hands for now, the analysts said.
In addition, the traders said, the continuing huge supply of Treasury issues is weighing on market participants.
''We are just overwhelmed with paper,'' another trader said. ''And until the Street gets some of this supply off its books and we get a clear sign what the Fed will do next, the market is going to stay under pressure, even though it held up pretty well today.''
The Treasury sold $18.4 billion worth of three-month and six-month bills at its weekly auction yesterday.
Three-month bills were auctioned at an average discount rate of 7.55 percent, up from an average rate of 7.41 percent at last week's sale.
Meanwhile, bids on the six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 7.45 percent, compared with a rate of 7.31 percent a week ago. 30-Year Bonds Down In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds were offered at a price of 98 3/32 late yesterday, down by 1/32, to yield 8.93 percent, unchanged from late Friday.
Among note issues, the 8 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 19/32 in late trading, down by 5/32, to yield 8.81 percent. The 8 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 3/4, down by 3/ 32, to yield 8.13 percent.
Activity in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate bonds and for tax-exempt securities was also very light, the participants said, with little price movement.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Both these issues are dated August 23, 1990. The three-month bills mature Nov. 23, 1990 and the six-month bills, Feb. 21, 1991.

Dollar Ends Mostly Higher After Many Days of Decline

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed mostly higher against the world's major currencies in moderate trading yesterday, recovering ground after many days of decline.
Gold prices also rose. On the New York Commodity Exchange, an ounce of gold closed at $410.10, up 50 cents from Friday. Later, the Republic National Bank quoted an after-hours bid of $409.25, up 75 cents, as of 4 P.M. 
Traders said much of the dollar's advance was attributed to investors who were selling positions in other currencies in exchange for the United States currency to take profits.
''The market was stretched to the point of a need for a correction,'' said Lorenzo Troni, vice president of foreign exchange at Paine Webber International in New York. ''There is always a point of profit taking.''
The dollar was also helped by President Bush's strong statements to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq about the fate of foreigners held in Iraq and Kuwait.
''People are a little bit concerned we could be approaching a flash point in this issue,'' said John McCarthy, chief dealer at Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank in New York. The dollar is traditionally viewed as a haven in times of international turmoil, but that has not been the case so far in the Middle East crisis.
Another factor helping the dollar was a slight weakness in the German mark because of trouble in the Social Democratic coalition Government in East Germany, Mr. McCarthy said.
But Mr. McCarthy did not expect the dollar's rebound to last. He said the currency remained weak against other major currencies because of rising interest rates abroad, which tend to support those foreign currencies, and sluggishness in the United States economy.
The dollar closed at 1.5641 marks in New York, up from Friday's close of 1.5500 marks. Friday's close was an all-time low for the dollar against the Germany currency. Earlier, in Europe, the dollar closed at 1.5625 marks, up from 1.5485 Friday.
The dollar also strengthened against the British pound. One pound cost $1.9135 in New York, cheaper than $1.9230 late Friday. In London, the pound fell to $1.9185, from $1.9195 late Friday.
But the dollar lost ground against the Japanese yen. Mr. Troni said the yen had been lifted by weekend reports that Iran would supply oil to Japan, whose economy is almost entirely dependent on imported oil.
In New York, the dollar bought 146.51 yen, down from 147.60 yen late Friday. Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar had risen to a closing 147.47 yen, from 147.35 yen Friday. But in London, it fell to 146.90 yen.
Other dollar rates as of 4 P.M. in New York, compared with late rates Friday, included: 1.2955 Swiss francs, up from 1.2820; 5.2565 French francs, up from 5.1975; 1,157.25 Italian lire, up from 1,142.25, and 1.1427 Canadian dollars, down from 1.14365.
Gold rose in London to $409.75 an ounce, from $409.25 on late Friday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $409.75 an ounce, up from $408.25 on late Friday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell 11 cents an ounce, to $409.77.
Silver bullion in New York cost $5.129 an ounce on the Comex, down from $5.179 on late Friday. In London, silver fell to $5.14 an ounce, from $5.20 on late Friday.

HEADLINE: Careers;
Better Times Expected for Southwest

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
ARE Southwestern states like Texas, Arizona and New Mexico, long in the economic doldrums, about to come alive again?
James Challenger, head of Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., a Chicago outplacement firm, has a theory that change for the better is on the way, and with it more job opportunities.
He points out that some economists have said that the savings and loan crisis will bring money into the Southwest. Many of the nation's failed institutions are in this region and their depositors can receive up to $100,000 in Government insurance on their accounts. At the same time new groups are buying up the assets of these institutions at fire sale prices. 
All of this activity, Mr. Challenger said, can create jobs in the area.
The Southwest is receiving a boost from another direction. There is a growing trend at many large companies to move their headquarters or parts of their businesses to the Southwest, where labor and energy costs as well as the cost of living tend to be much lower than in the Northeast and Midwest. State taxes also tend to be lower in this region than in states like New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts.
Mr. Challenger noted that the Exxon Corporation and J. C. Penney both recently moved out of Manhattan skyscrapers to relocate in the Dallas region. A subsidiary of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, AT&T Microelectronics, has moved to the area from New Jersey.
The GTE Corporation, a major electronics company, has moved its market services operation from Florida to the Dallas area, and the Mobil Corporation moved its training operations from Chicago to Dallas. NEC America, a large Japanese-owned concern, has moved staff members to Dallas from both New York and California.
In Houston, the Compaq Computer Corporation expects to expand its operations and create 4,000 jobs, and McDonnell Douglas Aerospace plans to relocate from California to the Houston area, he said.
In addition, the crisis over Iraq's invasion of Kuwait could help the oil industry in Texas. Some analysts say that if oil prices are sustained at around $25 a barrel for a year, the state should realize a marked benefit to its economy.
Outplacement firms like Mr. Challenger's help dismissed employees, mainly middle managers, to deal with job loss trauma. Their fees are usually paid by the employee's former company.
Sometimes an unemployed person has to relocate to get a job he or she wants, which can be painful financially because working spouses often have difficulty finding new jobs.
In fact, the effect on spouses of relocations shows little change for the better, according to Atlas Van Lines, one of the major household movers of families. It found in a recent survey that 84 percent of corporate relocation administrators with whom the company deals provide virtually no help for spouses who want to find jobs after their husbands or wives relocate.
''It is surprising that these percentages have not changed one iota when compared to five years ago,'' J. Stephen Mumma, senior vice president of marketing for the moving company, said recently.
Yet, when employees refuse to relocate, their careers can be hurt. Atlas found that 40 percent of the respondents in its survey said that rejecting a move probably hurt their careers. When they do refuse, these employees cite their spouses' employment, family ties, cost of living considerations, and mortgage and housing worries.
Runzheimer International, a management consulting firm in Rochester, Wis., keeps an eye on the reasons for relocation and the statistics of such moves.
Recently Nancy Brinkerhoff, a consultant who specializes in group moving and employee relocation for Runzheimer, said: ''The No. 1 reason companies move is cost. When salaries are high, rents are moving up and transportation costs going up, top management often says, 'Why do I need to be here?' ''
Often it is hard to recruit some employees for work in a high-cost area like New York.
Ms. Brinkerhoff added: ''A skilled productive work force is the first consideration when choosing a new work site. Increasingly the work ethic is a big concern because companies want a work force that is not only educated but also motivated.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Export Rise Forecast

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 20

 BODY:
Regardless of the impact of events in the Middle East on the cost of oil, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher believes United States exports will continue to grow and keep the nation's economy out of recession this year.
But he acknowledged in an interview that rising oil costs could ruin his prediction that the nation's merchandise trade deficit will come in under $100 billion this year for the first time since 1983. 
Mr. Mosbacher commented following his department's announcement Friday that exports in June reached a record $34.3 billion and helped drive the trade deficit that month to just $5.07 billion.
So far this year, Mr. Mosbacher said, the deficit has tumbled to $45.8 billion, the lowest six-month imbalance since the second half of 1983.
But he acknowleged that continued high oil prices could add to the cost of imports, which dropped to $39.37 billion in June and helped narrow the deficit. The price of oil on Friday was nearly twice the $14.64 a barrel that it averaged during June.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Envoys at U.N. Say Soviets Block Endorsement of Force Against Iraq

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 21

 BODY:
Soviet objections have so far been the main cause of the United States' inability to win Security Council backing for the use of force to uphold the embargo of Iraq, diplomats here say.
Representatives of the Security Council's five permanent members held another inconclusive meeting today on a United States draft of a proposed resolution allowing military action to enforce the mandatory economic boycott of Iraq adopted by the Security Council on Aug. 6.
For more than a week, diplomats from Security Council members have been discussing the resolution without being able to achieve a consensus of the five permament members. Without such a consensus, any of the five - in this case, the Russians - could veto the resolution, and this would embarrass the United States, diplomats said. 
Although there is said to be more than one reason for the difficulty found in getting approval of a use-of-force resolution, the major cause has been the difference in United States and Soviet views. As one diplomat from a Western country put it today, ''What we're looking at is bridging the differences between the United States and the Soviet Union.''
The differences are largely about the timing of such a resolution but also about the role of the United Nations in military force.
These differences have surfaced, diplomats say, despite the vast thaw in Soviet-American relations in recent years. But they say that as far as they know, the United States Government has not tried to use diplomatic channels other than the United Nations to try to do the bridging.
That is, as one put it, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d has not picked up the phone to discuss the subject with his Soviet counterpart, Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
Monday night and today, the United States presented to other Security Council members a succession of proposals of wording for such a resolution, in a continuing effort to generate broader acceptance within the Council. These proposals were said to include at least one change of wording to meet a Soviet objection.
 
Hope Goes Unfulfilled
After the heads of the permanent members' missions conferred for about two hours today, the British chief delegate, Sir Crispin Tickell, said cheerfully to reporters: ''Everyone reaffirmed the importance of the five and the Council as the mechanism to see that sanctions are enforced.''
But as the afternoon wore on, the only further contacts to be reported about the resolution were bilateral talks between the United States and other Security Council nations.
As the hours passed, earlier suggestions that the Security Council might go so far as to hold a formal meeting, beginning this evening, to vote on such a resolution, went unfulfilled.
One Western diplomat said his understanding was that the Soviets' chief objection was ''a question of timing: the Soviet Union wants a clear instance of sanction-busting'' - that is, a clear violation of the embargo to take place - before the resolution is adopted.
The United States and other members of the Council would like the ''U.N. blessing,'' that is, the resolution, in advance of such a violation.
Widespread doubt was expressed here today about a news report from Yemen that an embargo violation had taken place: the reported unloading of an Iraqi tanker at a coastal oil installation. The United States has taken the position that it can neither confirm nor deny the report.
In pressing for such a resolution, the United States believes that it would be good to have a United Nations endorsement for military action.
This has been referred to here by one American diplomat as ''a U.N. umbrella.'' It has also been described as ''a wink and a nod'' of approval.
But what the United States envisages is that these countries' military action remain ''unilateral'' - that is, not subject to command by a United Nations group.
Some days ago, the Soviet Foreign Ministry stated that Soviet forces would be engaged in the Persian Gulf area only in the context of an authorization from the United Nations. And the Soviet Union has been emphasizing in the recent discussions here that it wants a role to be played by a little-known United Nations panel, the Military Staff Committee of the Security Council, in overseeing military action.
 
Officers From Five Nations
The committee, which has been in existence for decades, consists of high military officers from the five permanent member nations of the Security Council - Britain, China, France, the Soviet Union and the United States. The officers customarily meet briefly here every two months.
It is widely said that the United States felt a sense of urgency Monday - and called for informal consultations among all Council members that went on late in the night - because Washington thought that it might have to order military action against another Iraqi tanker that was approaching Yemen.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF: BEHIND BUSH'S HARD LINE;
Washington Considers a Clear Iraqi Defeat To Be Necessary to Bolster Its Arab Allies

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 21

 BODY:
Iraq called today for negotiations on ending the Persian Gulf crisis, but did not offer to pull its troops out of Kuwait. The White House quickly responded that no talks were possible until Iraq unconditionally carried out the United Nations demand that it withdraw its forces from Kuwait.
The Administration's rapid rejection of the Iraqi proposal for opening a diplomatic track grows out of Washington's concern that should it become involved in negotiations about the terms of an Iraqi withdrawal, America's Arab allies might feel under pressure to give the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, a few token gains in Kuwait to roll back his invasion and defuse the crisis.
Also underlying the Administration's tough stance is a growing feeling that Washington and its allies have the advantage over the Iraqi leader, that their international quarantine and military buildup are just beginning to pinch Baghdad and that there is no reason to settle for anything less than an unconditional Iraqi pullout. 
True, officials say, the United States faces the theoretical problem of holding its international boycott of Iraq together over the long run. But the Iraqi leader faces a real and immediate problem - he is almost totally isolated and his economy is being strangled.
 
Withdrawal and Its Perception
Bush Administration officials insist that for the United States and its allies to achieve their objectives in the Persian Gulf, President Hussein must not only retreat from Kuwait, but he must do so in a manner that leaves no suggestion that Iraq gained from its invasion. Officials say he must not only be defeated, he must also be seen as defeated by everyone in the Arab world and beyond.
If Mr. Hussein walks away from his Kuwaiti invasion with even a scintilla of profit - a Kuwaiti island or minor border adjustments - American officials fear the Arab world will regard his crime as having paid dividends, and he will remain a threat. This would have profoundly negative implications in the Arab world for years to come.
For now, American officials say their closest Arab allies, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, are no more interested in negotiations with Mr. Hussein than Washington is. Administration officials contend that the Iraqi leader has lied to his Arab neighbors so many times that they simply do not believe any of his assurances and they want him deflated, if not militarily defeated, once and for all.
Nevertheless, Bush Administration officials say they are keenly aware that just beneath the surface of Arab support for the isolation of Iraq, there is anxiety about the mood on the Arab street. The Egyptians, Saudis and other gulf Arabs have to be concerned that pro-Iraqi elements will try to punish them for siding with the United States against an Arab power.
 
Pressure for a Compromise
These governments are already being pressed by King Hussein of Jordan and Yasir Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization to allow them to mediate between Baghdad and the other Arabs. For King Hussein and Mr. Arafat, being able to play the role of mediators is the only way to justify their support for President Hussein's invasion. Because that support has put them in politically difficult positions, they will do everything possible to escape from their predicament by trying to play this role and then telling the world that the only reason they kept ties with Baghdad open was to be peacemakers.
Between these pressures and those from the Arab street, Administration officials fear that in the context of a negotiation, the Arab world might be inclined to grant President Hussein some minor face-saving concessions to get him out of Kuwait and remove the threat of a full-scale war in the oilfields of the Persian Gulf.
''If Saddam Hussein is left looking like a winner he will be treated like a hero, and if he is left looking like a loser he will be treated like a zero,'' said Martin Indyk, director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy Studies. ''Even if the United States succeeds in getting Saddam to withdraw from Kuwait, he will still have a formidable force at his disposal. The only way that we can hope that he won't use it again is if he pays a significant, clear price for his aggression.''
 
Concern for Hostages
But the reason Washington rebuffed the Iraqi overtures today in a low-key, muted manner was concern for American and other Western hostages. American officials were worried that if they had simply told the Iraqi leader to ''go jump in the lake,'' he might have done something irrational with his hostages and might have closed off all discussions with American diplomats in Baghdad about their fate.
From the start of this crisis, one fear of the Bush Administration has been that Saddam Hussein's Arab nationalist appeal would resonate throughout the Arab world and undermine the resolve of America's Arab allies to resist Iraq. Officials are of two minds about this danger.
One school argues that the threat of the Arab street and the real support for Saddam Hussein in the Arab world have been vastly exaggerated. This is in part because so many American television and newspaper reporters have congregated in Amman, Jordan, where they have been widely exposed to a Palestinian interpretation of events, which is very sympathetic to the Iraqi leader. Elsewhere, in Cairo, the gulf and Syria, there is much less sympathy for the Iraqi leader.
It would also be dangerous to underestimate the resources of the Arab gulf states to manipulate public opinion in their favor. Last week the Muslim Brotherhood, a Muslim fundamentalist organization in Egypt, issued a statement supporting President Hussein. But the Muslim Brotherhood receives its main income from Saudi Arabia.
''The Saudis pulled their purse strings,'' said one American official, ''and suddenly they were singing a different tune.''
 
Funding for Palestinians
In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Palestinian hospitals and relief organizations are beginning to complain that their funding from the gulf is disappearing.
''There is a saying in Arabic that 'after the bout of drink comes the moment of awareness,' '' said Fouad Ajami, a Middle East expert at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. ''After they let off all their steam, even the Palestinians will understand what a great economic catastrophe has befallen them as a result of events in Kuwait. People will still have to work, and the gulf states provided more work for Palestinians and other Arabs than anyone else.''
In addition, Mr. Ajami said: ''The Arab street is much smarter than it is often given credit for. It knows a thief. It knows plunderer when it sees one. It knows that there is enormous blood on the hands of Saddam Hussein.''
But there are some equally strong arguments for reading the Arab street as more dangerous. Not only is the pro-Iraqi sentiment clearly in evidence in Jordan, the West Bank and North Africa, but more important, what matters in the crunch is not what the Arab silent majority feels, but what the activist minority does. The Administration may be right that millions of Arabs stand with Washington, but through terrorism they could easily be intimidated by the few who do not.

HEADLINE: Hartford, Its Boom Over, Sees Downtown Decaying

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Aug. 21

 BODY:
The hundreds of millions of dollars that poured into Hartford in the 1980's changed the skyline and tripled the amount of office space downtown, but the makeover appears now to have only masked a continuing decline in the heart of Connecticut's capital.
As the commercial real-estate boom abruptly ended across the Northeast, all the problems of an aging urban core have reemerged intact, shattering the idea that Hartford's glittering new facades and office towers enabled it to transcend the isolation, poverty and downtown blight that afflict so many old industrial cities.
To many people here, this city of 137,000 remains divided into a small island of safety crowned by the gold dome of the Capitol and the towers of insurance companies, surrounded by poor, devastated neighborhoods untouched and unreclaimed by the prosperity of the 80's.
 
Empty Swaths Downtown
In the last nine months, Hartford has lost more than 40 percent of its downtown hotel rooms, including the 410-room Hilton and a 36-year-old landmark, the Summit, which closed this month with only three days' notice. This week, one of the city's two downtown department stores, Sage-Allen & Company, which has done business on Main Street for 101 years, is expected to close as well. 
Some restaurants have closed and others are limping badly. Business bankruptcy filings are running double what they were a year ago, according to Federal bankruptcy court officials.
 
'Turned Off the Lights'
Worse still, large swaths of this compact city, including a whole block of stores on Main Street opposite Sage-Allen, lie empty, having been intentionally vacated by developers over the last few years in preparation for office towers that are now stalled on the drawing board. A nonprofit group has volunteered to put decorations in the windows of Sage-Allen and the other stores this Christmas to provide at least the illusion of life.
''It's like someone turned off the lights for some of these companies,'' said John A. Green, vice president of Lux Bond & Green, a downtown jewelry store.
Business people and economists - some of whom expressed relative optimism in for-the-record interviews but deep gloom in com-ments that they insisted not be attributed to them - said that Hartford's claim as a center of insurance and banking had been bolstered by the commercial real-estate boom of the 1980's.
But in many of the things that make a city more than an office park, Hartford's downtown lost ground as people found fewer and fewer reasons to come here except to work. For downtown businesses, the shock came when the number of 9-to-5'ers declined as banks and insurance companies reduced employment and construction came to a sharp halt last year.
Retailers estimate that the number of people working or visiting downtown on any given weekday is two-thirds to one-half what it was three years ago.
''It started before the current economic downturn, but the economic downturn can only make it worse,'' said James O. Rogers, president of the Connecticut Retail Merchants Association, referring to Hartford's long-term problems. Mr. Rogers said he believed things would get worse for downtown and that the city would face at least another 18 months of stress before there would a letup.
''And that's just the economy,'' Mr. Rogers added. ''The bigger question is how long can people hold on until we revitalize the urban areas?''
In Hartford's poorest sections, especially the largely black North End, unemployment is already running well above 30 percent, according to city officials.
Among Hartford's hidden losses during an otherwise booming decade of growth, one of the most bitterly missed has been the business-convention trade.
Convention agents said that while the city continued to draw smaller groups, the large lucrative conventions that can fill a city with shoppers and people on expense accounts increasingly went to competitors like Springfield, Mass., and Mystic, Conn., both of which built new hotel-convention complexes.
Hartford, with its aging hotels, traffic congestion, expensive parking and higher crime rate, could not compete.
In 1986, for example, the city was host to 139 convention meetings with 87,000 guests. By 1989, the number had fallen to 114 meetings and 46,000 guests. In Springfield, just 45 minutes north, the number of conventions rose from 4 to 48 in the same period, while convention visitors increased sevenfold, according to figures from the Greater Hartford Convention and Visitors Bureau.
 
Missing the Rolling Stones
''A year ago, I said things couldn't get much worse, and they did,'' said Claire Hue, co-owner of Monsieur Hue, an upscale men's clothing store that she said would either close or move next month. Mrs. Hue opened the store in 1987 in a downtown mini-mall called the Pavillion, which was built for 20 stores and now has less than half that number. Her store's sales this summer are 40 percent below those in the summer of 1989, which was in turn down from 1988, Mrs. Hue said.
Even for one-night events, like concerts, newer concert halls elsewhere attracted shows that only a few years ago would very likely have gone to the Civic Center Coliseum, which has been empty through most of this summer.
''In 1981 we had the Rolling Stones at the Civic Center because it was the largest arena in New England,'' said Jim Koplik, a concert promoter based in New York. ''But 16,000 seats is not as big as it used to be.''
Hartford's allure as a summer concert setting has further declined in the last two years, Mr. Koplik said, since the owners of Lake Compounce, an amusement park in nearby Bristol, began an ambitious program of outdoor shows.
 
Darker and Emptier Streets
A decline in visitors, especially at night, has in turn made Hartford's streets seem darker and emptier and more frightening, many restaurant owners say, especially to suburban residents on whom the delicate economy of the city depends. And Hartford's businesses can clearly not survive on the resources of city residents alone: In the 1980 census, Hartford was ranked one of the poorest cities in the United States in per capita income.
''It's a very fragile balance,'' said Warren L. Trafton, president of the Convention and Visitors Bureau. ''A whole series of things have conspired against us.''
Many of Hartford's hopes are pinned once again on the traditional savior, office construction, which is expected to rebound faster here than in some other cities where buildings went up faster than the demand.
According to the Farley Company, a leading commercial real-estate firm here, the amount of vacant office space peaked in January at 15 percent and has since fallen to 12.7 percent. The firm expects the rate - a key measure of economic health - to continue to decline to between 7 and 8 percent by 1993, when large-scale office projects could again become economically viable.
By contrast, Stamford, Connecticut's other major corporate office market, has 26.9 percent of its office space vacant, down from 29.6 percent in January, when it had the highest vacancy rate in the United States. In both New York City and Boston, the vacancy rate has hovered near 15 percent.
The United Technologies Corporation, based in Hartford, is also expected to provide at least something of a boost to the local economy this fall when it announces which of 10 empty sites it is selecting for a new corporate headquarters. The project, intended to consolidate the company's Hartford offices, is expected to be the only active construction job downtown through at least the early part of the decade.

Green, vice president of Lux Bond & Green, a jewelry store. In the last nine months, Hartford has lost more than 40 percent of its downtown hotel rooms, and business bankruptcies have doubled.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
With Embargo, Cheaper Tea

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 21

 BODY:
The price of tea has been hit by the Persian Gulf crisis. The United Nations trade embargo against tea-drinking Iraq has helped push it down to two-year lows. 
Other factors behind the fall include rising world output, reduced purchases by the Soviet Union and hot weather in Britain, where people have forsaken tea for cold drinks. Iced tea, while popular in America, has never taken hold in Britain.
The average price at last week's London auction fell to 77.7 cents a pound from $1.38 at the beginning of the year.
The figures make bad reading for India, Sri Lanka and Kenya, the world's major sources of tea.
International Tea Committee figures show that Iraq imported around 80.5 million pounds of tea in 1989. World production for all of 1989 was 11.64 billion pounds, and world tea output in the first six months of this year is believed to be 187 million pounds ahead of the same period in 1989.

HEADLINE: MORE EUROPEANS TO JOIN GULF FORCE

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 21

 BODY:
Anxious to demonstrate full support for American moves to isolate Iraq, Western European governments decided today to increase and coordinate their naval activities in the Persian Gulf and to reject Baghdad's demands that they close their embassies in Kuwait.
At a meeting of the nine-nation Western European Union, a regional organization, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain said their warships would soon join naval vessels from Britain, France and the United States that are already enforcing the trade embargo against Iraq in the gulf.
West Germany said its Constitution prohibited it from sending five minehunters and minesweepers beyond the Eastern Mediterranean, but it announced plans to propose a constitutional amendment allowing it to participate in any military operation backed by the United Nations. The other two members of the organization, Portugal and Luxembourg, have not offered naval support so far. 
 
Coordinating Effort
Both foreign and defense ministers attended the meeting, which included an agreement to set up an ad hoc group to coordinate members' naval activities in the gulf in areas like logistical support, zones of operation, task-sharing and exchange of intelligence.
The ministers said that, while naval forces would for the moment remain under national commands, the chiefs of defense staff of the participating countries would meet here on Friday to harmonize strategies. They added that this European initiative should enormously ease cooperation with the United States.
''It's very important that this should not just be a United States operation,'' Britain's Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, said, referring to enforcement of United Nations sanctions against Iraq. ''It is very important that it should be seen that the European allies are vigorously helping.''
The Secretary-General of the Western European Union, Willem van Eekelen, said, ''It seems essential that we do not leave this as an American affair, because Europe is even more interested than the United States in the supply of oil.''
Later, at a meeting of foreign ministers of the 12-nation European Community, there was also agreement that Western European embassies in Kuwait should remain open ''as long as practically and physically possible'' despite Iraq's order that they be shut down by Friday.
 
Paring Staff in Kuwait
The foreign ministers reiterated demands for the release of all hostages and further warned individual Iraqis that they would be held personally responsible under international law for any illegal acts committed against foreign nationals. Some 7,700 Community citizens are not being allowed to leave Kuwait and Iraq.
Mr. Hurd said that while diplomats from Community governments would remain in Kuwait, families and nonessential staff would be withdrawn in the coming days. In Britain's case, he added, ''three or four'' diplomats would stay in Kuwait to assist British citizens trapped there.
The actions today in both the Western European Union and the European Community seemed intended not only to dispel doubts about Europe's willingness to take part fully in the United States-led response to the Iraqi aggression, but also to demonstrate that Western Europe can work together both politically and militarily.
The Western European Union, which has been overshadowed by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization since it was created in 1955, was last used by its members in 1987 to coordinate the activities of five countries that sent warships to the gulf to protect oil tankers threatened during the Iran-Iraq war.
On this occasion, however, the Union has also provided a multilateral framework for several European governments that were reluctant to be seen either acting unilaterally or simply following the United States. Spain, for example, waited until today to announce it was sending one frigate, two corvettes and an auxiliary ship to the gulf.
France, which over the past two weeks has sought to emphasize its independent posture in the Iraqi crisis, also stressed today that it now shared the position of its Western allies. French officials said President Francois Mitterrand held a long telephone conversation with President Bush on Monday evening.
 
Action From Paris
Today, Mr. Mitterrand said at a news conference that France had responded positively to a request for personnel and materiel from ''different countries of the region'' and would be sending ''reconnaissance squadrons from the ground forces'' to the United Arab Emirates. He did not disclose how many troops would be involved.
Barely one week after France criticized American and British threats to stop ships suspected of trading with Iraq, Mr. Mitterrand also noted that ''an embargo without sanctions would be a sham.'' He added that only he could order French warships to fire on foreign vessels, although he acknowledged that the crisis had now entered ''a logic of war.''
With 8 French and 3 British warships, a total of 32 naval vessels have now been mobilized by European countries as a result of the Iraqi crisis. Among Community countries, excluding Ireland, which is neutral, only Portugal, Denmark and Luxembourg have not offered naval support.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF: REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK;
A Base With No Name: U.S. Puts It on the Map

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
The following report was filed under the ground rules that govern American correspondents accredited to the Pentagon who are working in Saudi Arabia. The ground rules prohibit the reporting of exact numbers of troops or weapons, their exact locations or the names of enlisted personnel.
The most famous spot in Saudi Arabia these days has become a base without a name.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, wearing blue jeans, a work shirt and dark-red Western boots, came here the other day to meet the troops under the glare of the television cameras. And nearby hotels are jammed with reporters and television technicians discussing satellite hookups and the troops that they are trying to ''book'' for the next day's broadcast. 
Taxicabs are doing so much business that a hotel guest here was advised to make a reservation for a cab.
But the official ''Ground Rules for Coverage of U.S. Military Activities'' distributed to correspondents here prohibits naming even the most obvious military installation, even though they are no secret to the Iraqis.
The rule appears to reflect the American military's zealousness about operational security, as well as Saudi Arabia's continued unease about its decision to open the kingdom's borders to large numbers of foreign correspondents. [Reports from correspondents not accredited to the United States military in Saudi Arabia have said that the air base is in Dhahran in eastern Saudi Arabia.] The base without a name is hardly the only paradox that reporters traveling with Mr. Cheney encountered this week during his hurried swing through the Persian Gulf.
In Bahrain, American reporters were urged by an American Embassy official to attend a news conference where, it was said, Bahrain would issue its first public statement explicitly endorsing the large deployment of American forces in the region.
But once the news conference began, a senior Bahrain official insisted that his endorsement be reported on a ''not for attribution'' basis and forbade the correspondents to tape-record his remarks.
Even with 200,000 Iraqi troops deployed in Kuwait and southern Iraq, the open embrace of the American military does not come easily for many gulf officials.
 
The Skeptical and Edgy
Despite the increased tensions near the base with no name, some here do not appear to believe that war will break out - at least in the short run.
A foreign mining consultant with long experience in the Middle East said he had been warned by his colleagues against coming here a week ago, but was told that it was safe to return now. His business: building underground command posts for the Saudi military.
But many American servicemen in the region are edgy.
A 28-year-old electronics technician on the La Salle, the command ship for the American fleet in the Persian Gulf, which is docked in Bahrain, said the vessel keeps its generators running and its crew on alert so that it can sail on two hours' notice.
The La Salle's crew held several emergency drills recently, including one called Circle William, where the sailors practice defending against a poison-gas attack by closing all outside and inside air vents. The spare parts that used to take months to reach the La Salle have all of a sudden started being delivered over the course of a week or two.
For some service personnel, the crisis in the gulf appears to present a dilemma. They don't want war, and yet find it difficult to imagine staying on a war footing in the region for months, or even years, as Mr. Cheney has suggested is possible. ''Hopefully we can take care of Saddam Hussein without force,'' said a sailor from Louisiana on the La Salle. ''But I'd rather see us do something now than drag it out for a long period of time.''
 
A Longer Stay, and Why
On the Eisenhower, the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier in the Red Sea that Mr. Cheney visited on Saturday, the sailors waited on Mr. Cheney's every word when he suggested that they would have to extend their time at sea.
The Eisenhower has been deployed since March, and under a normal operating procedure is due to be relieved. Many sailors in the Eisenhower battle group said they wished they could return home soon. But the prevailing feeling appeared to be that the sailors were prepared to stay on station in the Red Sea if needed.
The last few weeks have been an intense period of activity for the battle group, and sailors loaded fuel and transferred missiles at sea in the Mediterranean before sailing through the Suez Canal.
Mr. Cheney told the crew on the Eisenhower that their contribution was essential over the next couple of weeks and that they would be relieved as soon as possible. As he did with other American forces in the gulf, the Secretary spent much of the time telling the servicemen why they were here.
Mr. Cheney warned that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq could gain control of half of the world's oil if he conquered Saudi Arabia, giving Baghdad a hold on the economies of the West.
''When the President makes a decision to send folks halfway around the world to engage in what may be a dangerous enterprise, it is important that they hear from the President and his representative why that decision was made,'' Mr. Cheney told reporters after meeting with Air Force personnel in the United Arab Emirates.
By and large, the message appeared to go over well with the troops.
''At least he is not trying to run the war from behind a desk at the Pentagon,'' said a soldier at the air base here.
Another soldier, who was sitting under a camouflage net at the air base, indicated that he was persuaded by Mr. Cheney's explanation. The soldier's unit was an army battalion armed with Patriot antiaircraft missiles from Fort Bliss, Tex.
''We had kind of been in the dark,'' about why American forces were being sent to Saudi Arabia, a soldier said.
For all of the fanfare that surrounded Mr. Cheney's visit here, which ended with his return to Washington today, not everyone greeted the Secretary's visit with great expectation.
Mr. Cheney approached several soldiers here who were sleeping under a hastily-constructed shelter, a piece of wood bridging two light Sheridan tanks, a thin barrier against the sun and 104-degree heat.
''I did not mean to get you guys out of bed,'' Mr. Cheney said.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Yemen Agrees to Block Iraqi Oil; Missile Flow to Kuwait Reported

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 21

 BODY:
The mounting confrontation between American warships and two loaded Iraqi oil tankers in waters near the Persian Gulf was at least temporarily defused today when Yemen said it would not allow the tankers to unload their cargo in its port of Aden.
As Yemen acted, Pentagon officials said they had information on ''the likelihood'' that Iraq had moved long-range ballistic missiles into occupied Kuwait that could strike the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh.
 
Missiles 'Not Surprising'
A Pentagon official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that intelligence reports showing that Soviet-made Scud B missiles had been moved into Kuwait were of concern but ''not surprising,'' given the buildup on both sides of the Saudi border.
The missiles typically carry conventional high-explosive warheads, but Western military experts say they believe Iraq is trying to develop chemical warheads containing mustard or nerve gas. The Scuds, with a range of more than 350 miles, have dubious accuracy but could still inflict heavy casualties if launched at cities. 
Iraq has also deployed shore-to-ship missiles in occupied Kuwait, where they could be aimed at Western naval forces in the Persian Gulf, said an article in Britain's Financial Times newspaper quoted by Reuters.
The two Iraqi tankers that sought to unload in Aden had ignored warning shots across their bows from the American ships on Saturday, in the first challenge to the United States use of military power to enforce the international trade sanctions against Iraq.
But early today, in a session of the United Nations Security Council at which the United States sought approval for use of military power to enforce the sanctions, the Yemeni delegate said his Government would not unload the tankers headed for Aden.
 
Abstained in U.N. Vote
Reuters reported, however, that a third Iraqi tanker might have slipped through the naval blockade and unloaded its cargo before the Yemeni promise took effect. Yemen had abstained in an earlier Security Council vote to impose an international embargo on all commerce with Iraq.
Yemen's representative at the United Nations denied reports the tanker had unloaded at the oil refinery in Aden.
The Bush Administration had said it would order the Navy to disable the two tankers still at sea whether or not the United States won the United Nations blessing, but Administration officials were clearly seeking the added degree of international consent. The Pentagon said the two tankers were sailing slowly off the coast of Yemen today, shadowed by American warships.
The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said one of the tankers might be allowed to dock in Aden, but that the Yemenis had given assurances that the oil would not be unloaded or used. ''We intend to follow up and make sure that they comply with the sanctions as they said they would,'' Mr. Fitzwater said.
Defense Department officials were uncertain where the second loaded tanker would go.
 
A Selective 'Interception'
The two Iraqi vessels apparently loaded several days ago at Mina al-Bakr, an Iraqi off-shore oil platform in the northern part of the Persian Gulf. The American warships intercepted one tanker in the Persian Gulf and the other in the Gulf of Oman. A Pentagon official who spoke on the condition of anonymity sought to explain in the gaps in the economic net around Iraq, saying ''the operative term here isn't 'blockade,' it's 'interception.' ''
The official said that United States' intention was not to stop every single vessel, but to selectively intercept the ships most important to Baghdad's economy: oil tankers.
In Washington, the Pentagon's chief transportation commander, Gen. Hansford T. Johnson, said that more than 1 billion pounds of equipment was being sent by ship and by plane to Saudi Arabia in the ''largest sustained airlift ever'' over a short time period.
Virtually all American troops now in Saudi Arabia got there on civilian planes, General Johnson said. At first the troops were moved on chartered commercial jets and, more lately, they have been flying on planes commandeered by the military. More than 35,000 troops are now in Saudi Arabia.
Eight fast sealift cargo ships and 38 slower transport vessels have been activated and are carrying the bulk of the equipment to the Middle East, including tanks, helicopters, armored personnel carriers and ammunition.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Bush Regains Record Rating in Crisis

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES

 BODY:
The Persian Gulf crisis has propelled public approval of President Bush back to its highest level, with support for his stand against Iraq's invasion of Kuwait overwhelming misgivings about his handling of domestic problems, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll has found.
Seventy-six percent of the respondents said they approved of the job Mr. Bush was doing as President, the same figure he reached after the invasion of Panama last December. Only 15 percent of the 1,422 Americans reached by telephone Thursday through Sunday disapproved of Mr. Bush's job performance. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus three percentage points.
While Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Jimmy Carter had similar levels of support soon after taking office, the last President to attain this level of popularity so far into his term was John F. Kennedy, who won approval from 76 percent of the public in a Gallup Poll after the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. 
 
Sharp Climb in Rating
This upsurge in support for Mr. Bush, with its beginnings visible in a New York Times Poll on Aug. 9 and 10, came just in time, from the perspective of Republican Party officials, to reverse a precipitous decline in the President's standing since Panama, just as Kennedy's showdown with the Soviets pulled Kennedy and the Democrats out of a tailspin as the midterm election approached in 1962.
In less than three weeks, Mr. Bush's public approval has climbed nearly 20 percentage points. In a poll completed almost entirely before Iraq seized Kuwait, 58 percent of the public approved of Mr. Bush's handling of his job and 33 percent expressed disapproval.
That poll, conducted by Market Opinion Research, a firm with many Republican clients, said Mr. Bush was being dragged down by doubts about his handling of the economy and the savings and loan scandal. These doubts made Republicans increasingly nervous, and Democrats increasingly hopeful about the fall campaign, when Iraqi forces suddenly crashed across the Kuwaiti border.
 
Misgivings Persist
Those doubts persist, acccording to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll. The public is evenly divided over Mr. Bush's handling of the economy. and majorities give him poor marks on the savings and loan scandal and taxes.
But after another week of images of American troops crossing the desert sands, attention has shifted from domestic problems and the public, as it usually does at the outset of a foriegn crisis, has thrown its support to the President.
Misgivings and reservations about the American commitment in Saudi Arabia, apparent in the New York Times Poll 10 days ago, persisted at significant levels even as Americans learned more about the reasons for the United States deployment and the extent of it.
Three-quarters of the public expressed overall approval for Mr. Bush's handling of the Persian Gulf situation, equal to the level he reached in the earlier New York Times Poll immediately after he addressed the nation to announce the deployment of forces to Saudia Arabia.
Yet 4 out of 10 also said he was too quick to involve the military. That is the same number who felt that way when the troops were first sent 10 days ago, and none of the events since seems to have shaken their view.
This seeming contradiction illustrates a phenomenon so well documented by students of public opinion that it has a name: ''the rally round the flag effect.''
This is the tendency of the public to set aside doubts in a foreign crisis, particularly the early stages of one, and support the nation and its leader, the President.
 
Support for Deployment
Now that American troops, planes and ships have been deployed in Saudi Arabia and the gulf, 77 percent of the public says they support the decision to send them, a level of support far higher than was ever given to military deployments during the fighting in Vietnam.
Of those who support troop deployment in the gulf, half do so with the expectation that the conflict will be resolved peacefully. That is one example of how the public is divided in its readiness, or willingness, to shoulder the sacrifices that President Bush said on Monday would be required.
In another example, 43 percent of the respondents said they would be willing to pay higher taxes to protect Saudia Arabia, while 53 percent said they would not.
That division could be seen as evidence of resolve only when compared with the willingness to pay taxes to reduce the deficit. Only 31 percent of the public said in the same poll that they approved of tax increases to reduce the deficit, while 65 percent said they disapproved.
Richard Sobel, a Princeton University expert on public opinion about foreign policy, said that based on the history of the conflicts in Vietnam and Korea, support for American military action in the gulf would weaken in direct relation to expense and casualties.
In the early months of American involvement in Korea, 75 to 80 percent of the public in various polls said they supported President Harry S. Truman's decision to send troops. But as casualties mounted and Chinese forces overwhelmed American positions, support weakened. A year after the United States intervened in Korea, several national polls showed declines of 20 percentage points in the view that it had been the right thing to do.
The latest New York Times/CBS News survey was conducted just as President Saddam Hussein of Iraq was announcing that Americans and other Westerners would be held and moved to potential military targets as a shield against attack.
Most foreign policy experts have painted America's intervention in the Persian Gulf as a 20th-century spice war, motivated by the need to protect access to vital resources, in this case oil. But the more familiar justification for use of American power - deterring aggression and protecting friends -has greater political potency and is the one President Bush stressed in his speech to the Veterans of Foriegn Wars on Monday.
Just short of half the public, 46 percent, says American troops have been sent mainly because the price of oil will increase too much if Iraqis control the oil fields, while some 30 percent say the United States is there mainly to protect our friends. Both explanations were offered by 16 percent.
All three groups overwhelmingly support the decision to deploy American military forces, but among those who say the forces are there primarily to protect oilfields, 24 percent oppose the use of military forces. Among those who say they are there primarily to protect America's friends, only 11 percent are opposed.
In Washington, critics say Mr. Bush has not given an adequate explanation of the American purpose in the gulf. But 6 out of 10 Americans in the latest survey, completed before his speech on Monday, said they thought he had clearly explained why the United States sent troops. One in three said he had not.
Mr. Bush's decision to go ahead with a vacation despite the gulf conflict split the public, as it has divided his staff. Half the public thinks the President should have stayed in Washington, but 44 percent approve of his decision to go. Higher-income and better-educated people, who most strongly support American intervention in the gulf, are also most supportive of Mr. Bush's taking his vacation.
 
How the Survey Was Conducted
The New York Times/CBS News Poll was based on telephone interviews conducted Aug. 16 to 19 with 1,422 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. The numbers were then screened to limit calls to residences.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of residential telephone lines and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
The percentages reported are the particular results most likely to match what would be obtained by seeking out all adult Americans. Other possible percentages are progressively less likely the more they differ from the reported results.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for either Republicans or Democrats or independents it is plus or minus five percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: Pakistanis Race to Save Indus Valley Ruins

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KARACHI, Pakistan

 BODY:
The Pakistani Government, racing against time to save the Indus Valley ruins of Mohenjo-Daro, the site of one of the world's oldest but most mysterious civilizations, is planning an international appeal for help.
Scholars and tourists alike are being invited to tour the site. A small airstrip near the ruins, which rise above a barren plain, has been designated an international airport. A international symposium on Mohenjo-Daro and its unsolved mysteries is being planned for early in 1991, and an application has been made to the United Nations Development Program for a loan to set up an international fund-raising campaign. 
Mohenjo-Daro, about 240 miles north of Karachi, was the center of one or more ancient civilizations, the earliest possibly 5,000 years ago, with an extraordinary level of human development. Wells and private bathrooms, drainage systems and a variety of children's toys were found at the site, which was not discovered until 1922.
Why Mohenjo-Daro died or was destroyed - there is some evidence that a sudden human or natural calamity occurred - is still a matter of debate. Although pictographs have been found, no one has been able to decipher them. There is no known equivalent of Egypt's Rosetta Stone to provide a key, and the language is sufficiently unrelated to others of its age to make decoding difficult.
While the puzzles await solutions, the partly uncovered ruins are suffering from exposure and need restoration and preservation, said Abdul Kadir Shaikh, a justice of the Pakistan Supreme Court, who has been chairman since 1978 of a national commission named by President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq to look after the site.
Justice Shaikh is also head of an international consultative committee on the site, supported by Unesco. The seven-member panel has two American experts: Paul Perrot, director of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, and Frank Preusser of the Getty Conservation Institute in Marina del Rey, Calif.
Shahid Hosain, head of Pakistan's Department of Culture and Tourism in Islamabad, said that about $15 million would be needed found for work at the site. ''We have learned that all cultural projects have to be marketed like soap,'' he said.
Prince Mikasa, an art scholar and brother of the late Japanese Emperor Hirohito, has been active in bringing international attention to Mohenjo-Daro.
Alexander the Great fought battles in this country, and early Buddhist learning centers flourished long before the advent of Mogul armies.
The most serious threat to Mohenjo-Daro, Justice Shaikh said, has been the Indus, whose changing course and seeping irrigation canals raised water levels sharply, soaking part of the unexplored ruins.
Justice Shaikh said drainage spurs and the installation of 26 pumps to remove ground water had eliminated immediate catastrophe.
Justice Shaikh, hopes to lure Prince Charles of Britain and the Aga Khan -two leading patrons of architecture -to the site to lend support for restoration efforts.
''These sun-baked bricks of Mohenjo-Daro are part of the oldest civilization in the world,'' he said. ''If you are talking of the first known civilized way of life and society, then it has to be Mohenjo-Daro.''

HEADLINE: Philadelphia Mayor Seeks Taxes to Avoid Deficit

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 21

 BODY:
Mayor W. Wilson Goode says Philadelphia is not bankrupt and can avoid a $206.4 million deficit if the state and City Council work with him to raise taxes and cut spending.
''These actions may be painful,'' he said Monday. ''But had they been taken in the past, as I recommended, they would not be necessary now. To avoid tough times ahead, we cannot avoid tough choices today.'' 
Mr. Goode urged the Legislature to give the city power to raise taxes by $150 million, to be spread among consumers, homeowners and businesses. He also called for a freeze on hiring and a cut in all nonessential services. He did not specify the services. Under its charter, the city cannot raise taxes after the start of the fiscal year, which began July 1, without the Legislature's approval. The Legislature will reconvene Sept. 24.
Mr. Goode also proposed the lease or sale of Veterans Stadium, home of Philadelphia's professional baseball and football teams, and other city assets, including the Water Department.
Mr. Goode's call for action came as his administration announced plans to borrow $400 million in temporary loan notes within the next two weeks.
Without the notes, the city would be out of cash by late September, according to a report by the City Finance Director, Betsy Reveal.
Even with the notes, the city will be out of cash by May unless measures are taken to cut spending or raise taxes in the short term and over a longer period, the report said.
Mayor Goode accused previous administrations of taking stopgap measures to avoid financial crises. But he reserved the largest share of blame for the state.
''The root of our dilemma is that Philadelphia's fiscal problems are primarily structural,'' he said. ''They are built into the state system.''
Gov. Robert P. Casey defended his administration, saying he has ''substantially increased the state's financial contribution to the city.'' Both the Governor and the Mayor are Democrats.
Mr. Goode also assailed the City Council, which he said had repeatedly thwarted his attempts to raise taxes.

HEADLINE: Incumbent Senator And Governor Win In Wyoming Voting

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CHEYENNE, Wyo. Aug. 21

 BODY:
Senator Alan K. Simpson, an incumbent Republican, and Gov. Mike Sullivan, an incumbent Democrat, handily won their primary races today.
In the Republican primary to face Mr. Sullivan in November, Mary Mead, a ranch owner, defeated State Representative Nyla Murphy. With about 60 percent of the vote counted, Mrs. Mead's margin was 68 percent to 32 percent. 
Mr. Simpson, the Senate minority whip, won nomination to a third term, with about 85 percent of the vote.
Six little-known Democrats were contending for the right to challenge Mr, Simpson. Kathy Helling, a 32-year-old college student, and Al Hamburg, who was convicted last year of forging names on a campaign petition, were ahead in early returns.
As he did four years ago, Mr. Sullivan walked away with the nomination today. He received 88 percent of the early vote in his primary contest with a motorcycle mechanic, Ron Clingman.
The Governor said he would have preferred to face stiffer competition.
''I have to say that when you watch people debating the issues on the other side, you wish you had some primary opposition so you could talk about the issues,'' Mr. Sullivan said.
In the campaign for the Republican nomination to face Mr. Sullivan in November, Mrs. Mead faced Mrs. Murphy, a 59-year-old Casper woman who has served for 12 years in the state House of Representatives.
Mrs. Mead, 55 years old, is the daughter of former United States Senator Cliff Hansen. Mrs. Mead's campaign stressed her skills as a rancher and businesswoman and attacked Mr. Sullivan's economic development efforts.
Mrs. Murphy accused Mrs. Mead of having a negative attitude toward Wyoming and of failing to propose solutions to the shortcomings she perceived.
The state's only member of the House of Representatives, Craig Thomas, had no opponent in the primary. Elected last year to fill Dick Cheney's unexpired term in office, Mr. Thomas is seeking his first full term this fall. Also unopposed was the Democratic challenger, Pete Maxfield, a law professor at the University of Wyoming.

HEADLINE: The President and the Hasty Hawks

 BODY:
A cynical theory making the rounds in Washington holds that Americans will soon tire of President Bush's intervention in the Persian Gulf. Therefore, the theory goes, Mr. Bush should quickly exploit his high standing at home and abroad by undertaking, in Henry Kissinger's words, the ''surgical and progressive destruction of Iraq's military assets.'' Yet there's no evidence that Americans are as fickle as the Hasty Hawks contend. 
That could change, if casualties occur or Saddam Hussein seeks to ransom the hostages. But so far, in growing numbers, Americans support a strategy based on strength, patience and a carefully woven international consensus.
A New York Times/CBS News Poll shows that support for Mr. Bush is high, and climbing. His popularity has now reached 76 percent, equaling his previous high, after the Panama invasion. Fully 75 percent approve his handling of the crisis, a jump from 64 percent in early August.
Those findings reflect patriotism; Americans always rally around the Commander in Chief early in a crisis. But there's no reason to presume that this resolve is as fragile as the hawks seem to believe. Mr. Bush has explained the stakes, and most people appear to understand them.
Mr. Bush also profits handsomely from a resurgence of American pride. Having been told repeatedly that their country is in decline, many Americans are probably pleased to find that the U.S. alone possesses the global reach and the political mechanisms to offer prompt leadership.
Mr. Bush has made one big misstep - moving unilaterally to block shipping to Iraq without waiting for U.N. consent. And his oratory has been anything but Churchillian. Otherwise he has faultlessly positioned his pieces, orchestrating almost overnight two formidable policies - a military force to protect Saudi Arabia, and economic sanctions to force Iraq from Kuwait. Indeed, so smoothly has his strategy fallen into place that it's easy to underestimate how much he's accomplished.
Immediately after Iraq's invasion, for example, it could not be taken for granted that the cautious Saudis would risk inviting American protection. Or that Turkey would close Iraq's pipeline. Or that the U.N. Security Council would unanimously approve sanctions. Adroit diplomacy has since enlisted allies, neutrals and the moderate Arabs in a common cause.
Support for President Bush sends an important signal to Saddam Hussein. So, too, does Mr. Bush's willingness to spend his popularity by mobilizing reservists - the first such call-up since the Tet offensive in 1968 - and, on a less dramatic level, by commandeering 38 jets from 16 domestic airlines. His almost comical insistence on finishing out his vacation in Maine bothers many people; half the poll's respondents think he should have stayed in Washington. But even that stubbornness sends a calculated message to Baghdad: He will not allow foreign tyranny to imprison him in the White House.
The crisis is still in its early stages; much could happen to test and even weaken public resolve. But for now, Americans in great numbers accept Mr. Bush's definition of the stakes and his goals. Having worked so hard to build a global consensus against Iraq, one that includes even Arab states, the President would be foolish to risk its destruction by heeding the Hasty Hawks.

HEADLINE: OBSERVER;
Slaves to Oil

BYLINE: By Russell Baker

 BODY:
We are all hostages now, and by our own consent. It is our addiction to imported oil that has undone us. ''Just say no,'' Nancy Reagan used to advise the young tempted by drugs. Neither her husband nor anyone else of public consequence dared issue the same good advice to a vast public of all ages that was hopelessly hooked on oil.
Jimmy Carter had tried something like it during his own Presidency and Reagan had flattened him for it in the election of 1980. The Reagan people had recognized that Americans had a bad, bad oil habit, so bad that they were ready to kill for it, and certainly ready to shuck off any President who tried to ease them toward a cure. The Reagan people chose to get ahead by going along. 
To be sure, even Carter's medicine had been feeble stuff. He asked everybody to set the thermostat lower, leaned on Detroit to make the cars a little more efficient, persuaded Congress to put up a little money for research on solar energy. He appeared on television sitting in the White House wearing a heavy wool sweater.
A lot of us joked or winced at that. Next thing you knew he'd be urging us to put on long johns for the winter, as though we were farmers or, worse, Britishers.
Americans were delighted by the chance to put him away in 1980. When they did, the one feeble attempt to stop the big oil binge ended. After the Reagan landslide, research on solar energy was closed down. The ancient American lust for big cars was permitted to rage again.
The Japanese had successfully invaded America by offering low-cost, low-weight, fuel-efficient cars Detroit couldn't match. But as the oil spree got bigger in the 80's, so did Japanese cars. Bigger, heavier, more expensive, more like the old Detroit guzzlers and more profitable to both dealers and Japan.
By the late 1980's, Cadillac and Lincoln were running television commercials in which uptown swells engaged in boasting competitions about whose car was bigger, longer, heavier, more mastodonic and, therefore, more appropriate for the very finest Americans to drive to the country club.
The policy was: It's morning in America; live it up.
Thus we made the entire country available to hostage-takers like Saddam Hussein whose threat to our oil supply now enables him to force us to choose among options in matters of war, diplomacy and economic stability, all of them decidedly nasty.
If Saddam had not taken advantage of us, sooner or later someone else surely would have, and may yet, if the Saddam business ends happily. When you are as vulnerable as we have made ourselves because of our oil habit, it is only a matter of time before dangerous or foolish adventurers will dare have a go at you.
The big men say, of course, that oil is not the only explanation for our war footing. Saddam is said to be another Adolf Hitler (sure, and John Dillinger was another Attila the Hun), and his theft of Kuwait is said to be the sort of brutal aggression against which we must be prepared to use all our might if necessary to avert bloody chaos.
This call to serve principle and international morality is ennobling, but if no oil were at risk would we really be putting armies and navies into Arabia?
Drop the oil from the equation and the thuggish Saddam's seizure of Kuwait would be, to the United States, just another uninteresting incident in the tiresome tribal quarrels that divided the Arabs of the old Ottoman Empire before the British made such a mess of it in the First World War.
Of course, without the oil - all that money! - Kuwait might not have attracted Saddam. Certainly nothing in the Middle East attracted the United States until there was oil. It is hard to believe that before the Middle East and oil became synonymous, the United States would have wasted even a note of reprimand on a small-bore chieftain like Saddam for brutalizing one of the weaker tribes.
President Bush says the American way of life is threatened. He apparently means our ability to pick up the carry-out fried chicken in the drive-by lane at the fast-food shop, as well as our power to sit one-commuter-per-car for 45 minutes every day on the way home from work.
Hooked as we are on such joys, we may end by finding ourselves at war to preserve them. If not this time, then maybe next time. When you've got to have oil or die, you put your destiny in the hands of the oil dealers, just as surely as the drug addicts make themselves hostages to the people Nancy Reagan wants you to just say no to.

HEADLINE: Rinfret, Stalking Governor, Gets Lecture but No Debate

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUFFALO, Aug. 21

 BODY:
For the second time in five days, Pierre A. Rinfret, the Republican gubernatorial candidate, ambushed Gov. Mario M. Cuomo today by making a surprise appearance at one of the Governor's public events.
Mr. Rinfret beat Mr. Cuomo to a General Mills factory here and, when Mr. Cuomo arrived for a plant tour, confronted the Governor on the subject of debates. Mr. Rinfret, a New York City economist running his first political race, staged a similar ambush on Thursday at a Manhattan park where Mr. Cuomo was scheduled to speak.
Mr. Cuomo approached Mr. Rinfret today after being told his opponent was outside the factory gate. He spoke to him in calm, if stern, tones, but he later mocked Mr. Rinfret's tactics. 
''Politics is a little bit silly here,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''It's obvious that if he were the major candidate he says he is, he wouldn't be popping up from the bushes to get his face on television, right?
 
'He Could Buy Television'
''He'd go to the people of the state and talk to them. Or, he has $15 million. He could buy television. He says he's very wealthy. He said the President's with him. Why he has to sneak around and jump up in your face I don't know.''
Just as in last week's encounter, Mr. Rinfret devoted his entire confrontation with Mr. Cuomo to challenging the Governor to a one-on-one debate that would not include the nominees of the Conservative Party and the Right to Life Party.
''Hello Mario, how are you,'' Mr. Rinfret began, as a ring of reporters and photographers tightened around the candidates.
''You're good at getting cameras,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''How can I help you?''
''Well, I want to debate you one-on-one, as you know, as we've talked about,'' Mr. Rinfret said.
 
'Mario, Will You Debate Me?'
''Let me make it as clear as I can,'' said Mr. Cuomo. ''We agreed four ways. I've said over and over and I've said to you personally, as you know, I'd be delighted to debate you. They want to be part of the debate and they're entitled to be part of the debate and that's it.''
That was not quite it, but the discussion did not get much more substantive. Mr. Cuomo eventually broke it off as Mr. Rinfret yelled after him: ''Will you debate me one-on-one? Mario, will you debate me one-on-one?''
Despite Mr. Rinfret's challenge, the Republican candidate's true position on debates seemed unclear.
Mr. Rinfret said today he would debate only Mr. Cuomo. That stance contradicted Mr. Rinfret's position last week, in a news release, that Mr. Rinfret preferred a two-way debate but would participate in a four-way affair.
 
Rinfret Demands One-on-One
''Changed my mind,'' said Mr. Rinfret, who has also changed his mind on releasing his income-tax returns. ''I'm entitled to that.''
Mr. Cuomo has maintained that Herbert London, the Conservative Party candidate, and Louis P. Wein, the Right to Life Party candidate, have a legal right to participate in any debates.
Mr. Rinfret has said that those candidates are ''peripheral'' and that they will join Mr. Cuomo in attacking him during a debate.
While the Republican candidate was taking out his lonely position, representatives of the three other candidates agreed today to hold two debates this fall. Mr. Rinfret's aides were invited to the meeting but did not attend.
One debate would be held in upstate New York in mid-October and the other would be held in New York City in late October or early November. Election Day is Nov. 6.

HEADLINE: For Gay Travelers, More Places to Go

BYLINE: By Trish Hall

DATELINE: EAST STROUDSBURG, Pa.

 BODY:
ON a blistering August day the lounge chairs around the swimming pool at the Rainbow Mountain Resort here are overflowing with bare arms and legs. The smell of coconut oil and the sounds of ''I Got You Babe'' fill the air. Everything about this middle-class enclave seems typical of life in a Pocono Mountain resort except for one thing: nearly all the guests are gay.
John R., who lives and works in New York City, has been spending every weekend here because it is the only place where he and his companion feel they can relax, holding hands when the mood strikes without looking around nervously. ''It's like paradise,'' he said. ''Nobody bothers you.'' Like others, he spoke only on condition that his full name not be used.
Resorts, guest houses, tour operators and travel agents are increasingly finding that it pays to cater to gay customers by providing environments where they will feel comfortable and able to relax without engaging in the pretenses that are so often required in their day-to-day lives, where they often feel obliged to hide their sexual orientation. 
There have always been some resort areas, like Provincetown on Cape Cod and Key West in Florida, that attracted gay people, but the range and quality of services has vastly increased in the last few years. Seedy guest houses, once the norm, have been supplanted by elegant Victorian inns. Travelers can join gay-only tours through Machu Picchu or cruises of the Caribbean.
The International Gay Travel Association, a trade group that started with 20 members five years ago, now has 450 members. Member agencies seek gay business, either because they are gay-owned or see the market as appealing. Most travel companies, however, do not seek gay business as a special niche. ''We provide travel services for everyone,'' said Henry Blinder, a spokesman for Thomas Cook Travel in New York.
Specialists in gay travel say several factors account for the surging business, which is occurring even as the travel business in general is in a slump. The market for gay travel seems less affected by economic uncertainty because so many gay travelers live in households with two incomes and no children.
Although there are no figures showing the size of the gay market, a survey answered by 4,100 readers of eight large gay newspapers found that they took twice as many domestic trips as the national average, were more likely to fly and had incomes three times the national average. The study was done in 1988 by Simmons Market Research Bureau in New York for the Rivendell Marketing Company in New York, an advertising representative for gay newspapers and magazines.
Travel agents who specialize in the gay market say the lure of gay-only trips seems to be growing in part because those who came of age during the gay liberation movement tend to be more open about their sexuality and less afraid to patronize gay establishments. The advent of AIDS has also made travel more alluring to gay men than socializing in bars and bathhouses. ''It's an activity that doesn't involve any danger,'' said Hanns Ebensten, a tour operator with his own company in Key West. ''You don't get AIDS from looking at the Taj Mahal.''
Gay-only tours and cruises also spare gay travelers the need to participate in tiny but wearing compromises. ''On a tour,'' Mr. Ebensten said, ''you have to contribute and socialize and be pleasant and dance with the ladies. When someone says, 'Look at that pretty girl selling oranges,' you have to agree.''
The lure of all-gay trips, he said, is not what some people might think. ''It's not a great sex jaunt,'' Mr. Ebensten said. ''It's just that they're seeing the wonderful places they want to see in congenial company.''
At Rainbow Mountain, begun nine years ago by Laura Irish and Georgeann Moses on 85 acres of land here, all the amenities that typify a mountain vacation are available: tennis court, swimming pool, restaurant, pond, little red cabins with white trim. ''People come here to rest and relax,'' Ms. Irish said. ''It's not a cruisy, pickup atmosphere.''
Most visitors are couples who like to vacation in a place where they do not have to hide their homosexuality. ''I can be how I want without wondering if anyone is talking about me,'' said Jeanne L., who was spending the weekend with her companion and two of their friends. On Monday she would return to work, where she never can talk about her companion or her personal feelings because her friends and co-workers do not know she is gay. ''It's very difficult to go back into the real world,'' she said. ''You have to reprogram your brain.''
For a weekend, though, the women are spared the necessity of pretending. Homosexual couples say that when staying in most hotels, they sometimes mess up the other bed so the maid won't suspect they are gay.
An all-gay resort offers the chance to make friendships based on honesty. Some gay people say that is a rare opportunity for gay people. ''The life style can be a very lonely one,'' Jeanne said. Travel agents say their gay customers want what all travelers want: good accommodations and a felicitous environment. Agents will make sure that travelers don't end up in meccas for families with children or heterosexual honeymooners.
Not all gay travelers want to stay in gay-only hotels, but they tend to prefer adult-oriented places or resorts not biased against gay patrons. Derek G., who is homosexual and lives in Boston, recently stayed at a Holiday Inn in San Antonio and wandered down to the hot tub at 8 one night, thinking it would be frequented by other adults. ''There were 15 children diving head first into the Jacuzzi,'' he said. ''That's not my idea of relaxation.'' Travel agents make sure accommodations are suitable. ''A gay couple would be embarrassed to go to a regular agency and ask for a double bed,'' said George Wilson, president of the gay-oriented Islanders' Club Travel Company in New York.
Agents, too, can warn clients not to behave publicly in ways that might create problems for them in some locations. ''When you land in Madrid, you don't wear four earrings in each ear,'' said Aldis Alexander, an agent whose company, Aldis the Travel Planner in Brookfield, Conn., caters to a gay clientele.
Patronizing gay resorts makes problems less likely. James Fisher, a transportation consultant in New York, said he once checked into a hotel in Key West and received the worst room in the house. ''I think it was because I was with my lover,'' he said. ''I did complain, and they did upgrade my room, but it took a lot of fighting,'' he said. At gay-owned places, he said, he has not encountered such slights.
Information on travel can be found in the growing number of travel books put out by small publishers and sold at gay bookstores, and in gay-oriented newspapers and magazines. Our World, an international gay travel magazine based in Daytona Beach, Fla., started publishing 18 months ago and broke even after five issues. ''We have six filing cabinets full of gay accommodations, and we get new stuff in every day,'' said Wayne Whiston, the editor.
There are more luxurious places to stay than in the past, perhaps because of the recognition that the gay market is relatively affluent.
Kay Tsenin, a lawyer in San Francisco, opened the Langtry, a bed and breakfast in an old Victorian house that offers rooms ranging from $75 to $200 a night. ''I was tired of going to places that were downwardly mobile,'' she said, ''places that had signs in the kitchen like, 'Your mother doesn't live here anymore, so clean up after yourself.' ''
Cruises have also become popular among homosexuals. RSVP in Minneapolis has offered them for men since 1986. And early this year Olivia Records in Oakland, Calif., a producer of women's music, held its first two cruises in the Bahamas for 600 women each time. They sold out so quickly that Olivia is now planning three more cruises in the next year. ''Women are making more money,'' said Judy Dlugacz, the president of Olivia. ''There's such a desire to go away and not be defending yourself the whole time.''
Specialists in gay travel say they rarely encounter resistance to booking their clients, but it does happen. Robin Tyler, a music promoter in Los Angeles, decided earlier this year to organize a cruise for women. ''A lot of the cruise lines wouldn't do it,'' she said. One finally agreed, and the cruise is scheduled for this winter.
Most gay-oriented trips and agents publicize their services only in gay publications, to avoid mix-ups. They do occur, however. Ms. Tsenin, general partner in the Langtry, said a man checked in shortly after it opened about five years ago. She said that when he looked out on the deck and saw it filled with women, ''He said, 'I think I've died and gone to heaven.' '' He caught on, though, and ''ended up being a good friend,'' Ms. Tsenin said.

HEADLINE: Oil and Gas Prices Rise Slightly

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Prices for oil and gasoline rose slightly yesterday after swinging sharply during the day. They surged early in the day but then fell back after a statement by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq that traders said was less aggressive than expected.
Crude oil for October delivery closed up by 12 cents a barrel, at $28.71, having bounced from $28 to $29.45. But that was placid compared with gasoline, which traded over a broad 11-cent-a-gallon range, equivalent to $4.62 a barrel. It closed at $1.0125 a gallon, up 1.01 cents, after reaching $1.065 and dipping to 95.5 cents. 
Heating oil for September delivery closed at 83.71 cents a gallon, up three-quarters of a cent.
 
Bigger Losses in Europe
Stock prices also gyrated, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 52.48 points, or nearly 2 percent, to 2,603.96, after being down more than 77 points early in the day. The selloff continued in Tokyo today, with the Nikkei index at midday off 3.9 percent. Earlier yesterday, in Europe, with tensions heightened by a rumor, quickly denied, of a downed American fighter plane, stocks took even bigger losses. [Pages D8 and D2.] Crude oil moved mostly because the Iraqi statement was ''somewhat conciliatory, comparatively speaking,'' one trader in New York said.
The market's mood is making it more volatile even if price differences from one day's close to the next is not large, some experts said.
 
Move by OPEC Expected
Officials of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries indicated last night that there was a ''strong likelihood'' that by today a majority of 7 of the 13 OPEC members would agree to call a meeting.
A senior official of the group, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said that the last holdout was Ecuador and that it would decide today whether to join in a call for a meeting of all 13 members. Officials said, however, that even if a meeting were called, there was little chance that it would produce a unanimous decision on raising the group's total production but that enough of the members would agree to increase their output to make up for the Iraq and Kuwait shortfall.
The senior OPEC official said that these members would certainly include Saudi Arabia, which will increase its output by 2 million barrels a day; Venezuela, which is expected to raise its production by 500,000 to 600,000, and the United Arab Emirates, which would participate with an increase of about 500,000 barrels.
Peter C. Beutel, a trader at Merrill Lynch Futures, said the market in the United States ''acted like a gorilla on a trampoline.'' He added that in the current atmosphere of uncertainty, speculators were afraid to sell oil short, which means to promise delivery of oil they do not have. As a result, when others who are ''long'' decide to take a profit by selling contracts for oil they do not need, there are no ready buyers. ''So you get these quick whooshes down,'' he said.
After trading ended yesterday, the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's main trade association, released inventory figures that will add to the cues from which the market can choose today. 271,000-Barrel Drop In ordinary times, the new inventory numbers would be bearish. For the week ended Friday, crude oil fell by 271,000 barrels, a barely significant amount, and remained 40.4 million barrels higher than this time last year.
But with all eyes on the Middle East, market analysts said they did not know what effect the institute's numbers would have. ''If you do a supply-demand analysis for the fourth quarter,'' said Philip K. Verleger Jr., a commodity economist, ''even with an increase by Saudi Arabia of two million barrels a day and even if the other OPEC members go to full capacity, there is still a difference between production and consumption of two million barrels a day.''
The gasoline market, meanwhile, seems driven by demons of its own. Specialists suspect that at least part of the price run-up of the last few days is because large purchasers, from fuel distributors to service station chains, were buying supplies earlier than usual, because they thought prices would keep rising. That may have ended, with the inventories of refiners rising last week, by the petroleum institute's count.
But the market for refined products is also driven by the availability of refineries, and specialists are beginning to consider more seriously the fact that nearly half of Kuwait's exports of 1.5 million barrels a day were not crude oil, but refined products, which went to Europe and the Far East.
''Imports of gasoline into Europe must be down significantly,'' said John H. Lichtblau of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York. That cuts European exports to the United States. American refineries meet only 94 or 95 percent of domestic demand, with the balance coming from Europe and South America.
Mr. Lichtblau said that to a small extent, the military deployment in the Persian Gulf was consuming oil from Saudi refineries that would otherwise be available for export.
While the crude market may be calmed by increased production from Saudi Arabia or Venezuela, and crude prices would be lowered if Western governments decide to release reserves from strategic stocks, none of that would make more gasoline available, analysts point out.
Others say there is no justification for the price increases. ''I find it difficult to understand,'' said Nicholas A. Fedoruk, an energy specialist at Citizen Action, a nonprofit group in Washington. ''Clearly the price of oil has leveled out; there just doesn't seem to be a reason for the price of gasoline to be increasing.''
He suggested that the oil companies felt freer to increase the price of gasoline now because Congress was out of session. ''Maybe they think the chance of a 'windfall profits' tax is less now,'' he added.
Whatever the reason for the rising price of gasoline in the futures market, oil experts say that the last 20 to 30 cents of increases have not been reflected in the pump price, but will be in coming weeks unless futures prices turn around sharply.

HEADLINE: A Bank Expert's Plan for Change

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
When Lowell L. Bryan, head of the banking group at McKinsey & Company, the management consulting firm, ponders the future of the banking system, he recalls his father's explanation of how the failure of four banks in Oklahoma during the early 1930's carried away the family fortune.
''It was dust bowl Oklahoma and the fortune was not that big,'' Mr. Bryan said, ''but I remember my father telling me at an early age that bank failures were not good.''
That bit of family lore, plus the evidence from the Great Depression, when a loss of deposits contributed to the downward economic spiral, has made the 44-year-old Mr. Bryan a believer in the Government safety net for depositors. But he has warned of serious problems with the way the safety net is used in the American banking system.
 
An Influential Voice
At a time when Congress and bank regulators are intent on preventing a repeat of the savings and loan debacle among banks, Mr. Bryan has emerged as an influential voice on regulatory issues. He has an insider's knowledge of banking, without the vested interests of a banker. His recommendations - particularly that banks should not be able to use Government-insured deposits for risky loans and that the Government should not pay the costs when those loans go bad and the bank fails - are part of the dialogue whenever regulators and legislators discuss reform of the banking system. 
''Even if you see problems with his proposals, as I do, he is a thinker, and that is something you don't see enough of in banking,'' said H. Rodgin Cohen, a lawyer specializing in banks at the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell..
While Mr. Bryan does not expect a rapid collapse of the banking industry, he warned the Senate Banking Committee recently that the problems of banks ''are distressingly similar'' to those of the savings and loans. The banks' $200 billion capital cushion for absorbing losses may allow the industry ''to muddle through'' for several years, he said. But unless the system is changed, he added, the capital cushion could be eroded, increasing the chances that banks would eventually need the same kind of taxpayer support now being provided to the savings and loans.
Bankers' problems stem from their increasing losses from the kinds of risky loans that were rare a decade ago. As banks tried to replace the profits lost to competitors like money market mutual funds and securities firms, Mr. Bryan said, risky lending by banks for commercial real estate and corporate takeovers grew until, by 1989, it accounted for nearly half of the industry's pretax profits.
With riskier loans has come a rise in loan losses and a fear that if the economy slides into a recession, bank losses would rise sharply on a wider variety of loans. ''We have a greatly weakened banking system,'' Mr. Bryan said, noting that history shows that in a recession most of the loan losses are concentrated at 20 percent of the banks, making those banks more vulnerable to failure, which in turn could drain the Government's bank insurance fund.
The son of a Washington lobbyist for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Mr. Bryan has seen enough of Washington to recognize that taxpayers' outrage at the cost of the savings and loan collapse ''makes this the right time for banking reform.''
His efforts, which include four appearances before Congressional committees, take about a quarter of his working hours. Other partners at the firm are sympathetic, leaving him enough leisure time to coach the basketball and baseball teams of his 12-year- old son, the only one of his three children still young enough to live at home in New Canaan, Conn., with him and his wife, Deborah.
The essence of Mr. Bryan's program is to divide the banking system into two types of firms.
One type, which he calls a core bank, would accept Government-insured deposits, much as banks do today. But its activities would be limited to what he calls low-risk businesses like investments in Government securities, consumer loans and loans to small- and medium-sized businesses. ''These are not the customers that are putting banks out of business,'' he said. ''They don't have access to the securities markets and banks are still the best way of delivering service to them.''
 
Consumer Banking Risks
While some analysts, like Mr. Cohen, warn that even consumer banking can be made risky by poor management, Mr. Bryan notes that regulators would still have a role in making sure that core banks follow sound business procedures.
A second type of firm, called a wholesale or commercial finance bank, would be financed by investors whose funds would not be insured. It could do as much risky trading and lending, like loans for corporate takeovers and commercial real estate, as its financial performance and investors would allow.
''Protect the depositors and let investors take their chances,'' is Mr. Bryan's theme.
But for his system to work, depositors and investors would have to accept changes in the benefits and risks of the current system.
''Depositors in the core bank, in return for eliminating the risk of loss, would have to accept lower interest rates than they now earn,'' he said. And investors in the commercial finance company must accept the risk that ''if the company gets in trouble, the Government will prevent a panic, but will allow the company to go down, just as they did with Drexel Burnham.''
The success of companies like American Express and General Electric Financial Services Inc. is proof, he said, that a deposit guarantee is not needed to operate a financial company. Large financial companies would probably own a core bank and a commercial finance company, he said, adding that there should be strict controls on money transfers between them, but no limits on the sharing of information.
Mr. Bryan is modest enough to acknowledge that many others, including Robert Litan at the Brookings Institution, have proposals similar to his. But he does not shirk from criticism of other proposals that he sees ''as too narrow to solve the problem.''
 
Fed Proposal Criticized
For example, the Federal Reserve's recent suggestion that banks be required to increase the capital they have available to absorb losses might temporarily protect the Government insurance fund from loss but is not a long-term solution to the industry's problems, Mr Bryan said. In his 1988 book, ''Breaking Up the Bank,'' he said that higher capital requirements would encourage banks to make high-risk loans because ''only these will yield spreads high enough to generate a satisfactory return'' on the increased capital required by regulators. The alternative for banks - to cut back lending until their size is reduced to a level considered more appropriate for their capital - would starve many businesses of needed financing and hurt the economy.
Suggestions that the Government limit its risk of loss by sharply reducing the amount of deposit insurance available to bank customers ''are a lot riskier than people realize,'' Mr. Bryan said. ''There could be a real flight of capital'' from banks if large depositors are told they face a loss in the event of failure.
Backers of the ''universal bank'' structure, which is used in Europe and allows a wide range of insurance, securities, lending and deposit taking under the roof of a single banking company, should beware of weaknesses that will be disclosed as European countries drop trade barriers in 1992, Mr. Bryan warned.
''Competitors will emerge who will go after the most profitable parts of the universal banks' business,'' he said. ''If a Swiss company can successfully offer money market funds in Germany, they will take some market share and the German banks will lose some of their ability to cross-subsidize other activities,'' Mr. Bryan said. In the past, he noted, universal banks have used their large share of their home country's retail banking business to subsidize other activities and keep competitors out.
 
Research in Vietnam
Mr. Bryan's interest in the banking system started long before the savings and loan crisis. After graduating in 1970 from the Harvard Business School, ''where I got my Eastern Establishment credentials,'' he went to Vietnam and completed a research report on how banks set prices for different services.
He described the job of training Vietnamese to operate the country's communications system after American forces left as ''one of the safest positions over there, because the North Vietnamese did not want to destroy the system they knew they would be taking over.''
Now, with the once unthinkable collapse of the banking system becoming at least a possibility, Mr. Bryan is again in a position to observe the fray. Whatever measures for change are supported by Government regulators, it seems certain that the services of management consultants will be in strong demand.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Baby Boomers' Free Lunch?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
EVERYONE knows that America's rapidly aging baby boomers are burning the candle at both ends, consuming when they should be saving for retirement. Everyone also knows the boomers are depending on the rapid accumulation of cash in the Social Security trust fund to save their bacon.
But according to some heavyweight economists from Harvard (Louise Sheiner, Lawrence Summers) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (David Cutler, James Poterba) everyone has it wrong. While it may indeed pay Americans to consume less, they argue, the graying of the baby boom generation is not in itself a good reason to save more. 
In ordinary times their paradoxical defense of profligacy, just published in the Brookings Institution's Papers on Economic Activity, might be written off as the sort of game that academics love to play. But with state taxes on the rise and Federal tax increases high on the political agenda, it could - and probably should - increase the intellectual respectability of the crusade by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, to reduce the Social Security payroll tax.
On first glance the case for increasing savings to cover the needs of a rapidly growing non-working population seems airtight. One way or another, those who are productive must pay for those who are not. And if America does not save and invest heavily today, the smaller number of workers laboring in tomorrow's shops and factories will not be productive enough to support the larger number of pensioners in the style to which they have grown accustomed.
But as the four economists point out, demographics can cut both ways. The baby boom of the 1950's and 60's has been mirrored by the baby bust of more recent decades. Between 1960 and 1990 the labor force grew at an average of 1.6 percent annually. Between the years 2010 and 2060, however, it is unlikely to grow at all. And as the growth of the labor force slows, so, too, will the economy's need to run merely to stay in place.
During the 1980's, for example, the labor force increased by one-fifth. And to maintain the same amount of productive capital equipment per worker, the economy had to increase the stock of capital one-fifth - an effort that absorbed hundreds of billions of dollars. By early in the next century, however, the number of workers will have peaked. Any investment, beyond the amount needed to cover depreciation, will increase capital ''intensity.''
The dependency effect and the labor scarcity effect thus work in opposition. The former accentuates the tie between high savings and high growth rates, while the latter diminishes the linkage. And miracle of miracles, say the researchers, mathematical simulations suggest that today's high-living consumers need never pay a price for their profligacy. In spite of rising dependency, America could sustain gradually rising living standards -what economists call an ''optimal growth path'' -without increasing savings.
Were America to adopt pay-as-you-go Social Security, taxes would, of course, have to be raised later on to cover the baby boomers' pension and medical bills. And the spike in taxes, the authors acknowledge, could act as disincentives to work and invest. Indeed, if the economic distortions associated with this future tax increase were large enough, it would sink the whole logic of playing now and paying later.
But once again Pollyanna prevails. The researchers estimate that demographic changes will increase the portion of national income spent by the Government between 2010 and 2060 by a full five percentage points. But the failure to pay the rising bill with an unvarying tax rate would create economic losses of a mere 1 percent of a single year's national income.
Economists are bound to be attracted by the researchers' tight reasoning, as well as by their mathematical razzle-dazzle. But as Lawrence Summers readily acknowledges, it is all too easy to misread the conclusion. The research does not say that Americans would be foolish to save more. What it does say is that the rapid aging of the population does not mean it is necessary to raise the savings rate to maintain stable growth in living standards.
But there is no need to misread the research to see its political significance. Senator Moynihan maintains that it would be fairer to pass on the cost of the baby boomers' retirement to future generations than to take it out of the hides of today's hard-pressed workers, many of whom are baby boomers. Mr. Summers and his colleagues conclude that the looming cost of the boomers' retirement is in itself a poor excuse to save more now. Congress, always on the lookout for ways to please the voters, may need no sturdier rationale.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Stocks Plunge Over Crisis in Mideast

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The Tokyo stock market plummeted today in reaction to the continued tensions in the Middle East and the tumbling prices on Wall Street.
Once again, program trading played a leading role in the decline. The value of stock index futures fell sharply this morning, followed by stock prices, traders said. Volume was very thin, which allowed the selling pressure to have an even larger impact. 
''The futures had an exaggerated effect on the market,'' said Jeffery Guy, an analyst at Yamaichi Securities. ''But the market is very shaky anyway.''
The Nikkei 225-stock average closed down 1,086.93 points, or 4.13 percent, to 25,210.91. At one point in the afternoon, the Nikkei dropped below 25,000, the first time it went below that level since Feb. 24, 1988.
Another factor pushing the market lower, analysts said, was higher interest rates. As short-term rates edged higher in the money market, reports came out saying that Japanese banks were likely to raise their long-term prime rate soon. Banking sources were quoted as saying the prime rate would rise from 7.9 percent to 8.3 percent in the next several weeks.
In Europe yesterday, stock markets also fell sharply as the uncertainty of the Middle East crisis, fears of inflation and higher interest rates continued to undermine confidence.
The West German market dropped 5.2 percent, the French market 4 percent and the British market 2 percent. In Germany and France, the markets closed at their lowest levels of the year.
With the crisis finishing its third week, news or rumors from the Persian Gulf have sent markets up or down quickly. But most of the news has been negative and most quick reactions have been down.
Some selling in Europe was set off by a rumor, quickly denied, that an American fighter plane had been shot down over the Persian Gulf. The rumor caused concern that war could break out. But by the end of trading in New York those fears may have eased a little, with the Dow Jones industrial average coming back from a 77-point decline to close down 52.48.
Stock market analysts have given up trying to guess when the decline will stop. In many markets ''trusty'' support levels in the main indexes have already given way several times.
But Alistair Ross Goobey, the chief international strategist at James Capel Ltd. in London, said, ''At some stage you reach levels where people say, 'Even if I do this and war breaks out I will be happy in six months' time.' ''
He said he thinks that France and Britain are close to these levels. But West Germany and the United States, where the Dow's 1.98 percent fall left it at 2,603.96 yesterday, still have a way to go.
Even with the growth of bargains in many markets people are not ready to take advantage of them. ''We are not recommending buying,'' Mr. Ross Goobey said yesterday, ''because, as we saw today, the threat of war sends the market down.''
Forces outside the Middle East and the economic shock of the oil price increase were also contributing to the declines in some markets.
In France, the end of the monthly accounting period is tomorrow, which is adding to the sales rush, analysts said. If stock is sold in the new account period after tomorrow, the trade is not settled and the money does not change hands until the end of the account period in September.
Yesterday, the Paris bourse's blue-chip index, the CAC-40, fell 65.41 points, to 1,546.51, its lowest level since the beginning of 1989.
Also adding to the market's problems is the fact that some half-year earnings reports that have been released have been disappointing and the others still due soon are not expected to be any better. The weak dollar is hurting French exporters and the rise in oil prices is hurting chemical firms.
Michael Diehl, an analyst for Kleinwort Benson Securities in London, said that the selling in France had been by foreigners who helped drive the market up this spring. He said that most domestic investors had been staying out of the market.
In West Germany, the problems with the unification of the two Germanys is also weighing on the market. In Frankfurt, the blue-chip index, the DAX, dropped 85.73 points, to 1,549.96, its low for the year.
The faster than expected collapse of the East Germany economy means the cost of unification will be higher for West Germany. On Monday, the head of the East German agency in change of selling off state-owned businesses resigned after only a month on the job.
In Britain, The Financial Times stock exchange index was down 48.5 points, or 2 percent, to 2,108.1, its lowest level since April of this year and its sharpest one-day decline since Oct. 16, 1989.

HEADLINE: 'Junk Bonds' Post Sharp Price Decline

BYLINE: By ANISE C. WALLACE

 BODY:
Prices of some high-yield ''junk bonds'' fell sharply yesterday as investors reacted to the uncertainty in the Mideast and to concerns about a possible recession. Some mutual fund portfolio managers sold these speculative bonds to meet an increase in redemptions by nervous individual investors, traders said.
Indeed, in contrast to recent days when Wall Street dealers marked these bonds lower on very little selling, yesterday's trading was characterized as moderately heavy, traders said, and they expect the selloff to continue. 
Prices of RJR Nabisco bonds plunged more than two points, or $20 for every $1,000 of face amount. Bonds of the R.H. Macy & Company fell more than four points on continuing worries that the heavily indebted retailer would be unable to meet its obligations.
 
'Everything Was Down'
Even junk bonds of companies that investors consider recession-proof like the Kroger Company, the food chain, fell more than one point. ''Everything was down,'' said David Feinman, a junk bond trader at Jefferies & Company in Beverly Hills.
Many of the more speculative junk bonds, like zero-coupon bonds that pay no interest, or so-called pay-in-kind bonds that pay interest not in cash but in more junk bonds, were hit the hardest, and bonds of casino companies continued to drop sharply.
Nevertheless, traders said that late in the afternoon portfolio managers at some insurance companies and investment management firms stepped in and began buying some of the suddenly cheaper bonds. $230 Billion Market Junk bonds are securities of companies that are too young or have too much debt to earn an investment grade rating from the rating agencies like Moody's Investors Services. Many of the bonds in this $230 billion market were issued to finance leveraged buyouts and other corporate reorganizations in the late 1980's. Many investors are now worried that these companies will be unable to meet all of their debt payments.
Traders said yesterday that some Wall Street dealers, nervous about the possibility of war in the Mideast, were selling bonds to lighten their inventories of these risky securities. Also portfolio managers at junk bond mutual funds were trying to raise cash as nervous shareholders moved out, many switching their assets into safer investments like money market funds.
''There had been good cash flow into our high-yield fund all year, but clearly the trend has reversed,'' said Brian Mattes, a spokesman at the Vanguard Group, a large mutual fund organization in Valley Forge, Pa. Investors began withdrawing their cash from the company's $865 million junk bond fund in early August, and redemptions have picked up substantially since then, he said.

Japan Trade Group Fills Top Post in New York

 BODY:
The Japan External Trade Organization has named Tetsuo Matsufuji president of its New York office. Jetro is one of the leading Japanese Government agencies that promote trade relations between Japan and other countries.
Mr. Matsufuji, who is 47, has spent the last 25 years working in various countries for the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which oversees Jetro. 
He was president of the trade organization's office in Dusseldorf in the 1970's, for instance, where he developed policies to help reduce the trade imbalance between Japan and West Germany. His most recent position was as director of the policy division in the organization's Economic Planning Agency in Tokyo.
Mr. Matsufuji said he would work to increase United States exports to Japan in an effort to reduce the $49 billion trade imbalance between the two countries.
''This is not an easy job because the situation is too big,'' he said. ''You can't change it in a year or two.''
Since arriving in New York last month, Mr. Matsufuji has been walking a great deal around the city to get to know it and to window-shop with his 22-year-old son. He said they looked primarily for luggage, baby clothes and furniture because those were items manufactured in the United States that appealed to the Japanese. Nevertheless, he said American manufacturers would have to reshape some products for the Japanese market.
''The furniture sizes are just too big,'' Mr. Matsufuji said with a slight laugh. ''And in America, all the baby products are pink and blue. But in Japan the color is white.''
He had no complaints about the quality or cost of American products.
Mr. Matsufuji said his next project was to send Japanese businessmen to 15 Southern and Midwestern states in search of export products from small and medium-sized companies.
Jetro organizes buying and selling missions in which representatives of Japanese companies come to the United States and buy products that are then sold as samples at trade shows in Japan. Textiles, furniture and pharmaceuticals make up most of the 1,000 samples tested annually, he said.
The agency's annual budget for import promotion this year is $100 million, distributed among seven offices in the United States and 77 offices in other countries.
Mr. Matsufuji graduated from the law department of Tokyo University. His wife, Ayako, and two daughters plan to join him in New York in February. His son will return to Japan to finish his university education there. The family has a home near Tokyo, in the city of Nagareyama.

State Dept. Contract Gives Wang a Boost

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
In its most positive news in more than two years, Wang Laboratories Inc. said yesterday that the State Department had awarded the company a five-year, $841.3 million contract to supply and service a range of desk-top and midrange computers.
Under the agreement, Wang, based in Lowell, Mass., said that it would supply the State Department with personal computers, computer networks, midrange systems, communications gear and technical support and training.
Wang, once a leader in the computer industry, has struggled for the last four years with a series of reorganizations and layoffs. The contract announcement yesterday was described as the largest in the company's history. 
''This is important because it sends a signal,'' said Richard W. Miller, Wang's chairman and chief executive. ''It's an important confidence builder and a testimony from a sophisticated customer that is betting on us.''
He said he expected that the company, which reported a $424.3 million loss in 1989, will return to profitability in 1991.
Mr. Miller said the company had begun the bidding process for the State Department contract three years ago, but that it had been particularly intense in the last 12 months.
Frederick A. Wang, son of Wang's founder, An Wang, resigned in August 1989 as president of the company and Mr. Miller was appointed to take over as president and chief executive. An Wang died of cancer at age 70 this past March.
The office automation equipment in the contract will be used by the State Department, the United States Agency for International Development, the United States Information Agency, the Foreign Agricultural Service of the United States Department of Agriculture and the Foreign Commercial Service of the Commerce Department.
''It's a very pleasant surprise,'' said Shao Wang, a computer industry analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''It follows by less than a month a relatively positive earnings report. I won't say that the tide is turning, but things are coming in the right direction.''
Wang Laboratories rose to prominence in the 1970's as a word processor and minicomputer manufacturer, but the company has not been able to make the transition to the personal computer industry because it was late in bringing compatible products to the market.
Wang shares rose $1.125 yesterday, to $4.50, on the American Stock Exchange.

USAir to Drop More Workers

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
USAir, which said last week that it would lay off 200 pilots, reported yesterday that it was cutting another 1,500 workers, or 2.7 percent of its work force, as it pares back expansion plans.
The nation's seventh-largest airline, based in Arlington, Va., said most of the 1,500 employees have been hired recently as part of an expansion program that is being rolled back. 
''We are going to terminate about 1,500 probationary employees,'' a USAir spokesman said. Union and nonunion workers, most of them on the payroll less than six months, will be affected.
''We deeply regret that this action is necessary, but these employees were hired in anticipation of an expansion program that has since been reduced in light of current economic projections,'' USAir's president, Seth Schofield, said in a statement.
Last week, USAir said it planned to furlough 211 pilots on Jan. 1. At the time, it also said it was looking for areas to make further cuts.
USAir now has about 55,000 employees. It has large hubs in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Charlotte, N.C.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of U.S. Securities Lower

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury notes and bonds moved lower in thin, volatile trading yesterday, as dealers used movements in oil prices as their major indicator to buy or sell securities.
A sharp run-up in oil prices early in the day sent out a clear sell signal, pushing bond prices down by more than a point. But oil later came down from its daily highs, and that helped erase most of the decline in bond prices.
Comments from Tariq Aziz, Iraq's Foreign Minister, calling for a negotiated settlement to the crisis in the Persian Gulf also helped buttress prices, even though Mr. Aziz did not offer to withdraw Iraqi troops from Kuwait and restore its monarchy. 
Traders said that the drop in stock prices had little influence on activity in the credit markets. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 52.48 points, to 2,603.96.
''We are not seeing the move into Treasury bills that a drop in stock prices caused in the past,'' one government bond trader said.
Even though price movements were very erratic, market participants attached little significance to the shifts because volume was so low.
''People don't want to get headlined,'' another bond trader said, referring to the strong chance that a wire service report about the latest development in the Middle East could send prices plunging or soaring.
 
Investors Seen Afraid
''That means the Street is afraid to take positions, and retail investors are afraid to buy the market.''
For the most part, traders did not react when late yesterday morning the Federal Reserve added reserves to the banking system at a time when the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market was trading at just under 8 percent, the level widely believed to be the Fed's target for the closely watched rate.
Under other circumstances, the Fed's move would probably have attracted more attention, since it occurred on a day when members of the central bank's policy-making Open Market Committee were meeting in Washington.
But analysts said that the move was more to clean up after the chaos caused by the Aug. 13 blackout in lower Manhattan than it was to ease policy.
''Normally, when they add reserves after an Open Market Committee meeting you might think they are easing policy,'' said David Wyss, chief financial economist at Data Resources Inc., the economic forecasting firm.
''But in this case, they are disentangling the system after the problems created a week ago Monday. As a result, I wouldn't read too much into this.''
The funds rate traded as low as 7 3/4 percent yesterday, and Mr. Wyss and others said that it would probably not move back to its target level until after the end of the two-week reserve reporting period for banks ends on Wednesday.
For all of their volatility, Treasury issues were little changed at the end of the session.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 98 1/32, down 2/32, to yield 8.93 percent, unchanged from late Monday.
Among note issues, the 8 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 15/ 32, down 6/32, to yield 8.83 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at 99 26/32, down 2/32, to yield 8.52 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates rose slightly.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.56 percent, up three basis points, or hundredths of a point. Six-month bill rates rose by four basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.46 percent.
 
'Junk Bond' Prices Fall
While the sharp drop in stock prices had little effect in the secondary market for Treasury securities, the selloff in equities rattled investors in the high-yield ''junk bond'' market. Market participants said that prices of most issues fell by 1 to 1 1/2 points, with some bonds falling by much more than that. Trading was very light, however.
Reaction to the day's developments in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds was more subdued. Traders said that prices of most actively quoted issues were unchanged on the day.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, market participants said that prices of most issues fell by 1/2 point to 5/8 point.
Among the new municipal issues priced yesterday was a negotiated sale of $185 million worth of general obligation bonds for the District of Columbia.
The issue, which is insured by Financial Security Assurance, consists of serial bonds with maturities from 1991 to 2001 and two term bonds.
Coupons on the serial bonds range from 6.20 percent in 1991 to 7.20 percent in 2001.
The 7.40 percent term bonds that mature June 1, 2005, were initially offered at a price to yield 7.497 percent. And the 7 1/2 percent bonds that mature June 1, 2010, were offered at a price to yield 7.585 percent.

The Dollar Closes Mixed In U.S. After Drop Abroad

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished mixed after falling overseas yesterday in a volatile session that saw the currency buffeted by conflicting reports about the prospects for stability in the Middle East.
Traders sold the dollar after a report that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq was willing to negotiate a peace settlement. But later reports that the Iraqis were mining Kuwaiti ports and refineries pushed the dollar higher. 
The dollar ''got whipsawed by these conflicting reports,'' said Marc Chandler, an analyst with MMS International in Chicago. ''The dollar put in its lows on the idea that there would be peace,'' he added, but when that seemed to fade, it was pushed back up.
But another round of bearish economic data put further pressure on the dollar, as the Government reported that the Federal budget deficit jumped $25.9 billion in July. That pushed the fiscal year's imbalance so far to $189.1 billion, compared with $123.7 billion at the end of July 1989.
The report induced traders to sell dollars because it appears the United States economy may be headed into a recession. Lower interest rates, which typically follow in an economic slowdown, would make dollar-denominated securities less appealing to foreign investors.
Still, investors are ''a little afraid to get a little too short of dollars,'' said Gilbert Cisneros, a trader at the Bank of Boston's New York office. ''If something does spark'' in the Middle East, he said, ''it's expensive to get the dollars back.''
Against the Japanese currency, the dollar rose in New York to 146.80 yen from 146.51. Earlier, the dollar fell in Tokyo to a closing 146.55 yen, from 147.47 yen late Monday, and in London, it fell to 146.35 yen.
Against the German currency, the dollar rose slightly, to 1.5645 marks from 1.5642.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.9215, from $1.9185 late Monday. In New York, it cost $1.9113 to buy one pound, less expensive than Monday's $1.9135.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday, included: 1.2900 Swiss francs, down from 1.2955; 5.2635 French francs, up from 5.2565; 1,161.75 Italian lire, up from 1,157.25, and 1.1399 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1427.

Building Plan In Detroit Starts Debate

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
COMERICA INC., one of Detroit's largest banks, has won approval for a controversial plan to tear down a riverfront auditorium that was donated by the Ford family to the city and put a new corporate headquarters on the site.
After a series of heated public debates, Detroit's City Council voted 6 to 3 last month to approve the plan by Comerica and the developer, Gerald Hines Interests Inc. of Houston, to buy the Ford Auditorium, demolish it and build a 28-story headquarters. The design, by the architect Cesar Pelli will be made public next month. Comerica will start razing the auditorium, now rarely used but once the home of the Detroit Symphony, this fall, and construction will begin next summer. 
The controversy centers not only on the location of the proposed 750,000-square-foot building but also on the economic incentives given by the city. Under an agreement with Mayor Coleman A. Young's office, the bank will be allowed to buy the site for $7.5 million, with payments delayed 28 years, and receive an $18 million, 28-year interest-free loan for construction.
Downtown Detroit has been the site of relatively little major office construction since the Renaissance Center was built in the late 1970's. The Comerica project comes just a few months after Gerald Hines began construction of a 50-story office building nearby, and many local real estate people fear a glut of offices in the downtown market.
Opponents, among them an array of business and civic leaders and some members of the Ford family, say the site next to Hart Plaza, a large public space with a huge fountain and an amphitheater, is inappropriate for a high-rise office structure. Woodward Avenue, Detroit's main commercial thoroughfare, leads into the plaza, making it the core of the city's riverfront. They also assert that the auditorium should not be torn down. It was built in 1956 to house the city's symphony orchestra and abandoned last year because of poor acoustics. The orchestra now performs in its original home, Orchestra Hall, which was refurbished in 1989.
Comerica's supporters say the project will be an important investment by the bank that will keep approximately 1,200 jobs downtown and put a new, world-class office building on the riverfront. The bank defends its plans, saying it could not find another site downtown appropriate for its headquarters that would attract investors to help build it.
Critics say Comerica blackmailed the city by hinting that it would move to the suburbs if the project was not approved. William Clay Ford, grandson of Henry Ford and the largest single shareholder of the Ford Motor Company, criticized the bank's proposal in a letter to the city and said his family would no longer make donations to the city as long as the Young administration was in office.
Mel Ravitz, one of three City Council members who voted against the proposal, is a party to a lawsuit to stop the project. He said he opposed the plan because the city would be selling an asset to a private company that had been donated for public use.
''This seems to be a violation of the public trust,'' Mr. Ravitz said. ''My primary concern now is that other developers will be looking to the city to bargain for other public lands.''
The controversy started in May when Comerica and the city announced the project. The bank said then that it had spent several months looking for a site because the lease in its current headquarters would expire in mid-1993.
''The Ford Auditorium site was the one that best guaranteed that we could attract the financing and tenants to make the building an economic success,'' said David Taylor, a Comerica spokesman.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
Japan Offering Billions to Arabs To Help Offset Gulf Crisis Losses

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Japan is offering what may amount to billions of dollars in financial aid as well as communications and transportation support to Middle East nations that would suffer by cutting off trade with Iraq and Kuwait, the Foreign Ministry has said.
Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama is on a tour of the Middle East that will take him to Saudi Arabia, Oman, Jordan, Egypt and Turkey.
Japan is still debating whether it should send personnel to the Persian Gulf to support the United Nations embargo against Iraq.
 
Unable to Send Personnel
Mr. Nakayama has not been able to offer the ''concrete measures'' of noncombat personnel that the Government has said Japan is contemplating. But Foreign Ministry officials said he has been receiving requests for other forms of aid and that the Government has moved closer to agreeing to them. But officials said that the aid plans have not been completed. 
These requests range from large amounts of financial support to more practical logistical aid, including desalinization equipment for Saudi Arabia to medical teams. Such aid would be a new step for Japan, which is constrained by its post-World War II Constitution from involvement in possible military conflicts.
The offer of aid is an exceptionally sensitive issue for the Japanese. The Government is eager to demonstrate that it is prepared to take a more active role in international affairs commensurate with its economic influence.
Mr. Nakayama has told the potential recipients that Japan could offer some inducement to help countries financially if they agreed to support the embargo against Iraq.
The results of the Japanese initiative have been mixed so far. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, who has backed the embargo, reportedly told Mr. Nakayama on Wednesday that his country, already facing financial difficulties, might lose $2 billion a year or more from lower foreign exchange remittances by Egyptians working outside the country, a decline in fees from the Suez Canal and a reduction in tourism.
Turkey, which shut off an Iraqi pipeline through its territory to the Mediterranean, may suffer even greater losses and be even more eager for aid.
 
At Washington's Urging
But Jordan, which has been less willing to oppose its powerful neighbor, earlier this week rebuffed Japan's urgings that it take a strong stand on the embargo, according to Japanese press reports.
Japan's offer of money comes in part in response to American urgings. President Bush reportedly telephoned Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu last week and proposed that Tokyo provide such assistance.
In addition, he was said to have suggested that Japan help finance the international forces in the Persian Gulf, cover more of the annual costs of stationing American troops in Japan and that the Japanese Self-Defense Forces buy more American military equipment.
The Japanese Government has been playing down discussions of financial assistance out of fear that it would be seen as checkbook diplomacy - sending money when other countries, particularly the United States, are shouldering a heavier burden by risking lives in an effort to force Iraq out of Kuwait.
Japan has joined the trade embargo, cutting off nearly 12 percent of its regular oil supply. Also, 509 Japanese citizens are trapped in Iraq and Kuwait. But Japan is finding it far more difficult to arrive at a consensus on what other support it can offer.
Government officials have expressed some urgency in making it clear to the United States and other countries that Japan is willing to play a more prominent role in resolving the crisis - particularly since Japan is more reliant on Middle Eastern oil than any other industrialized nation.
Japan buys slightly more than 70 percent of its oil supplies from the Middle East.
On Friday, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Taizo Watanabe, emphasized in a briefing here for foreign reporters, ''Please don't think we are only considering sending money.'' He added, without being specific, ''We are considering everything.''
But any discussion of military matters can elicit strong emotional reactions in Japan, particularly from opposition parties. To overcome this resistance, it has been reported that Mr. Kaifu has been contacting opposition leaders to seek their understanding for what would be the most active steps Japan has taken since World War II into a possible military situation.
Japanese newspapers have said that this included a possibility of sending teams of medical, transportation or communications specialists, and perhaps minesweepers as well.

HEADLINE: The Shaken Financial Markets

 BODY:
The world's financial markets have been reeling as fears mount of war in the Middle East and oil prices soar.
In the United States, the jolts come on top of fears of imminent recession, and the stock market tells the story clearly. With a 43.81-point drop yesterday, to 2,560.15, the Dow Jones industrial average has now lost almost 440 points, or nearly 15 percent, since its peak in mid-July. 
In the three weeks since Iraq invaded Kuwait, the Dow has lost 300 points, fully 10 percent of its value.
The stocks of smaller companies have been hit even harder, with over-the-counter issues off by more than 20 percent since mid-July.
The Tokyo stock market, a powerhouse in recent years, is taking the biggest beating after reaching a record high at the end of the year. As measured by the Nikkei index, prices have fallen by 39 percent this year, with a 4 percent drop yesterday and a sharp selloff of nearly 6 percent in in Tokyo today.
European stocks have also suffered. On Tuesday, the West German market lost 5.2 percent and the French 4 percent, both hitting lows for the year, as British stocks lost 2 percent. In Frankfurt and Paris, the indexes regained some ground yesterday, while the London market stabilized.
In the American credit markets, fears of oil-ignited inflation and higher budget deficits piled on top of war worries, sending long-term interest rates to their highest levels in nearly four months. The yield on the Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond now stands at 9.04 percent.
In foreign exchange markets, the invasion would normally have sent the dollar higher as investors sought a haven, but instead it continued to weaken.Just last week, the dollar slid to its lowest level against the mark since the German currency was created in 1948.

HEADLINE: PRICE OF OIL JUMPS BY 9% IN ONE DAY

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The price of oil topped $31 a barrel yesterday, the highest price since November 1985, when the oil markets were still recovering from the Iranian revolution of five years earlier. The current Middle East crisis has raised prices to a level higher than they were when Iran and Iraq were trying to sink each others' tankers.
Many traders said yesterday's surge, close to 9 percent, came because market participants feared further war in the Middle East, eliminating even more production than the four million to five million barrels a day that Kuwait and Iraq once exported. Prices of refined petroleum products also continued to rise. 
 
A Case of War Jitters
''I think the market is getting more and more fearful that the shooting's going to start sometime soon,'' said Daniel Yergin, an energy analyst, ''and when that happens, it may be a lot more than four million barrels a day that doesn't get out of the gulf.''
Indeed, Saudi Arabia notified many customers yesterday that it would not be able to deliver large quantities of refined products because in the event of military action against Iraq the fuel would be needed for its own armed forces and the American forces in Saudi Arabia. The announcement came as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries found itself deeply divided after a group led by Algeria, Libya and Iran blocked a renewed attempt by Saudi Arabia and Venezuela to convene an emergency meeting to try to stabilize oil prices. [Page D6.] A few oil traders said yesterday's price action was also influenced by the delay in the often-expressed plan of Saudi Arabia and Venezuela to increase production by a combined total of 2.5 million barrels a day.
The futures market, where producers, refiners, wholesalers and speculators come together and strike a price for oil to be delivered at a specified date that may be many months away, has a mixed record as a predicter and interpreter of events. Dozens of times in the past, sometimes more than once a day, prices surged on reports of the death of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Iran. The market has reacted to snaps of cold weather, aberrations in inventory figures and announcements about OPEC in ways that bore little relationship to long-term meaning of the events. But its instinct at the moment is that it is better to buy at today's price than to risk having to buy at a higher price later.
The market's rise is likely to hit consumers harder in the next few weeks than they have been so far in the crisis. For example, gasoline has risen about 16 cents since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, but at the American Automobile Association, Jerry Cheske, a spokesman, predicted a rise of at least that much again in coming weeks.
Some experts, pointing to futures prices, say bigger retail increases are ahead. The price of unleaded regular gasoline for delivery next month surged 2.85 cents, to just over $1.04 a gallon yesterday. That plus the average tax of 25 cents a gallon exceeds the average pump price of $1.24 that prevailed at the beginning of this week. That leaves less than nothing for distributors and retailers, whose combined markup in normal times is about 20 cents. Thus, the futures price is pointing to a retail price of $1.50 a gallon.
At Mobil Oil, John Lord, a spokesman, said corporate policy forbade him to make price predictions. But he said the decreasing margin between the price on the New York Merc and the average retail price ''once again shows that there's been no rip-off of the American driving consumer.''
Refining analysts say that the loss of output from refineries in Kuwait, plus increased demand for refined products from nervous gasoline middlemen and users and from the armed forces in the Middle East have all contributed to the price run-up.
None of this assuages a popular mood of suspicion, however. Yesterday the New York City Consumer Affairs Commissioner, Mark Green, complained, ''This isn't a price hike but a price heist.''
Heating oil prices will also rise sharply, and the effect of higher prices will continue to ripple through the economy, experts said. In trading yesterday, the contract for September delivery of heating oil closed at 91.35 cents a gallon, up 7.64 cents.
In the crude market, the closing price for oil for October delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange was $31.22, up $2.51. That was the highest since futures prices were at $31.72 on Nov. 20, 1985. Contracts for delivery in later months moved up yesterday by their allowable daily limit, $1. Under the exchange's rules, the limits will rise to $1.50 today. In 1985, when the Iran-Iraq tanker war began, the average cost to refiners was $26.75, but by 1986 a price war among producers had cut the figure to $14.55.
Much of yesterday's gain came late in the trading day, after Gen. Colin Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on television that the United States' goal in the Middle East extended beyond simply defending Saudi Arabia.
At Cargill Investor Services, Bradford H. Hughes, a futures broker, said that the message the market got from that remark was that ''Saddam Hussein can't be another little Hitler; he's going to have to be taken out early.''
Not everyone has war jitters. At Purvin & Gertz, a Houston-based consulting firm, Robert A. Hermes, the president, said the market was reacting to delays by Saudi Arabia and Venezuela in increasing their production. ''The market thinks the additional production just isn't coming on on schedule, and the clock keeps ticking away,'' he said.
Without news of new production, he said, he would not be surprised to see the price of crude oil go to $35 a barrel.
Some experts said the sharp rise in prices might induce the Bush Administration to rethink its position on the use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The Administration has said it would tap the reserve only in the event of a shortage and not in response to price moves. Phil Kief, a spokesman for the Energy Department, said after the market closed yesterday that no re-evaluation was under way. ''We're not driven by price,'' he said. ''We're driven by supplies.''

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
Saudis Plan to Supply U.S. With Fuel for Military Use

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 22

 BODY:
Saudi Arabian oil officials moved today to suspend their nation's daily export of hundreds of thousands of barrels of jet and diesel fuel, diverting much of it to the American military as a down payment on reimbursement for United States aid in the Persian Gulf crisis, Saudi officials say.
The precise size of the Saudis' fuel contributions was not known today, but Ken Miller, an expert with OPEC Listener, a New York-based oil analysis concern, said the suspended exports could total 200,000 to 300,000 barrels a day, worth $5 million or more.
The fuel is probably the largest single Saudi compensation to date for the United States military effort, one American official said today, although the Saudis are expected to provide oil or cash to other nations assisting in its defense against Iraqi troops.
At the same time, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the Pentagon would dip into its own inventories to supply the Saudis with additional jets and other weaponry quickly, and promised later to sell the Saudis the most advanced fighter jet in the United States Air Force fleet, the F-15E. 
 
A Close Relationship
The two actions dramatize the increasingly close relationship between Washington and Riyadh, a political and military alliance that American officials say has long been warm, but has been cloaked to meet the necessities of Middle East diplomacy and economics.
Now the threat of war has forced King Fahd openly to declare himself in league with President Bush and the Western world. Although the move could save the Saudi kingdom in the short run, it poses both great and small risks as the American presence in the Saudi desert increases.
''Over the long term, it creates some big problems for the Saudis,'' said Yahya Sadowski, a research associate and Middle East expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington. ''The American presence is a lightning rod. Already, every Islamic movement in the Middle East is now depicting the Saudi Arabians as American puppets, rich sheiks sitting on barrels of oil while the poor suffer.
''If the Saudis can get out of this quickly and peacefully, they can still say they invited the Americans in strictly for defense purposes, and they don't totally rupture the relationship with the Arab world,'' he said. But Mr. Sadowski said he now believes the chances of that are slim.
 
A Free-Fuel Policy
The move today to restrict fuel exports by the Government-owned Saudi Arabian Marketing and Refining Company, commonly called Samarec, formally takes effect on Sept. 1. As a practical matter, however, it extends a free-fuel policy toward the American military and other foreign forces that has existed since Aug. 8, when the first United States troops arrived in Saudi Arabia.
One American official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the Saudis also provided fuel to the United States Navy when it escorted oil tankers through the mined waters of the Persian Gulf in 1987 and 1988.
Because the troops and military hardware are already paid for, fuel is one of the larger incremental costs of the American operation in the Persian Gulf, and the Saudi contribution therefore is substantial, that official said. Riyadh is also expected to foot some other costs of the American military, like building quarters for troops that now live in tents, should the United States' stay in Saudi Arabia become lengthy.
But by far the most important Saudi assistance, American officials say, is King Fahd's pledge this month to make up much of the shortfall in world oil supplies that has been triggered by the United Nations embargo on trade with Iraq and on Kuwaiti oil.
 
Close to Nation's Capacity
The Saudis are widely believed to have pledged to increase their oil exports from their current level of 5.38 million barrels a day, a figure set by the OPEC cartel, to nearly 7.4 million barrels. That is close to the nation's production capacity, and more than the Saudis have produced for a sustained time since 1982.
King Fahd has sought OPEC approval for the increase, but it is opposed by cartel members like Libya, which cannot easily increase its own production, and so would benefit by selling its existing stock of oil at higher prices.
''An OPEC agreement would kind of legitimize their position, but if none of that works, I think they'll go it alone,'' Mr. Miller said. ''But it's quite a big decision for them - bigger in their eyes than ours, because they have to live with these people.''
The prospect of an additional two million barrels from Saudi Arabia, and more from other oil-producing nations, so far has helped keep the price of oil low enough to limit the threat of a worldwide economic recession.
 
Close Ties Increasing
While the huge United States force in the Persian Gulf cannot be hidden, American officials have taken pains to play down other aspects of the increasingly close ties to the Saudis.
The State Department said today that the American Embassy had added only a handful of officers to its embassy in Riyadh to assist during the gulf crisis. The Pentagon has also shied away from describing the politically touchy nature of its authority on Saudi territory, with Mr. Cheney saying today only that the Americans and the Saudis had made ''parallel arrangements'' to govern the actions of desert troops and pilots.
Similarly, the Bush Administration declined to discuss Saudi payment for American military aid today. An official said only that ''in previous times when the Saudis have asked for our assistance we have worked out means of compensation, and we expect that will happen this time as well.''
The Saudi willingness to risk OPEC disapproval and the scorn of some Arab neighbors, American officials and observers like Mr. Sadowski say, underscores both the seriousness of their plight and the increasing depth of their ties to the United States.
Saudi kings have quietly supported American causes for decades, giving billions of dollars to secret American-backed wars in places like Afghanistan and Nicaragua, and providing cash support for United States diplomacy in nether regions like Somalia. In return, they have won the right to buy advanced Pentagon weapons and the White House's promise of on-the-scene aid in a genuine crisis.
American military advisers have been in Saudi Arabia almost constantly since 1949, training the nation's military elite and helping maintain planes and weapons systems.

Transcript of News Session by Bush and 2 Officials on Mideast

 BODY:
Following is the transcript of the news conference by President Bush, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell yesterday in Kennebunkport, Me., as recorded by The New York Times:
 
OPENING STATEMENT
PRESIDENT BUSH: First, Secretary Cheney and General Powell have just given me a very full and, I would say, encouraging briefing on the status of our deployment to the Persian Gulf. This has been a very complicated mission, calling for precision, calling for maximum coordination with Saudi Arabia and the other nations providing forces.
The process is going smoothly. And we've now moved what amounts to a medium-size American city completely capable of defending itself all the way over to the Middle East. And the Secretary reports that the men and women in the armed forces have performed with extraordinary ability. Their morale is high, and they've accepted the challenge of their mission with extraordinary dedication to duty. And I'm very proud of each and every single one of them. 
Now I want them to know that the American people are behind them 100 percent, supporting them strongly. And it's also crucial that everyone understand we are not in this alone. We stand shoulder to shoulder right there in the Middle East with the armed forces of 22 other nations from the Middle East, from Europe and around the world.
Secretary Dick Cheney reports an impressive alliance of multinational forces that stands behind the United Nations' resolve that Iraq completely and unconditionally withdraw from Kuwait, with the restoration of the legitimate government in that country. The United Nations has provided enormous leadership to the whole world community in pursuing this objective and voting the sanctions necessary to carrying it out.
And let's be clear as the deployment of the forces of the many nations shows and that the votes in the United Nations show, this is not a matter between Iraq and the United States of America. It is between Iraq and the entire world community, Arab and non-Arab alike, all the nations of the world lined up to oppose aggression.
And as our forces continue to arrive, they can look forward to the support of the finest reserve components in the world. We are activating those special categories of reservists that are essential to completing our mission.
The United States considers its reserve forces to be an integral part of the total military command. These essential personnel will soon be joining the cohesive organization required to support the military operation in and around the Arabian Peninsula. And I have the highest confidence in their ability to augment the active forces in this operation.
 
Pledge Not to Waver
We continue to pursue our objective with absolute determination. And I might add that I talked to the four leaders of Congress today, and I am very pleased that they are giving us the strong support they have been, the Speaker, Senator Mitchell, Senator Dole, Congressman Michel.
And the world simply cannot waver in its opposition to the threat that Iraq has placed on the doorstep of all nations who cherish freedom and the rule of law.
Now what I plan to do is take some questions, and then I know you'll have more questions for Secretary Cheney and General Powell. And then the discussions that we've had with these two gentlemen and Secretary Eagleberger, General Scowcroft, the Chief of Staff, Bob Gates, will continue for a little while this afternoon before they return to Washington.
So, Dick, I am very grateful to you for your mission, successful mission, and, both to you and Colin, my sincere thanks for the superb leadership you are giving the United States military, the superb leadership you are showing in working with other countries as we pursue these moral, high moral, objectives.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Cooperation With Soviets
Q. Mr. President, the Soviets had voted with us in the Security Council for the economic sanctions, but we learned today that they have 193 military advisers still advising the Iraqi army on how to use Soviet-built weapons against the allied forces. Do you call upon them to pull those people out?
A. Well, I think that frankly I'd like to see Iraq do what is civilized and permit foreigners who want to leave, leave. But I'm not going to comment on that because I don't have this information that you're telling me about. Maybe Dick Cheney can comment on it later.
Q. Can I just follow, sir? You've talked to at least a dozen world leaders right from here in the past week and a half. Have you called Secretary, President Gorbachev? And will you call President Gorbachev for his help in the crisis?
A. Secretary Baker talked to Foreign Minister Shevardnadze less than two hours ago, and we are in close touch with the Soviets. At this point, I can say we are getting superb cooperation from the Soviets. There may be some differences. In fact, I think it's fair to say we've been discussing some of them regarding the timing of certain further U.N. action. But I have no argument with the way in which they have cooperated, and I would expect that Secretary Cheney would agree on that point.
 
U.S. Interception of Ships
Q. Could I follow up to that, sir, talking about the action that you would hope to have? The U.S. forces fired across the bow of a ship that then was allowed to continue on and is now in Yemen. Why did they not pursue that further? Do you want to wait until you now have that U.N. authority?
A. Well, you know we feel we have all the authority we need. And the world leaders I've talked to, particularly Francois Mitterrand and Margaret Thatcher, agree that we have all the authority we need. We have been trying, and I think prudently so, to work with other countries around the world. And the more unanimity we get out of the United Nations, for example, the better.
So we're prepared to intercept shipping, but where I stand now is I'm talking to my top advisers here and been on the phone to Secretary Baker a couple of times in the last two hours talking about should the United Nations, should we give the United Nations more time to take more productive action.
And it has taken productive action, obviously. The Chapter 7 was a significant step. So, I think we've made clear to the shipping that they can be stopped and that we have the forces to stop them right now. And I believe that General Powell would back me up on what I've just said. So my question is, how much more United Nations action is required?
And so I'm going to continue the discussion, asking for the advice of my officials here, but at this juncture I'm not prepared to say whether we're going to insist on U.N. action before we go further. But I think the record, the signal, must go out to the world that many countries are prepared to fully enforce these sanctions, and if there's some U.N. action that will help, so much the better.
Q. How long will you wait for that U.N. action?
A. We haven't made a determination. I think the signal is out there as we pursue certain vessels and clearly have superior, have the demonstrated ability to board these vessels that we can do it. So now the question is, how much more U.N. action is, benefits this idea of the world staying more closely together? And I might be prepared to give a little time - speaking just for the U.S. - we're only one country there, important one though it may be - in order to get more collective action.
But, on the other hand, I need more advice in terms of the logistics, where the ships are, what the signal would be if we go ahead and take action to stop them, which we could confidently do.
 
Likelihood of Closing Embassy
Q. Mr. President, despite demands from the Iraqis that the U.S. and other countries close their embassies in Kuwait and remove all their diplomatic personnel, the State Department announced today that the U.S. would not do that. Why have you decided to take that course of action? And how can you possibly enforce that?
A. Because the occupation of Kuwait is illegal under international law and other countries agree totally that we must not take the position that this illegal regime can shut down legitimate embassies as a result of their aggression, that's why.
Q. But with Iraq in military control of Kuwait, how can you possibly hope to enforce that?
A. Well, my view is let's wait and see what happens. I don't go into these hypothetical questions. I'd like to explain this because I know there's a lot of them out there, as to what I might not or might do under certain circumstances. But here I think most countries that I'm aware of, and I defer to Secretary Eagleburger, would agree that they will not go along with the, with agreeing to this kind of affirmation of Iraq aggression, aggression that has been thoroughly condemned by the United Nations.
 
Policy on American Hostages
Q. I'd like to ask please about your hostage policy. You were very firm the other day in warning Saddam not to harm the Americans, but I wonder --
A. Consider what?
Q. -- has been provoked? Has the United States been provoked now?
A. I don't think it's a question of the United States. I think it's a question of the whole world is being provoked by this illegal action, outrageous action.
Q. Do you have a plan for getting --
A. I don't discuss hypothetical contingencies. But I would reiterate, it is a grave concern to all the countries whose leaders I've talked to.
Q. Will the United States give safe haven to our citizens in Kuwait and Iraq if, in the embassies --
A. If citizens came to the embassy seeking support and help, clearly we would do that.
Q. Mr. President, do you have plans to --
A. Let me just work right down the line here, if that's agreeable.
Q. Do have plans to draw down the number of Americans in our embassy in Kuwait?
A. I'd like to defer that question to Secretary Eagleberger when I continue this. There has been talk of it. Indeed, I think we're talking about taking down some personnel, but I'd like to ask him to be a little more definitive.
Q. Mr. President, how constrained do you feel by the Americans trapped in Kuwait as you make your decisions by the plight of the Americans?
A. I think any decision maker in the United States or in any of these countries is concerned about the lives of innocent civilians, innocent people. And so you weigh that very thoroughly against your actions. Having said that, international law in this case, the Chapter 7 sanctions, must be enforced.
 
Call to Conserve Resources
Q. Mr. President, you said last Wednesday at the Pentagon that part of what we're fighting for, standing for, in the desert is our way of life. Part of our way of life is heavy uses of energy, much more so than any other industrialized country. We haven't really heard you call upon Americans to conserve as part of this crisis.
A. I call upon Americans to conserve.
Q. Will you elaborate?
A. No. I think we ought to conserve in times like this. On the other hand, we are doing everything we can to guarantee that we don't panic Americans and that there will be an adequate supply of hydrocarbons. But I think it is a good time to conserve, so I'm glad you reminded me of that and I would call upon Americans to conserve.
And I think that doesn't mean that life screeches to a halt, and, therefore, I would say that. But I also think we're going to be able to guarantee an adequate supply of petroleum.
Q. How many reserves are going to be called up as a first step?
A. I will defer that question to Secretary Cheney.
Q. Do you sense any frustration or even desperation in the recent statements we've been hearing out of Iraq?
A. I certainly sense a sense of isolation. I sense, I think, the urgency in these statements and the high immoderate tone is due to worldwide isolation. And I think that's very clear, and I think he's trying to whip up support and make his Iraq versus the United States. Indeed it is Iraq versus the rest of the world. And I talked to leader after leader, talked at length to Helmut Kohl today, and he's been making just that point and will continue to make that point.
But yes, I think there is some of that feeling that as they become isolated from their Arab brothers - and they are - and as they become isolated from traditional trading partners - and they are - there is a sense of irrational urgency there.
Q. How seriously do you take his public threats?
A. The United States won't be threatened.
Q. Mr. President, the other day you called on Americans for personal sacrifice, but you didn't really elaborate. Are you talking about economic deprivation or were you --
A. No, I was not particularly talking about economic deprivation. I'm thinking of families whose plans have been severely altered by this. I'm thinking of more of that kind of thing when I made the statement.
 
Role of King Hussein
Q. Are you preparing Americans for the possibility of war and American deaths?
A. I think any time you move American forces and any time you are up against what most of the world now considers to be an outrageous violator of international law, the best thing is to be prepared.
Q. King Hussein today in Jordan suggested that perhaps you moved too percipitously, in his words that if there had not been this buildup that we might not be in the situation we're in and that Saddam Hussein might have withdrawn. Were there ever any signals, anything that would suggest that that might have been the case?
A. No, and the King, regrettably, did not have much support in the Arab world for that position. You recall the vote at the Arab summit. He certainly had no support for that position in the United Nations and as the United Nations moved towards Chapter 7. And I would simply remind people who hear that allegation that it isn't just the United States, it's the rest of the world.
But when we are invited by a friend to help defend it against aggression that has recently taken place and that it threatens to take place again, we're going to respond. And that's a good signal to send to friends around the world.
And I might say the request for support was not taken without reason. The Saudis were very much concerned, and let me just recite the history for the American people here.
He had said, Saddam Hussein had said, we're withdrawing. I believe it was on a Sunday. And they had a picture of one truck, people frantically waving goodbye to the beloved brothers in Kuwait as they went north. And at the same time, there was truckload after truckload of armor and mechanized equipment moving south.
Now we're not dumb when we see that. Nor are the Saudis. Nor are the other countries that are rejoicing, as Dick Cheney will tell you, in the fact that we moved. But I think it's important to keep reminding people of why the Saudis felt threatened and probably today still feel threatened.
 
Equipment for the Saudis
Q. Another sense of the enormity of this buildup, the reports have come during the Secretary's visit that the Saudis wanted -preparing to send them the most advanced fighters, the F-15E's. Is that, in fact, the case? And isn't there a political problem with that?
A. I will let Secretary Cheney address it himself to it. But the Saudis have been threatened. A neighboring country has been aggressed against. International law has condemned it. We should do all we can to help the Saudis arm themselves against aggression, and so he can talk 15E's or some other weapon system. I want to do everything I can, and I hope there would be no political problem because the world clearly sees that the Saudis have been strongly threatened, Charles.
Q. Prince Bandar is on his way into Moscow. King Hussein says he's going back to Baghdad. Is there a new stage of diplomacy that's beginning now?
A. There's a lot of activity, Ann, going on, a lot of diplomatic activity. I am continuing to conduct a good deal of it. Secretary Baker is. I mentioned his recent call with Shevardnadze. Other countries are reaching out to friends, trying to be sure that we all stay together on this. And indeed the Japanese, I might say, have a very big diplomatic initiative going now, and I must say once again that I think Prime Minister's Kaifu's willingness to help some of these countries that might be victimized by full enactment of the sanctions is very good. The Turks, as I've told you, have been heavily involved. I talked to Mr. Mitsotakis in Greece today, who's been cooperative. So there's an awful lot of diplomatic activity behind the scenes.
Q. And is it helping that King Hussein's going back to Baghdad?
A. I have no feelings about, I, no, there was no message or anything of that nature. As you remember there was a lot of speculation that the King was coming here bearing a message, and I can tell you unequivocally there was no request on my part for a message to go back other than one: our determination to stay joined up with others to see that this aggression is reversed and that the rightful rulers of Kuwait are returned.
 
Media Coverage in Saudi Arabia
Q. Mr. President, you mentioned return for the families here in the United States a few minutes ago. Traditionally, those families have been able to rely on open press coverage of young men and women who are sent into the breach, such as they've been now. Despite their earlier hospitality, the Saudis are now restricting press coverage and are saying that they will probably order foreign press out of the country, perhaps by the end of this week. Is there anything you can do to assure that Americans will have free, complete and open press coverage of their young men and women abroad?
A. We are the guests of Saudi Arabia in their country. I think Dick addressed himself to that question, because it has been discussed, and the more coverage the better as far as we're concerned. However, when people travel to countries like Iraq and countries of that nature, I hope the press coverage will be totally objective, just as it right here in this marvelous setting.
Q. Are you saying that we're at the total mercy of Saudi Arabia? That there's nothing we can do to insure -- A. No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying I'll let the Secretary address himself to this question. And I'm saying I hope the same tough questions are asked in every country as they are in this county. And I'm speaking of Iraq particularly.
 
Iraqi Use of Jordan's Port
Q. Is that criticism of press coverage, Mr. President?
A. Well, that's no criticism, Jim. I've learned long ago that you've got the loudest mike, and I just am standing here. So I'm not criticizing. Don't be so sensitive about it. American people know what the American people see. And so all I'm simply saying is, don't be sensitive. It's not a criticism; it is an objective statement. Yeah.
Q. Mr. President, why is Iraq still being allowed to receive supplies through Jordan?
A. I'm not sure they are. And I hope they're not. And very little is going into the Gulf of Aqaba these days. And so it is a question though, that if it is going in, it clearly violates not only the sanctions but what King Hussein told me.
Q. Mr. President, is it your understanding that it's been stopped? I mean, many of our colleagues at the border say -- A. Yeah, there's a difference of view on it, and I'm not sure I know the total facts on that, because we were discussing it a few minutes ago.
 
Possibility of Using Force
Q. Mr. President, when you made the announcement that you were sending U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia, you said their mission was not to kick the Iraqis out of Kuwait. Do you still rule out the use of U.S. military force to evict -- A. I don't rule in or rule out the use of military force. And I learned long ago not to tie one's self down by stating what I will or will not do in that regard.
These two last, and then I'll go peacefully, Marlin. One and two.
Q. Mr. President, we asked you last week if you saw any hope of a diplomatic solution. You said, ''I don't see it right now.'' Do these statements from Baghdad that they are willing to put their cards on the table increase the hopes there will be a diplomatic solution?
A. If they're willing to put all their cards on the table, that's good. I didn't hear that, but if they're willing to put them all out there, including complying with international law, that would be good. And in terms of readiness to talk, we've got a very able person there in Baghdad who is prepared to talk, and they came in the other day and said they'd like to talk. Well, here he is available to talk.
But please don't tell us that they're going to talk with conditions that are unacceptable under international law, because that is not, that's not the way it would work. The world community has made a strong statement, a very strong statement, and I don't sense any view in the world community that it is going to back away from that statement. And that statement included removal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait and the restoration of the rulers.
Yeah, Charles, last one.
 
Vacations and Prudence
Q. Mr. President, somebody's got to ask the tough question. You talked about conservation. Does that include Fidelity?
A. I'm going to keep using my boat. And I hope the rest of America will prudently recreate. I don't think we've reached the point where I want to call on everybody in the recreation industry to shut it down or everybody that's taking a vacation in America to shut it down.
It's not a tough question; it's a very fair question. And I would simply say that there's a lot of industry, a lot of people that have been looking forward to vacations in this country, and I would not suggest that the situation at home requires they stay at home now, or that they don't use their recreational facilities. Yeah? Q. We're not in any energy -- A. No, not now. We are not.
Q. In what condition are those 54 missing Americans? Have you been told? And is the number still 54?
A. I can't answer the question about the condition. And I, maybe Larry can expand on this later on. He says we don't know.
Thank you all very much. And now I will turn it over again with a vote of thanks to Dick Cheney and to Colin, who are doing a superb job and to both of whom the American people owe a strong vote of thanks, and people around the world, too. CHENEY. Thank you sir. A. All yours.
 
Saudis and F-15 Fighters
CHENEY: We'd be happy to entertain a question.
Q. Would you answer the F-15E question? What are the Saudis going to get? CHENEY: The instructions of the President have been asked to sort of do three things, defense. One is to deploy forces to deter aggression; secondly, be prepared to defend if deterrent should fail, and third is to look at how we can best enhance the indigenous defense capabilities of the forces in the region so that they can do more in the future for themselves. Part of that is to see that we deal with their emergency requirements, given the crisis they're now faced with and the large number of Iraqi forces on their border.
There has been a report that we plan to provide F-15E aircraft - for the uninitiated, that's the latest model of the F-15. It's basically, it's got both air-to-air and air-to-ground capability long range. We have not yet completed the buy for our own forces on the F-15E. So what's currently coming off the line will come to U.S. forces. What we have talked with the Saudis about is really a two-stage process. Stage one would be meeting their emergency requirements. Stage two would be a more comprehensive plan that dealt with the long term.
In terms of emergency requirements, we are looking at transferring to the Saudis from our own forces, our own inventory, a number of existing F-15's. They would not be the E model; they would be the C or D model basically designed for air-to-air combat, although they have some ground-attack capability as well.
The report that we're going to provide F-15E's immediately simply is invalid. That's the kind of thing we'd work in the longer-term package.
Q. Do they even need them? And don't you run into a problem with the Israelis if you give them?
CHENEY: Well, I think first of all that the situation in the Middle East and in the gulf region has changed dramatically. And the argument over the years has been that we wanted to help our friends in the region, including the Saudis, satisfy their legitimate security requirements. I would argue that a million-man Iraqi army, 160,000 to 200,000 Iraqi soldiers, a thousand Iraqi tanks poised on the northern border of Saudi Arabia is a legitimate security need. And that in light of that, it is appropriate for us to work with the Saudis within the confines of existing authority that the President has to see to it that we help meet their most urgent requirements, and then we will also work long term.
But I don't think this is a situation that presents any threat whatsoever to Israel, and I would not expect there to be any opposition in the quarter to our efforts to help the Saudis and our other friends in the region deal with what is a threat to their very existence.
 
Calling Up the Reserves
Q. Mr. Cheney, the order the President signed on the reserves was open-ended: it vests you with the authority to call them up. We're told that there'll be 40,000 called up by the end of August. Is that correct, and how many more will there be after that?
CHENEY: Well, the services are looking at, and working right now preparing their proposals. I've, working with the chairmen, asked them to scrub those proposals, and they'll be presented to me in detail tomorrow in a briefing scheduled at the Pentagon on a service-by-service basis by the service chiefs and the service secretaries. I expect that we will not use the full 200,000 authority that's in the statute that the President's authorized to call up. It will be considerably short of that, but it is important for us to move forward because many of these key requirements in special areas have for years been built into the reserves. We've always assumed the reserves would perform those missions, and we need to have those missions performed now in light of the deployment to the Middle East. Q. Is 40,000 the right ball park figure? CHENEY: I wouldn't want to put a figure on it at this point because I haven't reviewed the plans in detail. I would expect that the number will obviously increase the longer period of time goes by. But, again, I think the ultimate call-up will be significantly below the 200,000 that's there. And as soon as we've got some specific plans approved and we know which units are involved and we know how many people will be asked to come back for service, we'll be happy to make that public. It's just that we have not yet finalized the plans, and I'm reluctant to speculate on what the exact number is until I've personally reviewed and approved those plans.
Q. Mr. Secretary, on the F-15C's and D's, you said 'transfer.' Do you mean we're going to give those jets to the Saudis?
CHENEY: The Saudis would pay for them. But the point is, we take them out of existing inventories, not future procurement.
Q. But they will remain in Saudi Arabia once this operation is finished?
CHENEY: That's correct.
 
Limits on Flow of Information
Q. And on the press question, the President asked me to refer this question to you. CHENEY: I noticed that. Q. Will the American people be able to rely on free, open and complete press coverage of their American men and women deployed overseas, or are we going to be restricted?
CHENEY: Well, I suppose you get into a debate here over definition of terms and what you mean by free and unrestricted might be different than what the Saudis think is free and unrestricted. The fact of the matter is we are in their country at their request. They've asked us to come help defend their nation, as have many other countries.
They are a very traditional society. They've got certain standards and norms, certain ways of doing business. They're very private in their personal lives, and I think we have to respect their culture, just as they respect ours.
By the same token, I think it is important that we have an adequate flow of information to the American people about what our young men and women are doing in Saudi Arabia, and I'm hoping that we'll be able to arrange that.
I do not have the final authority over what kind of access the government of Saudi Arabia grants to our press. We have to date, I think, been able, working under difficult circumstances, to provide pretty good coverage. I think the pool system at the Pentagon worked to initiate that process. I know having been there the last few days myself that there are a lot of stories being filed out of Saudi Arabia. I think we'll work with the Government of Saudi Arabia to provide as much access as we can.
In the final analysis, they'll make the decision, but obviously we will be advocates for the concept that there should be significant coverage of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia available to the American people.
Q. You can understand the American people - if the Saudis asked us to come over there and help - and have the U.S. help protect them, and we're expending our blood, sweat and tears, that the American people would think that we should have open access to what is going on.
CHENEY: I'm, there may be a little bit of a difference, Jim, between what the American people think qualifies as open access and what the press thinks qualifies as open access. I don't want to get into that kind of debate, but the fact is that - I'll come back again to the proposition - we think that a good, steady flow of information about U.S. forces operations over there is an important part of the existing arrangement. We also think that we have to recognize and honor the request and the desires of the Saudi Government. And we'll do the best we can.
This affects not only the press. I mean there are other areas where our presence there forces, if you will, debate over different ways our two societies do business. Women play a very prominent role in our society; they play a very prominent role in our military. In Saudi society, a very different role. And having the two societies come together raises questions that have to be addressed, and we've done that successfully in a number of areas, and I'm confident we can do it with respect to the press as well.
 
Standard Chain of Command
Q. -- control or command of the American forces over there, would that also be the Saudis?
CHENEY: No. The way the process works is that under our constitutional principles the chain of command runs from the President to myself to General Powell to General Schwartzkopf is our sync in the area. And that constitutional principle is honored in our current arrangements.
It's also true though that we work very closely with the Saudis and that we coordinate very closely with them in terms of overall strategic guidance. We have parallel arrangements worked out between our forces and Saudi forces that our people on the ground have arrived at, and it seems to be working very smoothly. And this is not unusual. We do this in nations all over the world.
Q. On that point the President said there are armed forces from 22 countries involved in this operation. Has the issue been resolved in terms of command of this multinational force, particularly if combat were to occur?
CHENEY: I don't really have anything to add to what I've already offered: that is, to say that the Saudis obviously are the host for the operation. They've asked the rest of us to participate. And I'm confident that we will have adequate command arrangements to deal with whatever situation might arise.
Q. -- command at some point or are we going to have to waste a lot of time with units negotiated back and forth over who moves where.
CHENEY: We've not wasted a lot time now. We've moved very rapidly and very aggressively, and I'm satisfied with the current arrangements that we can do whatever we're called upon to do.
 
Reports of Missile Buildup
Q. General Powell, can you tell us anything about reports that there's a large buildup of missiles - SCUD missiles and the like -along the border of Saudi Arabia?
POWELL. I've seen those reports but I can't verify them or confirm that those large buildups are taking place.
Q. We well have, I would suspect, adequate intelligence to tell us that.
POWELL. I have adequate intelligence, and I think we have an extremely good picture of what the situation looks like on the ground north of the Kuwaiti-Saudi border, and without telling you how good that picture is, let me just say that I cannot confirm the reports you refer to.
Q. General, the President said we have sent a medium-size American city over there. The Pentagon talked about forces the size of Jefferson City. Without looking in our atlases, how many people do we have over there now?
POWELL. About the size of a medium-size American city. I'm not going to give the exact number of troops who are in-country. I think I will just rest on what we have been saying: that it's an adequate force that's being moved over there to accomplish the mission given to us by the President. And it has been a very impressive performance on the part of all the branches of the armed services for them to have delivered this force some 8,000 miles to the Saudi desert over a period of two weeks.
 
Size of American Buildup
Q. Are we no longer undermanned by the 160,000 or so Iraqis in Kuwait?
POWELL. I'm not trying to match them man for man.
Q. Are you satisfied, then, that the current force is sufficient to handle any contingency?
POWELL. Any contingency is a very broad statement, Jim, not - let me just say that the mission given to us was to deter initially and then be prepared to defend. And with each passing day I'm more and more confident of our ability to accomplish that mission.
Q. -- shadowing some of the tankers and freighters in the area under orders not just shadow and no longer fire across the bow?
POWELL. They are performing a mission given to them by the President, which was to perform those monitoring functions you described and we're just, we're tracking.
Q. General, how would you characterize the Iraqi deployment now? Offensive? Defensive?
POWELL. It's ambiguous, frankly. As the Secretary pointed out, there are 160,000 or more Iraqi soldiers north of the Saudi-Kuwait border. There's a large number of tanks. There are artillery formations there. There is some buildup. And when you see that kind of a force, you have to give it the capability of either defending or attacking.
And so I'm not prepared to say which one they are going to do. I always assume the worst in our planning. But I really can't ascribe an intent to Mr. Saddam Hussein, but it is a very capable force that does have the capability to go on the offense.
Q. Presumably ours has the same dual capability? POWELL. Excuse me. Q. What happens now?
POWELL. Half of the service secretaries and service chiefs brief Secretary of Defense tomorrow morning and get approval of their plans. Then the callups will begin. Selected units will be called up as they are needed and when they are needed. So you will not see a sudden rush, but individual units will be called up and told at what time to report to their mobilization station and whether or not they are going overseas or whether they will be used just to backfill for units who have left the United States.
Q. General, what about the mission? Are we clearly offensive now?
POWELL. Our mission there is to defend.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Religion and Politics Become Fused In Congressman's District, and Heart

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 22

 BODY:
Boston is one of those places where religion and politics sometimes merge to the point of being indistinguishable. Such was the case during one of Representative Joe Moakley's visits to the streets of the South Boston district that has been his base since he entered politics 37 years ago.
''Don't let those guys murder the priests and get away with it!'' one constituent shouted. ''Get those Jesuit killers!'' cried another. The reference was to Mr. Moakley's investigation into the killings of six Roman Catholic priests in El Salvador last November.
''It made me feel good,'' remembered Mr. Moakley, chairman of the House Rules Committee and a proud product of old-fashioned Democratic machine politics. ''It used to be there wasn't half a vote in the El Salvador issue. Then they killed the Jesuits.'' 
 
His Personal Crusade
The slayings are a personal crusade for Mr. Moakley. After criticizing the Bush Administration as not pushing the case, he turned up evidence strongly suggesting that top officers in the Salvadoran Army covered up the crime, and may even have ordered it. The Congressman then pushed through the House an amendment cutting United States military assistance to El Salvador in half. The Senate will take up the matter soon after the August recess.
In 10 years of Congressional protests to the policy of supporting the Salvadoran Government, no member has come closer to cutting aid to the country, which has received more than $4 billion in military and economic assistance over the last decade. To contain the damage, the Administration is scurrying to negotiate with Mr. Moakley, privately promising to accept cuts of 30 percent and to cooperate with his investigation.
Mr. Moakley's success is all the more remarkable because it is the work of a lawmaker who has never before taken a leadership role on any major foreign policy issue. Mr. Moakley's prior concentrations have been on issues like health care and labor causes.
Conservatives are not happy. Worried that Mr. Moakley's efforts could give a lift to the struggling guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, they express concern that Mr. Moakley is letting his strongly felt Roman Catholicism get in the way of a sensible anti-Communist policy. Similar criticism was directed at former House Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill, Mr. Moakley's close friend and golf partner, who said he took advice on policy toward El Salvador and Nicaragua from Maryknoll nuns who had worked in the region. A 'Sentimental' Approach? ''I think Joe, as Tip, is a good man who is somewhat sentimental in his approach to the clergy,'' said Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois.
Mr. Hyde commended Mr. Moakley for honesty and statesmanship but criticized him for embracing ''liberation theology,'' a leftist doctrine that says the church should side with the poor, which Mr. Hyde believes fails ''to draw the line at Marxist interpretation.''
Mr. Hyde added: ''The church has a myopic view of El Salvador. Ever since the murder of Archbishop Romero, they have not been friendly to the elected governments down there.''
Mr. Moakley does not disagree that religion drives his politics. He has long opposed abortion. In his office hangs a portrait of Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero, who was assassinated in 1980 in the San Salvador cathedral.
''When I was a kid growing up in parochial school,'' Mr. Moakley said, ''the current wisdom was: Hey, you're poor because God made you poor, and God loves poor people, and the poor shall inherit the Earth. That's no longer true.
''Today, they teach you you're only poor because you've got to pull yourself up by your bootstraps, you've got to educate yourself, you've got to unionize to get better wages, all the money shouldn't be in the hands of the few. I don't see anything wrong with that, to be honest with you.''
 
Stayed Close to Home
''I am a product of my environment,'' he said, as he toyed with a gold baseball ring given to him by the former Boston Red Sox star Carl Yastrzemski. ''I live in the same ward that I was born in 63 years ago. I grew up in South Boston politics, where the politician was the guy who put turkey on the table at Christmas if the husband was not working.''
His father was a truck driver. His two brothers became police officers. As a youth, Mr. Moakley dreamed of becoming a longshoreman, but while a sailor in the Navy during World War II he decided he needed a college education. He attended the University of Miami but did not graduate because ''I got sick of it.''
He returned to South Boston to become a state insurance auditor. He got sick of that, too, went into local politics and earned a law degree at night. He says his wife, Evelyn, the daughter of a Cambridge city public workers laborer, ''is just a housewife,'' adding, ''She tells me what we are going to eat and where we are going to go.'' He has few hobbies, aside from the statehouse politics he lives and breathes.
For 17 years, Mr. Moakley worked in the shadow of party leaders. He shied from publicity, and even refused to hire a press spokesman for his first 12 years in the House. ''There probably aren't many bills with my name on it,'' he acknowledged.
 
Affected by Suffering
Mr. Moakley first discovered the El Salvador issue in 1983, when during a meeting with constituents a group of Salvadoran refugees talked about the suffering in their country. ''They told me that some 50,000 to 60,000 noncombatants had been killed, how children were blown up by stepping on mines,'' he said. ''I just couldn't believe this was going on and this country had anything to do with it.''
He began working to allow Central American refugees to remain in the United States, and during Congressional hearings on the issue met two of the Jesuits who would later be slain, Dr. Ignacio Ellacuria and Dr. Segundo Montes. He concluded that the Reagan Administration had based its policies in Central America on all the wrong premises. ''The Salvadoran Army,'' he said, ''is only in place to save the country from their own people.''
Others had taken the lead in opposing United States policy toward El Salvador, but that all changed last November, when the guerrillas launched a large offensive. In response, a death squad invaded a college campus and executed the priests, their housekeeper and her daughter with high-powered rifles.
''I felt terrible,'' Mr. Moakley said. ''I figured here's a guy whose going right to hell, whoever did this thing. How can anybody in their right mind attack people representing God and do that to them?''
 
'Not Looking for Headlines'
Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington called Mr. Moakley to ask him to head a committee to investigate the killings. Mr. Moakley demurred. ''Why me?'' he recalled saying to Mr. Foley. ''If you put out an application list, you'd have 434 names on it, but not mine. He said, 'I know, that's why I chose you.' He knew I was not looking for headlines.''
John Sasso, manager of the 1988 Presidential campaign of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, put it another way: ''The reason why Joe Moakley is so effective is because his efforts are not coming from the left but from Mr. Lunch Bucket Democrat. When his blue-collar Irish and Italian constituency gets behind a move like this, you know it is going to be successful.''
In February, Mr. Moakley traveled to El Salvador, where he operated with the same plucky style he brings to the cloakrooms of the House. At first, the United States State Department wanted to put one of its own officials on his plane to supervise his activities, he said, but ''I said, 'No way.' I didn't want to look like Mickey the Dunce.''
 
Striking a Deal
He finally made a deal: He let a department representive come along but only after the department released answers to a list of questions Mr. Moakley had submitted two months before.
When the United States Embassy in San Salvador refused to release polygraph evidence taken from suspects in the killings and a letter written by an American major regarding a Salvadoran military cover-up, Mr. Moakley wangled them from sources he had cultivated within the Salvadoran Army.
In its preliminary report, released in April, Mr. Moakley's task force documented that the Salvadoran investigation was at a ''virtual standstill.'' The committee's findings included a report of a radio call from a meeting of the high command to a commander of the Salvadoran soldiers who allegedly killed the priests. Mr. Moakley concluded that the Army's high command was implicated in the case, and he has instructed his staff to keep investigating the radio call.
The task force returned to El Salvador in August, after which Mr. Moakley released a stinging indictment of the military. ''Salvadoran military officers,'' he said, ''have withheld evidence, destroyed evidence, falsified evidence and repeatedly perjured themselves in testimony before the judge.''
''You know what really bothers me?'' Mr. Moakley said in an interview. ''If some Speaker had organized a task force when Archbishop Romero was killed to challenge the Administration, the aid could have been cut a long time ago.''

CORRECTION-DATE: August 27, 1990, Monday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday headed Washington at Work, about Representative Joe Moakley, referred incorrectly in some copies to the late Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero of San Salvador. The Archbishop was not a leader of the Arena Party; the party was organized after he was assassinated in 1980 by a gunman who was later linked to a current party leader.

HEADLINE: 3 INCUMBENTS WIN IN WYOMING RACES

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CHEYENNE, Wyo., Aug. 22

 BODY:
Former Gov. Clifford P. Hansen's daughter won the Republican nomination for his old job in a primary on Tuesday. In November, she will face the Democratic incumbent, Mike Sullivan, who easily defeated his opponent, a motorcycle mechanic. 
With 96 percent of the votes counted today, Mr. Hansen's daughter, Mary Mead, a rancher, received more than twice as many as her opponent, State Representative Nyla Murphy.
Referring in her victory remarks to the Democrats' 16-year hold on the governor's office, she said, ''The people in Wyoming that I've talked to think it's time for a change.''
Mrs. Mead, who is 55 years old, had stressed her skills as a rancher and businesswoman and attacked Mr. Sullivan's economic development efforts.
Her father, also a Republican, was governor from 1963 to 1967 before moving on to the United States Senate. He retired in 1978.
Mr. Sullivan easily won nomination for a second term, receiving 88 percent of the vote against Ron Clingman, who had called for lowering the drinking age to 18 from 21.
 
Student Nominated for Senate
Senator Alan K. Simpson, the Republican whip, handily won nomination for a third term, receiving 84 percent of the vote. He will face Kathy Helling in the general election.
Ms. Helling, a 32-year-old college student who received 34 percent of the vote in a six-way Democratic race, said a strong grass-roots campaign and her stand against abortion would make her a formidable opponent.
Representative Craig Thomas, a Republican, had no opposition in his primary campaign for re-election. His Democratic opponent in November is Pete Maxfield, a law professor at the University of Wyoming. Like Mr. Thomas, Mr. Maxfield was unopposed in Tuesday's primary.

HEADLINE: Found: A New Treasure in the Gulf

 BODY:
President Bush's main goal in the Persian Gulf is to protect moderate Arab states threatened by attack or intimidation from Iraq. His policy has already achieved a brilliant success: A broad front of Arab states are standing up to Saddam Hussein's renegade regime.
That's a revolutionary development. But this brave new coalition remains tentative. If the U.S. were to heed the advice of those now urging pre-emptive military strikes against Iraq, the coalition could shatter, and with it America's standing among moderate Arabs for a generation. 
Wise American policy would build on the new Arab alliance. It offers a way to isolate and contain President Hussein with minimal bloodshed. And it also offers the best long-term approach to defending American interests in the gulf.
For decades, no Arab leader dared challenge the dogma that Arab unity meant unity against the West, especially against the United States. Cold war divisions once made it possible for Arab leaders like Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt to play off East against West. But the old doctrines make little sense in the world of the 1990's. And Iraq's brazen assault on an Arab neighbor buries the old ideology under the urgent need for self-defense.
Urged on by Mr. Bush's energetic diplomacy, Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's President, has rallied other Arabs around a new proposition: They must unite against any aggressor in their region, Arab or foreign, and cooperate with outside powers in a framework of collective security. The results have been astonishing. Twelve Arab League states have backed a resolution to defend Saudi Arabia with Arab troops. Egyptian and Moroccan contingents already stand beside Saudi Arabia's 65,000-member army. Syrian forces are pledged as well. The United Arab Emirates this week joined Saudi Arabia in giving the United States base rights.
Meanwhile, Baghdad grows ever more isolated. Even radical regimes like Libya now denounce Iraqi aggression and hostage-taking. Yemen, which had abstained in the original Security Council votes on sanctions, now says it will cooperate in their enforcement.
Saddam Hussein revealed himself as a clear threat to vital American interests only when he turned his might against the oil-producing Arab states of the Persian Gulf. His invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 raised the prospect of an Iraqi stranglehold on oil that could feed his growing appetite for advanced weapons and economic warfare.
The best defense against such threats is to give the gulf oil states political reinforcement. That means giving the highest priority to consolidating the new Arab alignment and reinforcing it with a broad international consensus on collective security operating through the United Nations.
Unilateral American military action may ultimately prove necessary, and President Bush was surely right in his news conference yesterday in refusing to rule it out. But for much of the Arab world to join the rest of the world in facing down Iraq is a political treasure to protect.

HEADLINE: South African Equality Begins With Education

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your upbeat editorial ''In South Africa: The Nightmare Ebbs'' (Aug. 8) is most encouraging. May I contribute to a dialogue by emphasizing that the nightmare in South Africa is not over. The phased release of political prisoners and the return of anti-Government exiles are part of the first easy steps. The hard bargaining on the hard questions of equal rights is still to come.
As you so rightly say, Nelson Mandela should press for, among other things, more jobs, better pay and opportunities in a country where 88 percent of the wealth is controlled by only 5 percent of the people.
To his credit, Mr. Mandela has consistently spoken out about the need to improve education for blacks.
Last March I led a group of 14 United States citizens to South Africa to survey the potential for Outward Bound programs in South Africa. One colleague participated in a protest march of more than 100,000 students from the townships of Alexandra and Soweto, outside Johannesburg. Fortunately, it was a peaceful march, although the police put up blockades at several intersections of the roadway.
The teachers were out on strike, but the students had grievances of their own: There are more than 100 students to each class. Ninety percent of the teachers are underqualified, and there was only one textbook for every five students. For every 100 rand the Government spends on each white student, it spends about 20 rand on each black student.
Jobs and economic opportunity begin with education. One of the most urgent needs in South Africa is a major effort to give blacks equal educational opportunity. When this happens, there will be cause for some celebration.

HEADLINE: Board of Estimate, Headed for Demise, Approves Flurry of Projects

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
The New York City Board of Estimate approved a flurry of disputed proposals early yesterday morning, including a plan by Columbia University to build a commercial biomedical laboratory at the site of the ballroom where Malcolm X was assassinated in 1965.
The unanimous vote came shortly after 1 A.M., almost a week after the board began its final meeting last Thursday. As in the past, the board hammered out its agreements in a series of private meetings, which began after noon on Tuesday, when the board reconvened after a weekend break. The public portion of the meeting resumed just before midnight Tuesday. 
Early yesterday, the board also approved extension of city streets into the site of the proposed $2.3 billion Hunters Point redevelopment, a complex of up to 6,000 apartments and 2 million square feet of commercial space planned for the East River waterfront in Long Island City, Queens. The board also approved zoning changes sought by developer Harry Macklowe that would allow him to build a 28-story office tower on West 33d Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues.
After voting on the Audubon Ballroom project, the board recessed until Monday morning, when it is to vote on the last item on its final agenda, a proposal for special permits for the United Parcel Service for a sorting center on Washington Street in SoHo. Under the new city charter approved last November, the board is to be dissolved on Aug. 31. Its powers are to be divided among the City Council, the mayor and various new agencies and boards.
 
A Test for Dinkins
The Audubon Ballroom was the most emotional issue taken up by the board as it went about the business of putting itself out of business. For different constituencies, the controversy had become a test for Mayor David N. Dinkins on everything from his policy on development to his racial loyalty.
In the compromise agreement on the ballroom at 165th Street and Broadway, the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, won a number of concessions from the Dinkins administration and the university, including more extensive preservation of the 1912 building's terra-cotta facade, the creation of a community health facility within the building and the establishment of community-based job-placement and training programs.
In return, Ms. Messinger agreed to drop her veto of $8.1 million in Port Authority funds that had been designated for the project.
''Malcolm X is widely remembered as a powerful leader of the African-American community throughout the world,'' Mr. Dinkins said of the agreement. ''The compromise we have reached will further his dream of economic justice while also creating a fitting memorial in his honor.''
The Dinkins administration and the university had contended that the proposed lab would help revitalize Washington Heights and would enable New York to remain competitive in high-technology medical research.
But opponents, including landmark preservationists, some local residents and members of a black nationalist group called Black Consciousness, had argued during a lengthy and passionate public hearing late Monday night and early Tuesday morning that the entire ballroom should be preserved.
Under the agreement, about 55 percent of the building will be preserved, including the ballroom, compared with 40 percent under the original proposal.
The $37.5 million project is the city's first foray into the field of biotechnology. It is expected to create 250 jobs during construction and 300 permanent jobs during the project's first phase.
Those involved in the negotiations said yesterday that the talks had not been about the relative merits of economic development versus historic preservation. Rather, they said, it was a matter of balancing those needs by quantifying the issues and fine-tuning some language.
''There was no one last issue,'' said Deputy Mayor Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero. ''It all sort of crystallized at the same time.''
 
'The Same Goals'
''The hardest issue for all of us was what to do with the money we have here,'' said Carl Weisbrod, the president of the city's Public Development Corporation, which is a partner in the project. ''We all had the same goals.''
Ms. Messinger said that while the center could not be viewed as solving all the problems in the neighborhood, it was a start.
In other action, the board on Tuesday cleared the way for the developer Peter S. Kalikow to demolish part of a tenement complex designated a landmark and then build a luxury tower. The site is the City and Suburban York Avenue Estates, on East 79th Street. Late Monday, the board voted to approve a condominium complex with 7,500 apartments on a two-mile stretch of beachfront in the Arverne section of Rockaway in Queens.

HEADLINE: 2 Held in Extortion of Paper Delivery Service

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Two key employees of a wholesale newspaper distributor were arrested yesterday on charges that they extorted $30,000 to assure speedy shipments of The New York Times to a newspaper home and business delivery service.
Federal prosecutors said the defendants stalled newspaper shipments to a company known as Mitchell's, the World's Finest Newspaper Delivery Service, to force the company to make the payoffs. 
The defendants, Leo D'Angelo and James McCreay, are named in a two-count indictment charging they conspired to extort money from the company through ''force, violence and fear, including fear of economic injury to Mitchell's.''
Both men pleaded not guilty at an arraignment before Judge Arthur D. Spatt of Federal District Court in Brooklyn. Judge Spatt set bail at $500,000 for Mr. D'Angelo and $250,000 for Mr. McCreay.
Both defendants are employed by Metropolitan News Company, a newspaper wholesale distributor located in Long Island City, Queens. Mr. D'Angelo, 57 years old, of East Northport, is a general foreman for Metropolitan and Mr. McCreay, 43, of Staten Island, is a driver and union shop steward.
Metropolitan, one of the largest newspaper distributors in the city, was not accused of any wrongdoing.
''The New York Times was aware of the investigation and supported it,'' said United States Attorney Andrew J. Maloney. Most copies of the newspaper in the metropolitan area reach dealers through independent wholesalers.
The owner of Mitchell's ''was threatened with physical harm, if he didn't agree to pay,'' said Assistant United States Attorney Leo Laufer.

THE OIL JOLT
 
The price of oil topped $31 a barrel, the highest price since November 1985, when the oil markets were still recovering from the Iranian revolution five years earlier. The current Middle East crisis has now raised prices higher than they were when Iran and Iraq were trying to sink each other's tankers. [Page A1.] 
 
A militant group of oil producers led by Algeria, Libya and Iran has blocked a renewed attempt by Saudi Arabia and Venezuela to convene an emergency OPEC meeting to try to stabilize soaring oil prices. The move creates a deep rift within OPEC as it faces its most severe crisis in 30 years. [D6.]
 
MARKETS
 
Stock prices tumbled late in the day in the wake of the surprising rise in crude oil futures. For much of the day, the market treaded water, but by the close, the Dow had slid 43.81 points, to 2,560.15, its lowest level in nine months. [D1.]
 
The Japanese stock market plunged again early today. And as the Tokyo stock market goes through its second major downturn this year, the seemingly invulnerable Japanese commercial banks and securities brokers appear likely to suffer their steepest profit declines in years and a possible slowdown in their headlong overseas expansion, analysts and economists say. [D1.] In Tokyo today, continued concerns about the Middle East caused the Nikkei stock index to fall nearly 6 percent by midafternoon today, to a point about 39 percent below its high for the year. Meanwhile, in Europe yesterday, stock markets stabilized after suffering heavy losses on Tuesday, and in some cases posted big gains. [D8.]
 
Long-term interest rates rose to their highest levels in nearly four months and Treasury bond prices fell sharply. In addition to worrying about inflation and possible war, the prospect of sharply higher Federal budget deficits weighed on the credit market. [D17.]
 
The dollar continued to weaken as the foreign exchange markets remained nervous. Gold prices were mixed. [D18.]
 
A growing supply of pork and a break in cash market prices combined to send hog futures prices skidding. [D18.]
 
THE ECONOMY
 
The storm at New England banks is growing more ominous. Problems with loans to real estate developers that emerged about a year ago have mounted, causing losses that threaten insolvency for many banks and savings institutions. [D1.]
 
COMPANIES
 
The U.S. is allowing Control Data to sell the Soviet Union six mainframe computers. The move is a significant policy relaxation. The machines will be used for analyzing safety factors in civilian nuclear power reactors. [D1.]
 
Crossland Savings said Federal regulators had turned down its plan for a financial revamping and had imposed limits on its lending in the future. Crossland has been hard hit by the downturn in the New York real estate market. [D1.]
 
Disciplinary charges against Stotler have been filed by the S.E.C. and the C.F.T.C. The collapsed futures trading firm is charged with hiding its financial difficulties. [D2.]
 
National Intergroup said it would entertain proposals for the sale of its Foxmeyer drug distribution subsidiary. [D4.]
 
TODAY'S COLUMNS
 
Chrysler's 1987 acquisition of American Motors gave Chrysler the Jeep line and A.M.C.'s share of the U.S. vehicle market. But Chrysler bought some headaches as well. Talking Deals. [D2.]
 
In stocks, the real carnage is in the over-the-counter market. Investors describe the activity of recent weeks as the worst since the October 1987 crash. Market Place. [D8.]

HEADLINE: Control Data Allowed to Sell 6 Computers to Soviet Union

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
In a significant policy relaxation, the United States Government is allowing the Control Data Corporation to sell six mainframe computers to the Soviet Union. The machines, which are considered mid-size mainframes and not supercomputers, will be used for analyzing safety factors in civilian nuclear power reactors. They would be the fastest yet sold to the Soviets.
The export license, which was announced yesterday by Control Data, was approved by the Commerce Department on Monday. The machines will cost the Soviets $32 million, the company said. 
The deal is the first large sale of high-performance computers to the Soviet Union by an American corporation since a June agreement that ended most trade restrictions with the former Soviet bloc. The accord was reached by the 17 nations of the technology watchdog group known as the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom.
The license is likely to be the first in a range of new agreements between American companies and the Soviet Union, aimed at supporting issues that are of importance to the United States Government.
On his visit to the United States in June, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union visited the Minneapolis-based computer maker and was given a demonstration of the machine, the Cyber 960.
''This is the first approval of a significant level of computing power to the Soviet Union,'' said Jim O'Connell, Control Data's director of international trade policy. ''There's an important symbol here. The U.S. Government is indicating in this approval that it is going to support U.S.-Soviet high-tech cooperation in certain areas that are deemed to be of global concern.''
He said other technology agreements could be expected in areas like environmental protection, petroleum exploration and industrial modernization.
''The American establishment has realized that this technology already exists in the Soviet Union,'' said Esther Dyson, a computer industry analyst in New York who publishes Release 1.0, an industry newsletter. ''It has become a financial question instead of a political one.''
People who have argued for strict controls on technology sales to the Soviets said yesterday that the sale was a reasonable one for the purposes involved.
''These computers don't pose any threat,'' said Steven D. Bryen, a former Pentagon official who was responsible for export control policy. ''But before we do any broad release of technology, we ought to make certain that the Soviets have made the changes that they have promised.''
Mr. O'Connell said Control Data had begun the process of attempting to gain an export license in November 1989. In June, restrictions were lifted dramatically after the Cocom countries met in Paris and dropped most technology export limits.
 
Machine Restrictions
Before the June meeting, computers with a performance figure above 75 were restricted. The figure means that the machine would be able to transfer data at 75 million bits of information a second - or the equivalent of about eight large novels.
This level of restriction led to the control of most computers, including most personal computers.
Since June, the 75 figure has been replaced by a three-tier structure. Computers with a performance rating of up to 275 can be freely sold under general-export licenses. The sale of machines rated up to 550 can be sold based on national discretion. Machines rated 550 to 1,000 still require Cocom export approval.
Mr. O'Connell said Control Data's Cyber 960 computer, which the Soviets are buying, has a rating of 435, but since the licensing process had begun before the June Cocom meeting, the application had gone through the United States Government interagency approval process.
The sale required a special agreement between the American and Soviet Governments, he said. The agreement creates a special safeguard program to regulate the use of the computers. The program, known as the nuclear safety technology cooperation agreement, was completed at the end of June.

HEADLINE: Bank Woes Climbing in Northeast

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The storm at New England banks is growing more ominous.
Problems with loans to real estate developers that emerged about a year ago have mounted, causing losses that threaten insolvency for many banks and savings institutions in the region. Nonperforming loans at New England banks nearly doubled, to 4.3 percent of their assets on June 30 from 2.23 percent a year ago, according to SNL Securities, a financial data firm of Charlottesville, Va.
New England now has a far higher percentage of nonperforming loans than any other region; the national average is 2.49 percent. The increases in problem loans are similar at savings institutions in the region. 
 
New Office to Address Problems
The recent failures of four banks in Massachusetts and the prospect of more have led the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to make plans to open a new office outside Boston. The office, with a staff of 450, will handle the myriad problems that emerge once bank examiners determine that a bank should be closed.
''There is clearly the potential for many more bank failures in New England over the next 12 to 18 months,'' said Gerard S. Cassidy, an analyst specializing in the region's banks at Tucker, Anthony & R. L. Day, a securities firm in New York.
New England relies heavily on oil for home heating and electricity generation, and recent increases in oil prices caused by turmoil in the Middle East will reduce the amount of money available for other kinds of spending and limit the region's economic growth, analysts expect.
 
Effect of Higher Oil Prices
''Given the region's real estate problems, the potential for failure was here without price increases in oil,'' Mr. Cassidy said. ''With higher oil prices, the outlook for the New England economy becomes more grim.''
Many of the troubled loans are to developers who have too many vacancies in their office buildings, condominiums and other projects because of the weakening New England economy. As higher oil prices hurt the economy further, it will take even longer for the region to absorb the glut of real estate projects.
''Things are still very bad and are probably going to stay that way for the foreseeable future,'' said Charles A. Shorter, senior vice president in the New York office of the Real Estate Research Corporation, a Chicago firm. Mr. Shorter estimated that as more projects were completed, vacancy rates would rise for residential properties and office buildings.
The rate of bank failures in New England has been low for the last few years. Two banks failed in 1988, four in 1989 and four so far this year.
But there are strong signals that the financial condition of many other banks is precarious, according to data compiled by Veribanc Inc., a Wakefield, Mass., bank-rating firm.
In Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire, there were 23 banks whose losses in the first quarter, if continued at the same pace, could wipe out capital in less than a year, or whose capital was less than 3 percent of assets.
 
Capital Is a Cushion
The level of the capital of a bank and its earnings are critical guides to its financial strength and are used by Veribanc to predict which banks are most likely to fail. A bank's capital serves as a cushion to absorb losses and many healthy banks have capital of 5 percent or more.
A rise in failures among New England banks was foreshadowed earlier this month by L. William Seidman, the F.D.I.C. chairman, who said the Bank Insurance Fund was likely to lose $2 billion in 1990, not break even as he had predicted earlier this year. To rebuild the fund, which exceeded $13 billion at the end of 1989, Mr. Seidman has proposed a 30 percent increase in the premiums banks pay for deposit insurance.
Although Mr. Seidman did not say where additional bank failures would occur, many analysts have been expecting a rise in New England.
They noted that the collapse of many Texas banks did not take place until more than two years after their real estate problems emerged.
 
'Many More Problems'
A staff of 450 at the new Boston office of the F.D.I.C. ''suggests they know of many more problems to come among smaller firms, or else they are anticipating the collapse of a very large institution,'' said Warren Heller, Veribanc's research director.
''Up till now, liquidations in that area had been handled out of the New York or South Brunswick offices,'' said Joseph Palladino, head of the liquidation division in the F.D.I.C.'s New York office. The agency has 16 liquidation offices around the country to sell the loans, real estate and other assets of the more than 500 banks that have failed since the end of 1987.
Recent announcements from many of the largest banks in New England have shown that the problems that began coming to the surface in late 1988 and caused large losses in 1989 are worsening.
At the Bank of New England Corporation, which reported a second-quarter loss of $33.3 million, troubles with bad real estate loans continue to grow. Even a large increase in reserves for loan losses that caused the company to lose $1.1 billion in 1989 and wiped out most of its capital has not proved enough to cover the company's bad loans.
In the second quarter, the Bank of New England added $28 million to its reserve for loan losses and increased by $31 million the real estate it holds from defaulted loans. It also shifted $110 million in loans to ''nonperforming'' status, meaning they are delinquent or face such serious trouble that the bank can not rely on continued payments.
Lawrence K. Fish, the chairman of the Bank of New England, said the deterioration was ''not unexpected because of the continued sluggishness in the region's economy'' and the ''softness of the real estate market.''
 
Failure Is Feared
The Bank of New England is a candidate for failure because of its losses and the low level of capital available to absorb additional losses, Mr. Heller said.
The Fleet/Norstar Financial Group of Providence, R.I., a financially healthy banking company and the second largest in New England, returned to profitability in the second quarter after a first-quarter loss, but nevertheless reported increases in its problem loans. Nonperforming loans rose by nearly 16 percent, to $756 million, on June 30, from $653 million at the end of March, and holdings of foreclosed real estate rose by $16 million, to $291 million.
Many of the banks hit hardest in New England are savings banks that have historically concentrated on home loans, much like the separately regulated savings and loan associations more common in the South and West. Deposits at many savings banks are insured by the F.D.I.C., meaning that the cost of their failure is borne by the bank insurance fund, which remains solvent.
Savings banks that have failed or been taken over by regulators this year include the Home Owners Savings Bank of Burlington, Mass., with $2.8 billion in deposits, and the Eliot Savings Bank of Boston, with $420 million in deposits.
The closing of savings institions whose deposits were previously insured by the insolvent Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, now the Savings Association Insurance Fund, is the job of the Resolution Trust Corporation. So far this year that agency has taken over five savings institutions in New England.

HEADLINE: Japan Stocks Plunge; Finance Sector Ailing

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, Aug. 23

 BODY:
The sharp slide in the Tokyo stock market accelerated today after a heavy selloff yesterday.
With this continuation of the second major downturn in the market here this year, the seemingly invulnerable Japanese commercial banks and securities brokers appear likely to suffer their steepest profit declines in years and a possible slowdown in their headlong overseas expansion, analysts and economists here are saying.
In Tokyo today, the closely watched Nikkei index, which fell 4.1 percent yesterday, plunged an additional 1,473.28 points, or nearly 6 percent, to close at 23,737.63. [Page D8.] The ripples that the tumbling market has sent through the financial system in response to the Persian Gulf crisis - and that it could continue to send for months - are demonstrating anew the dependence of Japanese banks, which hold huge stock portfolios, and brokerage houses, which rely on commissions from trading, on rising share prices for their financial health. 
When the market was raging ahead in recent years, it was a locomotive for the whole financial system. But as it tumbles, the market is turning into a millstone around these institutions' necks.
At least initially, the market's troubles will affect Japan's financial concerns much more than they will affect the country's industry. Japanese industrial companies have grown so wealthy over the last few years that they have generally not needed to raise large sums of capital from the market to finance expansion of their plants or moves into new businesses.
In time, however, a prolonged slide would cut into the assets of these companies and make it more difficult for them to get bank loans, raise capital or even make overseas acquisitions.
Likewise, the decline of the stock market is unlikely to have a direct impact on the purchases of United States Treasury securities by the Japanese, who have been principal underwriters of the United States budget deficit. But analysts say that if the decline persists it could eventually give the Japanese less fire power for acquiring assets in the United States or elsewhere.
''Nobody wants to believe this will continue for a year, or two or three years, but in my opinion it will be very hard to get confidence back after being hit twice in just a few months,'' said Toshio Mori, executive vice president of the Tokyo Securities Company. ''I'm afraid 1988 and 1989 were too good to be true.''
At one time, some in the financial community here would have expected the powerful Finance Ministry to step in and, behind the scenes, take steps to stabilize the market. But with the advent of deregulation, the ministry has fewer tools for doing so and has given no indications that it intends to intervene.
 
Calls for Program Trading Halt
There have been calls from some Japanese securities houses, however, to limit or halt program trading, which some blame for the volatility. There are no signs yet that action will be taken, but the issue could be particularly divisive, since American securities firms here are the principal practitioners of this trading technique, which involves using stock index futures.
For the securities industry, what is worse than the market's slide is the drop-off in the volume of trading. Every trade, even in a falling market, generates commissions for brokers. But volume has withered to less than 300 million shares on many recent days, a third of last year's daily average, as investors sat on the sidelines amid the uncertainties.
''In Japan, brokerage houses are much more dependent on commissions than Wall Street firms,'' Mr. Mori added. ''Thus, the magnitude of the problems when the market falls like this is much greater for us.'' 63% Drop in Profits Forecast Robert Zielinski, a financial analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities here, has forecast a stunning 63 percent decline in the operating profit this year for the 25 Japanese securities houses whose shares are listed.
The Nomura Securities Company, the largest brokerage in the world and this country's most profitable company two years ago, is expected to post a steep 45 percent decline in operating profits this year, Mr. Zielinski estimated.
Nonetheless, the damage to the nation's banks will be greater, he and others said.
''The Japanese banks live off the stock market and share price levels more than some people realize,'' Mr. Zielinski said. ''They were the biggest beneficiaries of the price rises before, and now that has all ended.''
 
Less Dependence on Oil
Economists say that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent embargo on oil imports from the two countries have not hit Japan's powerfully expanding economy hard because Japan has spent the last decade easing its heavy dependence on Middle Eastern oil.
But the attack could not have come at a worse time for the financial system. The market had plunged in February, March and April after interest rates here spurted upward. But in early July, it started to emerge from a long convalescence.
The fragile confidence in the market was therefore shattered when the tanks rolled across Kuwait's borders earlier this month, creating worries about inflation here and a possible recession in the United States.
Interest rates spiked upward, stock prices tumbled and stock-related business evaporated. The market for new issues of securities, the source of immense sums of new capital over the last few years, has been all but closed down. During the second quarter of this year, new issues of securities totaled about $275 million a month, compared with about $3.7 billion a month the year earlier. Now, there will be even less.
 
Effect on Psychology
''Frankly speaking, I don't think we can expect a return to the kind of trading volumes that we had in previous years,'' said Takatoshi Okuyama, an investment executive at Daiwa Securities. ''The psychology of investors has really been affected.''
There are no signs of huge insolvencies, like those that hit America's savings and loans, or other serious problems. Indeed, analysts say profits will still be relatively high even after the big declines that are expected. But the recent difficulties are a sign that Japanese institutions are not impervious to the kinds of jolts that have afflicted their American competitors.
Some of the fallout seems frivolous at first glance. Fortune magazine estimates that the market's slide has decreased the number of paper billionaires in Japan to 8, from 12 a year ago. But that is a telling omen, pointing to how deeply all Japanese institutions sitting on huge portfolios of paper wealth have been hurt.
 
Banks Have Huge Portfolios
Among the largest of these institutions are commercial banks. Japanese banks are permitted to own up to 5 percent of the stock in industrial companies, and the largest banks have portfolios worth tens of billions of dollars.
Analysts estimate that nearly half of the earnings of Japan's largest dozen banks over the last several years have come from sales of this stock. In addition, the banks have been able to count a portion of the value of these vast holdings as capital.
That system gave the Japanese banks huge and fast-growing capital bases when the market was rocketing higher. In turn, it permitted them to expand their lending at home and overseas at a break-neck pace, giving them a huge competitive advantage over American and European banks.
Stuart Matthews, an analyst at Barclays de Zoette Wedd, a brokerage house here, has forecast that the so-called city banks, the 13 leading commercial banks, will suffer a 20 percent decline in what he called their underlying operating profits, to 1.285 trillion yen, from 1.595 trillion yen in fiscal 1989, which ended on March 31 of this year.
 
Fall in Capital Positions
''Securities companies are generally in a better position to withstand a collapse in profits because their expenses naturally decline faster,'' Mr. Matthews said. ''They don't have the same expense problems.''
Under international banking guidelines, commercial banks as of 1993 will have to maintain capital equal to 8 percent or more of their total assets. Japanese banks were already well over the minimum last year. But the market slide has sliced billions of dollars off the value of their stock holdings, and that drop has sent their capital ratios tumbling.
Jardine Fleming estimates that of Japan's 15 largest banks, only 3 are above the 8 percent limit now, compared with 11 at the beginning of this year. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, the largest in the world; Mitsubishi Bank; Bank of Tokyo, and the Industrial Bank of Japan, to name a few, all fall below the minimum now, according to these estimates.
 
Cuts in U.S. Seen as Likely
The answer for these banks would normally be to raise capital by selling securities - an avenue that has been shut off. As a result, they must consider slowing growth in their least-profitable businesses. And in the last few years, that has been their international operations, in particular the United States. Japanese banks were heavy lenders to a number of large leveraged buyouts, many of which have run into trouble.
A recent article in a financial newspaper here estimated that Japanese banks might have to write off as much as $4 billion of such American loans. The article went on to make a subtle comparison between lending in the United States with lending in troubled developing nations.
''It's true; given their capital restraints they will have to think about cutting back on their less profitable businesses,'' a senior Finance Ministry official said. ''And that is most likely on the international side. They might consider slowing or even curtailing those businesses.''

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall Again as Oil Surges

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stock prices tumbled late yesterday in the wake of a surprising $2.51-a-barrel rise in crude oil futures.
For much of the day, the market treaded water, as no major new developments had emerged in the Persian Gulf crisis. At 2 P.M., the Dow Jones industrial average had fallen barely 19 points.
But by the 4 P.M. close, the Dow had slid 43.81 points, to 2,560.15 - its lowest level in nine months - after sinking 52 points the day before. 
 
Sharp Two-Day Loss
As a result, the blue-chip market indicator has lost nearly 100 points in just two days.
While the Dow has been making headlines, even more damage has taken place in the over-the-counter market. The Dow has lost 14.7 percent since July 16, but the Nasdaq composite index has fallen 20.2 percent. Yesterday, the Nasdaq index fell 4.84 points, to 374.84, its lowest level in 20 months. [Market Place, page D8.] In yesterday's market selloff, ''crude oil was the culprit,'' said Peter G. Grennan, head of stock-index futures trading for Shearson Lehman Brothers.
Until close to 2:30, he said, the price of crude was around $30.15 a barrel, up $1.44, and ''trending lower.''
But almost immediately after President Bush's news conference ended, he said, the price jumped an additional $1.07, to $31.22.
 
Behind Bush's Remarks
Traders said they had interpreted remarks by the President as meaning that he would not rule out the use of force to settle the crisis.
''Bush came across as very firm, in control of the situation, and doesn't want to back down,'' Mr. Grennan said.
But what is good for oil prices is bad for the stock market.
''Any escalation would move it down,'' said Kenneth P. Ducey, senior vice president of the investment house of S. G. Warburg & Company.
With the deadly combination of a weakening economy and a deepening crisis weighing ominously on the market, investors continued to be troubled by the preponderance of new lows and declining issues over new highs and advancing issues.
Declines outnumbered advances yesterday, 1,190 to 379, with 328 stocks setting new lows and only 7 hitting new highs.
For the second day, the nation's most widely held stock - A.T.& T. -touched a new low of 32, subsequently closing at 32 1/8, down 3/4. Others setting new lows included Hewlett-Packard, the technology company; AMR, the owner of American Airlines, and Fannie Mae, which buys and then resells mortages.
Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled a strong 175.6 million shares, down from 194.6 million the day before. Activity was buoyed by heavy program trading, investors seeking bargains and speculators scrambling early in the day to buy back stock they had sold short.
 
Pessimistic Mood
Mr. Grennan described the market's mood as pessimistic.
He said that early in the day traders had thought the market would rally because it was ''oversold,'' that prices had sunk too low.
''The market stabilized for a few hours in the middle of the day,'' he said, ''then began to move higher, but the rally was aborted by the oil rise. When it crossed $2, that was it. Then the market started selling off.''
During the President's news conference at Kennebunkport, Me., a reporter asked in part of the Iraqis, ''Do you still rule out the use of U.S. military forces to evict . . .?''
Not waiting to hear the rest of the sentence, President Bush responded: ''I don't rule in or rule out the use of military force. And I learned long ago not to tie one's self down by stating what I will or will not do in that regard.''
Oil prices jumped immediately, Mr. Grennan said. He added that cash prices subsequently rose an additional 50 cents a barrel after the futures market had closed for the day.
 
Program Traders Are Active
Professional stock traders again dominated most of the day's activity.
Program traders - who use computers to spot price differences between, say, the 500 stocks in the Standard & Poor's index and futures on the S.&P. index - clipped nearly 50 points off the Dow, Birinyi Associates said. A 14-minute selling program starting at 3:02, or 30 minutes after the President's news conference ended, toppled the Dow almost 19 points by itself.
Mr. Ducey of Warburg said investors who had sold stock short, hoping to buy it back later for less money, had given up by the middle of the day when prices failed to break and bought back the stock anyway. Bargain hunters were also heavily in the market, he said.
''When they got through,'' he said, ''the market came down again.''
Trading on Monday had been marked by wild rumors, later denied, that an American plane had been shot down, touching off sentiment that a shooting war could break out soon. With Wall Street prepared for the worst, some even thought that war might come in 48 hours. The spiraling rise in oil prices in the wake of President Bush's tough talk seemed to give stock traders little comfort.
With one eye on the crisis and the other on the economy, traders said nothing new had emerged from the Federal Open Market Committee, which reviewed monetary policy over the last two days. Many traders argued that lower interest rates might be a big help right now, although the deepening Middle East situation made that prospect much more difficult to assess.
 
Declines Among the Blue Chips
Many blue-chip stocks fell yesterday. 3M fell 2 1/8, to 79 1/8; Procter & Gamble 1 7/8, to 74 1/8; Eastman Kodak 1 1/4, to 39; Coca-Cola 1 7/8, to 39 1/2; Boeing 1 1/8, to 45, and Merck 2 3/4, to 78 1/2.
Oil stocks, which have already had a strong run-up, were mixed. ARCO rose 1, to 138 3/8. Gold shares, always a recession haven, rose slightly. ASA gained 1 1/4, to 54 1/2.
Paramount Communications rose 2 3/4, to 36 5/8, on renewed takeover talk. And Raytheon, the military supplier, rose 1 3/8, to 63 7/8.
In over-the-counter trading, Nike, the athletic shoe producer, slid 5 3/8, to 62. Alice Ruth of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco downgraded the stock because of recessionary trends that could hurt sales. Fred Anschel of Dean Witter Reynolds in New York recommended the stock as ''quite cheap.''
The S.& P. 500-stock index fell 5.31 points, to 316.55, while the New York Stock Exchange index dropped 2.72 points, to 174.22. And the American Stock Exchange's market-value index slipped 2.95 points, to 324.39.

HEADLINE: Merc May Trade in Rubles

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 22

 BODY:
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said today that it was working with Soviet officials and economists to develop futures and options markets for the ruble.
''As the Soviets dismantle their past economic system of rigid controls and move toward a market driven economy, it is imperative that their monetary unit become an accepted world currency,'' said Leo Melamed, executive committee chairman of the Merc, where trading of foreign currency futures had its inception in 1972. 
Mr. Melamed, considered a pioneer in currency futures, said he expected the exchange to begin trading in the ruble late in 1991.
''The big question is how fast the Russians move to convertibility,'' he said. ''It hinges on that.''
Western economists say the ruble cannot become truly convertible to other currencies until the Soviet Union establishes a market pricing system for all its goods and allows free cross-border trade.
They also say it is not possible to have a convertible currency in a controlled market.
Also, the currency does not circulate outside the Soviet Union. Over the years, Soviet businesses wanting to trade with Western companies have had to trade rubles with the Soviet Government for Western currencies. While the situation has loosened somewhat in recent years, the rate of exchange is still set by Soviet officials.

HEADLINE: Attempt to Set OPEC Meeting Fails

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JIDDA, Saudi Arabia, Aug. 22

 BODY:
A militant group of oil producers led by Algeria, Libya and Iran has blocked a renewed attempt by Saudi Arabia and Venezuela to convene an emergency meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to try to stablize soaring oil prices.
The move creates a deep rift within OPEC as it faces its most severe crisis in 30 years. The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 interrupted the flow of four million barrels of oil a day from the two countries, and prices for OPEC crude have since surged to around $28 a barrel here, the highest level in at least five years.
This latest OPEC disagreement comes as oil markets are beginning to experience serious shortages of some refined products. Many oil experts expect the situation to worsen and prices to rise further over the next two months. 
 
Saudis to Curtail Shipments
Saudi Arabia notified many customers today that it would not be able to deliver large quantities of jet kerosene, gasoline and gas oil, because in the event of military action against Iraq the fuels would be needed by its own armed forces and the American forces in Saudi Arabia.
The OPEC dispute splits the organization into two camps: price hawks who argue for higher oil prices and the Saudi-Venezuelan group, which insists that OPEC must raise output immediately to push down prices and ease the strains that short supplies are causing for both third would countries and the industrialized nations.
Trying to ease the friction, Sadek Boussena, Algeria's oil minister and the OPEC conference president, suggested today that all 13 members of OPEC meet informally in Vienna on Sunday without a mandate to make a decision, OPEC officials said.
Saudi Arabian and Venezuelan officials indicated, however, that they would hold a separate meeting by Sunday with the other OPEC members who favor immediate increases in output.
 
Saudi Official's Reaction
''The unwillingness of some OPEC members to meet just to look into what we should do to alleviate the shortage of oil and the pressure on prices is incomprehensible, given the fact that we have called many emergency meetings over situations that were far less serious,'' said the Saudi oil minister, Hisham M. Nazer, in an interview here.
Saudi and Venezuelan officials said they had hoped that a decision to increase production could be arrived at under ''an OPEC umbrella'' to preserve the organization's cohesiveness, but the failure to do so will not delay an increase in output for more than a few days.
''We wanted to avoid triggering a free-for-all because this is not going to be a matter of short duration,'' said a senior Venezuelan OPEC delegate who spoke on condition that he not be identified. He added that ''now we will coordinate our action with Saudi Arabia and those others who want to join us because it would be irresponsible not to step in now and dampen the price rise in such a crucial time.''
The official noted that failure to act now ''will affect OPEC's credibility as a reliable supplier of oil and as a responsible economic organization.''
 
Shortages Are Dobuted
But Iranian and Algerian oil industry sources maintain that there is no real shortage of oil and that the Western oil companies should use up the large stocks of oil they have on hand to ease the crisis.
These officials also say that the Saudis and the Venezuelans made no move to restrict output when oil prices sank to $14 a barrel in May and they maintain that the present increase is compensation for the revenue lost then.
''If the Saudis are once again undertaking to check the increase in oil prices, the oil-producing countries will stand against such plans and neutralize them,'' the Iranian press agency, Irna, quoted the daily Joumhouri Islami newspaper of Teheran as having said in an editorial today.
There are six OPEC members favoring a meeting, but that is one short of a majority of the 13-member organization. The six nations are Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Ecuador and Kuwait. (Representatives of the pre-invasion Government of Kuwait are still recognized by all the OPEC members, except Iraq.) Iraq, Iran and Libya have staunchly opposed a meeting that would try to raise output. Indonesia, Algeria, Nigeria and Gabon have said they see no need for a meeting now but want consultations to continue.
Oil experts said OPEC's procrastination in agreeing on a course of action, coupled with the certainty that some OPEC members will raise output anyway, had made the group's deliberations irrelevant to world oil markets.
Over the weekend, Mr. Nazer of Saudi Arabia served notice that his country would raise production by two million barrels a day ''very, very soon,'' with or without OPEC approval. On Monday the President of Venezuela issued a similar statement.
Today Mr. Nazer said: ''We are not going to let bureaucratic maneuvering delay a decision. We are talking about three or four days at the most.''
 
Pressures for Conservation
Oil experts said the actions by the OPEC faction that favors higher prices might push industrialized nations to step up efforts for energy conservation and to intensify the search for alternative energy sources.
John H. Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation of New York, said that OPEC had already damaged its image as a reliable partner in world economic development. ''After four years of projecting the image of moderation, a number of OPEC members are clearly adopting a pro-Iraqi stand, opposing a meeting and favoring much higher prices,'' Mr. Lichtblau said. ''This will be remembered.'' One senior Arab oil executive commented that even if OPEC did meet now it would project an image of political conflict that is overwhelming economic common sense.
''You will have a country like Iraq, which invaded Iran 10 years ago, sitting there days after it gobbled up Kuwait, another major OPEC producer,'' the executive said. ''It will be a mess.''
Evidence is mounting that a production free-for-all has already begun among OPEC members.
 
Iran Output Said to Rise
Oil industry sources here and in London said Iran was pumping some 3.3 million to 3.5 million barrels of oil a day - significantly above its OPEC quota of 3.1 million barrels a day -and that Iran was signing contracts with Japanese clients to supply additional oil starting in September to replace Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil.
The United Arab Emirates has begun to produce more than its quota of 1.5 million barrels a day, oil industry sources say. And, Nigeria, which has expressed opposition to higher output by others, is itself producing at least 100,000 barrels a day above its quota of 1.6 million barrels a day.
Saudi oil executives said that while they were intent on increasing output, the consuming nations must also act.
''Everyone should help out in this crisis, including the Americans with their strategic reserves and the Japanese and the Europeans with theirs,'' said a Saudi oil executive who insisted on not being identified. ''It is important that the crisis be eliminated, so consumers do not suffer. With proper administration the shortage can be handled.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Long-Term Rates Climb Sharply

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates rose to their highest levels in nearly four months yesterday and Treasury bond prices fell sharply, pushed by a sharp rise in oil prices and heightened fears that war may soon break out in the Persian Gulf.
''The market is trading on raw nerves,'' said John P. Costas, director of the taxable fixed-income department at the First Boston Corporation. ''People are very skittish.'' In addition to worrying about the inflationary implications of higher oil prices and the possible outbreak of fighting in the Middle East - a development many traders said could happen this week - the prospect of sharply higher Federal budget deficits also weighed on the credit market yesterday. 
''There is a growing consensus in the market that there will be an utter disregard for the Gramm-Rudman budget targets,'' said Richard L. Sandor, president of IndoSuez International Capital Markets, a subsidiary of Banque IndoSuez.
Through the first 10 months of the 1990 fiscal year the deficit stands at just under $190 billion, and seems certain to rise above $200 billion for the first time since 1986.
Earlier this week the White House projected that the shortfall in the coming 1991 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, will rise to $232 billion unless an agreement on a deficit reduction plan is reached.
 
Gramm-Rudman Targets
Before the Persian Gulf crisis, representatives from Congress and the Bush Administration had been talking about a $50 billion package of budget cuts and tax increases to bring the deficit in line with Gramm-Rudman targets.
But with the economy apparently on the verge of recession and the cost of financing military operations in the Middle East rising daily, far bigger cuts may be necessary. As a result, resolve to deal with the deficit is probably melting, private analysts said.
All of those factors helped to push the price of Treasury securities down sharply, but the drop ''didn't feel like a blowout,'' Mr. Sandor said, ''because it was so orderly.''
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 96 30/32, down a full point, or $10 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, to yield 9.04 percent, up from 8.93 percent late Tuesday. It is the highest yield on the benchmark issue since late April.
Treasury note issues also got pounded, as it became increasingly apparent to traders that the Federal Reserve Board is not likely to ease short-term interest rates soon.
In late trading, the 10-year 8 3/4 percent notes were offered at 98 26/32, down 21/32, to yield 8.93 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at 99 15/32, down 13/32, to yield 8.79 percent.
Late in the afternoon the Treasury announced that next Tuesday it will sell $11.5 billion of new two-year notes and $8.5 billion of five-year, two-month notes on Aug. 29.
In when-issued trading following the announcement, the two-year notes were offered at a price to yield 8.24 percent. The five-year notes were offered at a price to yield 8.60 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates rose modestly.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.57 percent, up one basis point, or hundreth of a point. Six-month bill rates rose by four basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.50 percent.
Since Aug. 2, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, long-term bond yields have risen by 56 basis points. Analysts said that while a 9 percent yield could attract retail investors into the market, interest rates could easily go higher.
''If we don't get a speedy conclusion to the crisis, there is no upper limit on where bond yields could go,'' said Nancy J. Kimelman, chief economist at Technical Data, a Boston-based bond market advisory service.
 
Fixed-Income Market Prices
Prices in other fixed-income markets also fell sharply yesterday, largely in sympathy with the decline in Treasuries.
Traders in the investment-grade corporate bond market said that prices of most actively quoted issues fell by 3/4 point. Meanwhile, municipal bond participants said that prices of most tax-exempt issues fell by 1 point to 1 1/4 points.
Among the tax-exempt issues priced yesterday was a $205 million offering from the New York City Transit Authority.
The issue, which is insured by Financial Security Assurance, consists of two term bonds maturing in 2020 and 2021 and serial bonds with maturities from 1993 to 2004.
Yields on the serial bonds range from 6.40 percent in 1993 to 7.35 percent in 2004.
Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. acted as lead manager for the negotiated underwriting, which is rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Weakens Further And Gold Prices Are Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar continued to weaken yesterday as the foreign exchange markets remained nervous about events in the Persian Gulf. Gold prices were mixed.
Analysts said the United States currency fluctuated in a narrow range as traders awaited new developments from the Middle East. 
Earl Johnson, an assistant vice president at the Harris Trust and Company in Chicago, said the dollar had some support from fears that war would break out, but lost ground on continuing concerns about the slowing United States economy.
''It's basically a nervous market,'' he said.
Investors were reluctant to make major moves in any direction, Mr. Johnson said.
Overseas dealers said traders continued to buy currencies of nations where interest rates were expected to remain high. The markets believed United States rates would be eased to prevent a recession, analysts said.
The British pound, one of the currencies supported by high rates, continued to climb against the dollar. Sterling rose to $1.9235 in New York from late Tuesday's $1.9113. In earlier London trading, the pound rose to $1.9275 from $1.9215.
The dollar fell to 146.15 Japanese yen in New York, from 146.80 yen late Tuesday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar closed at 146.92 yen, up 0.37 yen from Tuesday, and the dollar was quoted at 145.85 yen in late London trading.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.5575 German marks, down from 1.5645; 1.2775 Swiss francs, down from 1.2900; 5.2390 French francs, down from 5.2635, and 1.13535 Canadian dollars, down from 1.13985.
The dollar did manage to post a slight gain against the Italian lira, rising to 1,162.25 lire in New York, from 1,161.75 late Tuesday. In Europe earlier, the dollar rose to 1,159.00 lire from 1,155.75.
Gold prices were higher in New York after falling in Europe.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, a troy ounce of gold rose $3.60, to $411, while the Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $412.50, up $5.60 from Tuesday.
Overseas dealers said fluctuations in the price of gold reflected the market's nervousness over the gulf.
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $410.25 a troy ounce, from $413.25 late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid of $410.25, from $414.75 late Tuesday.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.24 to close at a bid of $408.69.
Silver rose on the Commodity Exchange, picking up 3.8 cents to close at $5.129 a troy ounce. In London earlier, silver fell to a late bid price of $5.15 a troy ounce from late Tuesday's $5.20.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
BAGHDAD WARNS DIPLOMATS AGAINST 'ACT OF AGGRESSION'; HUSSEIN SHOWS OFF HOSTAGES

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., Friday, Aug. 24

 BODY:
Iraq warned the United States and more than two dozen other nations Thursday that if they challenged a deadline today and tried to keep their embassies in Iraq-occupied Kuwait open, as they have vowed to do, Baghdad would take it as an ''act of aggression.''
Ambassador W. Nathaniel Howell 3d and fewer than a dozen aides remained in the American Embassy early today. Indications here Thursday night were that any Iraqi effort to shut down the United States Embassy or those of other nations would not trigger an immediate response by the American military, as long as no attempt was made to harm or kill the American citizens who remain inside.
The Bush Administration appears to have concluded that the Iraqis are preparing to cut off water, power and telephone lines to the embassies. But the Iraqis are seen as unlikely to take any other overt military action to invade the buildings, which are considered sovereign territory of the nations involved. 
 
Uncertainty on Deadline
American officials said they were uncertain about the exact deadline imposed by the Iraqis for closing embassies in Kuwait. Some accounts gave it as noon today (5 A.M. Eastern standard time), while others gave it as 8 P.M. today, or 1 P.M. EST.
But the impression here Thursday night was that the United States and other countries believed that diplomats in Kuwait could only hold out for a matter of days under such circumstances.
The ''red lines'' set by the Bush Administration as intolerable Iraqi action that could prompt a military response were more extreme: the killing of American citizens, an Iraqi military attack on Saudi Arabia or its oilfields, or an attack by Iraqi forces on Israel - a possibility that may be the one most feared by Mr. Bush, according to indications here Thursday night.
There were also indications that the Administration was moving toward a decision in the next day or two to start boarding or disabling Iraqi oil tankers.
 
Soviet Influence
The Administration is said to have been delaying such action primarily at the urging of the Soviet Union, which is concerned about the fate of 5,000 to 8,000 of its citizens living in Iraq. Moscow also is said to have argued that there is a glimmer of hope that Iraq might back down in the face of international sanctions, basing that contention on a visit to the Soviet Union this week by the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq, Sadun Hammadi.
While the Administration has not addressed the issue of how Mr. Bush intends to weigh the lives of American hostages against the potential need for military action, the impression here is that Mr. Bush would use force if he believes it is unavoidable - even if that might endanger the lives of Americans and other foreigners.
Mr. Bush has almost said as much himself, declaring that while American lives are important to him, the United Nations sanctions imposed against Iraq after the invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 must be enforced.
''I think any decision maker in the United States or in any of these countries is concerned about the lives of innocent civilians, innocent people,'' Mr. Bush said Wednesday at a news conference here. ''And so, you weigh that very thoroughly against your actions. Having said that, international law in this case, the Chapter 7 sanctions, must be enforced.''
A convoy carrying more than 100 people from the United States Embassy - diplomats, dependents and the entire Marine guard detachment -crossed from Kuwait into Iraq on Thursday, leaving behind Ambassador Howell and fewer than a dozen aides. A senior White House official said, ''A few Marine guards aren't going to fight off the entire Iraqi Army.''
The diplomats who stayed behind risked being taken hostage, for Baghdad has said that envoys who remain in Kuwait after the deadline will lose diplomatic status.
Only India and Lebanon, among major nations, acceded to Iraqi orders to close their embassies. There were unofficial reports that the Philippines would also do so. But like the United States, most countries evacuated most of their staffs; Britain left only four diplomats in place, including Ambassador Michael Weston.
Suggesting that a showdown could be near, European officials said they had been told that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq would surround the embassies with troops. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney warned that this would be a mistake. A Belgian official said all of the European Community ambassadors might assemble in one place ''to make their expulsion as dramatic as possible.''
The Pentagon said Thursday that as many as 49,703 servicemen and women could be involved in the first two rounds of a limited reserve callup, 10,000 more than officials had said on Wednesday. Britain announced the dispatch of a second 12-plane squadron of Tornado attack aircraft, American minesweepers were dispatched to join the Persian Gulf flotilla and a United States military unit, the 7th Medical Command, was sent from Germany to Saudi Arabia. No Breakthrough at U.N. In another military development, officials said that American sailors had already boarded about a half-dozen merchant ships suspected of violating the United Nations embargo on Iraqi commerce.
Washington's effort to win explicit United Nations support for the naval blockade it has been leading yielded some progress as representatives of the five permanent members of the Security Council - the United States, France, Britain, China and the Soviet Union - sent a draft resolution to their Governments for review. Diplomats said France and Britain had accepted the wording of the proposal, but that Soviet objections had not yet been resolved.
Mr. Bush said in the news conference on Wednesday that he was willing to wait only a little longer for United Nations action before ordering American ships to use force to halt vessels that violate the sanctions.
As the Middle East crisis entered its fourth week, Iraq continued to move foreigners from Kuwait to Baghdad and its environs. Poles returning home reported that about three dozen Americans were taken last Friday to the Chemadex chemical plant at Al Qaim in western Iraq, where the Eastern Europeans had been working. American experts said the plant produces phosphorus fertilizers, not chemical weapons.
 
Outrage at Iraqi Broadcast
American officials, reportedly including Mr. Bush, were outraged by an Iraqi television broadcast on Thursday in which an avuncular President Hussein met with a number of hostages, playfully ruffling a small boy's hair. Most of the captives seemed to be British.
The broadcast seemed to be an attempt by Mr. Hussein, who has been denounced in the West as a bully, to demonstrate his benevolence toward individuals while signaling that an American attack on Iraq would inevitably cost the lives of Western women and children.
Richard A. Boucher, a State Department spokesman, denounced the broadcast as ''shameful theatrics.'' The British Foreign Office assailed it as a ''repulsive charade.''
Baghdad radio reported Thursday night that the Iraqi leader had authorized the release of a 15-year-old British youth who was separated from his family during the crisis. The broadcast gave his name as Alex Cameron Farni, but The Associated Press said that officials at the British Foreign Office in London later identified him as Alex Barnett. A spokesman for British Airways quoted by the news agency said the boy was traveling to the Gulf region from London without his family when his plane was stranded in Kuwait.
 
Elite Iraqi Troop Movements
The State Department said it had counted 56 Americans who were in the hands of the Iraqis - 41 seized in Iraq and 15 in Kuwait. Mr. Bush declared earlier this week that the 2,500 non-official Americans in Kuwait and the 530 in Iraq must now be considered hostages.
In Tokyo, the Japanese Foreign Ministry said that 178 Japanese had been flown in three groups to Baghdad from the Japanese Embassy in Kuwait, where they had taken refuge. Another group of 62 was reportedly following. Shortly before the movements, Japan announced its intention to help reimburse countries that supported United Nations sanctions against Iraq at considerable cost to their own domestic economies.
Two Under Secretaries of the United Nations met on Thursday with nine hostages at an undisclosed location about an hour's drive from Baghdad, a spokesman for the organization said.
The nationalities of the nine captives, men between the ages of 17 and 63, were not given. The United Nations Under Secretaries, Virenda Dayal and Kofi Annan, arrived in Iraq on Tuesday to seek the release of some of the thousands of foreigners, including 21,000 Westerners estimated to be trapped by the conflict.
A Pentagon official said Thursday night that there were signs that Iraq was pulling back elements of the elite Presidential Guard, the vanguard of the force that invaded Kuwait, from the Saudi border and replacing them with ''second stringers.''
 
Concern Over Soviet Advisers
The official said it was unclear why the guard units were pulling back. He suggested that Mr. Hussein may not want to entrench his elite fighters along the front lines, or that the Iraqi President fears coup attempts from within his ranks and needs the guard's help.
Jordan, which announced on Wednesday that it was closing its border with Iraq to all refugees, left it open for another day Thursday. At least 30,000 more refugees poured through the Ruweishid border crossing as King Hussein of Jordan embarked on another peace-seeking mission to Arab capitals, starting with a trip to the Sudan.
Although Mr. Bush praised Soviet cooperation in American efforts as ''superb'' on Wednesday, United States officials said they were troubled by the presence of almost 200 Soviet military advisers in Iraq. Mr. Boucher said the Administration strongly believed ''that it is inappropriate to provide any form of military assistance to Iraq.''
The Soviet Union's reluctance to have the United Nations promptly endorse a blockade also irritated policy makers here.
 
'Mounting Toward a Peak'
Still, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, Yuri Gremitskykh, pleased Washington with his comment Thursday that ''Iraq should change drastically the policy which it is pursuing now.'' He added, ''Baghdad has lost much, politically and morally, in the eyes of world public opinion by its illegal and inhumane actions against citizens of third countries.''
In Israel, which is separated from Iraq by an increasingly shaky Jordan, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir warned that the crisis was ''mounting toward a peak,'' and a civil-defense official urged citizens to stock up on food, tape their windows shut and mix a homemade antidote in anticipation of Iraqi use of poison gas.
But in Washington, military officers said the Bush Administration had canceled an earlier alert issued to two United States-based Ranger battalions, in the belief that their involvement would feed speculation about a commando-type thrust by American forces into Iraq or Kuwait.
Representative Dante B. Fascell, the Florida Democrat who heads the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called on the President to tell Congress in a joint session when lawmakers return in two weeks exactly what his intentions are in the Persian Gulf. Among other things, he said he wanted to know how the enormous military undertaking would be financed and whether other countries were ready to pay a share of costs.

HEADLINE: U.S. STOCKS PLUNGE ON HEAVY SELLING OVER CRISIS IN GULF

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stock prices plunged yesterday for the third day, falling to their lowest level in 13 months on growing concern over the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
The market, as measured by the Dow Jones industrial average, fell 76.73 points, or 3 percent, to 2,483.42. It has now lost 173 points, or more than 6 percent of its value, since Monday.
In Tokyo today, though, stocks turned up after taking a beating recently. The Nikkei index, which had lost 10 percent in the last two days, rose 428.13, or 1.8 percent, to close at 24,165.76. 
The plunge in the United States came as oil prices continued to rise amid bellicose talk in the Iraq-United States standoff. Crude oil for October delivery rose 71 cents, to $31.93 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. [Page D1.] Pace of Selling Picks Up An added disturbing note is that until yesterday the sharp fall in stock prices had taken place on relatively low volume, as many institutional investors shied away from trading. But that seems to be changing. Stanley Shopkorn, chief stock trader for Salomon Brothers, said, ''We're seeing an increase in institutional sell orders today for the first time.''
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange rose to more than 250 million shares, the heaviest since the day after the 190-point plunge in October 1989.
''There's a lot of panic out there,'' a leading money manager remarked. ''It may be over, but there's still a lot that could happen.''
Speaking of the day-after-day drop in the market, one trader said: ''This is like water torture, You can live through it, but it's certainly not pleasant. When you're in the midst of a bear trend, it can be excruciating. It wears you down.''
The Dow is now at its lowest level since July 6, 1989. Just over a month ago, on July 16, the average stood just shy of the 3,000 level, but has plummeted 17 percent since then. It has fallen 13 percent just in the three weeks since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
Smaller stocks performed even worse yesterday. The Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter issues fell 14.62 points, or 3.9 percent, to 360.22, its lowest level since Feb. 22, 1988.
Some traders said the situation in the Persian Gulf seemed far too fluid to do much more than to pull money out of the market. In addition, some said a growing number of individual investors were facing margin calls, which meant they were being asked to put up more cash for the stocks they had bought on credit.
''Everybody seems to be anticipating that war is going to break out by Monday,'' said E. E. Geduld, president of Herzog, Heine, Geduld, a brokerage firm dealing in over-the-counter stocks.
 
'Ultimate Pessimism'
In Boston, Robert G. Freedman, the chief portfolio manager for the John Hancock mutual funds, described the mood of the market as ''ultimate pessimism, extreme nervousness.''
''It seems like people are throwing out money just to get into cash,'' he said. ''It's panic selling.''
Since the Dow peaked in July, worries over corporate profits and a possible recession have been intensified by the Middle East crisis and the soaring price of oil.
Shares of oil companies had been strong, but even they fell yesterday. Texaco dropped $3.625, to $60.125, with more than a million shares changing hands. Chevron fell $3, to $75.625, and Exxon was off $1.75, to $49.625.
Expressing an opinion that seemed to be fairly widespread, Mr. Freedman said that while a lot of stocks had fallen to levels that were attractive, ''We're not doing anything.''
 
Keeping Their Cash
Noting that Hancock's mutual funds ordinarily would have all of their money in the market, Mr. Freedman said that the funds currently have $42 million, or 14 percent of their money, in cash. ''We're not panicking,'' he added. ''We're holding cash and starting to look at opportunities to buy some extremely discounted stock.''
He said he would ''probably start buying'' stock again when the Dow falls to around 2,450, which would mean that it would have to drop another 33 points. If the current trend continues, that might be very soon.
The selling began at the opening bell yesterday, following selloffs in other stock markets around the world. In Japan, the Nikkei average fell 5.8 percent yesterday.
By 9:54 A.M., less than 30 minutes after trading began, the Dow had tumbled more than 50 points, prompting the New York Stock Exchange to invoke a rule that makes index arbitrage trading virtually impossible. In such trades, investors sell stocks and buy stock index futures. With the Dow down more than 50 points all day, the rule stayed in effect throughout the session.
Index arbitrage is a form of program trading, which has been severely criticized for past market declines. But it seems to have played only a minor role in this week's drop. Birinyi Associates, a research firm, concluded that program trading probably had a net effect yesterday of raising prices slightly from where they otherwise would have been.
 
Losses Were Widespread
Every stock market indicator fell to the lowest level in at least a year. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 9.49 points, or 3 percent, to 307.06, its lowest since May 11, 1989. The New York Stock Exchange index fell 5.34 points, or 3.07 percent, to 168.88, its lowest mark since April 13, 1989. The American Stock Exchange market-value index was off 8.54 points, or 2.63 percent, to 315.85, the lowest close since Jan. 12, 1989.
Showing the bearish mood that investors were in, 1,640 stocks declined and only 157 advanced in Big Board trading. No common stock on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday rose as much as $1, with the largest gain being 87.5 cents for Nuevo Energy, which finished at $9.625.
While only one issue hit a new high - an Alabama Power preferred stock - 707 hit new lows, including General Electric, American Telephone and Telegraph, General Motors, Citicorp and Toys ''R'' Us. That was the highest number of new lows for any session since the 1987 stock market crash. The number of stocks falling in price was also the highest for any session since then.
Many stocks are now so low that companies are beginning to think about buying back some of their own shares. The latest to announce repurchases were Intel, the high-technology company, and Fannie Mae, which buys and sells mortgages. Intel, which is traded in the over-the-counter market, rose $1.125, to $33.25, but Fannie Mae, traded on the Big Board, fell to a new low of $24.875 before rising to $26.625, down 12.5 cents.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 27, 1990, Monday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article on Friday about the performance of the stock market misstated the ranking of the New York Stock Exchange volume on Thursday.
The total of 250.4 million shares traded was the third-heaviest volume, not the heaviest, since the day after the 190-point plunge in October 1989.

HEADLINE: In Europe, Ambiance Costs $10

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 23

 BODY:
It's one thing to hand over an unfamiliar bill or a few strange coins after a pleasant hour at a Paris sidewalk cafe. It's quite a different thing to find that you've just spent $10 for a Coke and sandwich and a touch of ambiance.
''Don't think in dollars if you want to enjoy yourself,'' wily world travelers advise. But that is just what American tourists have been doing throughout Western Europe this summer. And the results have insured that their vacations will never be forgotten. 
''People used to talk about the rich Americans coming to Europe and buying everything in sight,'' said Brent Morris of Boulder, Colo., as he and his wife looked at shop windows in Vienna. ''Now we can't buy a thing. Everything is more expensive, even McDonald's.''
The explanation is quite simple. The dollar is considerably weaker against Western European currencies than it was last year. In fact, the dollar has fallen to its lowest level against the West German mark since the currency was created in 1948, setting a new low today.
Nonetheless, many American tourists come psychologically unprepared. ''Eight years ago, prices were just the opposite,'' recalled George Lamartiniere, who was visiting Paris from Alabama. ''This time we had to give up going to Rome and Florence and stayed with friends in Grenoble to economize.''
 
Sneakers for $65 in London
Marcia Burros, who is from Washington, said she was going about London on foot to save money. But then she looked down at her toes sticking out of her sneakers. ''Do you know sneakers cost $65 here?'' she said. ''How do the Britishers do it?''
From clothes to gasoline, meals to hotels, prices are now higher in Western Europe than in the United States. And often the little things hurt most. ''I had to listen to my wife complaining all morning about the price of one coffee, one orange juice and one croissant,'' Charles Reilly from McLean, Va., lamented as he wandered around Paris.
Some tourists, caught short of cash or traveler's checks, lean on their credit cards, determined not to ruin their vacations. But many admit to taking buses rather than taxis, to skipping lunch in favor of a good dinner and even to forgoing presents for the family. ''I can buy the same thing cheaper back home,'' a New Yorker in Vienna said.
 
Despite Costs, They Keep Coming
Surprisingly, though, Americans have not stopped coming. During the first three months of 1990, the number of Americans entering Italy rose by 4 percent over last year. Swiss officials anticipate a 5 percent increase in American visitors this year. France's tourist promotion agency also reported 10 percent more Americans with Paris as their destination this year. Yet much of the increase may have happened before the dollar really began to fall in June.
With rare exceptions, Americans have been replaced by Japanese - although the yen is also weak in Europe - and Italians as the big spenders in many European capitals. But whether in search of culture, good food or family roots, millions of Americans continue to be drawn to Europe, principally Britain, France and Italy.
Once here, though, many this year are spending as much time looking at price tags as at the sights. And those who visit more than one country become experts: taxis are cheaper in Madrid than in Rome;, meals are cheaper in Brussels than in Oslo, and the sales tax in Paris is one to watch out for.
 
Eastern Europe Is a Bargain
Those who travel first in Eastern Europe and then come here are in for a bigger shock than if they had come directly from New York. ''We came in from Czechoslovakia and the price of everything more than doubled,'' Mark Gallagher, a teacher from Manheim, Pa., noted after arriving in West Berlin. ''There a soft drink cost 15 cents. Here it costs $1.20.'' Since the economic unification of the two Germanys last month, however, East Germany is no longer a bargain. Scott Gordon from Boston paid the equivalent of $17 for a night at a youth hostel in East Berlin, and he thought the rate a bit high. At the other end of the scale, a double room at the legendary Ritz in Paris costs $590 a night.
In theory, with most major European currencies except the British pound following each other, prices should not vary much within the region. But frequently they do. A Coca-Cola costs the equivalent of $1.25 in Berlin and $3 in Rome, a medium-priced dinner for two without drinks costs $70 in Geneva and $130 in Rome, a medium-priced hotel costs $80 in Vienna and $160 in Rome.
 
'We're All Feeling the Pinch'
Indeed, By most accounts, Rome prices are hard to top. Sherri McFarran, from Lexington, Ky., said Italians had not heard that Americans are no longer rich. ''I was insulted by a taxi driver because I turned down his service for a bus,'' she said. ''Shopkeepers insist on hyping prices, not realizing that, with the dollar so low, we're all feeling the pinch.''
Mexite Begiri, visiting Rome from Worcester, Mass., said she found Italy much more expensive than Germany and the Netherlands. ''Food is twice as high as back home,'' she said. ''Take pizza. For $3 or $4, you get a full 10-inch pan in the States. Here you get a strip and it isn't as tasty.''
Her husband, Agim, added his experience. ''Gasoline must be five times higher here than in the U.S., and highway tolls are outrageous,'' he said. ''The trip from Bari to Rome cost me $33 when it would have cost me $18 to go from Boston to Toronto.'' The latter trip is nearly twice as long.
If not five times more, gasoline prices in Europe are more than triple what Americans pay at home. Recent averages in the United States for a gallon of unleaded was $1.21 for self-service and $1.42 for unleaded, according to Runzheimer International, a Chicago-based company that tracks travel costs.
In London last Friday, gasoline was about $4.89 for an American gallon. In Paris, it cost $4.03; in Rome, $4.98.
 
Spain No Longer a Bargain
Spain, which for many years was a penny pincher's paradise, is rapidly catching up with the prices elsewhere in Europe, and the dollar has done its bit. Five years ago, one dollar produced twice as many pesetas as today. ''I bought a pair of Levi's in New York for $20,'' said Patricia Lopez-Calleja, a young Spaniard who now lives in New York. ''Here it would cost me four times as much.''
Young people backpacking with crumpled copies of ''Europe on $25 a Day'' find they have to improvise to make ends meet. ''We had to sleep on radiator vents on the streets because the hotels in Paris are so expensive,'' recounted Brian Pagnella, a 19-year-old from Bowling Green, Miss. ''At least those vents have hot air blowing out.''

HEADLINE: Kohl Hails 'Day of Joy' for Reuniting Germans

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: BONN, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, a champion of German unification, basked in his triumph today with East Germany's decision to accede to the West on Oct. 3.
''Today is a day of joy for all Germans,'' he said in an address to a special session of the Parliament.
''Wednesday, Oct. 3, will be the day of reunification,'' said a beaming Mr. Kohl, who was often interrupted by applause from the parliamentarians and a delegation from the East German Parliament. ''It will be a great day in the history of our people.'' 
East Berlin's Parliament had voted in the early hours today to join West Germany in six weeks, less than a year after the breaching in November of the Berlin wall that symbolized the collapse of the Communist regime in East Berlin.
 
Week of Political Upheaval
The rush to decide on a date for formal reunification followed a week of political upheaval in East Germany's ruling coalition.
Unity was first planned to coincide with all-German elections Dec. 2. But East Germany's economy deteriorated so rapidly after it fused with West Germany's on July 1 that calls grew for Bonn to take full control through quick political union.
In his address to the West German Parliament, which later ratified a treaty setting the rules for December's election, Mr. Kohl said the unification was without precedent in recent European history.
''It is happening without war, without bloody revolution or violence and with the full agreement of our friends, partners and neighbors in West and East,'' he said.
Mr. Kohl thanked a long list of Germany's friends for helping make the dream of unity a reality after 40 years of division. First came the three Western World War II powers - the United States, Britain and France - ''who for decades have insured our security.''
''I name in particular our American friends and foremost President Bush who has proved himself to be a true friend of the Germans in the past months,'' Mr. Kohl said.
The French President, Francois Mitterrand, also came in for praise for supporting unification, which Mr. Kohl also said would have been impossible without the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
''Through his reform policies and the new thinking in Soviet foreign policy the fundamental change in Germany and in Europe has been made possible,'' Mr. Kohl said.
He also thanked the people and leaders of other Eastern European countries, especially Hungary, whose decision to let East Germans cross its borders to the West last summer led to an exodus and sparked East Germany's peaceful revolution.
 
The 'Inhuman Border'
Turning to the dark days of the cold war, when the superpowers stared at each other across the German divide, Mr. Kohl said unification had been achieved through blood and suffering.
Thousands of Germans died in the immediate post-war years and an estimated 75,000 were imprisoned by East Germany's former Stalinist leaders for political reasons, he said.
He also remembered the nearly 200 East Germans killed for trying to flee to the West across what he called the ''inhuman border'' that divided the two Germanys. Mr. Kohl's opponent for chancellor in December's election, Oskar Lafontaine, said the decision on the date for unification ended an unbearable tug-of-war over the timetable for the event.
''Now we must do all we can to steady the situation in East Germany and fight the ever-worsening economic crisis,'' said the Social Democratic leader in a statement.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
Shrinking Supplies of Food Evident in Iraq, Reports Say

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
While the American-led military buildup in Saudi Arabia continues, another weapon, the withholding of food for Iraq under the United Nations trade embargo, is beginning to cause hardship, a variety of reports from officials of Western governments and food experts say.
The Iraqi leadership is struggling to cope with shrinking supplies and an abrupt cutoff of imported food that, until the crisis, was fulfilling three-quarters of the country's nutritional needs. Eggs, sugar, cooking oil, fruits and vegetables have disappeared from store shelves in Baghdad or are in short supply, according to reports from the Iraqi capital that were confirmed by American Government officials.
Food imports from Jordan, the only neighboring state not to have fully committed to barring trade with Iraq, have not kept up with Iraqi consumption. And even these supplies may be dwindling as ships with Iraqi-bound cargos are being discouraged by United States Navy vessels from entering the Jordanian port of Aqaba, said a State Department official who spoke on condition that he not be identified. ''The clear impression is that they are running down their food supplies,'' he said. 
One possible source of food for Iraq is Iran, which President Saddam Hussein of Iraq is wooing by returning lands occupied in their eight-year war and by releasing Iranian prisoners. But Iran has so far shown no interest in actively helping Iraq, and in any case, routes between the countries are not adequate to support the large food shipments Iraq needs, grain industry experts say.
Mr. Hussein has exhorted his people to eat less, threatening to limit the food that foreign residents receive and announcing that merchants who hoard supplies will be sentenced to death.
 
'I Think They Can Make It'
But it remains unclear how quickly the pressure of the embargo will mount and at what point it might induce the Iraqi government to come to terms with those blocking its supplies. ''I don't think hunger is going to make the regime capitulate,'' said Daniel Pipes, the director of the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia. ''Unless we start bombing bridges and factories, there will be hardship but I think they can make it.''
Iraq's people are among the better fed in the Middle East, and their food supplies could last months with rationing, Mr. Pipes said. Farmers could also plant more grain for human consumption and less for animal feed next spring. Iraq has indicated that its soldiers may be fed before civilians.
President Hussein does not appear to have anticipated an embargo on food before his Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, said John P. Parker, a Department of Agriculture economist who studies Middle Eastern food supplies. While Iraq dramatically increased its food stockpiles on the eve of its 1980 invasion of Iran, these stockpiles fell every year from 1984 to 1990 and had reached unusually low levels by July 25, he said.
Because Iraq's population was growing in this period, the food supply for each person fell and the country was left with only a two-month supply of wheat as of July, Mr. Parker said.
Reports by people who fled from Kuwait after the country was overrun say Iraqi soldiers began asking local residents for food. ''It was like the old method of sending armies foraging for food on the ground they occupy,'' said a Kuwaiti businessman in a telephone conversation from Saudi Arabia, where he arrived four days after the invasion.
 
Some Stores Looted in Kuwait
The average Iraqi may notice shortages of sugar and tea first, he said. ''They drink a lot of tea, and heavy tea. It's like triple the amount of tea Westerners use, and that, of course, means you need a lot of sugar.''
An executive of a multinational corporation with employees trapped in Baghdad said yesterday that ''there is a shortage of certain food items,'' including eggs. The executive spoke only on the condition that neither he nor his company be identified.
Many stores in Kuwait were looted immediately after the invasion but others kept their shelves stocked, said Katherine C. Baker, an American store manager who escaped from Kuwait on Aug. 12. She said the banks were closed, she had little money and lived on potatoes, rice and pasta.
The amount of food seized by Iraq from Kuwait is unclear but may prove important, the State Department official said. The Kuwaiti businessman said his country had enough canned goods stored in warehouses to feed its population for four to six months, and Iraqi soldiers took over these warehouses and sent Kuwaiti employees home soon after the invasion.
But the canned goods may not feed Iraq for long. In 1987, Kuwait had 1.87 million people; Iraq's population was 16.1 million in 1986.
 
U.S. Supplies Had Been Cut
The United States cut subsidized food shipments to Iraq in half last year because of a financial scandal involving Government credit guarantees and an Italian bank, and Iraq had not found alternative suppliers.
The United Nations sanctions allow food shipments to Iraq and Kuwait to relieve famine only. The United States and the world's other major grain producers have said famine is not yet a problem. The American naval blockade includes food.
President Hussein's current predicament has been compounded by the failure of Iraqi agriculture to surmount problems like infertile land and inadequate irrigation.
 
Effects of Fabled Rivers
Two large rivers flow through Iraq, the Tigris and Euphrates, and their banks were the breadbasket of the Middle East in ancient times. Nearly five thousand years ago, the Sumerians built one of the world's first great civilizations there, while the wealth of the court of Harun ar-Rashid, an eighth-century caliph of Baghdad, was described in the famous work of Arab literature, ''Thousand and One Nights.''
But in the 12th century, the fields of Iraq became dry and less fertile after the Tigris began flowing faster and dug itself a deep channel instead of periodically flooding and distributing rich silt over the fields, said Engin D. Akarli, an associate professor of Middle Eastern history at Washington University in St. Louis.
Most of Kuwait is desert, and with the exception of some vegetables grown in greenhouses and limited shrimp fishing, the nation depends on imported food, Mr. Parker said.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
How Old Votes Become New Political Liabilities

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Recorded votes in Congress have a habit of becoming campaign nightmares. To avoid them, lawmakers often jockey for voice votes on controversial legislation, so as not to have to risk going on the record.
But the legislative process is not always accommodating.
This year, a series of votes in April 1987 is among those coming back to haunt incumbents. The subject was the Government's first savings-and-loan rescue; the issue, a Reagan Administration plan that would have forced the industry to spend $15 billion of its own money to shut down and liquidate its sick members. 
The Administration's argument was that since industry lobbying was largely responsible for the loose regulatory policies leading the burgeoning S.& L. crisis, it should be responsible for cleaning up its own mess.
The United States League of Savings Institutions, the industry's lobbying dynamo, countered that no more than $5 billion was needed. Let Congress revisit the issue in a couple of years, the lobbyists argued. In the meantime, the economy of Texas could easily turn around.
The league prevailed, in the House Banking Committee and on the floor of the full House. Most industry experts now say those votes delayed a comprehensive clean-up of the largest financial scandal in the nation's history, and so drastically increased its cost.
One politician particularly feeling the aftereffects is Representative Stephen L. Neal, the North Carolina Democrat who sponsored the amendment to cut the Reagan Adminstration bailout proposal.
''The S.& L. fiasco is the No. 1 issue, and the $5 billion amendment is the major issue within the major issue,'' said Ken Bell, a former assistant United State Attorney for the Western Disrtrict of North Carolina, who faces Mr. Neal in the fall election.
Mr. Bell points to Mr. Neal's comments at the time on the House floor. ''People have said that if we do not agree to the larger amount, there will be a taxpayer bailout,'' Mr. Neal was recorded as saying three years ago. ''There is nothing in the bill or in anyone's reasonable expectation that that would be the case.''
Today, Mr. Neal is far from eager to discuss his amendment. But through a spokesman, he defends the measure this way: Even if the Reagan Administration's $15 billion plan had passed, it would have been woefully inadequate. The spokesman added that from Mr. Neal's perspective, Mr. Bell had not been able to make the issue a major concern.
Among the 23 members of the House Banking Committee who voted for the Neal amendment in 1987 and are still on panel, only three are Republicans. Two, Norman Shumway and David Drier, are from California, and one, Bill McCollum, is from Florida. Both states have very large savings and loan interests, and all three Representatives have received contributions from those interests.
''This plan is more than adequate for the needs of both the industry and the nation,'' Mr. Shumway declared when the issue was debated on the House floor.
''Why should we risk the solvency of the healthy institutions?'' asked Mr. Drier. ''If there are still problems we can revisit the issue in two years,''
Mr. Shumway is retiring from Congress this year. Mr. Drier and Mr. McCollum have very little opposition in their districts.
That is not the case for one of the most senior Democrats on the Banking Committee, Doug Barnard of Georgia. The eight-term incumbent is under heavy attack by his opponent, Sam Jones, for his involvment with the savings and loan industry, and especially for a $20,000 contribution from Charles H. Keating Jr., owner of the failed Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., and a focus of the savings and loan affair.
As for the Neal amendment, Mr. Jones takes issue with Mr. Barnard - for not voting on it. He was the only member of the House Banking Committee to abstain, and the amendment carried by only one vote. His vote against it would have meant a tie and a defeat for the amendment.
''Doug Barnard took a walk away from the American people that day,'' Mr. Jones said recently. Mr. Barnard will not say exactly why he abstained but said ''we were being pulled by a lot of forces,'' including pressure by the House leadership to support the $5 billion number. ''I probably should have voted for the $15 billion,'' he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Already in a Recession, More Than 60 Percent Say

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Americans have turned decidedly sour about the state of the economy, with the perception that the country is in a recession now shared by 6 out of 10 of them, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
This negative mood has been developing for months, various polls indicate, but it has increased significantly since Iraqi tanks rolled into Kuwait three weeks ago and set off a continuing wave of bad economic news: rising oil prices, stumbling stocks and climbing interest rates.
About 55 percent of the public says the economy is growing worse, according to the Times/CBS News Poll. The last time the poll found so large a proportion of Americans dour about the economy was in 1981 and 1982, as the country tumbled into the worst recession since World War II.
 
Prospects for Economy
About 40 percent of the respondents in the current survey said the economy was staying the same. Only 4 percent said they thought it was getting better. 
The survey was conducted in telephone interviews with 1,422 Americans from Aug. 16 to Aug. 19. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus three percentage points.
Attitudes about the economy can have a powerful influence both on actual economic conditions and on politics.
Politically, a weak economy generally spells trouble for the party in control of the White House, although at the moment acclaim for his handling of foreign policy is carrying President Bush above troubles on the home front and may even be protecting his party from defections that might otherwise be spurred by bad economic times.
Then there is the effect that public attitudes have on the actual economy.
 
Various Definitions of Decline
Academics generally define a recession as two consecutive quarters of declining national output. Although there has not been even a single quarter of declining output in years, many economists say the definition fails to capture fully the varieties of hard times, like rolling regional recessions, that can develop at the bottom of the modern business cycle.
In any case, consumers' pessimism about the economy discourages them from making purchases - particularly high-price items like homes, cars and major appliances - and can thus help produce, or deepen, the very recession Americans are convinced is already here. The Federal Government, in fact, uses consumer confidence, as measured in a monthly report by the University of Michigan, as part of its index of leading economic indicators, which is designed to presage future movement in the economy.
Richard T. Curtin, who directs the Michigan survey, said there was an unusually sharp downturn in consumer confidence immediately after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. ''The mood of consumers was quite bleak,'' he said. It has rebounded somewhat since then but will still be down over all for August, he said.
In the latest New York Times/CBS News survey, attitudes about the economy varied considerably from region to region, just as conditions have varied. Nearly two-thirds of the respondents in the Northeast, where actual economic conditions have been poorest, said the economy was getting worse, while only about half of those in the South and the Central States said so. About 6 of 10 Westerners saw worsening economic conditions.
 
Rise in Pessimism
But pessimism increased across the country in August, and more than half the respondents in each of the four regions now say the country is in a recession.
The jolt that Iraq dealt to American economic confidence is clearly visible in a series of polls conducted before and after Aug. 2, the date of the invasion.
In a poll conducted by The Wall Street Journal and NBC News in May, only 30 percent of the respondents said they thought there would be a recession this year, and 57 percent said not. In a poll by CBS News six days after the invasion, 49 percent of Americans said they thought the country was in a recession, and 42 percent said not. In a poll by The New York Times eight days after the invasion, 52 percent said the country was in a recession, and 35 percent said not. In the latest survey, 61 percent said the country was in a recession, and 32 percent said not.
Mr. Curtin and other analysts said that so sharp a turn in so brief a period was unusual and was almost always associated with major events. For example, consumer confidence took a sharp slide after the stock market crash of 1987. The extent of the impact that such events have on consumer purchasing, and thus on the economy, depends largely on whether attitudes continue to deteriorate or begin to improve, Mr. Curtin said.
Analysts attributed the current dive in confidence to a combination of actual effects on Americans' pocketbooks - like higher gasoline prices - and the intensity with which television and newspapers have focused on the damage that the turmoil in the Persian Gulf could do to the American economy.
 
Talk of Spending's Benefits
There has been very little discussion in the news media of the possible economic benefits that various regions might derive from the military spending associated with the Persian Gulf buildup.
The latest survey comes in the wake of evidence that economic confidence among Americans was already deteriorating before the invasion of Kuwait. Indeed, that deterioration was the biggest concern of Republican strategists, and one of the unspoken hopes of Democratic strategists, as the Congressional elections approached.
Market Opinion Research, a polling concern that has many Republican clients, has found a steady increase since March in the percentage of Americans who say they believe the economy has worsened. In March, 32 percent of registered voters said they thought the economy had grown worse, Market Opinion Research said. In May the figure was 41 percent, and in a poll conducted in late July and early August, just as Iraq invaded Kuwait, the figure climbed to 52 percent.
In the latest Times/CBS News Poll, blacks were more likely to view the state of the economy as ''very bad,'' with 25 percent of blacks and 14 percent of whites saying so. Blacks and other economically disadvantaged groups are often more vulnerable to economic downturns. But there was no difference between the opinions of blacks and whites when they were asked in which direction the economy was going: more than half of both groups said it was getting worse.
Women were more pessimistic than men were, with 60 percent of women and 49 percent of men saying the economy was getting worse.
 
Joblessness vs. Inflation
Americans were about evenly divided over whether the biggest economic problem facing the country was unemployment or inflation. Forty-one percent picked unemployment, which was at 5.5 percent in July, and 45 percent picked inflation, which was running at an annual rate of about 5 percent before the latest round of gasoline price increases. During the high inflation of the late 1970's and early 1980's, Americans overwhelmingly picked inflation when asked this question, and during the 1982 recession, a majority picked unemployment.
Stanley Greenburg, a Democratic poll taker, said he believed Americans were expressing their economic worries largely by complaining about higher costs, even when the problem might be lagging income rather than serious inflation. He said this attitude was underlying political sentiments as diverse as the resistance to taxes and the objection to soaring auto insurance premiums. In the Times/CBS News survey, 43 percent of respondents said they were finding it more difficult today than a year ago to make ends meet; 47 percent said they were finding it about the same, and 10 percent said they were finding it easier.
Some 26 percent said the chances were high that an adult in their family would be out of work and looking for a job in the next year, and 4 percent said someone was already out of work in their family.
As for inflation, 37 percent said they expected prices to go up a lot in the next year. Virtually everyone, 89 percent of the respondents, said they expected prices to go up at least a little in the next year.
Economic conditions are thought of by politicians and political analysts alike as one of the most powerful influences on elections - particularly midterm elections, in which issues of foreign policy are generally secondary. In forming a judgment about the economy, voters go beyond the immediate condition of their own pocketbooks to an assessment of general conditions, said Michael S. Lewis-Beck, a professor of political science at the University of Iowa.
 
A Number of Influences
Everything from layoffs in the community to reports on the nightly news about interest rates can influence that judgment, said Mr. Curtin, who directs the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers.
The decline in the public's assessment of the economy has not been followed by a decline in public approval for Mr. Bush's handling of the economy. Such a decline would otherwise have been expected were it not for the boost Mr. Bush is getting from his handling of the Persian Gulf crisis.
In the Times/CBS News survey, 45 percent of Americans said they approved of Mr. Bush's handling of the economy and 44 percent expressed disapproval. These results were virtually unchanged from a survey in June.
A similar effect may be occurring in the important question of party identification. One of the few forces that rivals economics in influencing how voters cast their ballots is the party with which they identify. But in the latest survey, deterioration in attitudes about the economy did not shake loose any support for the Republican party.
In fact, the percentage of Americans identifying themselves as Republicans or leaning toward the Republicans edged up, to 47 percent from 44 percent in a Times/CBS survey in June; and the percentage saying they considered themselves Democrats or closer to the Democrats slipped, to 43 percent from 44 in the June survey.
Although this could be a statistical blip, it is sure to be watched closely by political strategists in both parties.
 
How the Survey Was Conducted
The New York Times/CBS News Poll was based on telephone interviews conducted with 1,422 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii, from Aug. 16 to 19.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. The numbers were then screened to limit calls to residences.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and the number of residential telephone lines and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points, in either direction, from what would have been obtained by interviewing all American adults.
The percentages reported are the particular results most likely to match what would be obtained by seeking out all adult Americans. Other possible percentages are progressively less likely the more they differ from the reported results.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for those in the northeast region of the country, it is plus or minus six percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: Water Under A-Plant Is Found to Be Tainted

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: GORE, Okla., Aug. 23

 BODY:
Workers excavating storage tanks at a plant that processes uranium found levels of radioactive uranium in underground water that were as much as 35,000 times higher than Federal safety standards allow, officials said today.
Ron Adkisson, an official of Sequoyah Fuels Corporation, the plant's operator, said that the contamination had been contained in the plant's restricted area and that there was no danger to the public. 
The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission is investigating.
Mr. Adkisson said workers discovered the contaminated water on Wednesday, while the plant was closed for annual maintenance.
Plant officials said they believed that the uranium had leaked years ago from a building where pure uranium is dissolved using an acid.
None of the company's 243 workers were exposed to radiation, he said, and no evacuations were ordered at the plant, 60 miles southeast of Tulsa.
Mr. Adkisson said he did not know when the factory, including a uranium conversion plant and a uranium hexafluoride reduction plant, would be reopened.
Sequoyah is a unit of General Atomics of San Diego.

HEADLINE: F.D.A. Defends Milk-Producing Drug in Study

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 23

 BODY:
The Food and Drug Administration said in a study to be published on Friday that a genetically engineered growth hormone that increases milk production in dairy cows was harmless to human health.
With the nine-page article in the journal Science, the 84-year-old agency is for the first time opening for public review the full array of confidential safety studies on which decisions to approve or disapprove a new drug are based. The agency took the unusual step, an official said, to explain and defend itself against critics of the hormone's safety and of the F.D.A.'s review process.
In 1985, the agency approved the experimental use of the drug, bovine growth hormone, in dairy herds around the country and said the milk produced by test animals was safe to market. Final approval of the drug is expected next year after the agency finishes evaluating the drug's effect on cows. 
But the drug has been criticized as an economic threat to small farmers and a hazard to health by a coalition of farm and environmental groups that are campaigning to outlaw its use.
''It had become well-known that this drug was being developed and questions about its safety and the impact on family farms came up,'' Dr. Gerald B. Guest, the director of the F.D.A.'s Center for Veterinary Medicine, said in a telephone interview. ''People were casting doubt on our review. There was a credibility question involved that we felt needed a response.'' #4 Companies in Campaign The agency's extraordinary action to explain why it concluded that the hormone is harmless is part of a campaign by the four companies developing the drug and portions of the dairy industry to calm the public's concern about bovine growth hormone. One reason for the F.D.A. review was a request last year by the National Milk Producers Federation, the industry's principal trade group. The review could not have been conducted without the permission of the manufacturers to disclose their own confidential studies on the safety of the drug.
The $1 million campaign, begun on July 11, has been planned since 1986 by the National Dairy Promotion and Research Board, a farmer-supported public relations and advertising group. The campaign includes consumer surveys, advertising, public relations efforts and attempts to convince physicians and pediatricians that the hormone is safe, according to the board's internal documents obtained by the Foundation on Economic Trends, a Washington-based group that opposes the hormone. $500 Million in Development This week, The Journal of the American Medical Association published an article and an editorial asserting that all available scientific evidence showed that the genetically engineered drug was safe. The articles were written by scientists from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., who have received research grants from the Monsanto Chemical Company, one of the drug's manufacturers.
More than $500 million has been invested in research and development of the drug by the manufacturers - Monsanto, the American Cyanamid Company, Eli Lilly & Company and the Upjohn Company - who say it will make dairy farming easier, keep milk prices down, and do so without any harm to health. The hormone's success or failure in the marketplace is seen by most industry analysts as pivotal to the future development of other products of genetic engineering intended for use on farms.
 
Some Farmers Opposed
Opposing the hormone's use is a coalition of farm groups and environmental organizations in the Middle West, New York, and New England led by Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends, a public research group. Mr. Rifkin began his campaign against bovine growth hormone four years ago in Wisconsin by asserting that it would drive up milk production, lower prices and cause thousands of dairy farmers to go out of business. Since last year, he has focused his criticism on the drug's effects on health, which he says have not been adequately evaluated by the F.D.A.
The article in Science, by two scientists in the Center for Veterinary Medicine, Judith C. Juskevitch and C. Greg Guyer, summarizes more than 120 safety studies submitted by the manufacturers.
The authors said that genetically engineered bovine growth hormone, which is produced by altered bacteria, is nearly identical in chemical structure to natural bovine growth hormone, which appears in minute concentrations in milk.
 
Insulin-Like Growth Factor
The article said the F.D.A. has paid particular attention to concentrations of another protein, insulin-like growth factor, that are higher in milk from cows treated with the hormone than in untreated cows. Insulin-like growth factor, a protein produced by the liver, helps to regulate production of growth hormone in warm-blooded animals, including man.
Some scientists believe that higher levels of insulin-like growth factor in the blood could effect development in babies and small children. But the authors said the concentrations of the growth factor in milk from cows treated with bovine growth hormone are roughly the same as the concentrations in human breast milk.
 
Drug Temporarily Banned
Last spring, Wisconsin and Minnesota temporarily banned the sale or commercial use of bovine growth hormone, the first time in American history a farm product has been banned before it was approved for commercial sales.
Among those joining Mr. Rifkin in questioning the F.D.A. review of bovine growth hormone were two lawmakers from dairy states, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Democrat of Vermont, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and Representative John Conyers Jr., a Democrat of Michigan, the chairman of the House Government Operations Committee.
Both lawmakers requested separate investigations of the agency's review. One inquiry is being conducted by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, and the other is being conducted by the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services.

HEADLINE: FOOTBALL: The Making of a Quarterback;
U.S.C.'s Marinovich Was Raised According to a Game Plan

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
The man is sitting in his office at a fitness center, looking at the figure on the television screen. The television is on a chair, resting upon the book ''Secrets of Soviet Sports Fitness and Training.'' The figure on the screen is throwing footballs, viewed from the side and the front in normal and slow motion.
As the balls are thrown, an impassive voice on the tape provides an analysis:
''Notice first the position of your body as your front foot lands. The body is leaning back a little bit more than we'd like to see. We'd like to have your weight balanced between your feet, the body more straight upright. This is going to help you to transfer your weight over your front foot as you throw. . . . By transferring your weight forward, it's going to help you throw harder with better energy transfer . . . .''
''Interesting, huh?'' said Marv Marinovich, captain of the 1962 University of Southern California Trojans, a former lineman with the Oakland Raiders, a onetime assistant pro coach, an expert on fitness and nutrition and the father of the image on the screen. 
Todd Marinovich, starting his sophomore season at the age of 21, has already exceeded the expectations surrounding the most highly anticipated U.S.C. football player since O. J. Simpson brought impressive junior-college credentials here more than two decades ago.
 
Already N.F.L. Material
After a freshman season in which Marinovich threw for 2,578 yards and completed 62.2 percent of his passes, the U.S.C. coach, Larry Smith, has already grown apprehensive that the willingness of the National Football League to accept underclassmen could end the college career of Marinovich after just two seasons.
That possibility is just one aspect of the economic options and competitive pressures that have been reflected in abrupt and radical changes for high-profile college quarterbacks this season.
Andre Ware, now with the Detroit Lions, became the second consecutive Heisman Trophy winner to leave for the N.F.L. with a year of college eligibility remaining. Chris Weinke, who chose Florida State over approximately 70 other schools, recently signed a baseball contract with the Toronto Blue Jays before playing a game for the Seminoles. And Bret Johnson of U.C.L.A., whose progress had been compared closely with that of Marinovich since high school, left the team this week after losing the starting position. But for now, the presence of Marinovich raises a larger question: As a career is guided by computerized analysis and carefully planned direction, by the exercises at a young age, the diet, the punishment and discipline, would it be an overstatement to say Todd Marinovich has become a prototype for the elite football player of the 1990's?
''I don't think so,'' Marv Marinovich said, ''and the people I have dealt with all believe that. In East Germany, that's how they've gotten to the top, with attention to detail and focusing on biomechanics.''
 
A Star is Conceived
The father sits in his office in Anaheim, and smiles as he tries to remember the earliest plans for his son, the vitamins and minerals that were taken before the child was conceived.
''A lot of minerals,'' he said. ''Potassium. Magnesium. Vitamin E. Vitamin C. Zinc. Of course, all your B-complex vitamins.'' Marv Marinovich chuckled. ''We used to eat a lot of sprouts,'' he said.
On the wall behind his desk, not far from seven of his son's trophies, is the magazine cover that established the image that identified a high school student as ''ROBO QB.''
''To me, the Robo quarterback means the guy has all the equipment,'' the father said. ''Everything in sync. Everything balanced. The perfect machine. From a training standpoint, not that Todd is that, but the appearance of that is a positive situation.
''You could never be too good with your mechanics of throwing. You can never be too focused, mentally. You can never have too good a vision. You strive for those things. The idea of Robo, the ultimate decision-making trigger machine.''
A freeway drive away, the ultimate football prodigy sits in the sun outside the cafeteria. He is asked about the label. ''I don't know what that really means,'' he said. ''I think people can get the false idea of what I'm all about.''
The quarterback of the 90's is a child of the 60's, born on the fourth of July, 1969. His light red hair creeps down his neck toward his shoulders. His earth-shoe sandals appear as if they were borrowed from another college generation. When Todd Marinovich was asked once for his favorite musicians, his response was Neil Young and Led Zeppelin. His ambition, after an N.F.L. career, is to open an art gallery and be able to paint in seclusion near the ocean.
 
'Total Control'
The quarterback talks about bringing his sense of creativity to the field. ''There's nothing like it,'' he said. ''You have total control on the field. You're the guy, and everyone in the stands is looking at you. Even the players are looking for you to make things happen.''
Last Sept. 30, just over a month after a knee injury to Pat O'Hara suddenly made Marinovich the starter, he produced a stirring finish in his fourth college game. He not only pulled out a 1-point victory over Washington State with 4 seconds to play, but also elicited a telephone call two days later from an excited fan named Ronald Reagan.
Marinovich is a fine-arts major who aspires to have an exhibition of his paintings and drawings on campus. ''So many times, at school, at home, it was my biggest release,'' he said. ''I'd go out and I'd just lose myself. I was so engrossed in starting something from scratch and watching it turn into something.'' The father said that was planned, too. ''I always thought, when I have a child, I hope I'll be able to provide a near-perfect environment for him,'' Marv Marinovich said. ''We didn't start out to produce a quarterback, or a football player. We didn't want to do it the way everybody else did it. We wanted to try to do our best to do a better job.
''And I'm not just talking about fitness,'' he went on. ''I'm talking about enriched mental capabilities, music and art. The ex-wife, every day, would go to museums, would plan park excursions, classical music, artistic expression. And it just happened that Todd showed an ability in sports, and it was something he wanted to do.''
From the time he was a young athlete, Marv Marinovich had searched for answers to questions about how the body works.
''I can remember asking my dad: 'What can I do to improve my performance? What would be the plan?' ''
His career became an endless search. He studied the biomechanics of running, metabolism, and nutrition at a time when many football coaches clung to the belief that water breaks were harmful to an athlete's sense of purpose.
He researched philosophies of athletic development in Eastern Europe. He investigated the concepts of visualization and mental rehearsal. The father made the same demands of his son that he had made of himself.
Before Todd fully committed himself to this regimen, he began to rebel. The father remembered: ''I thought, 'He has put all this time in. I've put the time in. We've researched everything. He's got everything in order. Why isn't he good all the time?' ''
 
Long-Distance Punishment
The son remembered being punished after barely going through the motions during an all-star basketball game. He had to run home alongside the car, from Huntington Beach to Balboa, a distance of nine miles. Todd Marinovich said it was not a big deal for him to run nine miles as a second grader.
''Usually with my dad, when we had confrontations it always blew over the next day, and he explained why he did it,'' he said. ''There were days I didn't want to, but always in the back of my mind I loved playing sports. There was no way I would have thrown it away.''
Marv Marinovich acknowledged that there had been family disagreements over Todd's development, but feels that the issue was not responsible for his divorce. He is remarried with a 2-year-old son named Mikhail.
''If he plays football, he's definitely going to be a linebacker,'' Todd Marinovich said with a smile. ''He's got that mentality, that look in his eyes. He's crazy.''
This summer, Todd lived with his mother, Trudi, and went to his father's club to work out. At school, he is a student developing a sense of independence.
''The separation from me going to college brought us closer,'' the son said of his father. ''We're still working out. It's just summers now. I like that. I have my life over here now, and Dad has his little boy now.''
Now and then, the father returns to the campus where he played to watch his son wear the colors he wore. Marv Marinovich stands back in the baseball grandstand next to the football practice field, and watches quietly. ''I'm just enjoying it,'' he said. ''But I'll always have a few comments for him, of course. I kind of think he expects it.''

HEADLINE: The Soviets: Steady, if Slow

 BODY:
Differences between the Soviet Union and the United States on when to use force to uphold economic sanctions against Iraq are troublesome. But they scarcely threaten the remarkable international consensus that increasingly isolates Saddam Hussein.
On all the big questions, Moscow has joined with Washington to counter Iraq's aggression. This counts more than Moscow's hesitations about using naval force to assure compliance with sanctions. Working to overcome Soviet doubts makes more sense than letting a difference on timing turn into a serious rift over larger goals. 
Moscow has joined in condemning Iraq's grab of Kuwait. It has also joined in imposing an arms embargo on the Baghdad regime and in voting mandatory economic sanctions. But so far, the Soviet Union has held back from fully approving a Security Council resolution authorizing a ''minimum use of force'' to prevent evasion of the sanctions. That could delay naval challenges to ships bound to and from Iraqi ports.
Meanwhile, the collective effort to contain Saddam Hussein grows stronger by the hour. Japan offers what could amount to billions in compensation to countries hurt by sanctions. Saudi Arabia is providing oil to reimburse costs of U.S. military aid. Western Europe is moving ships and troops to the gulf; France is joining as a full partner.
And global resolve can only be stiffened by Iraq's latest affront: the grotesque television charade in which Saddam Hussein appears as kindly godfather to the children of British hostages.
Soviet anxieties about moving too fast on the military track seem neither alarming nor unreasonable. Mikhail Gorbachev is not alone in his aversion to using force; others also worry that a massive U.S. buildup in the gulf could result in war by miscalculation or overreaction. And Moscow is understandably reluctant to turn forcibly against a radical Arab state with which it has had close ties for two decades. That may be why Mr. Gorbachev prefers deferring naval action until sanction-busting has been clearly demonstrated.
The debate has already whetted cold-war suspicions. Some fear that the Soviet Union is playing for time to protect its client and reap the benefits of higher prices for its own substantial oil and gas exports. And Soviet ''specialists'' remain in Iraq. Moscow says the advisers are only fulfilling contracts to train Iraqis in using Soviet military equipment.
None of this diminishes the crucial importance of Soviet support in helping to unite the United Nations. Sanctions are already reckoned as 90 percent effective. Their bite has provoked Iraq into denouncing the U.N. as an American tool, thus slandering all its members.
Given the tumult in the gulf, Mr. Gorbachev's hesitation about going further matters less than the unity of purpose already achieved. The first post-cold-war crisis has carried nations everywhere into new terrain. It is premature to read sinister motives into uncertain and even contradictory Soviet signals.

HEADLINE: Adding Police Won't Hold Back New York's Crime Tidal Wave

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am disturbed that public outcry over the recent shootings of children and innocent citizens in New York City has brought the tried and ineffective answer of more police. I have heard knowledgeable public officials and others who should know better say the additional police presence will ''suppress'' crime. How can you suppress a tidal wave? The murders, rapes and assaults that make headlines are only the crest of the wave of crime washing over this city.
The only true means of tackling the crime problem is to prevent young people from becoming criminals. You start by educating them and providing them with the means to compete successfully for jobs. You provide supervised activities to keep them off the streets and under the watchful eye of trained counselors, after school and during the summer. Most of all, you give them opportunities to work while they are young. Let them taste early a piece of the American dream the legal way.
The problem with adding additional police is that for every criminal arrested, there are plenty of unemployed, and unemployable, teen-agers and young adults waiting to take his place. The cost is more than just for the police. It costs approximately $58,000 a year to keep an inmate locked up in a New York City jail.
If we are forced to spend more on police, let us recognize that we must spend as much extra on preventive services (youth employment, after-school services, counseling) for children and their families. To spend money in one area and not in the other wastes public dollars and precious time.

HEADLINE: Persian Gulf States Use Wealth Wisely

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As an American born and raised in the Middle East, with 20-odd years of recent close experience with native business and government leaders in the Arab world, I believe the news media owe Americans more accurate representation about Kuwait, Abu Dhabi and the Persian Gulf states.
Great wealth from oil revenues is a fact, but not the only significant one. Perhaps as important, this wealth is used in many respects wisely and responsibly: to change ancient tribal societies into well-intentioned progressive 20th-century ones with preservation of family and religious values benefiting the whole social spectrum; and not only to spread the benefits of great wealth to every citizen by providing universal free education, medical services, home ownership, telephone and water services, but also to make hundreds of millions of dollars available to impoverished third world countries through the huge Kuwaiti and Abu Dhabi social and economic funds.
That these wealthy countries are in large measure acting responsibly with their resources deserves recognition.

For example, he talks of our ''reindustrialization,'' our gross national product and population as more than double Japan's, without recognizing that statistics from 1980 to 1989 indicate that Japan is likely to exceed our real per capita gross domestic product by the year 2004 or that Japan invested more in new factories in 1989 than we did - $549 billion versus $513 billion (see Leonard Silk's July 27 Economic Scene column, ''Who Is No. 1? It's Hard to Say''). 
There is an intangible asset that favors other industrial nations in their effort to capture more of our share of the world's industrial market. This is the quality of the work force. Beyond question, our work force is beset by social, economic, psychological and education problems that have led to warnings from industrial leaders that there will not be enough well-qualified workers for our industry by 2000.
Honest evaluation in Washington of our shrinking share of the world high-tech industrial market would force the conclusion that we need to change the distribution of wealth and our priorities to shore up the American family, and make the salaries and conditions in our schools attractive to potential science and math teachers. Instead, we will continue to spend close to $300 billion a year for ''defense,'' including weapons that have no proven purpose and don't function as prescribed.
Looking through rose-colored glasses is comforting, but dangerous. Not long ago, it encouraged the belief that multiplying high-tech factories would compensate for our lost smokestack industry. Events proved otherwise.

To the Editor:
''America Is No. 1. It'll Stay No. 1,'' Alfred Balk tells us (Op-Ed, July 31). He fails to mention our most serious problems, for instance, our national debt, which is more than $3.2 trillion and getting larger each day. 
He stresses the size of our gross national product but fails to tell us that $300 billion of this is due to our military spending, which has come close to bankrupting our nation. Since the cold war started, we have spent for the military an amount greater than the value of everything in the United States except for the land.
Neither does he mention what the cost of the savings and loan association bailout will do to the country. And in telling us how important our large G.N.P. is, Mr. Balk does not tell us that 65 percent of the G.N.P. is made up of consumption expenditures and that consumers are drowning in debt.
For the last seven years we have avoided a recession only because of our deficit spending. We have fluctuated between fear of inflation and fear of a recession. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has constantly changed from tight money and high interest rates to control inflation, to low interest rates and an easing of credit to avoid a recession.
Sixteen states are already in a recession or on the edge of having one. A recession seems almost inevitable. The only way we have of recovering from a recession is deficit financing, but we are already doing that at the present level of $150 billion annually. This is the bad news. The good news is that if we act in time, it is possible to avoid the chaos that a recession brings.

Tomorrow's Hope

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Alfred Balk (Op-Ed, July 31), tells us that we're No. 1 and will stay that way - in fact, that we've ''Americanized the world.'' Such notables as Vice President Dan Quayle have recently voiced similar notions. 
Mr. Balk's inventory of the many categories of human endeavor and enterprise in which we ''lead the world by far'' is impressive, but he seems to forget our crisis in education, our students' poor performance compared with their foreign peers, especially in science, mathematics, geography, other languages and knowledge of other cultures. Can he believe that the deficient performance of many American students will have little or no effect on our national future, especially in the science and technology he extols?
Finally, it is sad that Mr. Balk stresses material accomplishments almost exclusively. Surely our American dream is an inseparable fusion of the material and the spiritual, and surely this, not solely our material attainments, explains its attraction for the people of other countries. We all need to remember, Mr. Balk included, an ancient but always valid question: What profits it a man (or country) if he gains the world but loses his soul?

HEADLINE: DIALOGUE: Next Step in the Gulf
Should the U.S. Attack Iraq?;
Yes, Hussein Must Be Ousted

BYLINE: By Alfonse D'Amato; Alfonse D'Amato, Republican of New York, is a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

 BODY:
Imagine the Middle East with Saddam Hussein in command of a multimillion-man army, equipped with chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, and intercontinental missiles to deliver them.
Unless Mr. Hussein is destroyed now, that is what we will face in the future.
The United States' response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has been correct. We are now confronting tough choices. With every passing hour, Mr. Hussein rounds up more innocent Americans and other foreign citizens to be part of his ''human shield.'' We must act decisively against Iraq before we are presented with the unacceptable moral choice of tolerating his naked aggression in Kuwait or facing a protracted hostage crisis. 
We must realize that if Mr. Hussein is permitted to remain in power in Iraq, he will present a constant and growing threat to the security of the region and, in particular, to Israel. For that reason, we cannot settle for anything less than his removal from power.
Even apart from the hostage issue, the case for immediate action is compelling. Had Israel not undertaken its 1981 pre-emptive strike against Iraq's nuclear reactor, we would now face an enemy armed with nuclear-tipped Scud missiles. If we don't act decisively now, Saddam Hussein will have looked into the barrel of the gun and survived. He inevitably will seek the power to destroy any country that opposes him. Be assured that he will seek nuclear weapons to provide him with that power.
We cannot wait until President Hussein is able to back his grandiose ambitions with nuclear arms. If we now settle for a negotiated solution without destroying Iraq's capacity for future aggression, the cost of stopping him in five years will be more than the United States - and indeed the world - can or should pay.
Before World War II the world tolerated Hitler, erroneously believing that he was an enemy of Communism. We have made much the same mistake in tolerating President Hussein because he was the enemy of Iran and the Ayatollah Khomeini. Just as the world closed its eyes to Hitler's atrocities, we have ignored President Hussein's unconscionable use of poison gas against his own people.
We cannot accept a deal that would allow Mr. Hussein to retreat to his lair with his army - and his ambitions - intact. Nor can we trust him to abide by the terms of any negotiated agreement. Recall that when Iran confronted Iraq with superior force in 1975, President Hussein kissed the Shah and agreed to a treaty settling Iraq's boundary with Iran. He broke that treaty when it suited his plans, with a massive military attack on Iran in September 1980.
We now stand on Kuwait's border, face-to-face with him. We should learn from Israel's 1981 example and act pre-emptively. It is simply naive to believe that an economic embargo will starve Mr. Hussein into capitulating to our demands. With his bold rhetoric, he is fanning popular Arab unrest in Jordan, Egypt and even Syria. Time is not on our side.
Only a pre-emptive strike will save us from the nightmare of facing a regional nuclear war within the decade. Mr. Hussein's insatiable ambition and animosity toward Israel is well documented. If we walk away from the present crisis leaving intact his ambitions and Iraq's offensive military capability, then Iraq will surely strive to acquire the nuclear capability to destroy all of Israel and dominate the entire Arab world.
In any future confrontation involving an Iraq armed with nuclear arms, Israel may well be compelled to resort to nuclear weapons to insure its survival. The consequences could be a nuclear conflagration drawing in the entire world.
Striking now avoids the wrenching moral dilemma we will face if President Hussein is allowed to put his ''human shield'' in place. As we wait, the situation worsens and the cost of inaction mounts.
Appeasement and negotiations are no more the road to peace now than they were before World War II. We must show strength now.

Should the U.S. Attack Iraq?;
No, U.N. Pressure Will Work Best

BYLINE: By Terry Sanford; Terry Sanford, Democrat of North Carolina, is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The U.S. has accomplished its original military objective in the Middle East: We stepped in with a strong presence in Saudi Arabia and stopped Saddam Hussein's march south to control the Middle East oilfields. That was a bold and proper action. It was a brilliant performance.
Now, however, there is a real danger that we will be tempted to go on the offensive. Success is heady stuff. My fear is that commitments or threats will lead us into a war that would be bloody, costly and hard to conclude. 
By continuing to add troops and planes, and by threatening to act in advance of the United Nations to enforce a shipping blockade, the Bush Administration is playing into Mr. Hussein's desperate effort to depict his naked aggression as a confrontation between Iraq and the ''imperialist'' U.S.
We do not want the nations of the world to feel that they are helping the U.S. against Iraq. We want the rest of the world to see this confrontation as an obligation of the United Nations, of which the U.S. is a strong supporter.
Thus, we must rapidly shift the primary burden to the U.N. It will take the civilized world's concerted and sustained efforts to enforce an effective embargo of Iraq. It will take the U.N. to protect thousands of foreign nationals held as hostages. These are U.N. responsibilities.
I understand patriotic fervor, the urge to back the President when we are confronting a foreign foe. But I also remember the plunge toward combat involvement in Vietnam.
That is why there is an urgent need to calm down and remind ourselves that our presence in the Persian Gulf cannot become America's war. Although we may, and should, seek to guide and shape international consensus through the U.N., we cannot dictate it. Nor should we march ahead unilaterally, arrogantly assuming that the world will follow. If there is to be war, it is to be Iraq's war against the entire world community.
The U.N. charter was signed in the hope that a new international system might ''save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.'' That hope was frustrated by the cold war. Now, 45 years after the charter was adopted, the U.N. is in a position to unite and act. The international community appears ready to cooperate to enforce the law of nations.
The Security Council enacted economic sanctions against Iraq without a dissenting vote. If it finds that sanctions have ''proved to be inadequate,'' it may order other operations, including a military blockade. We must give the U.N. time to lead.
Such a multilateral effort is needed to make sanctions effective, and to deprive Saddam Hussein of the propaganda claim that he is simply standing up to American imperialism. His trump card is in turning the ordinary Arab against the royal families and against their protectors. The United Nations can take that card out of his hand.
Washington simply must, through the United Nations, exercise leadership among the community of nations to convey, forcefully and collectively, the message that blatant aggression will not be tolerated. Our greatest weapon is the embargo that will cut off Iraq's revenue.
The U.S. must also shift to the United Nations the responsibility for the American and other foreign families being detained in Iraq and Kuwait. There are indications that the continued buildup of U.S. forces in the region - by raising Iraqi fears of invasion - may expose them to even greater danger. The U.N. can best liberate these people.
We must not allow Iraq to transform an international crime into an offense against the United States - as Iran did so successfully in the hostage crisis in Teheran. Mr. Hussein's offense is against the world.
Those who suggest that Mr. Hussein is a brutal dictator are correct. But those who argue that we should take back Kuwait and take over Iraq in order to liquidate him are not thinking clearly. There are safer ways to bring him under control.

HEADLINE: At Stewart Airport, a Whiff of Success

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

DATELINE: NEWBURGH, N.Y.

 BODY:
Amid the military cargo planes and private jets that have long rolled along the runways at Stewart International Airport is a new addition these days: Boeing 727's.
After years of trying to interest airlines in this former Air Force base on the fringe of the New York metropolitan area, and years of opposition from environmentalists, state officials have finally succeeded in attracting scheduled passenger service.
Arrivals and departures have nearly tripled since the first flights were begun four months ago by American Airlines to its Chicago and Raleigh-Durham hubs.
American Airlines now plans to start service to Dallas in September, while two feeder lines, United Express and American Eagle, have begun flying to Washington and to New York, 60 miles to the south. ''In truth, I didn't think we would see all of these markets quite as soon as we're seeing them,'' said Russell B. Vachon, Director of Aviation for the State Department of Transportation. 
Stewart's auspicious debut has pleased passengers from Orange County and beyond and also state officials - the passengers because they were tired of fighting traffic to reach La Guardia, Kennedy International and Newark International Airports and the state officials because they see the Hudson Valley as New York State's next frontier for economic development.
But the early success at the airport has also heightened concerns among local residents and environmental organizations who have long feared its development into a fourth major airport for the New York City region.
 
Environmentalists Suing State
A coalition of groups, including the Stewart Park and Reserve Coalition, the Sierra Club, and Scenic Hudson, is suing the state, demanding a comprehensive environmental review of both the new air service and plans by the state to develop over the next 20 years up to 2,000 acres that it owns around the airport.
Last spring the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court ruled in the state's favor, and the coalition is now appealing to the Court of Appeals.
''Rockland County was overwhelmed by development in the wink of an eye,'' Sandra Kissam, president of the Stewart Park and Reserve Coalition, said of Orange County's southern neighbor. ''What's going to happen to our open space?''
State planners, however, argue that they will be better able to preserve open space and sensitive environmental areas by concentrating development in and around the airport, which is near both Interstate 84 and the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway and is bordered by an 8,000-acre ''buffer zone.'' That zone includes the 2,000 acres that officials have marked for industrial and commercial development.
 
Control of Development Stressed
''Over the long term, there will continually be development pressures coming out of the New York metropolitan area, and we ought to be in a position to handle it and control it, rather than let it happen haphazardly,'' said Stephen M. Finkle, the Urban Development Corporation's director of economic development at the airport.
The Federal Aviation Administration and the state's Department of Transportation are overseeing an environmental review of proposed commercial development on the buffer land. A review of the airport expansion in 1977 found there would be no significant impact on the environment.
As the debate continues over the merits of development and expansion, Stewart is making progress within the airline industry. The State Commissioner of Transportation, Franklin E. White, said in a recent news conference that the airport was ''the talk of the aviation industry,'' adding that it had the potential to relieve ''airport congestion that has reached crisis proportions.''
 
Airline Expansion Considered
A spokesman for American Airlines, Ed Stewart, said, ''Because Stewart is doing so well, it's one of the places we're constantly looking at for possible expansion.''
A number of airlines are now considering moving to Stewart, transportation officials said, with Boston and Miami the two new destinations talked about most.
The Department of Transportation has estimated that Stewart could one day accommodate about a fifth of the more than 200,000 passengers now using Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark each day. It sees the airport drawing on residents and employees from the Hudson Valley, northern New Jersey, parts of Connecticut and eastern Pennsylvania.
Among Stewart's airline and feeder services there are now 31 arrivals and departures daily. In June about 17,000 passengers passed through the single gate at the 34,000-square-foot terminal. The parking spaces, which are free until 1991, initially numbered 850 but have more than doubled.
The possibilities for expansion are great. A site at the northern end of the airport has already been set aside for a second terminal that would be 10 times the size of the existing one, subject to environmental review, and long-term plans call for an extension of an alternate runway to 8,000 feet from 6,000. But state officials say the current terminal could be expanded to handle any new airlines during the next five years.
 
Biggest Jets Can Land
In area the 10,000-acre airport is the second largest in the nation, behind Dallas-Fort Worth. Its 11,818-foot main runway - 2,518 feet longer than Newark's top runway but 2,754 feet shorter than Kennedy's - can accommodate the largest jetliners, as well as the supersonic Concorde and the Space Shuttle - as opponents like to make known.
On a recent day several travelers suggested they were willing to accept some development for the sake of convenience.
''The impact is somewhat of a concern, but unfortunately you've got to give a little to get a little,'' said Antoinette Rudzinski, a 39-year-old legal assistant from Beacon, N.Y., who was picking up her father-in-law on a flight from Florida.
''I don't have to go to the city, which is four hours there and back, every time a friend or relative comes to visit,'' she said.
Perhaps most concerned about the budding airport are the people whose houses are directly beneath the new flight paths. Gordon Rauer of Rock Tavern, an economist and real-estate broker who lives five miles from the airport in a farmhouse on three and a half acres, said he was now wakened every morning at 7:18, 12 minutes before his alarm clock was set to go off.
''The windows shake, and it feels like the plane is going through my living room,'' said Mr. Rauer, who is active in the Stewart Park and Reserve Coalition. ''I can practically see the pilot's lapels.''

HEADLINE: Tourism in New York City Is Down After 80's Boom

BYLINE: By KAREN De WITT

 BODY:
After the boom years of the 1980's, New York City tourism is down slightly this summer, a dip that is being closely monitored by the local tourist industry.
Hotel occupancy, convention bookings and domestic airline arrivals have decreased, but industry experts are saying they are not unduly concerned.
''What we're seeing in New York City is a dip from the sky, from cosmic levels of tourism,'' said Bern Rotman, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Economic Development. ''If it's a long-term trend, then of course it's dangerous. But tourism has been an absolutely growing industry, so if it seems that there is a slowdown, people get nervous.'' 
Even in the decline, there are bright spots. Theater attendance and visits to major New York City attractions are up. And New York appears to be less affected by a general dip in tourism than other parts of the country.
 
Tourism Peaks in the Fall
Earlier this year, travel experts feared that changing tourism patterns and a sluggish economy marked a flattening of the industry. But industry spokesmen are taking a wait-and-see attitude because tourism in New York peaks not in the summer months but in October and November.
''In the summer you get strictly visitors on vacation, and while New York is wonderful, it has its drawbacks if you have children,'' said Christine Godek of Berman-Godek Communications Inc., a hotel-industry public relations firm.
Though almost everyone acknowledges a softening in the domestic market, John D. Harding, vice president of marketing and advertising for Restaurant Associates Inc., which operates Mama Leone's Restaurant and restaurants at Rockefeller Center and other tourist destinations, said the company's New York proprieties have held better than those in Miami or Boston.
''Even though there's clearly a downturn, we think New York isn't as as badly affected as most other places in the rest of the country,'' he said.
 
'Stuff They Read in the Media'
What seems to be affecting New York City tourism, a $10 billion industry, is partly psychological, some travel experts say. An image of New York as crime ridden and racially strained are not selling points.
At Lincoln Center, Andryola Kye, a New York City jewelry designer, was showing off the city to a friend from Munich, Ann Pawlowski. ''You want to know why tourism is down in New York?'' Ms. Kye asked. ''I'll tell you. It's the image of the city. It's crime. It's the stuff they read in the media.'' Earlier this week, Mayor David N. Dinkins announced that he was reinstating city money for the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau in an effort to promote tourism. City officials say the money was more an effort to ensure continued tourism than an attempt to stanch a decline.
''There are areas of business I'm panicked about, but the tourism industry is not one,'' said Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development. #5 Percent State Tax on Hotels Hotel occupancy rates and the number of conventions is down to 73 percent for 1989, compared with 76.7 percent for 1988. In other major cities like Los Angeles, Atlanta and Miami, the figures are down as well.
Mrs. Godek said that travel industry officials were still waiting to see what effect the New York State tax increase of 5 percent on hotel rooms would have on the market. ''Everyone is a little worried about the tax, because along with stories generated in the media worldwide, the problem of Kennedy Airport no longer being the only gateway into the country - and Kennedy is not a user-friendly airport - those kind of things make all New York hotel people nervous,'' she said.
According to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, domestic airline passenger arrivals showed a slight increase over the first six months of last year, from 12,979,741 in 1989 to 13,012,101 this year. But since 1986, the figure has been declining.
The number of foreign visitors to New York continued to increase, from 5,157,774 in the first six months of 1989 to 5,334,856 this year.
 
Attraction of the Lower Dollar
''The relatively depressed value of the dollar is helping things for the overseas tourists,'' said Greg Bohan of Pannell Kerr Forster, an accounting and consulting firm that specializes in the hotel and restaurant industry.
At Rockefeller Center, Shirley Emery, 26 years old, and Avril Nicolson, 27, of Scotland, said that bargain prices brought them to the city.
''We're spending about a thousand dollars each for the two weeks here,'' said Miss Emery, a nurse.
American tourists like Sungbok Lee, 19, and Sang Jee, 20, both Michigan State University students, are cutting their costs by staying with friends.
 
Cutting Vacation Costs
''And we drove from Lansing,'' said Mr. Lee, as he and Mr. Jee waited for a friend at St. Patrick's Cathedral. ''There's no question that we'd come to visit New York - this is the world's metropolis - it was just how to keep it from being really expensive.''
The students said that at some point during their stay they were going to have to pay for a hotel and had calculated $40 a night apiece, a far cry from the $133.75 average daily room rate.
While hotel occupancy and the number of conventions are down slightly, visits to the city's tourist attractions and theaters are up. For fiscal year 1988-89, there were 7.97 million theatergoers; in fiscal 1989-90, 8.03 million.
''Generally there has been an upturn reflecting more and better shows playing, with about 40 percent of our business from out of town and about a quarter of that from foreigners,'' said George Wachtel, director of research for the Theater League.
At the Empire State Building, Laura Fries, manager of the observation decks, said: ''While last year was a flat year, this year we're seeing an increase. One of the reasons is that the Empire State building is internationally known.''

In Westchester, Fantasies of Odilon Redon

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
Odilon Redon's name does not often appear near the top of lists of 19th-century artists who influenced 20th-century art, but before the Surrealists - before many of the Surrealists were born, in fact - he was exploring the dark side of the subconscious.
In the prints and drawings he made beginning in the 1860's, Redon created macabre and cryptic images inspired in some cases by the writings of Poe and Baudelaire, in others by the paintings of Goya. His renditions of flowers sprouting skulls and of skeletons with antlers, and his references to Hindu symbols for death and to mythical creatures like Pegasus and the Sphinx, prompted the Parisian critics to label him as a purveyor of ''le fantastique reel,'' ''that desolate region which exists on the borders of the real and the fantastic - a realm populated by formidable phantoms, monsters, monads and other creatures born of human perversity,'' explained the critic Emile Hennequin in an 1882 review of Redon's lithographs.
''Le Fantastique Reel: Graphic Works by Odilon Redon'' is also the title of a concise and handsome exhibition at the Katonah (N.Y.) Museum of Art, organized by Stephen F. Eisenman, a professor at Occidental College in Los Angeles. Bringing together about 30 drawings and prints from six public and private collections, the show focuses on the first decades of the artist's career, when he was working almost exclusively in black and white and was known only to a coterie of enthusiasts. 
Redon was 41 years old in 1881 when he was finally given his first exhibition of drawings, and only in the 1890's did he achieve a measure of the fame he had sought for so many years. By 1913, three years before his death, Redon was thought significant enough to the development of modern art to merit a prominent place in the Armory Show in New York.
Yet for much of his career, he worked in obscurity. Born in the Medoc, in the Bordeaux region of France, Redon maintained a fascination with supernatural stories he had heard as a child, and in his early work he sought to illustrate those tales of demons, enchanted forests and witches' sabbaths. Like others in the French avant-garde, he wanted to create a kind of populist art, one based on a repertory of folk images that would seem in opposition to the classical themes promoted by the academy. This goal also led him in the mid-1870's to printmaking, which he believed would ensure that his works were widely available. Redon told his teacher, Rodolphe Bresdin, that he wanted to become ''a man of the people.''
In retrospect, as Mr. Eisenman points out in his catalogue essay: ''Redon's ambition was contradictory and utopian. . . . The 'supernatural tales' that Redon heard were, to some extent, the creation of metropolitan folklorists who felt comforted by the idea of a timeless, simple and superstitious peasantry. Indeed, though Redon's own championing of the 'ragged and sad' people of his native Medoc was first motivated by respect and a desire for social justice, it gradually changed into a belief that poverty was itself ennobling.''
But the salient point remains that, for Redon, depictions of the grotesque and otherworldly represented not an escape from reality, but an attempt to create a visual language at least as true to life as the landscapes depicted by the Impressionists - in his case, true to the inner life of the imagination. Like photographers, the Impressionists were concerned only with re-creating the surface of nature, he believed. Redon aimed for a representation of nature based on the unseen.
The prints and drawings in this exhibition underscore how diverse his sources were. He seems to have found precedents in the works of not only Goya and Bresdin, but also Corot, Rembrandt and Leonardo. Although Poe, Baudelaire and Flaubert supplied him with ideas, he derived help, as well, by reading about the latest developments in anatomy and botany. (He sent a copy of his 1879 set of lithographs, ''Dans le Reve,'' to Louis Pasteur, who declared Redon's monsters ''fit to live.'') The results can be judged in his 1888 suite of prints based on Flaubert's ''Temptation of St. Anthony,'' in which it becomes clear why Mallarme praised Redon's blacks for being ''as royal as purple.'' In ''The Chimera With Green Eyes Turns, Bays,'' from this series, the artist creates a realm so shadowy and unfathomable as to seem abstract. It is a work like ''The Chimera'' that links Redon most strongly with the avant-garde of the early 20th century.
Evocative uses of light and dark are also what make prints like ''Evil Glory'' of 1886 and the frontispiece for ''The Chimeras'' by Jules Destree of 1889 stand out among the finest of Redon's achievements. Few artists could make black serve so many purposes.
When, in the 1890's, he began to create scenes more explicit in their imagery and less dependent on mysterious effects of shadow, he was responding to charges of obscurantism from critics unaccustomed to ambiguity. But the works suffered as a result. His third ''Temptation of St. Anthony'' series, from 1896, is a prime example of the problem, with its descriptive, almost cartoonish style.
By the mid-1890's, Redon had become widely known, and his change of fortunes corresponded with a turn from black and white to pastel, oil and watercolor. He became an artist in the modernist mainstream. It is on the basis of these later, more contrived compositions that his reputation has understandably suffered. It has suffered, as well, from association with imitations by countless lesser artists. Still, as this exhibition makes clear, Redon left behind, with his early prints and drawings, works that have lost none of their mystery and elegance, and that establish him clearly as a father to the art of the 20th century.
 
In Purchase
''First Impressions'' at the Neuberger Museum in Purchase, N.Y., is ultimately too big and too diffuse, but it serves an important function in documenting the growth of the art of printmaking in the United States in the last 30 years. Organized by Elizabeth Armstrong of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, where the show was first seen, it brings together early attempts at printmaking by 46 contemporary artists, beginning in the late 50's with the collaboration between Larry Rivers and Frank O'Hara on a series of lithographs, and concluding with works from the 80's by such artists as Carroll Dunham, Eric Fischl, Robert Longo and Elizabeth Murray.
What transpired during the interim was a complete transformation of attitude among artists. Where Robert Rauschenberg had felt justified in responding to an invitation in the early 60's to make prints by saying that ''the second half of the 20th century was no time to start writing on rocks,'' two decades later it had become evident to young artists that the reputations of many of America's leading artists, including Rauschenberg, were considerably enhanced by their prints.
What had also become clear is that almost anything was possible in printmaking. The great merit of ''First Impressions'' is to demonstrate how freewheeling and inventive contemporary artists have been - partly, as with Vito Acconci or Bruce Nauman, in an attempt to translate radically different kinds of artistic practices into the medium of prints; partly, as in the case of Edward Kienholz or Lynda Benglis, in an attempt to stretch the definition of printmaking.
There are outstanding works in the show, including familiar ones like Jasper Johns's ''0-9'' and Chuck Close's ''Keith,'' and there are many other prints, like Richard Bosman's ''Man Overboard'' and Bruce Conner's ''Thumb Print,'' that would have seemed more impressive under less sprawling circumstances. The once-over-lightly quality of the exhibition tends to make the display seem more a survey of contemporary art than a study of the evolution of a particular medium. As for the very important part that economics has played in the flourishing of prints, little is said. Still, ''First Impressions'' will leave no doubt in a viewer's mind of the major contribution of publishing houses like Universal Limited Art Editions, Tamarind Lithography Workshop, Crown Point Press and Gemini G.E.L. to the progress of American postwar art.

Parallels in American and Soviet Post-Modernism

BYLINE: By ANDY GRUNDBERG

 BODY:
To American eyes, contemporary Soviet art is endlessly fascinating. It comes from a culture that for most of this century has been closed to the West. It dispenses with the approved style of Socialist Realism and contradicts our preconceived ideas about the creative conditions of Communist life. Moreover, it bears a disconcerting resemblance to recent American art.
The new Soviet art has only recently begun attracting the attention of American museums, however, so the process of sorting out what its meanings and potentials are is in its infancy. But judging from ''Adaptation and Negation of Socialist Realism: Contemporary Soviet Art,'' an exhibition organized by the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art in Ridgefield, Conn. (where it can be seen through Oct. 7), today's Soviet artists are as fully post-modern as those in New York.
What popular culture is for New York artists, Socialist Realism apparently is for the Soviets - an omnipresent, oppressive realm that symbolically represents an elusive but all-pervasive authority. Thus much of the work in the exhibition - a total of 46 pieces by 14 artists, selected by Jamey Gambrell, an art critic in New York - attempts to unmask or pervert the erstwhile ''official'' style. 
Yevgeny Barabanov, a Soviet art critic who has contributed an essay to the show's catalogue, calls it ''post-underground'' work. That is, it is neither the detested art of officialdom nor an absolute rejection of it. Instead, the artists in ''Adaptation and Negation'' toy with the ideological system from which an earlier avant-garde tried to flee. Part of a loose, Moscow-based movement referred to as conceptualism, they employ illustration, text, graphic design and a realm of other non-painterly techniques to comment on the contradictions of Soviet life. This is what makes their work look so similar to that of their American post-modernist peers. But however much their purposefully ambiguous and sometimes playful work resembles the kind of contemporary American art one finds in SoHo galleries these days (and much of it has already been seen there, primarily at the Phyllis Kind Gallery), its reasons for being are not the same. These artists have little of the world-weary cynicism that results from a fashion-conscious marketplace. Their theoretical basis is formed not so much by the notion of the disappearance of reality as by the all-too-real reality of their immediate artistic and political situation.
Some of the best-known figures in today's Soviet art are included in the show. Ilya Kabakov, for example, who has been a member of the Soviet Artist's Union since Nikita S. Khrushchev's time, is represented by paintings and a room-sized work called ''He Lost His Mind, Undressed, Ran Away Naked.'' The wordy, debris-filled installation has a narrative that concerns the fate of an obsessed, paranoid Moscow apartment dweller.
The paintings of Ivan Chuikov, Eric Bulatov and Eduard Gorokhovsky - all veterans of the New York gallery scene - are here as well. Each, in his own way, makes use of the Socialist Realist style, turning it into a form of a bad joke. The most vivid demonstration of this adaptive urge is Mr. Gorokhovsky's ''Two Thousand Four Hundred and Eighty Eight Portraits of Lenin'' (1988), a photo-silk-screen in which the thousands of tiny Lenin heads form a single, monumental portrait of Stalin.
However, the show's main energy comes from a slightly younger generation of artists. Igor Kopystiansky's ''Construction'' (1990) employs a traditional style of painting, but his 19th-century genre scenes are brushed on walls, floor and several free-standing pylons. Svetlana Kopystiansky's installation in the same room, ''Library,'' is gorgeous in an equally polished but more Minimalist way. Consisting of a wall of more than 100 open books displayed in individual wooden boxes, the work creates a tension between the autonomy of each volume and the sculptural mass of the whole.
Ms. Kopystiansky's interest in combining verbal and visual experience is echoed elsewhere in the show, by the inked-over newspapers painted by Dmitri Prigov and the lettered oil paintings of Igor Makarevich. For others, painting is about symbolism. Simon Faibisovich fashions photo-realist conundrums like ''Das Ist die Frage,'' an interior shaped by sunlight in the form of a question mark. In Oleg Vassilyev's ''Landscape and Space'' paintings, bright floodlights bleach out the center of an empty vista. Natalya Nesterova's ''Recollection of Germany'' shows three men looking back at a distant yacht.
Few of these artists are represented in the recently organized touring exhibition of contemporary Soviet Conceptual art ''Between Spring and Summer,'' currently at the Tacoma (Wash.) Art Museum and bound for Boston and Des Moines. This is at once a sign of the breadth and depth of Soviet cultural life today and a symptom of how much of it remains unexamined and unsorted in America.
 
Longo in Hartford
As the mid-career retrospective of some 50 drawings, sculptures, videos and mixed-media works at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford confirms, Robert Longo is an ambitious artist who is at his best when he treads the borderline of hyperbole and arrogance. Prone to firing major artillery at small targets, he nevertheless is capable of expressing emotions beyond the reach of many of his contemporaries.
The line between success and failure in Mr. Longo's work is always subject to redefinition. At the beginning of his career, in the late 1970's, it was a matter of finish: his ideas - about the ambiguities of masculinity, gesture and photographic representation - often overspilled their containers. More recently, now that he employs assistants to help in fabricating his drawings and sculptures - the situation is often reversed, and the containers threaten to become self-sufficient spectacles.
But there is a great deal of pleasure to be had in seeing the artist's efforts to walk the line, which he manages to do remarkably often in this show, which was organized by Howard N. Fox of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. His themes of faceless power, male dominance and urban anomie are familiar, but his stylistic decision to mimic their rhetoric without obvious irony gives the work its frightening charge.
In ''All You Zombies: Truth Before God,'' a bronze science-fiction figure turns slowly in front of a semi-circular painting of an opera house. The figure sports two sets of bared teeth, a bandolier of bullets, football shoulder pads and chain mail; as if this were not enough, a pair of lightning bolts issues from his backside. Invisible motors make an unholy din in ''Running Dumb: The Theory of the Brake,'' a 10-foot-long stack of steel rollers covered in gold leaf.
Compared to these hybrid works - Mr. Longo calls them ''combines,'' using Robert Rauschenberg's term - ''Corporate Wars: Wall of Influence'' seems a model of restraint. ''Corporate Wars'' epitomizes the artist at his best: an aluminum frieze of warring, punching businessmen and women, modeled after Michelangelo's ''Battle of the Centaurs,'' is flanked by two lacquered black forms that suggest modernist skyscrapers. The piece suggests the fraught emotions of corporate life symbolically and, for Mr. Longo, economically.
Indeed, some of the show's best moments come when Mr. Longo is at his most abstract. ''Joker: Force of Choice,'' a steel wall sculpture that forms the shape of a cross, verges on being a spiritual logotype. ''Black Planet (for A. Z.),'' with its trail of rubbery cords falling from a steel disk, evokes a damaged and weeping Earth.
But even at his most restrained, the artist has been hard put to make sculpture that can match the force of his ''Men in the Cities'' drawings of the early 1980's. Done with the aid of a commercial illustrator and larger than life, these show single figures mysteriously engaged in what seems to be a particularly animated dance. Tall and iconic, the drawings provide a space of reflection in a show that begins with the whine of electric motors and ends with the chug of the hyperactive, hyperfashionable rock videos that Mr. Longo has directed in recent years.
 
Photos in Stamford
''American Photography, 1839-1900,'' the survey at the Whitney Museum of American Art's branch in Stamford, has two major virtues. One is that it includes many of the acknowledged masterworks of the medium, pictures that are often seen in reproduction but seldom in the flesh. The second is that it traces the evolution of photography from its most primitive beginnings to a state of elaboration and diversity of means, styles and social functions.
The show was organized by Janet Burger of the International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House in Rochester. Any exhibition that numbers among its 50 daguerreotypes portraits of Henry Clay, Stephen Douglas and Daniel Webster, as well as John Whipple's 1852 portrait of the moon, is not to be missed. Add to these weathered splendors such paper pictures as Carleton Watkins's 1861 view of Yosemite Falls, Alexander Gardner's grisly image of the execution of the Lincoln assassination conspirators, A. J. Russell's staged tableau of the joining of the transcontinental railroad, and two intimate, domestic scenes by Oliver Wendell Holmes, and one has an exhibition of unsurpassed accomplishment.
What is missing among all the masterpieces, however, is much evidence of photography's pedestrian presence in 19th-century life. There are no tintypes, ambrotypes or other common coinage from portraiture's mammoth mint; instead, there are ''imperial size'' portraits by Mathew Brady of the nation's social cream. The dawning of the age of the snapshot at the century's end is barely hinted at in Frederick Fargo Church's 1890 image of George Eastman photographing aboard ship with an early Kodak camera. Instead, ''American Photography'' ends with a flurry of Pictorialism, photography's most refined and artistically self-conscious moment.

Seeing the Landscape At Its Best and Worst

The Experience of Place
By Tony Hiss
233 pages. Illustrated. Alfred A. Knopf.
$19.95.
Its subtitle to the contrary, ''The Experience of Place'' is not really ''a completely new way of looking at and dealing with our radically changing cities and countryside.'' It is a way that has been used for years wherever people have been piled up in cities, here and abroad. (The Japanese are very good at it.) It is the sort of adjustment that may well occur whenever condos rise above the fruited plain and wherever the majesty of purple mountains overlooks acres and acres of free parking. 
For when developers march on meadows and fields, and only the well-to-do dare aspire to the privacy of a bosky garden, or to live within an easy walk of a working farm, what else is there to do but concentrate very hard on the shards of beauty that remain? To do it as Tony Hiss wants, we must embrace the illusion of countryside if there is no countryside, and think about the city lovingly so that in the mind's eye it always remains as we want to remember it: civilizing, comforting and offering its own special kind of privacy.
The only question is whether most have the will to engage in a kind of observation that would bring out the best in the physical reality of America. Mr. Hiss, a writer for The New Yorker, does this very well indeed. He can look through the enormous damage that has been done to American cities and countryside since World War II and fix upon the good that has survived; he acknowledges the sins of the past, which continue even now, but he does not dwell on them. He uses his estimable powers as an observer to take us to some familiar places, and he challenges us to regard them as he does.
Times Square, for example. Yes, he says, there are crime and sleaze there, but there are also the ingredients that originally made the place work, and aren't these the things we should at least try to look at? He describes the square in detail and talks about the activities in it that continue to serve the interests of the legitimate theater. He reveals the places where, he assures us, he can still get a feeling of privacy, and he recalls the way sunlight used to fall into the square before some of its most recent skyscrapers were built, ''reflecting off the dust in the air, making the air seem to be charged with light and showing it as a three-dimensional form.'' He later concedes, though, that ''what used to be a bowl automatically brimming over with light now feels increasingly isolated from its sources and more like an oddly shaped bucket that's starting to drop down a well and sink away from the reach of the sun.''
And then there is Grand Central Terminal. Again, he gives an extended description of what it is like to walk through one of its passageways: ''I felt hurried along. My breathing was shallow and slightly constricted; my neck and shoulders were tight. I could smell cookies and pizza baking in the shops around me, but it seemed difficult to look to either side.''
Later, entering the Main Concourse: ''I could no longer distinguish the sounds of my own footsteps. All the sounds that reached me seemed to have been fused into a single sound. Vast and quiet, it seemed to be evenly distributed throughout the great room. This sound, pleasant in all its parts, regular in all its rhythms, and humorous and good-natured, seemed also to have buttoned me into some small, silent bubble of space. I felt that I wasn't quite walking but was paddling - or somehow propelling - this bubble across the floor.'' ''The Experience of Place'' is filled with such etherealness, as well as hard reporting on what advocates for environmental and urban health are thinking these days.
But before one begins to appreciate what Mr. Hiss has created, it would seem mandatory to remember some of the other observers, famous and not so famous, who have come before him, especially in the last 30 years: Lewis Mumford, whose ''City in History'' made it clear that there were parallels between downsliding Rome of yore and New York City of 1961; and Jane Jacobs, who celebrated humanist values and diversity in her ''Death and Life of Great American Cities,'' also published in 1961. Richard J. Whalen's anger seemed justified when, in 1964, he attacked New York's greed and short-sightedness in ''A City Destroying Itself.'' By 1985, there was wistfulness and a tightly controlled ire in Lorraine B. Diehl's ''Late, Great Penn Station,'' which meticulously detailed the ignominy and economic folly that attended the destruction of one of New York's most impressive public places.
There is much to enjoy in Mr. Hiss's book. But his message is disturbing, too, because it shows that the nation did not hear Mr. Mumford and the others who tried to instruct Americans in what it means to be true stewards of the land. Even worse, some of the alarms that were sounded by an older generation of environmentalists and urbanologists are yet to be responded to.
Mr. Hiss suggests that if the land is developed carefully, people ''can build on a landscape, that is, without eating away it.'' But he also acknowledges that New York State lost nearly a million acres of farmland between 1982 and 1987, and that 372 of the most productive farming counties in the nation, representing more than half of the best such counties we have, are ''either already within or directly adjacent to metropolitan areas.'' Americans still do not have a very good track record in protecting such places.
Mr. Hiss tells of a research program in England intended to ''investigate how schools can restructure a number of paved and windswept schoolyards to give them a country look and so provide 'a complete environment for learning.' '' His readers may be glad to know it, but many of them will think that America could have had so much more.

HEADLINE: Judge Rejects Keating Suit; Sees 'Looting' of Lincoln

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 23

 BODY:
In a blistering opinion, a Federal judge today dismissed the lawsuit brought by Charles H. Keating Jr. to regain control of the failed Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. The judge said that the Government seizure of Lincoln was ''fully justified'' and that the actions of Mr. Keating and his associates amounted to a ''looting'' of the institution.
In handing the Government an across-the-board victory, Federal District Judge Stanley Sporkin found that Mr. Keating and other Lincoln directors engaged in ''unsafe and unsound practices'' that warranted the seizure last year by regulators. The judge said Mr. Keating and other executives had executed a series of improper transactions to funnel money from Lincoln to its parent company, the American Continental Corporation. 
The ruling, the first significant court decision to examine Mr. Keating's management of Lincoln and its takeover, came in a much-publicized lawsuit that Mr. Keating had filed to regain control of the institution, which was seized on April 14, 1989.
At more than $2 billion, the bailout is one of the costliest on record, and Mr. Keating's campaign contributions to lawmakers and his flamboyant personal style have made him a symbol of the savings and loan excesses leading to the nation's worst financial crisis. Mr. Keating has attributed Lincoln's demise to the Government, saying that regulators engaged in a vendetta against him.
 
'Not a Pretty Picture'
''What has emerged is not a pretty picture,'' Judge Sporkin said in his opinion. ''It is abundantly clear that A.C.C.'s officials abused their positions. Bluntly speaking, their actions amounted to a looting of Lincoln.''
''This was not done crudely,'' the judge wrote. ''Indeed, it was done with a great deal of sophistication. The transactions were all made to have an aura of legality.''
The judge's only criticism of the Government appeared in a footnote in which he said it was ''inexplicable and clearly inappropriate'' for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, in the face of threats of lawsuits, to have agreed to transfer the investigation of Lincoln and ignored an earlier critical report of the institution by its San Francisco branch.
''This is an extremely important victory in a very significant case,'' said T. Timothy Ryan Jr., director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, the successor agency to the bank board. Harris Weinstein, the agency's chief counsel, said the ruling reinforced the view that Mr. Keating and the senior management operated Lincoln ''primarily for their own benefit at the expense of the institution and its depositors.''
One of Mr. Keating's lawyers, Robert K. Huffman, declined to comment on the opinion or say whether an appeal would be made.
 
Directors Criticized
Moving broadly beyond the Keating claims, Judge Sporkin also questioned why lawyers and accountants at Lincoln and American Continental had failed to stop or at least disassociate themselves from the improper transactions.
Judge Sporkin said the Government's evidence proved ''beyond question'' that the main purpose of many transactions ''was to create paper profits to 'window dress' the financial statements of Lincoln and its parent.''
''The entire board of directors, in addition to Keating and the others that controlled and operated Lincoln, must be held strictly accountable.''
Exploring a tax agreement plan in which Lincoln transferred more than $94 million to American Continental purportedly to take advantage of loss carry-forwards at the parent, the judge called it a ''dishonest scheme.'' He said it was ''nothing more than a clever but impermissible way of looting Lincoln by upstreaming funds from Lincoln to A.C.C.''
''Plaintiffs used the concept of tax sharing as a way of dipping into Lincoln's coffers,'' he added.
 
Land Sale Criticized
The judge said that another transaction involving the sale of 20,000 acres of land outside Phoenix by a Lincoln subsidiary was engineered solely to enable Lincoln to transfer $4.4 million to American Continental.
While Mr. Keating appeared confident throughout much of the proceedings that led to today's decision, few lawyers had said they thought he would be handed a favorable ruling from Judge Sporkin, who earlier in his legal career had vigorously prosecuted corporations as director of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission. His decision today represents a small piece of the enormous legal battle between the Government and Mr. Keating.
Mr. Keating is under parallel investigations that are being conducted by a grand jury in Los Angeles, the S.E.C. and the Internal Revenue Service. A civil lawsuit was filed two weeks ago by the Office of Thrift Supervision against Mr. Keating and others seeking $40.9 million. Earlier, a racketeering case was brought by regulators naming Mr. Keating as a defendant and asking for $1.1 billion.
 
Bondholders Suing
He is also the target of lawsuits brought by bondholders of American Continental, many of whom are elderly and say they were defrauded by sales made to them in the lobbies of Lincoln branches. The company is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.
Mr. Keating has struck back at regulators in other lawsuits, but the Sporkin proceeding stands out, not only because it addressed many legal questions for the first time, but also because it served as a critical turning point in the public relations battle between Mr. Keating and regulators.
Mr. Keating's lawsuit provided him with a powerful forum to strike back at the Government, putting regulators on the defensive and introducing important pieces of evidence that at the least raised questions about how officials had handled the affair.
 
Took the Spotlight
At the same time, Judge Sporkin's willingness to question both the Government and Mr. Keating at great length over more than six months emboldened the Phoenix developer to move into the public spotlight. Only a month before the Sporkin hearings began last December, the normally loquacious Mr. Keating sought to maintain a low profile. He declined to answer any questions before a Congressional committee examining his campaign contributions to five senators who regulators say intervened on his behalf, and instead invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.
Once the hearings were under way and it became clear that Judge Sporkin would permit Mr. Keating wide latitude, he radically changed his tack, appearing on television and arranging interviews with virtually anyone who would listen.
For hours, Mr. Keating would engage in a casual colloquy with Judge Sporkin, who seemed to be enjoying the event, often asking questions as he leaned back in his chair, almost supine, and stared at the ceiling, his glasses perched atop his head. The judge questioned, interrogated, debated and chatted with Mr. Keating during several days of testimony from January to May.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Why the Broad Selloff in Oil Stocks?

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Even as commodity traders extended the upward march of oil prices in the futures market, investors continued to unload their holdings in oil companies and oilfield service companies, for the third consecutive day.
Among the oil stocks, Texaco fell $3.625 a share today, to $60.125; Chevron lost $3, to $75.625; Mobil declined $2.375, to $62.875, and Occidental Petroleum fell $1.75, to $22.375. In the oilfield service sector, Halliburton lost $2.875, to $50.625; Schlumberger fell $2.125, to $61.125, and Baker Hughes slipped $1.875, to $29.125.
This broad and unexpected selling wave began Tuesday with Wall Street's growing conviction that a shooting war along the Saudi-Iraqi border was imminent. Price declines have been especially deep in the oilfield service sector, with one mutual fund specializing in oilfield stocks, the Fidelity Select Energy Service fund, falling by 8 percent in the last three days, to $14.07. 
 
Rise in Prices of Oil Futures
Most of the attention on oil prices has been focused on the futures market. The contract for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed at $31.93 today, up 71 cents. But the posted price for oil bought by Texas refineries has also soared. Producers are getting $29 a barrel this week, compared with $15.50 as recently as July 13. Analysts said those prices are certain to translate into higher third-quarter revenues for most of the industry.
So why are investors shedding energy stocks with crude oil prices at their highest level in nearly five years?
Anthony Banham, managing director of Simmons & Company International, an investment firm in Houston, said the selling was a logical response after the large price gains posted this year by many energy issues. ''My guess is you are seeing a correction to a knee-jerk runup in oil prices,'' he said. ''There really is no reason for us to be trading for some extended period of time in the $30-a-barrel range.''
 
Nervousness Over Profits
Other analysts and investment bankers attributed the selloff to nervous money managers. As the collapse of the broader market gathered momentum, these analysts said, the money managers came under pressure to take profits where they could to offset mounting losses in other issues. Profits in the energy sectors were among the fattest on their books this year.
Another reason is mounting uncertainty within the oil industry itself about demand and pricing in the coming months. Many oil executives are concerned that prices may retreat just as quickly, possibly below $20 a barrel, after such a rapid rise.
''When $18 oil becomes $25 oil, it's a good thing for oil stocks,'' said Thomas A. Petrie, chairman of Petrie, Parkman & Company, an investment firm in Denver. ''But somewhere between $32 and $60 it becomes too much of a good thing, and major imponderables loom on the investment horizon.''
Some important issues include how much demand for oil and gasoline would be dampened by high oil prices and a severe recession, whether Congress would agree to a guaranteed, minimum price to encourage higher spending for drilling and, most critically, how soon a price collapse would follow a price spike.
Bryan Jacoboski, an oil analyst at Paine Webber Inc. in New York, said money managers wrestling with these issues should be betting on energy stocks. Instead, many have not accepted the view that oil prices could average or exceed $25 a barrel or more in 1991 because that would require them to reshape their stock portfolios drastically, he said. ''If crude prices do no more than stay where they are now, people should be buying oil stocks with both hands,'' he said.
He recommended the purchase of Unocal, Murphy Oil, Texaco and Amerada Hess. ''A lot of scenarios could lead to lower prices than where we are today, but prices will still be higher than where we were before the invasion,'' he said.
With worldwide oil demand rising and production capacity in OPEC strained, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait had planned to expand production from their oilfields in coming years. But one consequence of the Iraqi invasion in Kuwait, Mr. Jacoboski said, was that ''about the only thing one can say with 100 percent confidence is that capacity expansions will be delayed.''
Suzanne L. Cook, an oilfield service analyst at Merrill Lynch in Dallas, issued a buy recommendation this morning for several big companies in the oilfield service sector. In an interview, she said investors had a chance to buy into the sector before stock values of oil service companies resumed an upward climb that had begun last year.
''In this already somewhat tight market,'' she said, speaking of oilfield services, ''we are now introducing higher oil prices and stimulus for higher levels of activity for drilling.'' She added that Merrill Lynch would soon raise its earnings estimates in the industry by 20 percent for 1991. Her recommendations included Dresser Industries, Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes.

HEADLINE: 'Parking' Spaces for Jittery Dollars

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
In the midst of the Persian Gulf oil crisis, much of the world's money is fleeing to safe harbors in Britain, Australia and Canada.
These three currencies have become the haven for millions of dollars from worried investors and, as a result, have rocketed to recent highs against the American dollar. The reason is energy. These countries have it. 
Normally, one would not expect sterling or the Australian dollar or the Canadian dollar to provide protection for the troubled money of the world.
Traditionally, sterling and the Australian dollar have both been volatile, burning many investors who put their trust in them. The Canadian dollar is less volatile, but, like the other two, is a high-yield currency, supported by high local interest rates that attract foreign investors. Such high-yield currencies have traditionally meant more risk, something investors would not normally look for during a confrontation like that between Iraq and most of the rest of the world.
But in this situation, these countries and currencies have something else. They have energy at home - oil, coal and natural gas - and are net sellers of energy abroad. This gives them a cushion in the current crisis from the negative economic impact of higher oil prices and the threat of supply disruptions. And that gives investors some measure of the extra comfort sought when financial markets are in turmoil.
 
'Best of Both Worlds'
''You are getting the best of both worlds,'' said Robert A. White, vice president of First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles. ''You are getting a high yield, and you are putting your money into a country that will benefit from the higher oil prices.''
''People are parking cash,'' said Francoise Soares-Kemp, vice president at Credit Suisse in New York. ''Its a real non-brainer reaction,'' she added. ''People are just chasing yields, and on top of that these countries are long on the resources.''
The flight to these currencies has been swift. Since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, sterling is up 5.3 percent, the Australian dollar is up 5 percent and the Canadian dollar is up 2 percent.
This invasion rally has pushed the British pound, which closed at $1.9555 in New York yesterday, to its highest level since November 1981. And the Canadian dollar, which reached 88.55 cents late yesterday, touched its highest point since July 1978. And for the Australian dollar, its 83.51 cents to the dollar was the best it has done since February 1989.
All three currencies jumped sharply yesterday with the pound up more than three cents from $1.9239 Wednesday, the Australian dollar up almost a penny and a half from 82.04 cents, and the Canadian dollar gaining almost half a penny, from 88.08 cents.
 
Swiss Stability
The dollar also continued to fall against other currences yesterday, passing its all-time low against the Swiss franc and falling to a new low against the German mark. In late trading in New York, the dollar was at 1.2560 Swiss francs, down sharply from 1.2780 Wednesday and its lowest level since World War II. The previous closing low in New York was 1.2690 on Dec. 31, 1987.
The Swiss franc is helped by its traditional status as a stable currency, which has long attracted investors, and, now, its generally lower dependence on imported energy than other Continental countries, especially West Germany. While not in the interest-rate class of the high-yielders, the Swiss franc, with three-month interest rates at 8.75 percent, is even yielding a little more than a dollar investment.
Against the mark yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5444, down from 1.5589 on Wednesday and below the record low set last Friday of 1.5495. Before that, the lowest level since 1948, when the mark was created, was 1.5700 on Dec. 31, 1987. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was basically unchanged, ending at 146.19 against 146.15 Wednesday.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which is an average of the dollar against a basket of 10 major foreign currencies, fell yesterday to 84.98, its lowest level since July 28, 1980. The index is used as the basis for a futures contract traded on the Financial Instrument Exchange in New York.
In the current Persian Gulf crisis, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar have gotten stronger, although their central banks have eased interest rates a little recently. This is in part because the jump in oil prices and the expected increase in inflation at home mean there is little chance that rates will be eased again soon. Canadian short-term rates are about 12.85 percent, and Australian rates are about 13.75 percent.
 
'Comfortable in London'
In England, where short-term rates are around 14.88 percent, there is also no immediate expectation of lower rates.
John W. Baker, senior vice president at Bank Julius Baer & Company in London, said much of the money that is going into these currencies appears to be coming from Japan and the Middle East. ''A lot of investors from the Middle East feel comfortable in London,'' he said, referring to the buying of pounds.
Britain, Canada and Australia are all net exporters of energy. Based on 1989 data, Australia, which has significant coal resources and also produces oil, has net energy exports equal to abvout 65 percent of its consumption. Canada, a big producer of natural gas and oil, has net exports of about 18 percent. Britain, a major oil and coal producer, is a bigger energy consumer, but still had net energy exports equal to about 1.5 percent of consumption.
This run to the British pound is similar to the lift it got in the last oil crisis of 1979-80. Then the pound, which averaged $1.92 in 1978, moved up to an average of $2.12 in 1979 and $2.33 in 1980. But neither the Canadian dollar nor the Australian dollar moved higher then. The Canadian dollar actually declined from an average of 88 cents in 1978 to 86 cents in 1980 and the Australian dollar held relatively steady, averaging $1.12 in 1978 and $1.12 in 1980.

Trade Obstacles Among Africans

BYLINE: By Jane Perlez

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya

 BODY:
On the edge of Nairobi's industrial park sits one of the most visible manufacturing ventures in Kenya. Founded after independence in 1963 by the Jumas, an Asian family who came to Kenya from Uganda, the company, Orbitsports, makes soccer balls, rugby balls - indeed, all kinds of balls - dart boards, boxing gloves, and a wide range of sports clothing and leisure wear. Its soccer balls were used in the recent World Cup matches in Rome.
''From here we send to France, Italy, the United States,'' said Nizar Juma, the managing director. 
Orbitsports is an African success story. But it is also a telling example of why trade among African countries is extremely difficult. Orbitsports has grown because of its exports outside the continent.
High-minded economists from the West stream into Africa suggesting ways that countries could not only export to the lucrative markets of Europe and the United States but also trade with each other. The experience of Orbitsports, which is also the only Adidas franchise in sub-Saharan Africa, might show the economists some of the obstacles.
In the beginning, Mr. Juma said, Orbitsports did well on African business alone. Now, 23 years later, more than half the company's trade is with Europe, where it was recently able to outprice and outsell the Adidas franchise in Hungary.
Mr. Juma's hand-stitched, top-of-the-line soccer balls command a lower price in Europe than in Africa. But a multitude of political and economic problems gave him the incentive to search for business away from Africa.
First, the company had protracted problems getting its bills paid in Africa. A few years ago Libya, then one of the company's biggest customers, owed more than $1 million. It took diplomatic efforts to get the bill paid.
Second, even though a number of East African nations have a preferential trade agreement, jealousies are pervasive. Thus, neighboring Tanzania prefers to buy its sports equipment in Europe rather than to ''make Kenya rich,'' Mr. Juma said. ''They pay 45 percent more for Adidas in Europe, and then the freight back, even though the products are made next door,'' he added.
Also the idea of doing business across the continent - from Kenya in the east to the Ivory Coast in the west - makes Mr. Juma laugh. ''If I want to export to the Ivory Coast, it's often easier out of Paris,'' he said. There is no direct flight to the Ivory Coast from Kenya.
The goods must pass through Lagos, Nigeria, perhaps Africa's most corrupt airport, where Mr. Juma reckons about 75 percent of any shipment is likely to be stolen. Even from one East African country to another, transport is a headache.
Mr. Juma's soccer balls do well in Europe because the quality is high - thanks largely to the stitching by the 500 Kenyan workers - and the price is right. The workers receive a basic 2,200 Kenyan shillings a month, or about $100 at the current exchange rate of 22 shillings to the dollar, for a five-day, 40-hour week with three weeks of paid vacation a year.
But where his product does well on quality and price, the efficiency is poor in comparison with Adidas's Asian franchises. Part of the reason is a tradition that workers go home to their rural villages the day after payday. On that day, there is 30 percent absenteeism.
The market within Kenya is good for Orbitsports. The company provides 90 percent of the country's sporting equipment, and the brand name is a household word, at least in Nairobi, where the company has invested in extensive newspaper and radio advertising to convince consumers that Orbitsports products, particularly track suits, are as smart as any imported brand.
Snob appeal among Kenyans is on the rise, Mr. Juma said. So with a bit of marketing inventiveness, Orbitsports came out with another label, L'Equipe - which has a foreign sound. ''Friends come up to me in their track suits with L'Equipe written on the front and apologize for not having bought Orbitsports,'' Mr. Juma said. ''I just smile and say, 'That's O. K.' ''
Nevertheless, Mr. Juma sees future growth more and more in exports, especially as American importers look for replacements for Asian products that are subject to quotas. The Kenyan Government is beginning to offer incentives to exporters. An export processing zone is being established in the industrial park not far from the Orbitsports factory, where manufacturers will be able to import raw materials duty free as long as the finished product is exported.
''We've had inquiries from American companies,'' Mr. Juma said, as he headed for a trip to the United States. ''I think we can fill a gap on the clothing side.''

HEADLINE: 'Junk Bond' Prices Plunge In Reaction to Stocks' Fall

BYLINE: By ANISE C. WALLACE

 BODY:
Heavy selling sent prices of high-risk, high-yield ''junk bonds'' sharply lower yesterday as traders reacted to the uncertainty in the Middle East and the sharp decline in the stock market.
''It's a nightmare,'' the head trader at one Wall Street firm said. ''The market was very, very illiquid.'' 
Prices of many junk bonds were down at least a point, or $10 for every $1,000 face amount. Some zero-coupon bonds, which pay no current interest, fell by much greater amounts. For instance, Burlington Industries bonds fell 3 points, to $35.50, and Fort Howard bonds dropped 3 points, to $43, traders said.
 
Effect on RJR Nabisco Issues
Bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. were hit hard, as were the company's warrants, which are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The RJR junk bonds due in 2009 dropped 2.125 points, to $106.25, down 12 points from the high in July. The company's bonds due in 2007 fell 3.75 points, to $80.75, down 16 points from the July high. The warrants, which can be exchanged for common shares of the company's stock, fell to $4.75, down one-half point.
Since the beginning of August, the First Boston High Yield Index has declined about 4 percent, compared with a 10 percent decline in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and a 5 percent drop in the price of 30-year Treasury bonds, said Sam DeRosa-Farag, an analyst at the firm. The price of the average bond in the index is 75 cents on the dollar, compared with 98 cents a year ago, he said.
Wall Street traders said the junk bond market was acting in concert with the stock market as investors worried about a recession. Additionally, Wall Street dealers were marking prices of bonds down on selling, or anticipated selling, by mutual funds that must raise cash to meet shareholder redemptions.
 
'Junk' Funds Lose Investors
A number of organizations that operate junk bond funds, including T. Rowe Price Associates, Fidelity Investments and the Vanguard Group, said this week that investors have been switching their cash out of the funds in recent weeks.
Professionals at investment management firms that own junk bonds complain that Wall Street dealers are not willing to provide capital for their trades, making prices of these thinly traded securities more volatile.
''It looks like dealers have thrown in the towel and repriced the market,'' said David A. Briggs, senior trader at Federated Securities in Pittsburgh.

HEADLINE: Venezuela to Increase Oil Production by 25%

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Venezuela, the largest oil producer in Latin America, has announced it will raise production by 25 percent to offset oil lost because of the embargo on Iraq and Kuwait.
Venezuela will increase production by 350,000 barrels a day in September, the nation's Minister of Energy and Mines, Celestino Armas, told a Venezuelan congressional committee here Wednesday night. By December, production is scheduled to rise by a total of 500,000 barrels a day, to 2.5 million barrels, he said. 
 
A Big Windfall
Speaking hours after world oil prices rose above $30 a barrel, Mr. Armas calculated that Venezuela stands to gain an extra $1.2 billion to $2.4 billion in oil revenues this year. Last year, Venezuela earned $9 billion, largely from selling crude oil at an average price of $14.62 a barrel.
The windfall is expected to wipe out the financially troubled nation's 1990 budget deficit of $1 billion.
The minister's statement appears to end three weeks of indecision here on energy policy. Venezuela's President, Carlos Andres Perez, reportedly promised the United States on Aug. 7 that Venezuela would increase oil production by 500,000 barrels. But he has said his country, a founding member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, needed the group's permission to exceed an OPEC quota of 1.945 million barrels of crude oil.
In recent days, it has become clear that a full OPEC meeting has been blocked by a militant group of oil producers led by Algeria, Libya and Iran, which oppose higher production.
On Monday, Mr. Perez, long a spokesman for the third world, expressed concern that the soaring price of oil could hurt the world economy.
''It is not our plan to allow this crisis to skyrocket oil prices and to cause serious damage to the international economy,'' the President said. ''Venezuela feels it is her obligation to look after our clients and to safeguard the equilibrium of the world oil market.''
 
Big Supplier for the United States
Venezuela's production increase is good news for the United States. In recent years, the South American country has alternated with Saudi Arabia as the largest source of crude oil for the United States. In 1989, Venezuela sold the United States about a million barrels of crude oil a day - about 18 percent of America's total crude-oil imports.
During the 1973 Arab oil embargo, Venezuela sharply increased oil production and exports to the United States. This time, Venezuelan public opinion is again heavily in favor of increasing production.
Frustration over a prolonged recession in Venezuela, a country recently accustomed to the highest standard of living in Latin America, is bolstering the push for more production. Low oil prices forced Mr. Perez to adopt unpopular austerity measures shortly after he took office in February 1989. About 300 people were killed in ensuing riots.
Last year, Venezuela's gross national product collapsed by 8 percent, partly because of the austerity measures and partly because of adjustment to new free-market policies. Until the recent jump in oil prices, economic growth was expected to be flat this year.
''This little war is a bonanza for us,'' Teodoro Petkoff, a socialist politician, said in an interview, echoing the sentiments of many Venezuelans. ''We are doing better off the misfortune of others.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Bonds Decline Further

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The selloff in the credit markets continued yesterday and interest rates rose, as dealers reacted to a further rise in oil prices by marking down the price of most Treasury securities.
''The market has one eye on oil and the other on wire reports coming out of the Middle East,'' said Daniel Callahan, director at Deutschebank Government Securities Inc. ''But there is very little liquidity in the market.''
Despite the continued pessimism in the market, Mr. Callahan and others said that at this juncture it would be unwise to make big bets that the rise in interest rates would continue unabated.
 
'You Have to Behave'
Given recent events, traders were forced to cast an extremely practical eye on prospects of war and the impact on credit markets. 
''At these levels you have to behave yourself,'' one government bond trader said. ''The Street expects this whole Middle East thing will come to a solution pretty soon. And while war would be negative initially, how the market moves after that would depend on news of how it is going.''
The price decline was recorded in issues with maturities of more than two years. The continued sharp slide in stock prices supported prices of short-term securities, as investors appeared to move some money out of equities and into short-term notes and bills.
The short end of the maturity spectrum was firm despite the fact that the Treasury auctioned $10.5 billion worth of one-year bills yesterday. Given the market's extreme nervousness, injecting that much new supply in the market could have pushed up short-term interest rates.
At the auction, the one-year bills were sold at an average discount rate of 7.40 percent, up from the average rate of 7.34 percent at the last one-year bill sale on July 26.
''The fact that we had a bill auction and that prices are firm is a positive sign,'' another bond trader said. ''But everybody is afraid of what might happen Friday and over the weekend.''
 
'Impossible to Trade'
Dana Johnson, chief money market economist at the First National Bank of Chicago, said: ''In these circumstances it is impossible to trade the fixed-income markets. They are subject to the latest rumor or headline coming out of the Middle East or any movement in oil prices.''
By late yesterday, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 96 9/32, down 21/32, to yield 9.11 percent, compared with 9.04 percent late Wednesday.
Among note issues, the 8 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 98 1/2 in late trading, down 10/32, to yield 8.98 percent. The 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at 99 9/32, down 6/ 32, to yield 8.66 percent. But the 8 percent two-year notes rose by 1/32, to a late offered rate of 99 19/32, to yield 8.22 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates fell slightly.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.51 percent, down 6 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. And six-month bill rates fell by a basis point, to a late offered rate of 7.49 percent.
The sense among market participants that the Persian Gulf crisis would break out into war very soon was heightened yesterday when Iraq said that a failure by foreign governments to abandon their embassies in Kuwait would be regarded as ''an act of aggression.''
Scores of diplomats and their families left Kuwait yesterday, but the United States and a number of other Western nations have made it clear that they have no intention of completely abandoning their embassies.
Although an outbreak of war would almost certainly feed inflation fears by pushing oil prices well above the level of $32 a barrel that they reached yesterday, some analysts said the Federal Reserve might react to the start of a war by easing monetary policy.
 
Unpleasant Alternatives
''If war breaks out, the least worst alternative for the Fed is to loosen up,'' said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International.
''It would not work miracles,'' he said, ''but in a war you need more liquidity, and the evil the Fed must absolutely avoid is recession. Compared to increased inflation, that is the greatest risk.''
Activity in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate bonds and tax-exempt municipal bonds was light again yesterday as prices continued to decline. And the continued slide in stock prices also pushed down the prices of high-yield ''junk bonds.''
Corporate bond traders said that prices of most actively quoted issues fell by about 1/2 point.
The decline in the tax-exempt market was more severe: market participants said that prices of most issues fell by a range of 1 1/4 points to 1 1/2 points.
In the new-issue market, the Rohm & Haas Company offered $100 million of 10-year notes through an underwriting group led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The 9 7/8 percent notes, which mature Sept. 1, 2000, were priced at 99.53 to yield 9.95 percent, 95 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended Aug. 13. The report had no effect on prices in the credit markets.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of one-year Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales Drop By 4.7%

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks fell 4.7 percent in mid-August, a decline that analysts attributed to record high sales a year ago.
While analysts noted that overall demand for vehicles has been sluggish this year, they said that consumers appeared to be shrugging off the crisis in the Middle East.
''So far there seems to be no visible effect on car sales from gasoline problems or fears about the Middle East,'' said David Healey, an automotive analysts with Barclays de Zoete Weld in New York.
The nine manufacturers with American operations sold 160,633 domestically built cars in the Aug. 11-20 period, a decline of 10 percent from a year ago. Sales of vehicles classified as light trucks, which account for about a one-third of all vehicles sold, rose 5.1 percent. 
Cars sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.9 million, compared with 8.4 million in the comparable period of last year. Through July of this year, the seasonally adjusted sales rate was 6.6 million.
 
Japanese Auto Makers Gain
Overall sales of cars and light trucks by the Big Three domestic auto makers declined 9 percent in mid-August. The Japanese auto makers that produce cars in the United States posted a 38.8 percent increase in sales.
The General Motors Corporation reported that its car sales fell 10.1 percent, the smallest decline of the Big Three. The Ford Motor Company's car sales dropped 22.9 percent. The Chrysler Corporation reported a decline of 27.3 percent of its cars.
The major manufacturers said August sales were consistent with their forecasts in spite of the tension in the Persian Gulf. Analysts cautioned, however, that sales of cars could plummet if the price of gasoline continued to rise and the economy worsened.
Michael M. Luckey, president of the Luckey Consulting Group, said he was ''very cautious about the prospects for vehicle sales over the next 12 months.''
Mr. Luckey said he had reduced his forecast of 1991 light-vehicle sales to 13.5 million cars and trucks from his previous estimate of 14.2 million, because of the anticipated jolt to the economy of higher oil prices.
The auto industry is bracing for a drop in sales and executives said they are scrutinizing daily sales reports from dealers for signs that the car-buying public is holding back from making purchases.
Some auto executives expressed surprise that the threat of war in the Middle East had not caused auto sales to fall even further in August.
Joel Pitcoff, manager of research and analysis for Ford, said higher gasoline prices had not had a discernible effect on customers' choices of vehicles.
''There does not seem to be any massive stampede toward fuel-efficient vehicles,'' he said.
One measure that the Persian Gulf crisis has had little effect so far on auto sales was the strong sales performance of mini-vans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in mid-August. Higher gasoline prices are expected to affect sales of these vehicles first, because of their generally large engines and relatively inefficient designs.
Ford's light-truck sales jumped 19.3 percent, led by the strong sales gains of the company's Explorer sport-utility vehicle. G.M.'s light-truck sales also rose 1.3 percent while Chrysler reported a 9.5 percent decline.
Car and truck sales soared a year ago when manufacturers offered huge cash rebates and dealers slashed prices in an effort to sell a large backlog of unsold 1989 models to make room for 1990 models.
Dealers' inventories are lower this year, so there has not been as much pressure to offer discounts on unsold models.
The Toyota Motor Corporation sold 10,444 cars manufactured at its plant in Georgetown, Ky., a gain of 65.8 percent. The Honda Motor Company, which manufactures cars in Marysville, Ohio, posted car sales of 12,323 units, an increase of 26.6 percent. The Nissan Motor Company sold 3,129, up 3.9 percent, and 3,696 light trucks, a decline of 3.5 percent. Both vehicle lines are produced at Nissan's plant in Smyrna, Tenn.

HEADLINE: Even as Profits Fall, Home Builder Plans to Gain

 BODY:
The Ryland Group, the nation's second-largest home builder, took analysts by surprise earlier this summer when it said it would earn less in the second quarter than it had expected.
''Some people couldn't believe that what was happening to everybody else was happening to Ryland,'' said Melissa Cook, a New York-based analyst for Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd.
The Columbia, Md., builder of moderately priced houses has indeed started to smart from the real estate downturn that is already consolidating its rivals. With housing starts at their lowest level since the early 1980's, Ryland's net earnings declined 46 percent in the second quarter, to $5.7 million, from the corresponding period last year. 
 
Low-Risk, Conservative Strategy
But Ryland is showing the same resilience in the low point of this cycle as it has shown in previous slumps. Its success arises from a low-risk, conservative approach that limits the 23-year-old company's profits in boom times, but cushions it from losses during the downturns.
''They have a tremendous record of long-term performance and will come out ahead,'' said Kenneth Campbell of Audit Investments, a money management company in Montvale, N.J. ''You cannot kick them in the teeth now simply because they aren't going to perform this year.''
While hundreds of home builders have gone bankrupt since early 1989, Ryland, one of the few that are publicly traded, earned $170 million on revenues of $1.4 billion last year. Today, it is one of the least leveraged companies in the business, allowing it to borrow and expand at a time when competitors are retrenching.
 
Aiming to Gain Market Share
In fact, Charles E. (Ted) Peck, Ryland's chairman and chief executive, said the company aims to double shareholders' equity in each of the next five years - just as it has in every year for the last 17. It hopes to pick up market share as rivals weaken, luring home buyers with financing plans that few in the industry can afford to offer.
At the heart of its strategy is the fact that Ryland, unlike many home builders, rarely ties up its money in raw land. It buys finished lots already equipped with roads, sewage, water and utility systems. This method enables the company to get its money out of properties more quickly and reduces its borrowing costs and the risks of having an inventory of undeveloped lots when demand for new houses is slack, as it is today.
In the rare instance when it buys raw land - as it does in California because developed lots are scarce -Ryland minimizes its risk by buying the properties in joint ventures with financial institutions.
 
Debt-to-Equity Ratio: 0.5 to 1
''By using financial partners, they get only half the profits, but they can keep capital in lines they prefer,'' said Barbara K. Allen, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company. As a result, Ryland's debt-to-equity ratio is only 0.5 to 1, Ms. Allen said. By contrast, the top 100 builders had an average ratio of 8.4 to 1 last year, according to Builder magazine.
''Ryland may have missed out in some markets, but they are not suffering the catastrophic losses from borrowing that other builders are,'' Ms. Cook said. In fact, at a time when bank regulators are tightening commercial lending standards and developers of all stripes are finding it difficult to obtain financing, Ryland recently managed to complete a three-year revolving credit agreement with about a dozen banks for $265 million.
''I think our conservative practices offer them some reassurance,'' Mr. Peck said.
 
Cautious Top Executives
Ryland's conservative approach is in keeping with the backgrounds of its top executives, analysts say. While most home builders are headed by risk-taking entrepreneurs, Mr. Peck, who is 64 years old, worked for the Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation for 32 years before joining Ryland in 1981, where he considered himself ''an organizational man.'' He was most recently an executive vice president and director of Owens-Corning.
Before becoming president of Ryland in May, Roger W. Schipke, who is 53, was a senior vice president of the General Electric Company's $5.6 billion-a-year appliance division.
Mr. Schipke is scheduled to become chief executive in January and may become chairman later next year when Mr. Peck retires, analysts say. He is expected to carry on in the company's cautious tradition.
''He seems very much like Mr. Peck and takes a very analytical, well-thought-out approach to strategy,'' Ms. Allen said. ''Mr. Schipke is expected to continue the positive leadership left under Mr. Peck.''
 
Orders Down 21% in First Half
Yet, Ryland recently started to skid. The company booked 4,207 orders for homes (their average sale price last year was $116,000) during the first six months of this year, a 21 percent decline from the corresponding period in 1989.
And times are getting tougher. Housing starts have slipped to their lowest level since the recession of nearly a decade ago. Based on July's figures, new houses and apartments are being built at a seasonably adjusted annual rate of 1.15 million, the lowest level since September 1982.
And with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait earlier this month have come renewed fears of inflation and the prospect of higher interest rates, which would further hurt housing sales.
 
More Bankruptcies Expected
Analysts expect bankrupcties among home builders this year to top those in 1989, when 1,840 builders of single-family homes went under, according to statistics compiled by Dun & Bradstreet. That figure is scarcely 1 percent of the approximately 200,000 home builders nationwide, most of which build fewer than 10 houses a year.
Indeed, Ryland's stock has been trading at its lowest level in two years. Trading as high as $25.50 a share in 1989, it closed yesterday at $11.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, down 25 cents.
Yet Ryland says it is less vulnerable to the vagaries of regional economies than many of its rivals, most of which operate locally, because it builds houses in 17 states.
 
Shift of Regional Profits
While most builders began feeling the slowdown in demand in 1987, Ryland thrived until about a year ago because of its business in Washington, D.C., and California, where real estate values continued to increase until recently. Ryland is now likely to pin its hopes on regions experiencing slight rebounds like Phoenix, Houston and Denver.
Ryland says its ability to provide financing also gives it an edge. It is one of only about two dozen home builders to provide financing to its buyers. Ryland's mortgage unit has accounted for about 17 percent of the company's earnings for the last five years.
''The mortgage company is not a big-income item, but it definitely gives them an edge in times when credit is tight,'' said Michael Mead, vice president of research at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. in Baltimore.

HEADLINE: Durables Orders Up 2.9% in July

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Factory orders for durable goods rebounded 2.9 percent in July, the Government reported today.
The orders had declined 3.2 percent in June, and analysts said the zigzag performance this year indicates a listless manufacturing economy that could worsen because of the Middle East crisis.
''Orders have been bouncing up and down, and the net effect is a very weak upward trend,'' said Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI/McGraw-Hill, an economic research firm in Lexington, Mass. ''I don't actually see the industrial sector in decline, but there's not much stimulus for expansion there.'' 
 
'A Little Tougher'
Thomas Runiewicz, an economist with the WEFA Group in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., agreed, but added: ''Since the Middle Eastern crisis, we're in a different ball game. It makes things a little tougher than what we were experiencing before, and that was fairly flat.''
The Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods - relatively expensive items expected to last more than three years - totaled a seasonally adjusted $128.3 billion in July.
In the first half of the year, orders rose during three months and fell in the other three, with January posting a record drop of 10.5 percent. Over all, orders for the six months fell to $744.7 billion, down 1.5 percent from the comparable 1989 period.
The sluggishness in the manufacturing economy has cost 350,000 factory jobs since that sector peaked in March 1989, and 7,000 of those job losses occurred in July, according to Labor Department figures. Drops in orders normally result in production cutbacks and job layoffs.
Ms. Latta noted that the July rise in orders included a 5 percent increase in transportation orders, to $34.9 billion, which she said would not result in any immediate economic stimulus.
''A lot of that is aircraft, and that's production three, four, five years down the road, given the big backlogs that aircraft manufacturers have,'' she said.
Excluding transportation, orders would have risen 2.2 percent.
 
Military Orders Are Down
Military orders slipped 3.1 percent, to $7.6 billion, after a 21.9 percent decline in June, but Ms. Latta suggested this category would pick up because of the Middle East crisis.
''There have been a lot of things shipped over to Saudi Arabia'' to support American forces there, she said. ''There are a lot of stockpiles that will have to be replenished.''
Orders for nonmilitary capital goods jumped 10.7 percent, to $40.1 billion. This category is often a barometer of business investment plans, but analysts were hesitant to read anything into the July number because of the Mideast uncertainty.
Orders in all major durable categories rose in July: nonelectrical machinery was up 2.7 percent, to $22.4 billion; electrical machinery, 1.9 percent, to $20.4 billion, and primary metals, 1.5 percent, to $11.6 billion.
Shipments of durable goods slipped 2 percent, to $124.7 billion, after an increase of six-tenths of 1 percent in June. Unfilled orders rose seven-tenths of 1 percent, to $501.6 billion, more than offsetting a decline of five-tenths of 1 percent in June.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Cattle Prices Fall the Limit; Hogs and Pork Bellies Drop

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Cattle futures prices plunged the daily limit on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange yesterday, as concern grew about the implications of the Middle East crisis.
Pork futures also suffered a setback, particularly bellies, which were down the limit for the third consecutive day.
Beef is more expensive than pork at the meat counter now, making cattle much more vulnerable to outside price swings, said Phil Stanley, a trader at the Merc and consultant to ADM Investor Services. 
''Economic worries had as much to do with the break in cattle prices as anything,'' he said.
Inflation or recession would turn shoppers away from high-priced beef cuts.
Pork futures have been under pressure from the skidding cash hog market, and trading yesterday was no exception.
''It's been kind of a free fall for cash hogs,'' Mr. Stanley said, noting that they have lost nearly $3.50 a hundredweight this week. A large increase in the number of animals being brought to slaughter has severely weakened the cash market.
Pork prices were at record highs earlier this summer but have been in a fairly steady decline. Meanwhile, cattle prices have remained fairly level for half a year.
While the relatively high price of beef makes cattle more vulnerable, pork is not immune, Mr. Stanley said.
''If the stock market falls on its face,'' he said, ''we can expect another deep plunge for cattle and hogs.''
Live cattle settled 0.75 cent to the limit of 1.50 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in October at 76.72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.57 cent to the limit of 1.50 cents lower, with August at 88.95 cents a pound; live hogs were 0.30 cent lower to 0.20 cent higher, with October at 48.42 cents a pound, and frozen pork bellies were 1.58 cents to the limit of 2 cents lower, with August at 43.72 cents a pound.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
GORBACHEV WARNS BAGHDAD TO BACK OFF OR U.N. WILL ACT; IRAQIS RING KUWAIT MISSIONS

BYLINE: By R.W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24

 BODY:
President Bush made a big gain today in his effort to isolate President Saddam Hussein of Iraq when President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union warned Baghdad that he was ready to back additional measures to toughen the United Nations embargo against Iraqi commerce.
Ranking American officials said Mr. Gorbachev's action made it likely that the Security Council would soon allow United States warships and those of Britain and France, as a last resort, to stop Iraqi tankers trying to evade sanctions. One official said he expected to ''see Iraqi rudders shot off,'' disabling the ships, if oil-bearing tankers tried to make port this weekend.
 
Security Council Gathers
The 15-member Council gathered tonight and began informal discussions on a proposed resolution after the five permanent members - the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union and China - circulated a draft with new wording.
Unlike previous drafts, the latest version does not specifically call for the use of ''force,'' but it would nonetheless authorize countries to halt ships suspected of violating the embargo. Removing a major stumbling block, the Soviet representative to the United Nations said he was in agreement with the text. 
As the three-week Middle East crisis continued, Iraqi troops surrounded the embassies of the United States and a number of other countries in Kuwait, preventing people from entering or leaving and trying to force diplomats to close the missions.
A West German spokesman said the Iraqis had cut off electricity and water to most of the operating embassies tonight after first notifying the Norwegian Ambassador, the senior Western diplomat still in Kuwait. But the State Department said the United States Embassy had not been affected.
 
No Intrusion on Embassy
''They have not made any moves against the embassy or intruded in any fashion,'' Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said at a briefing earlier in Kennebunkport, Me. ''But they are nonetheless present.''
President Bush, vacationing there, was said to be withholding any retaliatory action unless the United States Ambassador, W. Nathaniel Howell 3d, and the handful of aides who remained with him were harmed.
The Bush Administration reacted much more angrily to news that 100 or more American diplomats, dependents and Marine guards, who had been evacuated from the embassy in Kuwait in a caravan of 33 automobiles on Wednesday, had been held up in Baghdad despite Iraqi promises to let them leave the country.
A State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, called their detention ''another stark example of Iraqi duplicity.'' The 100 refugees were reported to be safe at the United States Embassy in Baghdad, but they seemed to be stuck there at least until the impasse at the embassies in Kuwait was resolved.
The Soviet Union vacated its embassy in Kuwait, the only major power to do so, but said it remained open in legal terms, even if shuttered.
President Gorbachev sent President Hussein a sternly worded message warning him that failure to heed a United Nations resolution ordering him to pull out of Kuwait would ''inevitably compel the Security Council to take corresponding additional measures.''
American officials said Mr. Gorbachev was referring to the possibility that the Security Council would authorize military action to back up economic sanctions. The United States, Britain and France have been seeking Soviet support for their naval blockade of Iraqi commerce.
About 12 Iraqi ships are currently under allied surveillance in or near the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, Pentagon aides reported tonight.
The British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, said one Iraqi ship had unloaded oil at Aden, in Yemen, and that one other Iraqi tanker was in the Aden port and three others were en route there.
 
Arms Linked to Libya
Before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Iraq regularly sent its crude oil to the Aden refinery for processing, and the resulting products were sold on the world market by Iraq, according to David T. Mizrahi, editor of the Mid East Report.
Mr. Fitzwater said that despite the sanctions, which have been in force for three weeks, Baghdad was still receiving shipments of arms, aircraft parts and some of the raw materials used in the manufacture of chemical weapons. He would not say where the supplies had come from or how they had entered Iraq, except to indicate that some had arrived by air.
Intelligence officials said Libya was one source of the arms. They said that fewer than 10 planeloads of weapons had been sent this week from Tripoli to Baghdad.
The flights are believed to have carried Polish-made tank engines and other military supplies loaded earlier this summer aboard the Iraqi-flag vessel Balqees when it docked in the Polish port of Gdynia.
 
Battleship Enters Gulf
The Balqees was bound for an undetermined Middle East port when American warships began shadowing it in mid-August. An Administration official who insisted on not being identified said the ship later changed course and unloaded its cargo in Libya.
Increasing the military pressure on Iraq, the United States moved the battleship Wisconsin, with its Tomahawk cruise missiles and its 16-inch guns, through the Strait of Hormuz and into the Persian Gulf. From there Kuwait, Baghdad and all of Iraq are well within its range.
Six Air Force reserve units were mobilized, all with C-5A and C-141 cargo planes to bolster the massive airlift of troops and weapons from the United States to Saudi Arabia. The squadrons are in Mississippi, Texas, New Jersey, New York, Maryland and Massachusetts.
This weekend, military officials said, the Central Command, which oversees all United States military operations in the Middle East, will move from MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla., to Saudi Arabia.
President Hussein's next step is unclear. Having set several deadlines Friday for the embassies to close down, he allowed each to pass without definitive action, a State Department official noted, adding, ''The big crunch at noon did not materialize.''
The Japanese Foreign Ministry said its two remaining diplomats in Kuwait had been told that their diplomatic immunity had been revoked but that no attempt had been made to remove them from the embassy. Spain's Ambassador to Jordan said the diplomats had been told to leave their embassies by Saturday morning or be forced out, increasing fears that the stranded envoys would be taken hostage.
There was no confirmation from Baghdad of a report by Britain's Independent Television News quoting the Iraqi Information Minister, Latif Nassif al-Jassem, as warning of dire consequences if Britain invaded Iraq. He was quoted as saying of the 230 British hostages, ''If Iraqis die, so will the British civilians.''
About 10 other American diplomats were reported to have stayed behind in Kuwait with Ambassador Howell, who is a 50-year-old Virginian. Most of them are thought to be consular officers.
 
Symbol of U.S. Protest
Asked what the Ambassador's standing orders were, Mr. Fitzwater said: ''Force has not been applied. Should he be subject to that, he will have to act accordingly, but those are judgments that he is authorized to make in many cases. Beyond that, I couldn't go into specific discussions that we have had with him.''
The State Department said its communications links with the embassy via satellite were intact.
Mr. Fitzwater insisted that the United States intended to keep the embassy open ''to look after the American community'' and to serve as a symbol of continuing protest against Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. But officials said privately that they did not expect Mr. Howell to resist a direct order from the Iraqis, delivered at gunpoint, to close down.
The Bush Administration appears to have concluded that the Iraqis are unlikely to take overt military action like invading the embassies, which are considered the sovereign territory of the nations involved. But it takes very seriously the prospect that Mr. Howell and his colleagues may be made hostages, as the 100 evacuees from the American Embassy appear to be.
''In any event,'' an adviser to the President said, ''we doubt any of the embassies can hold out for more than three or four days at best.''
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, describing President Hussein as a dictator, warned him against harming British diplomats or British hostages.
In addition to the British, West German, Norwegian and American Embassies, those of France, Japan, Sweden, Hungary and Romania were surrounded by troops this morning.
Jordan officially reopened its border to refugees, who in fact have never stopped crossing it, and Asians and Arabs continued to pour out of Iraq by the thousands. The Interior Ministry said that it would limit the flow to 20,000 people a day.

HEADLINE: FEDERAL RESERVE SAID TO RULE OUT A RATE SHIFT NOW

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JACKSON HOLE, Wyo., Aug. 24

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve apparently decided at a policy meeting this week to make no changes in interest rates until the Middle East crisis quieted down and a clearer picture emerged of its effect on the economy.
Such a decision suggests that the Federal Reserve, for the time being, remains more concerned about controlling inflation than quickly trying to offset any potential recessionary effect of the Middle East crisis.
Perhaps more important, some officials said that if oil prices, after the crisis, were to settle at, say, $8 a barrel above their pre-crisis levels, or at about $26 a barrel, then the long-term effect on the economy would be minimal - perhaps shaving one-quarter or one-half a percentage point off economic growth.
 
Growth Rate Is Weak
The Commerce Department reported today that growth in the second quarter was at an anemic annual rate of 1.2 percent, after an also-weak 1.7 percent in the first quarter. That means the gross national product has grown at an annual rate of 1.5 percent so far this year. [Page 31.] The minutes of the closed-door meeting in Washington on Tuesday will not be released for six weeks. But some Federal Reserve officials, here for a conference, indicated in off-the-record conversations that a change in policy when no one knows what might happen in the Middle East could inject new uncertainty into the jittery bond and stock markets. 
 
Annual Two-Day Event
The gathering here in Grand Teton National Park, at a lodge deep in the mountains and woods, is an annual two-day event that brings together Federal Reserve officials and economists from universities and from Wall Street.
The aim is to socialize, to exchange views and to attend five hours of conference sessions each morning, leaving the afternoons free for white-water rafting and hiking. The conference sessions today and Saturday center on controlling inflation in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe; a half-dozen central bank presidents and finance ministers from these countries traveled here to participate.
But the Middle East was clearly a distraction for the Federal Reserve delegation, led by Alan Greenspan, the chairman. There was much coffee-break talk about the latest reports from Wall Street and the Persian Gulf. And some Fed officials suggested that as long as the crisis continued and future oil supplies were uncertain, there was nothing that the Federal Reserve could or should do.
''It is fairly well accepted that monetary policy, reacting to supply shocks, is not appropriate,'' a Federal Reserve official said.
Largely as a result of war fears and oil-supply disruptions, the Dow Jones industrial average has lost nearly 13 percent of its value since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, and long-term bond yields have climbed more than half a percentage point.
 
Regularly Scheduled Meeting
The Tuesday policy meeting in Washington was one that is held every six weeks. The presidents of the Federal Reserve's 12 regional banks gathered in the capital with Mr. Greenspan and the five Federal Reserve governors to review the state of the economy and decide whether to use their power to lower interest rates, thus stimulating buying and investing, or push up rates and thus reduce the odds of a higher inflation rate.
The Federal Reserve has been slowly pushing down interest rates for nearly a year, out of concern that the economy was weakening. The last drop came on July 13. Although Mr. Greenspan has not commented on the economy since Iraq invaded Kuwait, he maintained until then that while the economy was weak, the odds of a recession were low.
A day after the Washington meeting this week, Mr. Greenspan and two Federal Reserve governors, Wayne D. Angell and Edward W. Kelley Jr., traveled to Jackson Hole and were joined by 6 of the 12 presidents of the Federal Reserve regional banks.
 
Two Unwelcome Developments
In informal interviews, several Federal Reserve officials said the Iraq crisis had brought on two developments that the central bank had hoped to avoid. One was a fall in the value of the dollar, a potentially inflationary development because it makes imports more expensive. The other was the sharp rise in interest rates for long-term Government bonds to offset any erosion in the value of bonds from future inflation.
The rise in bond rates reflected in part a concern on Wall Street that the Middle East crisis might cause the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates in an effort to avoid a recession. In the Wall Street view, rather than warding off a recession, such action by the Federal Reserve might fuel inflation. ''People perceive that the Fed might be ready to cave in on interest rates, so the Fed has to maintain them longer than it might otherwise have wanted to do,'' said Jerry Jordan, chief economist at First Interstate Bancorp in San Francisco.
 
Decisions Not Disclosed
None of the five or six officials who discussed informally the Middle East crisis and the American economy would disclose specific decisions made at the Tuesday meeting. But they said the nation would not know for a month or more what might happen in the Middle East: whether war would break out; whether oil shipments would be further disrupted, or how high oil prices might rise. In such an uncertain situation, the officials said, adjusting interest rate policy would be inappropriate.
But some said that if the price of crude oil was to stabilize at about $26 a barrel - it fell in trading today to about $31 a barrel - that would be a $25 billion to $50 billion ''tax'' on consumption. Economic growth would slow a bit, in this view, but not to the point of a national recession, which is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth in the gross national product.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Amid Crisis, West Meets Mideast in Saudi Arabia

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JIDDA, Saudi Arabia, Aug. 24

 BODY:
The arrival of American and foreign troops in Saudi Arabia and the flood of Kuwaiti refugees here are helping to pry open Saudi society, which has been hermetically sealed.
This deeply conservative Muslim country of about 16 million people is being exposed to the glare of international news reporting, and Saudis are being drawn into a social enterprise that is radically different from their retiring ways and conspicuous traditions.
So far, the Saudi Government has done its best to insulate its people from the effect of this crisis, keeping foreign troops well out of sight in all civilian regions - several hundred miles from this port city and from the inland capital of Riyadh - and maintaining a business-as-usual facade in its news reports and daily economic activities.
Saudi newspapers and television news talk of the ''Islamic, Arab and other multinational forces,'' arriving here to stand up to Iraq - practically ignoring that the bulk of these troops are American soldiers that include women, Christians and Jews, in a country that is almost 100 percent Muslim.
In Dhahran, Al Khobar and Dammam, the heart of the Saudi oil industry and its vital pipelines, pumping stations and oilfields, barely 200 miles from where Iraq's missiles and troops are stationed, shops are open late into the night, hotels are full of guests, and military vehicles are only rarely seen. The American troops are out of sight, 15 to 20 miles away in the desert. 
Oil has made the Saudis one of the world's most prosperous nations, with an economic growth rate of 5 percent and virtually no unemployment. In Jidda, where the Saudi Government has been for the summer, the pulse of life is untouched. Cars linger over the long seaside corniche, and Egyptian soap-operas fill television programming.
On the nightly news Saudi soldiers are paraded and senior Saudi officials review troops endlessly and listen to patriotic poems. But there is little discussion of the huge American buildup under way and virtually no mention of Iraqi troop movements close to the Saudi borders.
''We don't feel a thing,'' said a senior oil executive in Dhahran as he drove his car up and down the main avenues of the oil town that is the headquarters of the Aramco oil company. ''If it weren't for foreign radio stations you would not suspect we are on the verge of war.''
 
A Xenophobic Grip
Yet, a deep and fundamental debate has started in Saudi circles about the impact of this crisis on the future of the country.
Saudi intellectuals and liberals are thrilled by the notion that the presence of American troops, and the immense good will the world is showing Saudi Arabia, will loosen the hold of the fundamentalist Muslim religious leaders, who have opposed every step of modernization in this country, from the education of girls to the introduction of television.
But the purpose of the foreign presence does not escape Saudi officials. They are concluding that this country can absorb a first strike by Iraq, but fervently hoping that the United States would hit first, with a devastating attack on Iraqi forces.
''We think that there is a 3 percent chance of missiles getting through to our vital oil facilities,'' said one Saudi official, who expressed confidence that the combined American-Saudi airpower can handle any such atack with a ''knockout'' blow to Iraq's air force and missile launchers.
Saudi intelligence officials estimate that Iraq's rate of production of land-to-land missiles is two per day, and a Saudi defense offical said it is believed that Iraq has not perfected the technique of mounting chemical warheads on its missiles.
''The greatest probability is that they have to deliver chemical payloads by airplanes or artillery, which gives them a limited range of operation,'' said the defense official, who like many Saudis and foreigners interviewed here about the current crisis, asked for anonymity.
In the streets of this desert country, the burning topic of conversation is the threat of war, and foreigners fret over whether they should stay or leave, while Saudis are content to bask in the notion that with American troops here and the whole world standing against Iraq, there is little doubt that President Saddam Hussein's days are numbered.
''He is finished,'' said Khalid Ali Alturki, a successful businessman who lives in Al Khobar, speaking of President Hussein. ''The only question is how much it will cost - not whether it will happen. I think Kuwait will pay a heavy price, but no matter how much it costs, it is worth it to have back the country and rid us of Saddam.''
Saudi officials and senior members of the ruling Kuwaiti al-Sabah family who live here in the summer capital of Taif, said that Kuwait is indeed putting its formidable economic muscle behind the military effort against Iraq.
It is understood from these officials that Kuwait, which holds foreign assets estimated at over $100 billion under the control of its Government-in-exile in Taif, is increasingly footing a growing part of the enormous costs of the deployment here of the American, Egyptian and other forces, which is running at some $25 million a day.
''We are willing to sacrifice everything,'' said the Kuwaiti Crown Prince, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, in a meeting with the foreign press on Thrusday in Taif.
 
Kuwaitis Underwriting
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are also believed to have advanced financial aid to Egypt to compensate for the rising costs of moving back tens of thousands of Egyptians fleeing Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait from Jordan.
And, Saudi Arabia has been carrying the cost of housing, feeding and giving refuge to some 100,000 Kuwaitis who are refugees here.
But Saudis in decision-making positions are rethinking the country's financial aid to the Palestine Liberation Organization. They make it clear that they will no longer deal with the current leadership of the P.L.O. and that they expect Yasir Arafat to be replaced as its chairman if the organization expects to resume normal ties and continue to receive financial aid.
In Saudi Arabia, hardly a single Saudi misses the opportunity to vilify Mr. Arafat, who is seen as having betrayed this country and other gulf Emirates by siding with Iraq in the conflict.
''From now on, we will support causes not people,'' said one well-placed Saudi in an extensive interview today. ''We are making the point that Yasir Arafat is finished here but that other Palestinian leaders who appreciate all the financial help we have extended to the Palestinian movement over the years and who have not turned against us will be welcome.''
Officially, the Saudi Government denies that there has been any break with the P.L.O. Saudi officials said that a request by Mr. Arafat to come here a few days ago was politely turned down, but on Thursday King Fahd received Hani al-Hassan, a senior P.L.O. leader who is widely seen as sympathetic to the gulf monarchies within the Palestinian movement.
In conversations with many Saudis, including ordinary citizens, there appears to be a firm conviction that Iraq, the P.L.O., Yemen and Jordan have conspired to subdue the gulf emirates and Saudi Arabia in the hope of each getting rewards out of what is described as an obvious plot.
''When Saddam attacked Kuwait, he really calculated that we will back down,'' said a Cabinet minister. ''Eventually they thought the P.L.O. would dominate Kuwait using the 400,000 Palestinians living there to govern and that Yemen would get a territorial adjustment in the South taking some land from us there. Jordan and Iraq would reap substantial financial aid from a subdued Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.''
The talk of the future in this region now envisages a whole different scenario. ''This is the beginning of what I think is going to be a rollback of the excessive influence of the Saudi religious establishment,'' a liberal Saudi official said.
Faced with the immense good will the world has shown Saudi Arabia, the most conservative religious leaders, led by Sheik al-Baaz, the most senior religious figure in the kingdom, conceded in television interviews over the past few days that even though those who came here to ''defend Islam'' include ''atheists and Christians,'' not to mention women, they will be ''rewarded by God for their good deed,'' thus putting the seals of approval on the American presence here.
 
American Habits
Even though they deny it, American troops here are believed to have access to alcoholic drinks, including beer, and as their numbers rise to an anticipated 200,000, their influence is bound to be felt more strongly.
Already in the Eastern province of Saudi Arabia, where the bulk of Kuwaiti refugees and American troops are, Kuwaiti women and American women soldiers have been seen driving their cars and jeeps in a country where women are strictly forbidden from driving.
There is a story that has circulated widely in Saudi Arabia over the past few days: that an American woman soldier in uniform drove her car into Al Khobar to shop. Her behavior was viewed as nothing less than scandalous in a society where women virtually never appear alone in public.
The soldier was approached by a Mutawaa, one of the Islamic fundamentalists who enforce laws of proper behavior. The Mutawaa raised his cane warning the soldier to get back into her car and go away. Whereupon, the story goes, the American pulled her gun and pointed it at his face sending him scrambling for cover.
''It does not matter that the story is true or not,'' said a Cabinet minister who was among 14 people recounting it over a lunch recently. ''What matters is that everyone wants to believe that it is true,'' he said.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Gorbachev Sends a Signal Ending Hesitation at U.N.

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 24

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev warned President Saddam Hussein of Iraq today that the Iraqi leader will face additional international sanctions if he does not withdraw his troops from Kuwait and release foreign nationals under his control.
Mr. Gorbachev's message to the Iraqi leader, reported by the Tass press agency, was a clear sign that Moscow was prepared to support a United Nations resolution authorizing limited military measures to enforce the embargo against Iraq. Members of the 15-member Security Council gathered tonight to begin debating a draft resolution.
Arab diplomats and Soviet journalists here said that despite the Soviets' hesitation to back the use of force, there was now little doubt that Moscow would withdraw its objections to the United States-sponsored resolution in the United Nations Security Council aimed at increasing naval pressure on Iraqi cargo vessels. 
''I am 100 percent sure the Soviet Union will either vote for the measure or abstain,'' said Maksim A. Yusin, the diplomatic correspondent for the Government newspaper Izvestia. ''A veto can be ruled out.''
 
'Losing Patience With Iraqis'
''It seems to me they are losing patience with the Iraqis,'' a senior Arab diplomat said.
In what Tass described as ''an urgent personal message,'' Mr. Gorbachev called on President Hussein to begin immediately honoring United Nations resolutions demanding that Iraqis leave Kuwait, restore the ousted Government and assure the safety of foreigners.
''Evading these resolutions will inevitably compel the Security Council to adopt appropriate additional measures,'' Tass quoted Mr. Gorbachev as saying.
The news agency itself added, ''It now depends on the Iraqi side how the Security Council will act.''
Moscow has not wavered from its condemnation of Iraq and its endorsement of economic sanctions, but Soviet leaders have consistently pleaded for more time to let the sanctions work before applying new pressures.
 
A Crossroads of Diplomacy
During the last week, Moscow has become a crossroads of international diplomacy, with senior diplomats from Iraq and Saudi Arabia visiting this week to compete for the Kremlin's support, and the Foreign Ministers of Kuwait and Egypt expected within days.
Arab diplomats said one clear signal of Moscow's loyalties in the crisis was the brusque official treatment of Iraq's emissary, Deputy Prime Minister Saddun Hammadi, compared with the warm welcome given the special emissary of the Saudi royal family, Prince Bandar Bin Sultan al-Saud.
Although Moscow has no diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia, the Prince spent hours with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and other senior officials, and told fellow Arab diplomats afterward that he was satisfied with the Soviet position.
''We have no reason to think they are not serious,'' said a Persian Gulf diplomat who sat in on some of the talks. ''We will give them the time.'' Soviets Argue for Delay In meetings with Prince Bandar and other Arab diplomats, the Soviets argued for delay so that Mr. Hammadi could pass along the Kremlin's mounting impatience to his superiors in Baghdad.
In the meantime, they argued, a few leaks in the embargo would not seriously reduce the pressure on President Hussein.
''They still hope they can influence Iraq, because they feel Iraq has nowhere to go,'' an Arab diplomat said.
Arab diplomats said Soviet officials also argued for caution because they see a serious risk of a catastrophic war, including the use of chemical weapons.
''There is still a lot of anxiety in this country,'' Mr. Yusin, the Izvestia correspondent, said in an interview. ''The memory of Afghanistan is fresh, and when the coffins start coming from the gulf not everyone will think the goal of stopping the aggressor is noble.''
 
Concern About Its Nationals
Diplomats and Soviet journalists said another factor in the more moderate Soviet approach was concern about the fate of Soviet nationals in the region, and a desire to evacuate as many as possible before increasing the pressure on Baghdad.
The Foreign Ministry said today that it had completed its evacuation of all 882 Soviet nationals from Kuwait, and was scheduled to begin removing Soviet women and children from Iraq this weekend.
''Soviet citizens in Iraq are not regarded as hostages, unlike citizens of Western countries, but we cannot take risks,'' Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov said on television tonight.
Yuri Gremitskikh, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said that although the Soviet Embassy in Kuwait was empty, this did not mean that Moscow was complying with Iraq's demand that all embassies be closed, or that it recognized Iraq's annexation of the emirate.
''We said in advance that we were not closing the embassy in international legal terms,'' Mr. Gremitskikh said. ''In international legal terms we have not ended our diplomatic representation.''
Arab diplomats said the Soviet decision to abandon its embassy in Kuwait when Western embassies are defying Iraq's order to leave was typical of Moscow's more low-key approach.
 
Military Specialists Stay
Another example was the decision not to withdraw 193 Soviet military specialists from Iraq. Moscow says they are weapons technicians and have not taken part in the seizure of Kuwait. The Kremlin seems to feel that pulling them out might endanger the other Soviet citizens still in Iraq.
Still another reason for the greater moderation among the Soviets, diplomats said, is a reluctance to be seen as slavishly following the American lead.
''I think that they don't want to appear in this whole crisis to be trailing the United States,'' an Arab diplomat said. ''Maybe the United States has not been attentive enough to this factor.''
Offsetting the Soviet reluctance to move too quickly against Iraq is a feeling that the gulf crisis is a test of Moscow's commitment to new principles of international conduct, and the desire for the potential economic benefits that would flow from acceptance in the West.

Reserves' Quick Shift: Civvies to Olive Drab

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWBURGH, N.Y., Aug. 24

 BODY:
He spent Thursday night in Greenwich Village, shopping for clothes - just another 19-year-old. He got the call at 11:30 P.M. By this afternoon he was in an olive drab flight suit with an American flag insignia on one arm, checking in at the Air National Guard base here, 60 miles north of New York City.
His unit, the 137th Military Airlift Squadron of the 105th Group, had been called to active duty. 
Standing in a line, in front of a window, waiting to begin a slew of paper work, the second-year student at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan still seemed dazed.
 
'Excited and Apprehensive'
''I'm excited and apprehensive,'' he said. ''I'm backing this 100 percent.''
All day long, the 150 members of his unit, based at Stewart International Airport, arrived from New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Philadelphia, Washington and as far away as Texas.
They were mostly men, mostly in their 20's, with a few in their 40's who had fought in Vietnam. There was a computer analyst from Texas, an unemployed Eastern Airlines pilot, a lawyer, a switching technician for New York Telephone Company and a 26-year-old New York City detective.
At least in front of reporters, the talk was not of war or hot desert sands or chemical gas but of the mundane details of tying up loose ends at home: powers of attorney, W-4 forms, checking accounts, life insurance and wills. They were told not to give their names to reporters.
 
Patriotic but Not Gung-Ho
What they actually felt as they left their families and entered the cauldron of the Mideast they kept to themselves. The base was not the place for them to spill emotions. They seemed proud but not gung-ho.
''We're not a bunch of Tom Cruises,'' said the commander of the 137th, a lieutenant colonel who identified himself only as Tom.
The narcotics detective said he was not worried at all. ''It's probably worse in New York than it is over there,'' he said.
 
World's Largest Aircraft
This is an elite unit. Its members fly and operate 12 C-5A Galaxies, 221-foot-long cargo planes that are among the largest aircraft in the world. The transports cost $130 million each and hold 246,000 pounds. The members fly the planes, maintain them and handle the cargo.
The guardsmen have been called up for 90 days and will be shuttling the planes forth across the ocean. Volunteer guardsmen have been operating the planes since Aug. 7.
 
Long Preparations
Colonel Tom, as the unit's commander was called all day, is a 43-year-old former Air Force pilot in Vietnam. He said this unit had prepared long and hard for today.
There had, he said, even been simulated calls to active duty. ''This is a simulated recall,'' the phone caller used to say.
After 9:30 P.M. Thursday, as Colonel Tom and other full-time personnel telephoned the unit members, they repeated the words: ''This is an actual recall. This is an actual recall.''
A unit member named Valerie, checked in late Thursday night. A 22-year-old assembly line worker at the General Motors plant in Tarrytown, N.Y., she had worked her usual 8 A.M. to 4 P.M. shift, putting together gas tanks on 400 cars. Then she drove to the air base.
Her father, who served in Korea and also works at the plant, gave her advice: ''He told me, 'Just be brave.' You'll feel better about yourself when you get back,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Southwest Boomed in 80's, Census Finds

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24

 BODY:
The five states whose deserts and canyons form the vast expanse of the American Southwest have seen some of the nation's sharpest increases in population in the last decade, preliminary 1990 census figures show. A boom in the Las Vegas area raised Nevada's population by nearly 50 percent.
While the growth in Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah was also strong, it was still slightly below the bureau's earlier estimates. Nevada grew by more than expected, rising to 1.2 million from 800,000 in 1980. The total population for the five states rose from 9 million to more than 11 million, or more than 20 percent; that was twice the estimated growth rate for the nation as a whole. 
The Census Bureau, which began distributing its preliminary estimates last week, has now issued figures on 40 states and the District of Columbia, a group making up just under half of the estimated national population. The figures on Arizona, Colorado and Nevada were in the most recent group; the New Mexico and Utah results were issued earlier. Data on most of the largest states, including California and New York, are still to come.
 
Growth Around, but Not in, Capital
The tentative figures, which are being distributed to 39,000 state, county and local governments for review, also show double-digit growth in Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, at the southern end of the sea of suburbs that run down the East Coast from Boston to Richmond. Those three states now have a population of 11.5 milion, after a steady 10 years of growth that reached almost 14 percent.
But the the city of Washington itself lost almost 10 percent of its population, or more than 60,000 people, and now may have as few as 575,000 people, the early data show. A slow downturn in population apparently accelerated at the end of the decade, when the homicide rate soared and crack markets blossomed on Washington street corners.
In the Northwest, a late-decade spurt that followed five years of sluggish growth pushed Oregon's population above earlier estimates, said Kimball Brace, a demographer and political analyst who is tracking the emerging figures. Alaska grew by 36 percent, but much of that increase came in the early 1980's, as the oil pipeline was completed.
Contrary to predictions that economic problems would slow its growth, Washington State grew by more than a sixth in the decade. That increase, nourished by the state's Pacific Rim export industry and an expanding cluster of high-technology concerns, may have garnered it an extra Congressional seat, redistricting experts say. In the South, a Surprise Loser? By contrast, Louisiana's loss of 0.6 percent of its population during the decade may cost it one of eight Congressional seats.
But Mr. Brace and other experts caution that few predictions about winners and losers can be made until the preliminary total for the entire country, the essential element in the redistricting equation, is available next week.
Census Bureau officials also note that procedures still going on may add three million or more people to the count. Among those procedures are a check of housing stock and the reviews by the state, county and local governments that are now receiving the data.
Demographers say the 1990 tally is still running well behind earlier estimates, though it has closed the gap somewhat since the first figures were distributed last week.
Mr. Brace, president of Election Data Services, who first identified the consistent discrepancy between the unchecked 1990 figures and the Census Bureau's earlier estimates, said the discrepancy was now running slightly below 2 percent. If that figure holds for the nation as a whole, it will mean that the census found about five million fewer people than the bureau had expected. In 1980, the bureau found 5.1 million more people than its earlier estimates had led it to expect.
But it is not clear whether the discrepancy is a result of a faulty 1990 tally, inaccurate earlier estimates or both. In addition, preliminary population counts are still not in for California, Texas and Florida, where much of the decade's population growth was concentrated.
Preliminary population estimates for those three states and seven others - Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Georgia and Alabama - are expected next week.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
A table with an article on Saturday about preliminary figures from the new census misstated the 1980 population and preliminary 1990 count for Oklahoma, and in some copies misstated the Census Bureau's 1990 estimate for the District of Columbia.
Corrective information appears today in a table on page A16.

HEADLINE: Religion Notes

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels

 BODY:
Woman to Head Alliance An American Presbyterian scholar has become the first woman to head a worldwide communion of churches. Dr. Jane Dempsey Douglass was elected president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, an association of churches rooted in the 16th-century Reformation theology of John Calvin.
The alliance includes 178 Presbyterian, Reformed and Congregational denominations with 50 million members in over 80 countries. Two-thirds of the denominations are in the third world. Recently, the alliance, which has a small staff in Geneva, has been most visible for its advocacy of human rights in South Africa and Rumania. 
Dr. Douglass, a 57-year-old professor of historical theology at Princeton Theological Seminary in New Jersey, had been a leader in the alliance for more than a decade. She will replace the Rev. Allen Boesak of South Africa, who resigned after revelations of an extra-marital affair.
Interviewed by telephone, Dr. Douglass linked her election this month to a decision last August by the alliance's General Council to emphasize the ''full freedom of women in the church.''
Almost half the alliance's member denominations do not ordain women as ministers, she said, and the General Council, the group's highest decision-making group, asked them to reconsider that position.
 
Reactions on Invasion
Religious groups that have recently been among the most outspoken critics of American military interventions and armaments are generally supporting the nation's position in the Persian Gulf crisis.
The National Council of Churches, the president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the World Council of Churches, all of which have questioned previous military actions, have strongly condemned Iraq's seizure of Kuwait and supported resistance to it.
Most of the statements stressed the need for international cooperation, and they are wary about directly endorsing any specific military action by the United States.
The American Jewish Committee went a bit further, commending President Bush's ''forceful leadership'' and urging a ''firm and collective response.''
Mohammed T. Mehdi, Secretary General of the National Council on Islamic Affairs, condemned the Iraqi invasion immediately after it took place.
Last week, he criticized both President Bush and President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, saying they had ''cornered themselves'' by their ''action and hyperbole.'' He called on King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to prevent a confrontation.
 
Bishops Back Unions
In a statement of strong support for labor unions, the Committee on Domestic Social Policy of the United States Roman Catholic bishops has condemned the hiring of permanent replacements for striking workers.
Federal labor laws should ''outlaw the permanent replacement of workers involved in a legitimate strike,'' the committee said in its annual Labor Day statement.
''When replacements are permanent, they represent a major stumbling block to settlements,'' the statement said. ''When the issues are settled, agreeing what to do with two sets of workers - strikers and strikebreakers - is usually more difficult than settling the strike in the first place.''
 
Wages With the Church
All is not well on the Catholic bishops' own labor front. A study overseen by 15 Catholic groups, including the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, has found that the median annual salary of nonordained professional workers in the church is $22,258, 17.5 percent below the median income in the general population.
The study covered lay and religious staff members in Catholic schools, parishes and diocesan agencies but not professionals in Catholic hospitals. Over half the workers, whose median age was 42, had master's degrees.
Over 20 percent of the married workers surveyed had no family health benefits. Forty percent of the married workers reported needing second jobs, family gifts or other forms of outside income to make ends meet. Almost 70 percent had considered leaving their church jobs, primarily for economic reasons.
 
Torah Among Soviets
Several years ago, when Sidney Kwestel, president of the Union of Orthodox Congregations, decided to commission the writing of a Torah scroll in honor of Soviet Jews, he did not imagine that the task would be completed in the Soviet Union itself.
But two weeks ago in Leningrad, he watched a scribe ink in the last letter of the handwritten Sefer Torah, the first five books of the Bible that every synagogue treasures as its most sacred ritual object.
Thousands of Soviet Jews in attendance fell into line and came forward to kiss the scroll, said Eliezer Edelman, administrative director of the Orthodox Union.
Although the scroll was written in Israel according to the exacting requirements of Jewish law, 1,000 letters of the approximately 300,000 letters in the Torah had been left blank. These were filled in during a series of dedication ceremonies from Aug. 5 to Aug. 10 in Moscow, Berdichev, Kiev and Leningrad. The scroll will be kept by the Jewish communty in Kiev.
Mr. Edelman estimated that at least 25,000 Soviet Jews attended these events. The Torah scroll was accompanied by a 120-member delegation of American Jews.
While Mr. Edelman affirmed the seriousness of anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union, he also said: ''Wherever I went, I always wore a yarmulke. Not only did nobody bother me, but many young Soviet Jewish men also seemed to be wearing yarmulkes without fear.''

HEADLINE: The World v. Saddam Hussein

 BODY:
Cornered and desperate, Saddam Hussein now lashes out against diplomacy itself. His troops lawlessly threaten foreign embassies in Kuwait while his regime detains U.S. diplomats and dependents who were promised a safe exit from Baghdad. The most telling condemnation comes from Moscow, Iraq's longtime ally. An outraged Mikhail Gorbachev warns that an Iraqi failure to heed United Nations resolutions would ''inevitably compel the Security Council to adopt appropriate additional measures.'' 
Those measures need no spelling out. The Soviet Union is now weighing a Security Council resolution that would authorize use of force to secure compliance with economic sanctions. Americans who have been struggling to win Soviet approval have gained unexpected support from Saddam Hussein.
Each fresh breach of law solidifies the global consensus against him. Cumulatively, he and his associates are becoming war criminals in the classic Nuremberg sense.
In a decade, Iraq has managed to violate most of the Nuremberg Principles as formulated in 1945 by the Allies in World War II and reaffirmed unanimously by the U.N. in 1950. In law if not yet in fact, the Baghdad leadership could be held criminally accountable for Iraq's offenses. The Nuremberg Principles assert that a crime against world law is liable to punishment, that heads of state can be held responsible and that obeying orders does not exempt subordinates when a moral choice is possible. These are punishable crimes:
Crimes against peace, like initiating a war of aggression in violation of international treaties. Iraq initiated war against Iran in 1980, and against Kuwait 23 days ago.
War crimes, like the ill treatment of civilian populations in occupied territories, killing of hostages, plunder of private property or wanton destruction of cities. Iraq plundered Kuwait, stripped its people of their citizenship, abused innocent civilians and now makes hostages even of diplomats whose special status is protected by the Vienna Convention.
Crimes against humanity, like murder, deportation and inhuman acts or persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds. It is a capital offense in Iraq to insult the President, espouse Zionism, leave the ruling Baath Party or persuade someone else to do so. Using these laws, Iraq has executed thousands. It has waged genocidal war against its own Kurdish minority, using poison gas in contravention of a Geneva protocol to which it is a party. There is hardly a human rights convention that Iraq has not violated.
The chief defense of war criminals tried at Nuremberg in 1945-46 was that no precedent existed for their punishment. It does now.

HEADLINE: Letter: On Energy;
A Tax Would Make Oil Shock Worse

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''America's Neck and a New Noose'' (editorial, Aug. 2) is wide of the mark when it comes to crafting workable energy policies for this country's future. If the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has indeed put a noose on the United States economy, there's no need for Congress to be the one to pull open the trap door by jacking up prices even more with a new energy tax.
You say the United States ''can't do much'' about declining domestic production. It was that same attitude that led OPEC to think it could raise the cost of oil through the roof in the 1970's. The result was that, spurred by higher prices, producers in the United States increased their output by about 10 percent between 1976 and 1985. At least when OPEC is the one raising prices, American oilmen can reap some of the benefits and use the profits to strengthen the industry at home, reduce our need for foreign oil and help put supply and demand back into balance. 
An energy tax would bring most of the negative effects of an oil shock to the economy, including inflation, unemployment and a diminished quality of life, while weakening our energy industry by cutting the demand for products that aren't in short supply. The declining United States production that you rightly identify as a threat to our national security and our economic well-being would actually be accelerated.
As to the supposed conservation incentives provided by an energy tax, not all business leaders agree that more expensive energy will lead to great gains in efficiency. Last month, Red Cavancy, president of the American Paper Institute, observed that the proposed new energy taxes would shrink the pool of money available for such capital improvements. Similarly, a report issued by Congress's Office of Technology Assessment last June found that economic slowdowns tend to create conditions that impede energy-efficiency gains.
It wasn't just OPEC's greed that caused oil prices to collapse in the 1980's. The unexpected flexibility of producers in this country to find more oil and consumers to use less, aided by Federal policy changes that let the law of supply and demand bring the market into balance, played key roles in taking the bull by the horns.
As oil markets in the 1990's suddenly turn volatile, it's important that we remember a lesson of the 1970's and 80's, and keep the Government out of the business of setting energy prices.

HEADLINE: Mexican Democracy Means Brokered Elections

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is unfortunate that Javier Trevino, Minister of Press and Public Affairs at the Mexican Embassy (letter, Aug. 11), has chosen to misrepresent when he rhetorically asks, ''If no 'honest elections' have been held in Mexico, why do 237 out of the 500-member Chamber of Deputies belong to opposition parties?''
That opposition members occupy political offices in Mexico is not proof of democracy. Rather, it demonstrates the success of his party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or P.R.I., in manipulating elections. What Mr. Trevino did not say is that Mexican opposition parties began to ''win'' elections only after 1968. It was that year the Mexican Army, on orders of Luis Echeverria, the next President, opened fire on unarmed student demonstrators in the Plaza de Tlateloco, killing 500 while the world press, in Mexico City for the 1968 Olympics, watched in horror. 
Mr. Echeverria, scrambling to repair Mexico's image, established quotas for opposition party ''victories'' in the Chamber of Deputies, a rubber-stamping body. His successors merely expanded the quotas.
Opposition victories have thus been the result of brokered deals orchestrated by the P.R.I., not of actual ballots cast by Mexican voters.
That Mexico is not democratic is evident. The Organization of American States warned Mexico last June that it ''must comply exactly with the obligation to guarantee the free and full exercise of political rights.''
Unarmed citizens, protesting election fraud in municipal elections throughout the state of Michoacan, were forcefully dislodged in 19 towns by the army in a wave of unprecedented violence last spring.
As I walk to and from my office every day, I see the tired faces of the Mexican people, faces that have had to endure the ravages of a decade of inflation and an austerity program that has cut real wages by 70 percent. Mexico does not need lectures on democracy. But it certainly needs democracy.

HEADLINE: Man Suffocates As Intruders Hold a Party

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Four people, three of them teen-agers, were charged yesterday with murdering a mentally retarded man who suffocated inside a closet while they caroused in his Bronx apartment for nearly six days and sold his belongings, the police said.
The victim, Freddie Thomas, 32 years old, was found dead inside a plastic garbage bag in his apartment at 665 Burke Avenue in the Williamsbridge section at 6:15 P.M. on Wednesday. His girlfriend, Opah Sanders, 34, also mentally retarded, was imprisoned in another closet for six days but survived. She was set free on Wednesday evening just before the group left. 
Both Mr. Thomas and Ms. Sanders were unemployed and received Social Security payments for their disabilities, the police said. They met more than a year ago in a program for mentally disabled people, called the Bridge, that teaches them to live independently. The couple had lived in the apartment together since October. ''They were harmless, slightly mentally retarded people,'' said a detective. ''They kept to themselves, getting by on Social Security.''
An autopsy revealed that Mr. Thomas was smothered by tape his attackers had put over his nose and mouth, said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the Medical Examiner. The police said he is believed to have died sometime Aug. 17 or Aug. 18. Acting on information from Ms. Sanders, the police arrested four people on charges of second-degree murder, robbery and unlawful imprisonment on Wednesday night. They were identified as Ms. Sanders's sister, Hope Kelly, 16; William Fennell, 21, of 2302 Andrews Avenue; Samuel Rivera, 17, of 8 Fordham Hill Oval, and Barbara Redding, 17, of 380 East 143d Street. A fifth suspect was being sought.
The couple's ordeal began at 9 P.M. on August 16 when Mr. Thomas answered a knock at the door and let in Hope Kelly, Ms. Sanders's sister, who had lived off-and-on at the apartment, Lieut. Anthony Vitaliano of the 47th Precinct detective squad said.
Minutes later, Lieutenant Vitaliano said, Miss Kelly let in a woman and three men, one of them armed with a shotgun. One of the men hit Mr. Thomas over the head with the gun, taped his face with duct tape, bound his wrists with telephone wire and locked him in a closet, the police said. In the living room, another man hit Ms. Sanders from behind, bound her with tape and put her in a second closet.
 
Parties in Apartment
For the next two days, the group held parties, Lieutenant Vitaliano said. They also sold Mr. Thomas's television, a videocassette recorder and stereo equipment on the street.
The group also bought a padlock and sealed the closet where Mr. Thomas was imprisoned, the police said.
On Saturday, when Mr. Thomas's body began to decompose, the group wrapped it in a shower curtain and a garbage bag and placed it in a bedroom with a fan blowing, the lieutenant said.
On Tuesday about 6 P.M., the five untied Ms. Sanders, who had been given only cigarettes and fruit juice, and fled the apartment, the police said.
None of the suspects showed any remorse for the crime, investigators said. The four arrested made videotaped statements to investigators.
''It seems senseless,'' said Lieutenant Vitaliano. ''These were two harmless people who didn't bother anyone.''

HEADLINE: Quiet Race Worries Connecticut Democrats

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Aug. 24

 BODY:
In two weeks Democrats will choose in a primary for governor between a challenger whose strategy for victory counts on as few voters as possible going to the polls and a convention-endorsed candidate who rarely acknowledges there is a race at all.
The result is a nearly silent campaign of murmurs and glancing blows that has done little to light the partisan fires that many Democrats say will be needed if the state's largest political party is to remain in power.
Based on the candidates' backgrounds and campaign pledges, Democrats face a clear choice in the Sept. 11 contest between United States Representative Bruce A. Morrison of Hamden and State Representative William J. Cibes Jr. of New London, especially on the major question of how the state will deal with its troubled finances next year.
But because Mr. Cibes (pronounced SEA-bus), the challenger, has little money to trumpet his views, and Mr. Morrison, the party front-runner, has chosen almost to ignore Mr. Cibes's challenge, voters have had to be in the right place at the right time to know that there is a race or to be inspired to take any interest in it. Recent world events have not helped. 
''With the Mideast thing and a lot of other issues, my sense is that there are not a lot of people excited about it,'' said Carmella M. Lattizori, who, as First Selectman, is the top Democratic elected official in the town of Barkhamsted, and who is a volunteer worker for Mr. Cibes. ''The primary has kind of gotten back-burnered, if that's a word.''
Strategy has played a part as well. Mr. Cibes's campaign manager, Jonathan Pelto, said this week that because Mr. Cibes is largely unknown, a big turnout would not be good because it would probably swamp the polls with Morrison supporters. Only if less than 20 percent of all Democrats vote will Mr. Cibes's supporters have much hope of being in the majority, Mr. Pelto said.
In the last Democratic gubernatorial primary, in 1978, about 33 percent of the voters turned out. But Mr. Pelto said the low level of interest in this year's race makes it more like the last statewide primary, in 1982, for the office of secretary of the state. Only 18 percent of the 661,000 Democrats registered in that year bothered to vote.
For Mr. Morrison, who has raised more than 10 times the $90,000 collected by Mr. Cibes, the primary has seemed almost incidental. The real opponent, as Mr. Morrison made clear in campaign appearances this week, is former Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a Republican who is running as an independent and leading by a large margin in the polls over all other candidates. The Republican candidate is Representative John G. Rowland of Waterbury.
Voters will decide in the primary which Democrat has the best chance against Mr. Weicker, Mr. Morrison said, and only by going toe to toe with Mr. Weicker now can Mr. Morrison demonstrate that he is that man.
''I'm focused on winning the election in November,'' Mr. Morrison said in an interview about the primary in which the name ''Cibes'' crossed his lips only once. ''That's my goal. That's why I'm running,'' he said. ''In order to win in November I have to win the primary.''
On many issues Mr. Morrison and Mr. Cibes do not differ significantly. Both have made protecting the environment a theme in their speeches, both are for abortion rights and both have presented plans to reinvigorate the state's moribund economy.
 
The Question of an Income Tax
The major difference between them is the question of taxation. Mr. Cibes, who is the chairman of the General Assembly committee on Finance Revenue and Bonding, says that Connecticut's tax system has reached a crisis and must be changed next year. Mr. Morrison says there is still room to maneuver.
Mr. Cibes has said he would propose a sweeping package of tax changes that would lower the sales tax to 5 percent, from 8 percent, cut corporate taxes and impose a progressive income tax for the first time. The new engine of an income tax could then be used for property tax relief, environmental protection and education, he has said.
Mr. Morrison argues that residents are too strained by taxes and a souring economy to risk what he says would be a major tax increase under Mr. Cibes.
Spending must be controlled before taxes are considered, and voters must be consulted through a referendum before an income tax is imposed, Mr. Morrison said.
 
Democrats Less Popular
Both candidates agree that their stands on the tax question are proper measures of their character and philosophies of government. Mr. Morrison said his position reflects a view that people do not want anything ''stuffed down their throats.'' Mr. Cibes said his stance reflects the courage and leadership to say what he believes is needed, however unpopular it may be.
Opinion polls show that Democrats have become less popular in Connecticut in the last year, and some poll-takers say that this race simply reflects that disaffection.
Of 500 residents questioned late last month by the Institute for Social Inquiry at the University of Connecticut, for example, 34 percent said the state would be ''better off'' with a Republican governor. Only 23 percent said they preferred a Democratic governor, while most of the rest either favored Mr. Weicker or said it would depend on the candidate. The poll has margin of error of plus or minus 5 percent.
A recent Gallup poll said that both Mr. Morrison and Mr. Cibes were the least-favored candidates in any of the possible three-way races that voters could decide in November.
Democrats have controlled the governor's office for all but four years since 1955, including the last nine years under William A. O'Neill, who decided in March not to run again as his popularity wilted with the state's economy.
''People are ready for a change without a doubt; they say we need something else,'' said Mrs. Lattizori. ''But I'm not sure at all what that something else is going to be.''

HEADLINE: S.I. Port's Fate Is Muddled by the Mideast Crisis

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
Before the Persian Gulf crisis began, the Staten Island home port was almost ready to open, or almost ready to close, depending on who was asked. Now, the prospects for the port are even more confused.
The debate over the port, the New York metropolitan region's largest military project, has been given a new wind by the largest and costliest troop deployment since the Vietnam War.
The port is now more than 90 percent complete. More than $150 million has been committed to building the pier, the maintenance building and other parts of the base. The families of more than 100 crewmen for the Normandy, the new ship that is the center of the naval task force that is the center of the plan, have already settled into new apartments at Fort Wadsworth near the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. 
Before the current crisis, the scramble to cut military costs had landed the port project on the list of possible cuts in the military budget.
 
'Everything Is Up in the Air'
Now, no one is certain what will happen. ''A few days ago we thought we would probably be announcing more base closures,'' said Glenn E. Flood, a Defense Department spokesman. ''Now everything is up in the air.'' Mr. Flood said no decision was likely on the port until the fall, when a new budget is adopted.
In the meantime, the base's supporters and opponents are pushing in opposite directions. Officially, at least, Staten Island is the designated port for the Normandy and its support group.
The 567-foot missile-carrying cruiser is being checked at a shipyard in Maine. Navy officials expect it to arrive in New York in October.
Chief Petty Officer Lawrence A. Jones, an engineer on the Normandy, and his wife, Diane, recently moved into a new garden apartment at Fort Wadsworth. Mr. Jones has no doubt that the Normandy will sail into New York harbor in a few weeks. ''That's why I'm moving my whole house here,'' he said.
 
Private Users Sought
But more than $100 million in additional construction for the base and personnel support installations has been stalled for months.
Moreover, Mayor David N. Dinkins, who opposes the base, is so certain the project will be killed that a few weeks ago he sought plans for alternative uses for the installation. A report is due in early September.
''The Mayor's intent is the same as it's always been, to find private industrial uses of that site,'' said Albert Scardino, the Mayor's press secretary.
Staten Island and five other new ports across the country were proposed in 1983, when the United States was working to build a 600-ship Navy and needed more berthing space. Opponents said the dispersal was intended to win political support for the buildup.
The Navy is now reviewing its system of bases, including all six home ports, which face different levels of opposition. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney has imposed a spending moratorium on military construction projects, including ports, and has placed four of six home port projects, including Staten Island, on a list of possible cuts. A Nuclear Danger? The port was initially embraced by New York City officials, led by Mayor Edward I. Koch and Representative Guy V. Molinari, now the Staten Island Borough President. Many believed that the Navy would pump $387 million a year into the city's economy. But in the mayoral campaign last year, Mr. Dinkins said he would fight the project because the ships to be berthed on Staten Island could carry nuclear weapons that would endanger the region.
A tour of the two areas within the port - Fort Wadsworth, beneath the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, and the new pier and 200,000-square-foot maintenance building in Stapleton, about two miles away - indicates that the base is close to operating capacity and Navy officials say it is ready to handle the Normandy.
The pier, on which the Normandy and 10 other ships can be docked, was dedicated in 1989. In June, the Navy officially moved its local headquarters from the Brooklyn Navy Yard, which is to be closed by 1992, to Staten Island.
According to the General Accounting Office, $193 million has been appropriated for the Staten Island port. Of that, $152 million had already been obligated as of May 31, and $136 million had been spent.
 
To Build or Not to Build
Before Congress recessed a few weeks ago, a proposed budget amendment to cut off financing for the ports was defeated in the Subcommittee on Seapower and Strategic and Critical Materials and the full Armed Services Committee. A similar amendment could be introduced when a budget bill is debated on the floor of the House of Representatives in the fall.
Mr. Dinkins has asked Defense Department officials and a Congressional committee to force the Navy to stop building on Staten Island until the project's future is decided. He vetoed a city budget expenditure of $22.7 million this year for the reconstruction of Front Street and city bulkheads near the Stapleton pier.
If the Navy were to ship out, Mr. Dinkins has supported the idea of buying back the property and using the new Navy pier to dock a 200-foot-long oil spill recovery ship operated by the oil industry.
 
'I'll Carry the Ball'
Capt. Charles H. Gnerlich, commanding officer of Naval Station, New York, which encompasses Fort Wadsworth, the Brooklyn Navy Yards and several other military installations in the area, has said he is willing to allow an oil spill recovery team to berth at the port even after the Normandy arrives, if that is what the city wants.
''I'll carry the ball for the city to make such an agreement happen,'' Captain Gnerlich said. ''The Mayor doesn't have to buy the facility from me to get what he wants.''
Supporters of the base say it is needed now more than ever. Joseph F. Callo, executive director of Homeport Information Task Force, which represents businesses and officials supporting the project, said that if Navy ships had sailed to the Gulf from New York instead of Newport News, Va., they would have arrived one or two days earlier.
But Representative Ted Weiss, a New York Democrat, said the Persian Gulf crisis has not changed his view that completing the port would be a waste of taxpayer money. ''I don't doubt at all that some people are going to use the crisis as an excuse for keeping home port alive,'' he said, ''but I don't think the argument is going to sell.''

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Fall Back $1 a Barrel

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
Prices of crude oil fell $1.02 a barrel in the futures market yesterday, and prices for gasoline and home heating oil eased slightly. Analysts and brokers said jittery commodity traders cashed in some profits before the close of a landmark week in the oil markets.
The contract for October delivery settled yesterday at $30.91, a gain of $2.28 on the week. Alarmed by American military maneuvers and fear of fighting near the giant Middle East oilfields, traders had pushed oil prices to $31.93 on Thursday, and at one point during the day to $32.35, which equalled the highest level in the seven-year history of the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 
Gasoline Prices Ease
Gasoline prices ended the week at $1.05 a gallon, off 4 cents from a record close on Thursday at $1.09 a gallon on the New York Merc. Home heating oil finished the week at 91 cents a gallon, losing 5 cents yesterday, but up 10 cents for the week.
Albert Helmig, a principal with Energex, a commodity brokerage firm, said that although traders remained nervous about events in the Persian Gulf, many reduced their holdings of October contracts because of the uncertain impact of military and diplomatic activity over the weekend, as well as the unofficial meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries set for tomorrow in Vienna.
If Saudi Arabian oilfields are damaged, it will likely cause crude prices to soar when trading resumes Monday. But if tensions between Baghdad and the West ease, or if OPEC members agree to raise production to replace the estimated four million barrels lost from Iraq and Kuwait, prices will fall, analysts said.
 
Reason for Caution
''If something good happens, it would put a lot of pressure on the October contract price,'' Mr. Helmig said, explaining why traders are cautious, even though most continue to bet on an outbreak of war and disruption of supplies. Many European traders closed their positions yesterday since the London commodity market will be closed Monday, ''Most people in the market think this is a crucial weekend,'' said Robert S. Jonke, a trading manager and analyst at Cargill Investors Services, a commodity brokerage firm in New York.
''There has been no lessening of tensions, but some people wanted to take their profit and get out,'' said James R. Fiedlerat E.D.&F. Man Inc., in New York, despite a very dangerous situation in the Persian Gulf.
Ministers from as many as 10 OPEC nations are to meet tomorrow in Vienna to discuss raising output quotas, although the role of Saudi Arabia, the group's largest producer, was unclear. Some analysts said little of consequence was expected from the meeting.
The Saudis indicated last week that they would increase output by nearly two million barrels a day next month, and other OPEC members, including Venezuela, Nigeria and the United Arab Emirates, were expected to add one million barrels to help cover the shortfall from Iraq and Kuwait.
Global demand for OPEC oil was estimated at 22 million barrels a day before the Iraqi invasion on Aug. 2. Fareed Mohamedi, senior economist at the Petroleum Finance Company in Washington, said OPEC output would rise to 22.5 million barrels a day next month if the Saudis, Venezuela, the United Arab Emirates and Nigeria succeed in raising output to their recently voiced objectives.
 
Doubt About Output
But many analysts doubt that those production levels will be achieved in the coming months. In that case, oil prices could resume their climb even if war is avoided.
Also, some analysts said, little of the Saudis' additional production would be available for export, since much would be diverted for Saudi and American military use.
Adam E. Sieminski of the Washington Analysis Corporation, a Washington consulting firm, said a worldwide crude oil shortage would probably would be evident as early as mid-September. He predicted heating oil shortages by November.
''Prices are going to go higher,'' he said. ''How much higher depends on whether we have a shooting war, whether the Administration taps the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and how effective the embargo of Iraq is. The odds that we could have $35 oil, at least for a while, are pretty good.''
A war would drive prices to $50 or higher, he added.
 
Increases by Refiners
Domestic refineries in the United States continued to increase the cash prices paid for oil delivered this week. The Mobil Corporation said yesterday that it increased its posted price at its Texas refineries by $3.25 a barrel, to $30.25 a barrel, on Thursday. The Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the state's oil industry, estimated that posted prices at refineries would average more than $29 a barrel for the week.
Oil prices have doubled from a close of $15.30 in the futures market on June 20, and are up nearly $10 a barrel since the day before the Iraqi invasion. The Middle East events have also sent gasoline prices surging, and consumers face further increases in coming weeks, even though supplies were reported adequate as the end of the summer driving season neared.
The average price of unleaded regular gasoline at self-service pumps rose 3.7 cents since Monday, to an eight-year high of $1.27 across the nation, the American Automobile Association said yesterday.
Higher oil prices are also expected to extract a heavy toll on the nation's work force. Stephen P. A. Brown, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said that if oil prices held at $31 a barrel through 1991, the economy would lose 1.2 million jobs.
An analysis of 1989 economic data indicates the nation loses 90,000 jobs for every $1 rise in oil prices, Mr. Brown said, although the effects vary by region. For instance, in Texas 15,000 jobs are added for every $1 rise in oil prices, as the domestic oil industry increases drilling activity.

HEADLINE: G.N.P. Rate For 2d Period A Weak 1.2%

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24

 BODY:
In what many analysts see as a further sign of a weakened economy, the Government confirmed today that growth was listless even before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait jolted oil prices.
Figures released by the Commerce Department confirmed an earlier estimate that the nation's output of goods and services had risen at an anemic 1.2 percent, or $12.2 billion, for the second quarter of 1990. That followed a 1.7 percent growth rate in the first quarter and a rate of three-tenths of 1 percent in the fourth quarter last year.
The latest figures are far below earlier expectations by the Bush Administration of a growth rate of at least 2 percent for the year. 
 
Drop in Business Inventories
Economists had hoped that increased exports and consumer spending would lead to an upward revision of the gross national product for April, May and June. But those advances were more than offset by a sharp downward revision in business inventories from the first estimate released July 27.
''The economy is headed toward a recession,'' said H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company. ''The imposition of the 1990 oil shock on top of extremely tight monetary policy will push consumption and, thus, the economy into a somewhat lower position than we had expected.''
Economists have traditionally defined recession as two or more consecutive quarters of negative growth.
The new figures appear to make even more delicate both the economic and the political situation of the Federal Reserve Board, which sets monetary policy. Any immediate move to infuse money into the system and encourage industrial growth could add to the already-rising rate of inflation. On the other hand, a failure to provide some relief could cause a further drop in production and increase the number of people unemployed, leading to a recession.
Since July, the price of crude oil has risen more than 75 percent. Economists say that each 1 percent rise in the crude oil price could cut the gross national product by about a tenth of a percent. The Bush Administration, insisting a recession is avoidable, has been pressing the Fed to lower interest rates. A New York Times/CBS Poll conducted this month showed that more than 60 percent of the people surveyed believed the nation was already in recession, and 55 percent said the economy was getting worse.
''It's not a great choice for the Fed,'' said Allen Sinai, an economist at the Boston Company. ''There isn't enough data yet for the central bank to call it a recession by the traditional definition and to ease monetary policy. But from the data, it is easy to read that the momentum of the economy was sliding in the second quarter and it is not hard to forecast that we are heading toward a recession.'' Members 'Remained Confident'
The minutes of the July meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee, released today, reflected the view that inflation would not pose a significant problem for the economy. ''The members generally remained confident,'' the minutes said, ''that some progress would begin to be made in reducing the underlying rate of inflation during the period ahead, given their expectations of diminished pressures on labor and capital resources.'' Their view was formed, however, before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait pushed oil prices up sharply.
The Open Market Committee met again on Tuesday and, although the committee does not immediately announce what happens at each meeting, there were indications that it has decided not to make any change in monetary policy until the Persian Gulf crisis has subsided.
Briefing reporters in Kennebunkport, Me., the White House press spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said the Commerce Department report showed that the economy ''was indeed still growing,'' but he emphasized the need for a quick agreement with Congress on controlling the budget deficit to offset any negative impact the Persian Gulf crisis might have on the economy.
The growth reported today for the second quarter, combined with the 1.7 percent increase for the first quarter, put the nation's annual rate of growth at 1.5 percent for the first half of 1990.
The report reduced earlier figures on the growth of business inventories by $14.6 billion, to $11.6 billion. After-tax profits of American corporations also slipped, by two-tenths of 1 percent, to $166.7 billion, their worst decline since a 5.9 percent drop in the third quarter last year.
 
No Change on Inflation
The Government's reading of inflation was unchanged in the Commerce Department's report, which said that the price index tied to the gross national product rose at an annual rate of 3.9 percent in the second quarter. Government officials expect inflation to worsen in the third quarter because of higher fuel prices.
Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of economic activity, increased three-tenths of 1 percent in the quarter, a modest increase from the earlier estimates but substantially down from the 1.1 percent increase for the first quarter. Business investment spending fell 5.2 percent, and housing construction dropped 10.8 percent.

HEADLINE: Going Private Is a Public Affair

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Under the plan of the Mexican Government to privatize its huge national telephone company, the winning bidder will have to agree to increase the number of household phone lines from 5 million to 10 million over the next four years; reduce installation time from 18 months to 6, and shrink the wait for a dial tone from 30 seconds to under 10.
Short of cash to pay off debt and also to support education, health care and other social programs, the administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is plunging into privatization. But in Mexico, privatization comes with a great deal of regulation for the new owners, and that might rule out sales at full market value, in the opinion of some economists and businessmen.
''There is a trade-off between price and regulation, and the Government might have to adjust the price downward,'' said Federico Reyes Heroles, an economist at the University of Mexico. $20 Billion Is the Goal Two tendencies are emerging among the European and Latin American nations caught up in the privatization trend. Britain and Argentina, for example, impose few rules, trusting that the growth potential of their markets will prompt the new owners to invest billions of dollars voluntarily. But countries like Hungary and Mexico, with less confidence in free market incentives, are trying to hold the new owners to detailed annual growth rates. 
''We have a Mexican model: You privatize but you regulate,'' said Jacques Rogozinski, chief of the Mexican Government's Office for Privatization. ''We do not believe that the Government has to own things to direct the economy.''
Whatever the dampening effect of regulation, the Government is hoping to raise more than $20 billion -roughly 30 percent of what it spends in a single year -from the sale not only of the phone company and 18 major banks, but also of a copper mine, steel mills and dozens of other enterprises. More than half of the hoped-for revenue is to come from the phone company and the banks.
The regulations concerning the sale of the telephone company, Telefonos de Mexico, are probably the most demanding. And although the sale is to be completed by Christmas, many criteria are just now being published. Potential bidders include three United States companies, the GTE Corporation, Southwestern Bell and U S West.
By all estimates, the cost of meeting the Government's and other goals will be roughly $8 billion over 8 to 10 years for a company whose market value is about $8 billion, based on the price of publicly traded Telefonos stock. The Government owns 51 percent of the company and it would receive more than $4 billion from the sale, Mr. Rogozinski said, but only if the company is sold for its full market value.
The Salinas Government does not want to give ground on price in these transactions. In one case, however, it has had to. The Cananaea copper mine, which accounts for 3 percent of the world's copper production, was put up for sale last year at nearly $1 billion. After three attempts to sell the mine, 25 miles from the Arizona border, the high bid in an auction this week was $475 million, from a Mexican group. The price tag came down in part because the new owners will be under pressure from the Government to invest $250 million in the next few months to upgrade equipment, and $1 billion over a five-year period.
In theory, at least, the Telefonos sale is structured to encourage this sort of big investment, without at the same time making sacrifices on price. The operating group will be able to gain voting control of the company through a payment of only $2 billion, Mr. Rogozinski said. Most of the limited voting stock will be sold to the public, and traded on stock exchanges here and abroad.
But however low the initial payment from the controlling group might be, Telefonos's average net income in recent years has been only about half of the $1 billion a year that will probably have to be invested to comply with the goals that Mr. Rogozinski's office is putting together.
That means the controlling group, and perhaps the public investors, will have to ante up hundreds of millions of additional dollars before the investment in Telefonos begins to pay a dividend, toward the end of the decade. Mr. Rogozinski estimates that reinvested profits might supply up to 70 percent of the capital requirements of the telephone company.
 
Taking the Long View
Nevertheless, plowing new money into Telefonos and waiting years for the first dividends might turn out to be acceptable to some of the private groups considering a bid, given the growth potential of a country whose industrial output is expanding while telephones are limited to one for every 17 people. Although U S West, one of the potential bidders, has not commented on the Mexican deal, the company has made a similar investment in a television cable concession in Hong Kong. That investment is not expected to begin to pay off until just before China takes control of the British colony, in the late 1990's.
Some critics of privatization in Mexico, among them Albert Barranco Chavarria, an economics columnist for the daily newspaper La Jornada, argue that if private investors are willing to upgrade the telephone company and wait for a payoff, then the Mexican Government should also take this long-term approach. Unlike state-owned companies in Eastern Europe and some other Latin American countries, major Mexican companies held by the state - among them the oil and telephone companies and the banks - have been profitable in recent years.
Rather than invest these profits in the companies, however, the Salinas administration has used the money to pay foreign and domestic debt, finance social services and reduce the budget deficit. The administration argues that these outlays remain the top priority and in addition the Government cannot, over the long run, operate a company as efficiently as the private sector.
The private sector, however, faces problems under the privatization rules in Mexico. Because foreign ownership is limited or prohibited for some major state enterprises, companies are being sold to consortiums of Mexican businessmen, raising the possibility of disagreements.
This has been the case with the Mexican groups that purchased the two state airlines last year. In one case, Aeromexico, one group is buying out another. And in the case of Mexicana de Aviacion, one partner has put his share up for sale.
Mexicans will hold a majority stake in the group that will gain control of Telefonos de Mexico, and the minority partner will be a foreign phone company that will provide technology and operating expertise. To prevent one partner or another from pulling out, the Government has specified that the controlling shares must go into a trust that cannot be touched for five years.
The banks, which were nationalized in 1982 and are now being resold, are also subject to numerous regulations. Industrial companies, for example, cannot be buyers. A new Government agency will monitor bank practices, in part to prevent new owners from making risky loans to themselves or their friends at preferential rates. And foreign ownership will be limited to 30 percent. Among American banks, Bank of America and Morgan Guaranty have made inquiries, published reports have said.
 
The Old and the New
Still, the resale of the banks, which account for 90 percent of the nation's commercial banking industry, is likely to go more smoothly than other privatization projects. The new owners are expected to be mostly the same Mexican business groups that owned the banks when they were nationalized. Having received $400 million when the banks were seized, they are being asked for $8 billion to buy them back.
But in the intervening years, the Government has increased the banks' profits threefold. It has invested millions of dollars in new computer equipment and it has closed weak banks or merged them with stronger ones.
That should make them attractive as investments to foreign banks. But so far most of the foreign interest is coming from Europeans, particularly the French and the Spanish. ''More than the Americans, Europeans don't mind not having control,'' said Guillermo Ortiz, Under Secretary of the Finance Ministry. ''They are accustomed to minority stakes.''

HEADLINE: Oil? Nation's Utilities Are Not So Worried

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Whatever damage the run-up in oil prices inflicts on the economy as a whole, the effect on electricity bills is likely to be relatively modest. Of the fuel-consuming industries, the electric utilities have been the most successful in learning the lessons of the first two oil shocks, in the 1970's, and finding other sources.
Oil accounted for about 16 percent of the fuel used by utilities at the time of the Iranian revolution in 1979, but amounted to only an average of 5.7 percent last year, despite a vast increase in the amount of electricity generated over the last decade. Moving the electric system off oil is important because a growing share of the energy used in this country - almost 36 percent last year - is turned into electricity before it is consumed.
 
Variations Among Companies
But the amount of oil used by utilities still varies widely from company to company, so the effect of rising oil prices on consumer bills will also vary. The Hawaiian Electric Company, for example, is nearly all oil-powered. The Long Island Lighting Company is still 63 percent oil-dependent, while the Consolidated Edison Company of New York depends on oil to generate 41 percent of its power. 
A barrel of oil produces about 500 kilowatt-hours when burned. The average household uses about 500 kilowatt-hours a month. If a utility was 100 percent oil-dependent, a $20 increase in the price of a barrel of oil would raise the monthly electric bill by the same amount.
But most utilities that were heavily dependent on oil in the 1970's have weaned themselves away by converting to coal or natural gas and by purchasing or building hydroelectric capacity or nuclear reactors. In addition, experts say, few plants built in the last few years use oil.
''As the utilities began to see themselves as competitors, and wanted to portray themselves as low-cost producers, the incentives were for them to switch away from oil,'' said Marie Corio, president of Applied Economic Research in New York.
They accomplished this first by running their own plants in a different pattern. They used gas- or coal-fired generation first, bought power from utilities with extra coal-fired capacity next, and then rebuilt their hardware to burn fuels other than oil. This required adding anti-pollution equipment in many cases, although the biggest technical difficulty was often finding a place to store the additional coal, some experts said.
As various users now substitute gas for oil, the price of gas will rise, Dr. Corio said. This may discourage the plans of some utilities and independent power producers to build new natural gas-fired power stations.
Others are not sure the price of gas will rise. ''We don't see a very direct linkage,'' said I. C. Bupp, a managing director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. Even if oil gives up part of the market to gas, ''there will still be gas-on-gas competition,'' he said.
Coal prices will not rise, because ''there is so much spare capacity, nobody has to dig a new mine,'' said Standley H. Hoch, chairman and chief executive of General Public Utilities in New Jersey. It gets about 45 percent of its energy from coal.
Companies with excess capacity to burn coal will be in a strong position to sell power to those that use oil, said Charles B. Earle and Gary R. Licht, utility analysts at Mabon, Nugent & Company, the securities firm. They add that companies that still use oil heavily may find that after they have passed increased fuel costs to their customers, they will run into political resistance to unrelated increases. Eastern Utilities Associates, which wholesales power in New England, is in the former category, they said. Central Maine Power and Con Edison are among the latter. Still, the public's resistance to nuclear power and the emissions problems that arise from burning coal make it doubtful that oil will disappear in electric generation.
 
Gas or Light Oil Burned
In addition, many utilities and independent power producers have added turbines that burn natural gas when it is available and light oil when it is not. In the Northeast, these generators have been blamed for increasing the demand for heating oil on the coldest winter days, when natural gas is in short supply, as happened last December.
Over all, however, the conversion away from oil has been dramatic.
United Illuminating, which serves the New Haven and Bridgeport areas of Connecticut, is now about 22 percent oil-dependent, down from 92 percent at the time of the Iranian revolution. That figure will fall to 11 percent by 1991, the company says, at which point, even if oil prices doubled, electric costs would go up only 9 percent.
The reasons for the switch by utilities around the country are illustrated by United Illuminating's cost structure. The fuel and operating cost per kilowatt-hour at the plant gate is 2.176 cents for Bridgeport Harbor 3, a 25-year-old plant that was converted from oil to coal in 1985. A less-efficient oil-fired plant, which was used only about 7 percent of the time last year, has a price of 5.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.
 
Nuclear Power Increased
United Illuminating and many other utilities also substituted uranium for oil by building nuclear plants, which last year generated 19 percent of the domestically produced electricity, up from 4.5 percent in 1973, at the time of the first oil shock. The Seabrook nuclear plant, which went into commercial operation earlier this week and of which United Illuminating owns 17.5 percent, costs the company 1.792 cents a kilowatt-hour, the utility said.
But building new nuclear plants is an option now closed, for all practical purposes, because of waste disposal problems, safety and regulatory questions, and especially cost overruns. Building Seabrook bankrupted the biggest investor, the Public Service Company of New Hampshire and required United Illuminating to seek several emergency rate increases.
The New England Electric System, another Seabrook partner, which was 78 percent oil-dependent in 1979, has since reduced its reliance. John Rowe, the chairman, said the company had adopted ''a general strategy of not being caught that dependent again.''
Even when oil bottomed out at around $10 a barrel in 1986, he said, the coal the company was burning in converted plants was cheaper.
''In 1990, people understand the need to burn coal, with troops in the Middle East,'' Mr. Rowe said. ''But it isn't always obvious at other times.''
 
Changes in Florida
Florida Power and Light, which was 53 percent dependent on oil in 1979, completed two new nuclear plants and is now seeking other ways to curtail its oil use. It has signed long-term contracts for natural gas, and recently signed a letter of intent to buy a minority interest in a coal-fired plant in Georgia. This year, oil will make up 22 percent of its fuel, said Michael R. Bumgardner, a spokesman.
Southern California Edison was more than 40 percent dependent on oil at the time of the 1973 oil shock, said Larry Papay, a senior vice president. Now it is 4 to 5 percent dependent on the fuel. In the last 10 years, nuclear power has grown to 17 percent, from 4 percent, he said. The company also burns more coal and natural gas, and buys or generates power from solar plants, geothermal plants and windmills.
The company's focus is on improving efficiency, he said. ''Although conservation lost some of its glamour after 1985, we have continued spending $44 million or $45 million a year'' to help customers use electricity more efficiently, he said. Earlier this year, after negotiations with environmental groups and others, it raised the sum to $75 million, and will increase it again to $100 million.
 
Long Island Abandonment
Less successful in reducing imported oil is Long Island Lighting, which built a nuclear plant that would have displaced more than eight million barrels of oil a year if it had operated as its designers said it would. But the plant was abandoned by agreement with New York State because of safety concerns.
In the last 12 months, the company has been 62.5 percent dependent on oil, 13.5 percent on natural gas, 5.5 percent on nuclear power from a plant upstate and 18.5 percent on purchased power - a mix of natural gas, coal, hydroelectric power and even garbage, which is burned in a power-generating incinerator.
In July, Lilco paid an average of $15.19 a barrel for the heavy oil it uses, up from $14.49 in June. On Monday, it paid $22.50.

HEADLINE: Fed Panel Kept Steady Course in July

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers concluded in July that inflation remained high enough to require that current interest rates be maintained despite a ''relatively slow'' economy, records released today show.
''The staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested that the economy would expand over the remainder of 1990 at around the rate estimated for the first half of the year and at a slightly faster pace in 1991,'' minutes of the July meeting said.
Ten days later, on July 13, the central bank did lower the Federal funds rate - the rate banks charge for overnight loans - from 8.25 percent to 8 percent. But the Fed said that action was intended to offset overly cautious lending practices by the nation's banks and was not carried out because of a weakening economy. 
The Federal Open Market Committee met again Tuesday but decisions made then will not be announced for six weeks.
In testimony before Congress in July, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said the central bank projected a 1990 growth rate of 1.5 percent to 2 percent, slightly slower than the Bush Administration forecast of 2 percent.
Since then, however, the Commerce Department reported the economy slowed from a 1.7 percent annual rate of growth in the first quarter of 1990 to 1.2 percent in the second quarter, and there have been signs of further weakness as the economy entered the second half of the year.
Moreover, the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq on Aug. 2 has driven the price of oil above $30 a barrel, adding to inflationary pressures and concerns that the economy may be pushed into a recession.
 
Juggling Interest Rates
The Federal Open Market Committee, which is made up of the 7 Fed governors and 5 of the 12 presidents of Fed regional banks, had pushed short-term rates up, beginning in 1988, to slow the economy in an attempt to curb inflation. But as economic growth weakened, the policy makers began nudging short-term rates down, starting in June 1989.
The Administration and many economists have been urging the committee to permit interest rates to fall further to stimulate the economy.
''The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity was continuing to expand but at a relatively slow pace,'' the minutes said.
At the same time, the minutes said that while prices had moderated since earlier in the year, ''there was little evidence of significant change in the trend rate of inflation.''
At the end of the meeting, the members voted, 11 to 0, to maintain current interest rates. Manuel Johnson, the vice chairman, who is resigning, did not attend the meeting.

HEADLINE: Bond Yields Rise in Volatile Trading

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Long-term Treasury bond yields continued to edge higher yesterday in a trading session marked by volatile price swings. The Treasury debt market was buoyed after the opening by weakness in oil prices and the absence of any signifcant worsening of the situation in the Middle East, as well as by the expected slowing in the growth rate of the second-quarter gross national product.
''After some buying after the opening, which included some bargain-hunting, most market participants concentrated on unwinding or hedging positions for the weekend,'' said Kevin M. Flanagan, money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds. ''But the shorter maturities were spared the volatile price moves and were essentially unchanged for most of the session.'' 
 
Long Bond at 9.15 Percent
In late trading, the Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 8.75 percent issue maturing in August 2020, were offered at 95 25/32, down 8/32 on the day, while the yield rose to 9.15 percent from 9.11 percent the day before and 8.93 percent a week ago.
Although the long bond's yield is at its highest level since March 1989, the real rates of return on Treasury debt issues are falling well below those on comparable Japanese and German maturities. The real rate of return is the yield, less the rate of inflation. This development has given rise to concern about the Treasury's ability to continue financing the Federal deficit and other needs without increasing interest rates.
Eugene J. Sherman, senior vice president and chief economist at the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, said that ''German and Japanese bond yields and real rates of return have soared in the past month, despite the fact that their inflation levels were rising faster than ours before the surge in oil prices.''
Using 10-year Treasury maturities as a yardstick, Mr. Sherman found that the real interest rate in Germany was 5.9 percent, roughly the same as in Japan and about 4 percent in the United States.
The Treasury's long notes, the 8.75's of August 2000, fell 6/32 on the day, to 98 6/32, as the yield rose to 9.03 percent, from 8.79 percent a week ago. By comparison, the yield on Japanese Government 10-year bonds, their longest maturity, climbed to 8.29 percent, from 8.05 percent a week ago, while the same German long bonds rose to 8.94 percent from 8.89 percent during the week.
Using 90-day Eurocurrency rates for a measure of real short-term returns, Mr. Sherman found the real interest rates in Germany and Japan at 5.5 percent while those in the United States were roughly at 3 percent.
''Consequently, United States financial markets are more vulnerable at this stage than major foreign markets,'' Mr. Sherman said. ''In short, interest rates here are likely to move up and the dollar lower under almost any reasonable prospective scenario.''
Meanwhile, the discount rate on 90-day Treasury bills fell seven basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 7.46 percent; six-month bills slipped three basis points, to 7.48 percent, but the one-year bills added a basis point, at 7.41 percent.
 
No Fed Intervention
The Federal Reserve refrained from intervention in the credit markets, as was expected, because the central bank had arranged a large infusion of reserves into the banking system on Thursday through four-day repurchase agreements. Partly as a result, the Federal funds rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans held steady at 8 1/16 percent most of the day before closing at 8 percent.
Elsewhere in the credit markets, American Airlines Inc., a subsidiary of the AMR Corporation, priced at par $250 million in equipment trust certificates with maturities ranging from 1992 to 2014 through Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. The securities yield from 8.75 percent to 10.68 percent and are rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Up From Lows; Gold Higher in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
In what is becoming a usual Friday performance, the dollar rose yesterday ahead of an uncertain weekend in the tense Persian Gulf.
Gold prices advanced after drifting lower overseas. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled at $415 an ounce, up $3 from Thursday. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $414, up $2.75 an ounce. 
After falling in the previous session to new lows against the German mark, the Swiss franc and the British pound, the dollar was ripe for a technical rebound. The currency began rising in Asian trading and continued to gain ground when activity shifted to Europe and then the United States.
Traders continued to focus on developments in the Middle East, where a tense standoff got under way at foreign embassies in Kuwait. The United States Embassy and at least seven other missions were encircled by Iraqi troops as diplomats defied an order to close their doors.
 
'Threat of Military Conflict'
''There's a threat of military conflict over the weekend, and despite all the obvious concerns over the economy, the knee-jerk reaction says you buy dollars,'' said Earl Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
Traders agreed that if hostilities do not break in the next few days, the dollar is likely to resume its descent.
''Events are arguing for a higher dollar, but fundamentals are arguing for a lower dollar,'' said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company.
Indeed, the Commerce Department confirmed its first estimate that the economy grew at a sluggish annual rate of 1.2 percent in the second quarter. Although traders said there was little reaction to the report, they added that the notion of broad economic weakness was not being lost on the market.
In Tokyo the dollar fell to a closing 145.70 Japanese yen, from 145.88 at Thursday's close. But it rose later in London to 146.45 yen and continued to gain ground, settling in New York at 146.75 yen, up from 146.19 yen on Thursday.
In London, the British pound fetched $1.9445, cheaper than $1.9515 late Thursday. In New York, it cost $1.9400 to buy 1, less expensive than Thursday's $1.9570.
Against the German currency, the dollar rose to 1.5605 marks from 1.5445.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.2720 Swiss francs, up from 1.2560; 5.2360 French francs, up from 5.1855; 1,159.50 Italian lire, up from 1,152.00, and 1.1353 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1293.
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $411.75 an ounce, from $412.75 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, the metal settled at a closing bid of $410.75, down from $411.75. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.61 an ounce to close at $410.95.
Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex silver bullion for current delivery settled at $5.187 an ounce, up from $5.126 on Thursday. In London the metal fell to a late bid price of $5.14 an ounce from $5.15.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Cattle Prices Are Declining Amid Fears of a Recession

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Cattle futures prices slipped yesterday at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange amid continuing fears of a recession.
Cattle prices are vulnerable on a number of fronts and are now at the mercy of the Middle East energy crisis and the potential for a recession, said Paul Hare, an analyst in Chicago with Linnco Futures Inc.
''There's also some concern about the profitability for cattle prices this fall because of the extremely high prices that were paid for feeders in the early spring and midsummer,'' he said. 
The cash market is not helping, he said, with cash feeders falling $2 to $5 a hundredweight yesterday.
In contrast, pork futures showed some stability after a period of sharp declines in cash prices.
Cattle futures settled 0.25 cent to 0.75 cent lower, with the contract for delivery in October at 76.17 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.55 cent to 1.15 cents lower, with August at 88.17 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to 0.33 cent higher, with October at 48.42 cents a pound, and frozen pork bellies were 1.82 cents lower to 0.30 cent higher, with August at 41.90 cents a pound.
Soybean futures prices advanced on the Chicago Board of Trade.
''After yesterday's strength, nobody wanted to sell,'' said Mickey Luth, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ''The fundamentals were there to drive it higher.''
He said bean prices were benefiting from lower supplies, reduced South American production and smaller amounts of competing crops.
Grain prices, on the other hand, were weak.
''They don't have the dynamics of soybeans,'' Mr. Luth said. ''The corn supply is getting bigger, not smaller. And there's no risk of frost.'' The latest 6-to-10-day forecast calls for warm temperatures in the main corn-growing regions, and Mr. Luth said he felt confident that the crop would make it past Oct. 1 and into the harvest season without severe frost damage.
Wheat was 1 cent lower to 1 3/4 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in September at $2.84 3/4 a bushel; corn was 1 1/4 cents lower to 1/4 cent higher, with September at $2.57 3/4 a bushel; oats were 1 1/4 cents lower to 3/4 cent higher, with September at $1.18 a bushel, and soybeans were 1 1/2 cents lower to 5 cents higher, with September at $6.30 a bushel.

HEADLINE: USAir Plans More Layoffs

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
USAir Group Inc., which had already announced layoffs of more than 1,500 workers this month, said yesterday that it planned to cut another 2,100 jobs by the end of the year. The latest reduction amounts to about 4 percent of the work force of the airline company, which is based in Arlington, Va. 
''These additional personnel cuts take into account the softening of passenger demand, poor economic conditions, escalating fuel costs and the company's need to reduce operating costs,'' said Edwin Colodny, the company's chairman. The nation's seventh-largest airline has had to roll back expansion plans. USAir said it was planning to increase capacity next year by 2 percent, compared with its original plans of 6 percent.
USAir currently has about 54,000 employees. It has hubs in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Charlotte, N.C.

HEADLINE: SPORTS OF THE TIMES;
Saratoga's Backyard Success

BYLINE: By Steven Crist

DATELINE: SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y.

 BODY:
Business at Saratoga this month should have been rotten. The economy is receding. Tourism in the area is down. The racing is indifferent and the weather is as unpredictable as the steeplechasers.
Yet still they come, day after day, the old faithful horseplayers and the newly curious patrons, and they can hardly wait to part with their currency. The usually prosperous tourist business in nearby Lake George is down 30 percent this summer, but the attendance at Saratoga Race Track is holding steady and the betting is up 9 percent. 
No one is coming for the fabled water, oily and overrated stuff. Nor is the climate a draw. Last Saturday, it was 90 degrees and stickier than jam, and the next night the temperatures plunged to the 40's. When it rains, it rains for days. The only thing you can count on rain or shine is being mugged by mosquitoes the size of small children.
When the racing is good, it is very good, but more often, it is peculiar and maddening: steeplechases and grass races on the flat at marathon distances that are impossible to handicap, fields full of first-time starters that are exercises in guesswork and dozens of shippers.
No one comes for superior amenities. Saratoga is a charming old place, but short on comfort. Seats with decent views of the races are scarce, and lines for everything from rest rooms to betting windows are infuriatingly long. Even the swells have to crowd into tiny boxes that sell for $50 a day, and then pay $10.50 for a cheeseburger.
A far more pleasant day at the races can be had any afternoon in the summer or fall at Belmont Park on Long Island, but there, attendance dwindles every season and the box-seat section is a ghost town. So what is everyone doing here? Race tracks usually thrive during recessions, but Saratoga is a phenomenon unto itself. Its continued success over the last decade has not carried over to Aqueduct or Belmont. Saratoga should be New York racing's best marketing tool, but it seems entirely self-contained. Saratoga turns newcomers into Saratoga fans, not into racing fans. The society angle also seems overblown. Everyone talks and writes about the rich people who move into their summer houses here for a month and go racing every day, but there are no gawking masses hungering for a glimpse of the well-heeled. No one pays much attention to the swells but the other swells, and there is no evidence that the throngs in the grandstand are there because they enjoy gambling under the same roof as richer folk.
In fact, the swell in Saratoga's business over the last decade has been decidedly downscale. The largest segment of new racegoers are the group that spends the day picnicking in the expanded backyard area. Clad in tank tops and shorts and toting folding lawn chairs, they stake out a spot for the afternoon and get no closer to a race than the television monitors hung in the trees. They will wander over to the betting windows a few times during the afternoon, but they could just as well be at an offtrack betting parlor, except that there is no such parlor where you can sit on your own lawn chair and eat from a picnic basket.
Perhaps that is the secret of Saratoga's success. For many of the new patrons, a day at Saratoga is like a day in their own backyard, with the added amusement of nine horse races on a television screen. With money tight, people are taking fewer vacations, and a few day trips to Saratoga add up to a cheap vacation.
The other difference from being in your own backyard is that every half hour or so, some horses wander through the picnic area as they are being led to the paddock. The best thing about Saratoga for those who enjoy horses as well as racing is the close-up view of the runners before and after a race. It is too easy at other tracks to relegate these magnificent creatures to numbered specks on a television screen. Saratoga reminds you of the flesh and blood.
Go for Wand, Rhythm and Meadow Star may be remembered as the stars of the meeting, but a less renowned runner turned in two performances that show just how big these horses' hearts really are. Token Dance, a talented 3-year-old sprinting filly, ran in the Test Stakes here Aug. 2 and ran well to be third to the spectacular Go for Wand. Eddie Maple, her jockey, knew she had hit her head on the side of the starting gate when she broke, but only after the race did he and the filly's trainer, Pat Kelly, find that Token Dance had ripped out three teeth and a piece of her jaw.
She did not flinch when a veterinarian went in with a knife that night and cut out the broken piece of her jaw, which will grow back in time. Then three days ago, Token Dance went back to the races. Under firm but gentle handling by Maple, she scored a comfortable victory.
''She's amazing, '' Kelly said. ''She's got a hole in her jaw and a big space where those teeth should be. I guess now she can whistle 'All I Want for Christmas Are My Three Front Teeth.' ''

Oil vs. Gas: A Question of Cost Again

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
The contest between oil and natural gas for supremacy in the home heating market has been long and bitter. Now the confrontation between the United States and Iraq has made it more intense.
Since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 the price of home heating oil, along with prices of gasoline and other petroleum products, has risen sharply. To the gas industry and some Government officials, these increases are typical of price patterns during oil crises and could presage still further rises in oil prices this winter. 
But to the oil industry and at least one consumer group, the price changes accompanying the new turmoil in the Middle East represent little more than a blip on a chart on which both fuels fluctuate and neither has a monopoly on large price advances and declines.
No one questions the fact that prices of home heating oil are up this month. A survey by the New York State Consumer Protection Board found that since the invasion of Kuwait, the average price of heating oil in the state has jumped to $1.07 a gallon from 95 cents, and the average price in New York City to $1.19 from $1.06.
''We have received no indication that there are oil supply problems, yet home heating oil prices are now at their highest August level in six years,'' said Richard M. Kessel, executive director of the board. ''Based on current projections, I wouldn't be surprised if by Labor Day or shortly thereafter you're going to be paying $1.25 for home heating oil. This is going to be a very difficult winter.''
Mr. Kessel's words are music to the ears of natural gas executives. In their marketing efforts they have frequently cited what they perceive as the advantages of gas for heating homes, including ready availability of gas, its clean burning qualities and no storage requirements. Now they are emphasizing the price argument even more.
 
Gas Industry's Warnings
''There is a good potential for higher oil prices, and that makes gas a better buy relative to oil,'' said Paul D. Holtberg, principal economist of the Gas Research Institute, an arm of the natural gas industry. ''In the worst-case scenario with a war in the Middle East, a great deal of productive capacity would be destroyed.''
''The cost of oil varies with demand,'' added Walter F. Wilm Jr., vice president of gas operations for the Long Island Lighting Company. ''Whenever there is a supply disruption or the threat of one, the cost of oil goes up.''
Heating oil specialists, however, believe that such talk is an example of not seeing the forest for the trees. They say that oil prices, as well as gas prices, should be viewed as a continuum rather than as a series of peaks and valleys. Seen that way, they say, there is no clear-cut distinction as to which fuel is less expensive for the homeowner over the long run.
 
Oil Men's View of Prices
''We've had extreme highs and we've had extreme lows,'' said William F. Kenny, president of the Metropolitan Energy Council, a federation of heating oil associations in the New York area. ''But on a long-term basis, the price of oil and gas is the same.''
''Every form of energy has its cycle of crises,'' said Bernard A. Smith, executive vice president of the New England Fuel Institute, which represents oil dealers in that region. ''When you try to come up with a long-term solution to a short-term problem, the consumer usually comes up on the short end of the stick.''
Thus oil people are concentrating their advertising and promotional barrages these days not on the current price, but rather on what they consider to be the superior qualities of their fuel. These, they say, include a higher heating efficiency over gas, the relative ease of improving an oil heating system, and the absence of pipelines that could be damaged and disrupt supplies.
The argument that a long-term view is better than a short-term view is buttressed by the Consumer Energy Council of America Research Foundation, a public interest group. It studied the cost of both fuels in gallon equivalents over the last decade and concluded that there is little to be gained by switching from oil to gas on economic grounds.
''The surest way of saving money is not to gamble over the future differential of fuel prices but to cut consumption,'' said Ellen Berman, executive director of the council. ''Conservation is still one of the best consumer purchases around.''
 
WHEN IT WOULD PAY TO SWITCH TO GAS
For consumers who are considering converting their heating equipment to gas from oil, Charles Guinn, the deputy commissioner of the New York State Energy Office, has this advice.
If your existing furnace is fairly new and operating efficiently, conversion would not be as cost-effective as it might be with old and inefficient furnaces.
Check costs, short-term and long-term. The price of a new gas furnace can range from about $1,500 to $5,000, with the national average at $2,000, according to the American Gas Association. If natural gas is cheaper than oil, as it is today, and that differential continues, figure out how many years of such price savings it would take to cover the price of the furnace.
An example given by the gas association shows $2,300 as the price of a new furnace and installation, a saving in the Northeast of $385 a year from using gas instead of oil, and a payback period of almost six years. Experts say, however, that the history of prices in the past decade suggest that the current price differential is unlikely to continue at exactly the same level for six years.
Before making any calculations, find out whether natural gas is available to you. There are areas, like the north and south forks of Long Island, where supplies are extremely limited.

Watching Interest Rates

 BODY:

International events are now influencing the interest rates that banks pay more than the economy is influencing them. Yields on certificates of deposit have been falling for more than three months, but the Middle East situation could mean higher yields in the near future. Bank rate analysts suggest watching rates on certificates of deposit closely for the next three weeks and holding some money in a federally insured bank money market account to be ready to shift to C.D.'s if interest rates rise. Investors might also want to split money between short-term certificates of deposit and money market accounts. Here are some current national average yields on certificates of deposit and the comparable yields in early May.

HEADLINE: After a Stray Shot: A Girl's Family Seeks Meaning in a Random Loss

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
Daisy L. Rasberry lives as if suspended in time. She has not been to work for two months. Nor has she slept a full night since the evening of June 23, when a Saturday shopping trip with two of her daughters ended with her 10-year-old ''baby,'' Shaniqua, bleeding in her arms from a fatal gunshot wound to the chest.
The bullet was not meant for Shaniqua. She was killed when an argument between two men and three clerks at a jewelry store in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn spilled onto the sidewalk where she stood browsing for summer shoes with her mother, her 13-year-old sister, two of her mother's friends and their three children. Another child, an 8-year-old girl, was also shot but survived.
''I do accept it,'' Mrs. Rasberry, 30, said, ''but I can't believe it.'' 
Since the death of Shaniqua Brown, a third-grader from Far Rockaway, Queens, who was known for her warmth, good grades and funny faces, stray bullets have killed at least five more New York City children under the age of 16 and wounded at least another five. The shootings have led to plans to hire more than 1,000 police officers by next spring and calls for tougher gun-control laws.
But while such random violence appears to have become commonplace, its lingering impact on the victims' families, friends and communities is not.
Within Shaniqua's family - her mother, her stepfather, Larry Rasberry, two sisters, Carmalei, 13, and Shayisha, 12, and grandparents - there is anger at the police for not being there when the quarrel outside the jewelry store on Flatbush Avenue erupted into shots, and at the store employees for somehow letting the argument turn deadly.
Mrs. Rasberry said she was considering a lawsuit against both the Police Department and the jewelry store.
It is not rage, though, but numbness, that seems to envelop Shaniqua's family. During interviews, they hardly mention the fact that two men have been arrested in the case.
''It's a lot to deal with,'' Mr. Rasberry, 27, a truck driver and former air cargo specialist with the Air Force, said last week.
Mrs. Rasberry says she finds solace in talking to her minister, Charles Jones, at the Bethel Temple Church of God in Christ in Far Rockaway and in a Bible study group. But she still gropes for a meaning to her daughter's death. ''It's like paying for somebody else's sins.''
Shaniqua's sister Shayisha remembers her as ''the only one in the house that made us laugh.'' ''She'd make funny faces.'' Mr. Rasberry said his stepdaughter was also the only one who could make him ''move'' - go out for pizza, for example - after a hard day of work.
''I was always too tired but she had a way of getting me to do things,'' he said.
 
'Jarring Reality' for Students
At Public School 197 in Far Rockaway, where Shaniqua would have started fourth grade this September, a psychologist, a social worker and an educational evaluator were on hand the Monday after the shooting to help her classmates and other students deal with the news, the principal, George Giberti, said.
Most students, he said, had heard about the shooting by the time they arrived for classes and many were visibly upset.
''There was a jarring reality,'' he said. ''Children sometimes feel that they are immortal. They were now faced with a loss and there was an outpouring of emotion.''
Emotions ran strong too, in the neighborhood where the shooting took place, a bustling strip of stores and markets that is always crowded on Saturday afternoon.
 
Neighbors Cooperated With Police
The police said they were able to arrest the first of two men charged in Shaniqua's killing within 48 hours because the level of cooperation among residents and shopkeepers was unusually high. They provided leads and identified the first suspect, Jamal K. Coley, in a police lineup.
''Normally in a case like this nobody saw nothing,'' said Ed Boyar, the assistant district attorney prosecuting the case.
In a statement to the police, Mr. Coley, 22, who lives in Flatbush, said he had gone to the Taj Mahal Jewelry store to return a gold chain he had bought for several hundred dollars but which another jeweler told him was worth half what he had paid. Mr. Coley told the police that when he confronted the Taj Mahal's clerks, they denied having sold him the chain. He left the store, kicking the door on his way out, and returned a short while later with a neighbor, Brian Reid, 22.
Just as Mr. Coley and Mr. Reid went back to the Taj Mahal, Mrs. Rasberry and her friends, their children in tow, decided to shop for shoes. Feeling June's growing heat, they had gone to Flatbush Avenue to shop for cool clothes and sandals. Mrs. Rasberry often shopped in Brooklyn, somewhat of a trek from her Queens home, because ''it's so cheap out there for the kids.''
 
'It Was So Quick'
She recalled that the stores that evening ''were packed with kids.'' About 7:15 P.M. she, her daughters and her friends stopped by the window of Your Foot, next door to the Taj Mahal. Shaniqua fell for a pair of sandals in black, red and yellow.
The next thing she remembers is hearing someone yell ''Run!''
''It was so quick,'' she said. ''I didn't hear an argument.''
''All we did was bend down for one second and someone said, 'Run!' I went to grab my baby girl and the bullet hit her at the same time. I remember when she said 'Ow.' I said, 'Run, Shaniqua!' ''
Mrs. Rasberry said that she and her daughter ran inside the shoe store for safety, but that Shaniqua, grabbing her stomach, said, ''Mommy, I've already been shot.''
 
Fired a Single Bullet
Shaniqua died later that night at Kings County Hospital Center.
Mr. Coley has told the police that he fired a single shot into the air after he and Mr. Reid argued with a shoe store clerk they believed ''was with'' the jewelry store workers. The police say that is the shot that killed Shaniqua.
Mr. Coley, arrested two days later at his girlfriend's apartment, has been indicted on charges of second-degree murder, attempted murder, assault and criminal possession of a weapon. He has pleaded not guilty and is being held without bail.
Mr. Reid, who turned himself in to the police Aug. 6 and is also being held without bail, has been indicted and is scheduled for arraignment on the same charges tomorrow in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn.
Both men are unemployed and single, and both lived with their families in Flatbush.
 
Suspect Has a Son, 4
Mr. Coley, who dropped out of school after the 10th grade, is the father of a 4-year-old boy.
''He's very concerned about the charges against him, but he and I agree that whatever happened was certainly very tragic,'' Mr. Coley's lawyer, Michael F. Baum, said.
Because killings like that of Shaniqua are so random and unexpected, psychiatrists say, they provoke more shock and fear than other types of violence, and are more difficult to accept.
And because the frequency of such killings has reached new levels, -they are extremely disorienting, said Lawrence W. Sherman, a professor of criminology at the University of Maryland who has researched bystander shootings and reactions to them.
 
'Completely Terrorizing Event'
''It's not something your parents have told you about,'' he said. ''It's not something your friends have experienced. To have a stray bullet come out of nowhere for reasons that have nothing to do with the kind of life you've led, it's a completely terrorizing event.''
Since Shaniqua's shooting, Toufik Kassab, owner of both the Taj Mahal and Your Foot, has hired security guards at both stores. The owner, who was not present during the shooting, said that his employees had called the police at least twice about the argument but that there was no response.
Come September, Mrs. Rasberry said, she may be ready to return to her job as a part-time office clerk in the highway permits division of the city's Department of Transportation, ''just to keep my mind occupied.''
Also in September, when classes resume at P.S. 197, the school plans a food drive, Mr. Giberti said. Donations will be sent to Bethel Temple Church of God in Christ in Shaniqua's name.

HEADLINE: Lead Paint Poisons Children Despite 1971 Law on Removal

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 25

 BODY:
Nearly 20 years after Congress declared lead-based paint a health hazard and ordered it stripped from the nation's stock of federally subsidized housing, it remains on the walls and woodwork of dwellings across the nation, posing a lasting toxic threat that medical experts say afflicts as many as one in every six children.
By almost any measure, the campaign to eliminate lead-based paint from the apartments and houses where the nation's poorest inner-city families live has produced a legacy of frustration and failure, according to housing specialists, public health experts and Congressional critics.
''The Government's record in dealing with this problem is one of absolute dereliction,'' said Dr. Herbert L. Needleman of the University of Pittsburgh, a researcher who has linked lead poisoning to learning disabilities, higher school dropout rates and lower I.Q.'s among children. ''Unlike almost any other public health threat, the problem of lead paint is eradicable, not just controllable.''
Despite Congressional imperatives, court decisions and a growing consensus among medical experts that more than three million children under the age of 6 have elevated levels of lead in the blood, the national effort to eliminate lead paint from public housing, much less private housing, has been mired in a kind of bureaucratic inertia. 
 
Issue of Financial Resources
By way of a defense, Federal and local housing officials argue that Government does not have the financial resources to remove lead paint from public housing units. The cost is estimated at $3,000 to $8,000 for each dwelling. Yet their critics say that if the Government does not pay now, it will pay later.
In remarks in Congress last May, Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat who heads the subcommittee that oversees appropriations for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, said Federal officials were not taking into account the cost of future medical treatment.
''I'd rather see H.U.D. paying to clean up houses than Medicaid paying to clean up kids,'' Senator Mikulski said this week.
Public health experts and Congressional critics say the failure to deal with the problem partly reflects the absence of public pressure to eradicate a hazard whose principal victims have little political leverage - young, poor, black residents of inner cities.
Although Congress banned residential use of lead paint more than decade ago, studies estimate that nearly 900,000 units of public housing, and some 40 million units of private housing, still have lead-based paint. H.U.D. is now conducting a study on how to deal with the problem in private housing.
 
Odd Impact at White House
Not all the lead paint is in poor neighborhoods. Earlier this month, it was disclosed that Millie, President Bush's dog, became ill with what was described as ''acute lead exposure'' as a result of renovation work being done at the White House.
Critics argue that it is a measure of the Government's hesitant approach to the problem that a 650-page set of new, comprehensive Federal standards for testing and eliminating lead-based paint in public housing units has yet to be distributed to the nation's 3,200 public housing authorities, even though they took effect on April 1.
John C. Weicher, Assistant Secretary for policy development and research at H.U.D., attributed the delay to disputes over certain key sections. Despite the delay, Mr. Weicher said Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp was determined to address the problem of lead-based paint.
 
Growing Scope of Problem
''I'm not going to try to defend 20 years of policy on this issue, by a variety of administrations,'' said Mr. Weicher. But he said that only in recent years had officials come to understand the growing scope of the problem. In response to new medical evidence, the United States Public Health Service has twice since 1971 lowered the limit of acceptable lead exposure and is now considering a further reduction, he said.
Although the lead poisoning has been associated with lead in drinking water and other products, experts argue that the disease most often strikes children who inhale dust tainted by lead-based paint, or ingest paint chips.
In poorer neighborhoods, in both public housing units and private apartments, paint is often peeling. Dr. Needleman said 55 percent of poor, black urban children under the age of 6 have elevated levels of lead in the blood.
So far, state and local programs aimed at private housing, particularly in inner-city buildings, have had little effect, partly because of resistance from landlords.
The State of Massachusetts and the City of Baltimore have adopted strong programs, including mandatory screening for lead exposure in preschool children. Yet for the most part local officials become involved only after a child is already ill and tests show lead poisoning. Critics say that is the public policy equivalent of using children as coal companies once used canaries in mines to detect poison gas.
 
Special Nature of Problem
Don Ryan, a former Congressional aide who is now an organizer of a public interest alliance that will focus on the danger of lead paint in housing, argues that lead exposure poses a public health hazard unlike any other environmental threat.
''When we talk about pesticides or asbestos, we use risk assessment models that discuss some statistical chance - one in a million, say - that someone may be harmed in the future,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''With lead, we know that about one out of every six children is already suffering, that they have too much lead in their bodies. In some places we even have their names and addresses.''
As in some cases of asbestos, some housing officials argue that it may be better to cover lead paint surfaces, rather than try to remove them. Jeff Miller, a spokesman for the Lead Industries Association in New York, said several lead manufacturers had been working with the Environmental Protection Agency on ways to cover lead paint safely, to reduce its hazard.
Public health experts like Dr. Needleman oppose covering, rather than removing, lead paint, saying it only postpones the problem.
Experts agree that many techniques used so far to remove lead paint have often made the problem worse. Sanding lead paint produces dust tainted with lead that residents and workers inhale. Devices that use flame to burn off lead paint produce toxic fumes.
Under the new H.U.D. standards, the agency recommends methods for safely removing the paint, including the temporary relocation of tenants and the use of protective equipment and clothing for workers.
Congress passed the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act in 1971. But 10 years later, the General Accounting Office assailed the housing department, accusing it of ''confusion and noncompliance'' in programs aimed at eliminating lead poisoning in children.
For all its useful properties, lead has been known since biblical times to be toxic. Amid concerns about the public health effects of lead, Congress strongly restricted the use of lead as an additive in gasoline, and banned most use of lead-based paint in 1978.
 
Many Cases Undetected
Dr. Needleman has pointed out that the great majority of cases have never been diagnosed because the effects of lead poisoning, though severe, are not unique or obvious. In a long-term study, published this year in The New England Journal of Medicine, he concluded that teen-agers who had been exposed to relatively high levels of lead as first and second graders were seven times as likely to be school dropouts as classmates who had little or no lead exposure, and six times as likely to suffer reading disabilities.
Despite H.U.D.'s adoption of the new guidelines, public housing advocates argue that the Government has failed to train personnel and will not pay for the complex testing procedures to determine whether an apartment is contaminated with lead paint.
Perhaps more significant, they say that some of the department's field offices are intentionally ignoring the guidelines.
Robert E. McKay, executive director of the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities, wrote to Federal housing officials in July, complaining that field staff members were threatening some local public housing agencies with loss of Federal funds for modernizing housing, because the agencies wanted to delay some current construction work so as to comply with the new lead-paint standards.
 
'Transitional Problem'
Mr. Weicher of H.U.D. said the department was having what he called ''a transitional problem'' in bringing the agency's bureaucracy in line.
Some attitudes within H.U.D. on lead paint were reflected in comments made at a housing seminar in St. Louis earlier this year by Carolyn Newton, who has since left the housing agency. She told a meeting of public housing administrators that there were those in H.U.D. regional offices who believe the lead-paint issue ''has been blown way out of proportion, that there are other more pressing issues.''
Officials who administer public housing developments do not disagree that lead-based paint constitutes a major health hazard. But they also say the Federal Government is asking them to undertake costly and disruptive abatement programs with little more money.
''You may ask, Are we not fully occupied already, having been singled out to solve the nation's drug problem, and its housing problem of mentally handicapped and homeless?'' said Alonzo Watson, the director of the South Bend, Ind., Public Housing Authority, at a recent seminar.
Local housing officials also worry about the soaring cost of insurance for contractors removing lead paint, and the growing specter of lawsuits from tenants and workers whose own blood may show elevated levels of lead, as a result of exposure.
In New York, Boston and New Orleans, tenants have filed lawsuits against city or public housing authorities, alleging health damage. In turn, the Government agencies have sued the lead paint industry.
William P. Quigley, a New Orleans lawyer working on behalf of the tenants there, says that because most of the victims are young, poor and black, the questions involved transcend matter of public health. ''This is a human rights issue,'' he said.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Iraqi Diplomat Vows to Release Kin of Envoys

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25

 BODY:
Iraq promised today to release dependents of American diplomats from Kuwait who are being held in Baghdad, but not the diplomats themselves.
The Iraqis meanwhile acted on their threat to cut off supplies, electricity and water to the American Embassy and several others in Kuwait. Soldiers, some of them armed with machine guns and mortars, continued to encircle many embassies in Kuwait City but made no effort to remove the remaining diplomats by force.
United States officials said the American Embassy was using an electric generator and that supplies were adequate for the Ambassador, W. Nathaniel Howell, and his skeleton staff of about 10 diplomats.
Iraq's Ambassador to Washington, summoned to the State Department for an hourlong discussion of the situation, said the diplomats in Kuwait could not be released ''because they don't have diplomatic status; they are considered ordinary citizens, just like anyone else.'' 
 
Says Embassy Won't Be Attacked
The Ambassador, Mohammed Sadiq al-Mashat, said after the meeting here that Baghdad's troops are ''not going to use force'' against the United States Embassy or its envoys.
''You people should be concerned with the major problem: We are on the brink of catastrophe, unnecessary,'' he said. ''Without any reason American lives are being risked. For no reason whatsoever.''
As many as 60 spouses and children of American diplomats might be allowed to leave the Iraqi capital, where they have been held since they left the embassy in Kuwait on Friday.
It was a day of inconclusive and sometimes confusing diplomatic wrangling, as the United States also moved to enforce the naval blockade approved early today by the United Nations Security Council to enforce trade sanctions against Iraq.
Bush Administration officials said the United States was studying the possibility of offering political asylum to the crews of Iraqi vessels as an enticement for them to cooperate with the blockade.
Other tactics were also being considered, from blocking Iraqi ports to boarding or even attacking merchant vessels attempting to break the embargo. Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser to President Bush, said the United Nations resolution meant that the United States has full authority to enforce the blockade, and he said that the American military intends to use it.
 
Minimum Use of Force
But Mr. Scowcroft also said in an interview with the Cable News Network that allied forces hoped to use ''the minimum amount of interference necessary'' to make the sanctions effective.
Appearing on Iraqi television, President Saddam Hussein dismissed the Security Council as a puppet of the United States. He used a joint appearance with Kurt Waldheim, the Austrian President, to talk vaguely of a solution yet use some of his most bellicose language yet.
''We want peace,'' he told reporters accompanying Mr. Waldheim. ''So, it is the duty of the Americans now to bear in mind that they should resolve to a political solution and not to force.''
But if the United States attacks, ''there will be columns of dead bodies which may have a beginning but will have no end,'' he said through a translator.
After a personal appeal from Mr. Waldheim, President Hussein allowed the Austrian President to board a chartered plane with 95 Austrians who had been trapped in Iraq. The mission drew some criticism abroad, for Mr. Waldheim is the only Western leader to have met with Mr. Hussein since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
Offering to meet with other world leaders, President Hussein suggested that Mr. Waldheim could be a mediator in any settlement talks.
Mr. Scowcroft cautioned against making too much of President Hussein's gesture, calling it ''an attempt to get around the universal condemnation.''
 
Kuwait Embassy Situation
As the Middle East crisis continued, it remained unclear whether Iraq intended to seize the embassies of the United States and other countries in Kuwait. A confusing picture emerged as Iraqi troops continued to surround many embassies, preventing people from entering or leaving.
United States officials said that electricity was cut today at the American Embassy, and restored briefly at the British Embassy, only to be cut again. Japanese diplomats said that electricity, water and telephone service had been disconnected at their Embassy.
Confusion also engulfed the other foreign hostages held in the Iraqi capital. About 20 of the 213 Japanese citizens held at a hotel in Baghdad were loaded into a bus with other foreign nationals and taken by Iraqi authorities to an undisclosed location. Diplomats tried to pursue the bus but lost sight of it, the Japanese Foreign Ministry said, and Iraqi officials offered no information on the captives' destination.
Mr. Mashat was summoned to the State Department this afternoon for what an American official called a discussion ''of our views on the American Embassy in Kuwait and American and other foreign nationals in Kuwait.''
 
'No Use of Force'
In Baghdad, an Iraqi spokesman told Reuters, the British news agency, by telephone: ''For the time being there is no use of force and I do not think there will be any use of force.'' Diplomats remaining in Kuwait ''will enjoy no privileges, services, or facilities,'' he said.
About a dozen Iraqi commercial ships, primarily loaded oil tankers, remained under close surveillance by Navy ships and helicopters in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea.
 
Iraqi Vessel in Aden
Although one Iraqi tanker has apparently unloaded its cargo in Aden, a port city in Yemen where Iraq has regularly sent its crude oil for processing, and a second tanker is in port, the Yemenis have said they will abide by the international sanctions and refuse to unload any more oil.
Pentagon officials said that American warships are prepared to disable the Iraqi ships by firing at their rudders, if the vessels attempted to run the blockade.
But Administration officials said they were also reviewing whether to offer asylum to the Iraqi crews and spare the United States a possibly bloody confrontation that could trigger all-out war.
''It's what we'd prefer,'' said one Pentagon official, who said the White House was discussing various options.
 
Crews of Iraqi Tankers
According to American intelligence officials, the Iraqi tanker crews are under strict orders from Baghdad to ignore warnings to halt, even if fired upon. Tanker crews face the death penalty in Iraq if they allow American sailors to board their vessels.
Although Iraq is believed to have warplanes based in Yemen, Pentagon officials said today that Navy ships intercepting Iraqi tankers would be protected by American F-14 fighter jets on aircraft carriers nearby and by F-15's based at Saudi airfields.
Even if the Iraqis accepted asylum, Administration officials said there would be several problems to resolve, including what the United States would do with the Iraqi ships and their cargo.
As the blockade continued to strangle Iraqi's oil-dependent economy, several American military officials bluntly warned Mr. Hussein that if attacked, the United States would respond with force on a large scale.
The American buildup continued today, as the United States said it was sending an unspecified number of F-111 bombers based in Britain to Saudi Arabia to bolster what is called Operation Desert Shield.
The situation at more than 60 foreign embassies in Kuwait, all of which Iraq ordered closed on Friday, varied today from nation to nation.
 
Power Is Cut Off
Iraqi soldiers cut off electrical power to the United States Embassy in Kuwait City today at 11:15 A.M. Kuwait time, or 4:15 A.M. Eastern time, but power was restored using the emergency generator.
Ambassador Howell and the other 10 American diplomats remained in routine contact with Washington, officials here said.
Elsewhere in Kuwait City, Iraqi troops were reported this morning to have breached the wall of the French Embassy, apparently to cut off water lines.
News reports quoted Italy's Foreign Ministry as stating that Iraqi troops surrounding the French Embassy were ''beating down the embassy wall to get to the water unit to cut the water off.''
 
Report by Italian Envoy
The report, which could not be quickly confirmed, came from Italy's Ambassador to Kuwait, Marco Colombo, who said he had talked to French diplomats in Kuwait City early today.
British officials said Iraq had pulled its tanks away from its embassy but that soldiers still surrounded it. Electricity was restored to the mission today after being cut off on Friday, they said.
Iraqi soldiers surrounded Canada's Embassy on Friday but withdrew overnight, leaving power and water in place, Canada's External Affairs Department said.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Hostage Families Tell Their Stories

 BODY:
A decade ago, Arleen Uerling was working in a restaurant in Yakima, Wash., when Mohammed Tayeh walked in, ''and it was love at first sight,'' her mother said. Two years later they were married and headed for Kuwait, where, until the Iraqi invasion Aug. 2, Mr. Tayeh had a catering service and Arleen Tayeh was a homemaker.
Now she is one of 3,000 Americans trapped in Iraq and Kuwait, all of them hostages, many of them moved to important military targets as shields against attack. 
The United States Government and the families of these Americans know almost nothing about their condition now, or even where they are. But some families are willing to tell the stories of their missing relatives. A page of profiles of Mrs. Tayeh and other hostages, by Lisa Belkin with Dennis Hevesi, is on page 14.
BUSH'S BIG TEST: The President, who has successfully stitched together a broad international alliance against Iraq, still faces fragile public support and the possibility of far-reaching damage to the nation's economy as a result of the Middle East crisis. News analysis, page 16.
IRAQ'S SUPERGUN: Before he was slain, Gerald Bull, the world's greatest artillery designer, sold his lethal talent to the highest bidder: Saddam Hussein. Beginning in 1985, Iraq bought hundreds of artillery pieces developed by Mr. Bull that now threaten the multinational force in Saudi Arabia. But Mr. Bull's obsession was building a Supergun able to launch shells thousands of miles. Although a number of Supergun parts were seized in Europe on the way to Iraq, the Hussein Government is believed to have many other components - and the blueprints. Magazine, section 6.
HUSSEIN'S VIEW OF HISTORY: Giant posters in his country liken the President of Iraq to Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian king who destroyed Jerusalem, and Saladin, the Muslim warrior who fought back Christian crusaders. The glory his region had as a world power through the centuries is still alive as a force driving Saddam Hussein's yearning for greatness. The Week in Review, section 4.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
U.N. CALLS ON NAVIES TO BLOCK IRAQ'S TRADE; RESOLUTION PERMITS USE OF FORCE, U.S. SAYS

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 25

 BODY:
The Security Council overwhelmingly adopted a resolution early today giving the United States and other nations the right to enforce the economic embargo against Iraq by halting shipping to and from that country.
The vote was 13 to 0, with Yemen and Cuba abstaining.
The resolution endorses ''measures commensurate to the specific circumstances as may be necessary'' to halt shipping; it does not explicitly authorize the use of ''minimum force,'' as the United States had urged. But Thomas R. Pickering, the American representative to the United Nations, said the resolution was ''sufficiently broad to use armed force - indeed, minimum force - depending upon the circumstances.''
 
On Watch in Gulf and Red Sea
The Pentagon has reported that about a dozen Iraqi ships are under surveillance by American or allied warships in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea. 
Brent Scowcroft, the White House national security adviser, said the resolution - the result of several days of negotiations - allows the United States to act as it sees fit to enforce the embargo ordered by the United Nations against Iraq on Aug. 6, four days after the invasion of Kuwait.
''That means no commerce should go in and out by sea, and that means that vessels will be stopped and inspected,'' Mr. Scowcroft said. Other American officials have said the United States and its allies could use force to disable ships, wrecking rudders of vessels that seem determined to break the embargo. This runs the risk of Iraqi air retaliation against American ships.
 
Another Warning From Iraq
The Iraqi delegate to the United Nations, Abdul Amir al-Anbari, warned after the Council's vote, ''This use of force by the United States or any of its allies or puppets will lead inevitably to a number of explosions which will burn all in their path.''
Officials have suggested that Iraqi air attacks on American ships could set off a huge military response by the United States.
The Security Council resolution, the result of compromises with the Soviet Union, was not as clear-cut as Washington had originally intended. Instead of specifically permitting the use of force, the text is more ambiguous.
The Council calls upon nations with naval forces in the area ''to use such measures commensurate to the specific circumstances as may be necessary under the authority of the Security Council to halt all inward and outward maritime shipping in order to inspect and verify their cargoes and destinations and to insure strict implementation of the provisions related to such shipping.''
The United Nations vote was nonetheless widely regarded as a success for the United States because its language seemed to permit the use of force.
The vote also dramatized a shift in the international climate. At an earlier time it would have been unthinkable to envision the Soviet Union and China both voting to enforce an embargo against Iraq, a country that has had friendly military and political relations with both.
Despite qualms earlier in the week about authorizing force, the Soviet delegate joined in the vote after President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ended his silence and warned President Saddam Hussein of Iraq that the Security Council would take additional action if his forces did not withdraw from Kuwait.
To make Soviet agreement possible, the United States eliminated the phrase ''minimum force'' and met a Soviet request that any military actions be coordinated ''as appropriate'' through a moribund United Nations body, the Military Staff Committee.
President Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said today that the vote ''further strengthens the world resolve to force Iraq out of Kuwait.''
In Kennebunkport, Me., where Mr. Bush is vacationing, Mr. Fitzwater said in a written statement, ''We are encouraged by the progress of events at the United Nations and by President Gorbachev's strong support.''
He called Mr. Gorbachev's actions ''a very important development,'' adding, ''We welcome his voice to the world condemnation of the aggression by Saddam Hussein.''
 
Bush Largely Out of Sight
Mr. Bush stayed largely out of sight today, going boating in the early morning and meeting with Mr. Scowcroft at Walker's Point, the President's family residence.
Mr. Fitzwater did not immediately comment on a remark to reporters Friday by the Soviet delegate, Valentin V. Lozinsky, indicating that the Soviet Union was considering taking part in the multinational naval presence.
The Security Council approved the resolution at 4:10 A.M. after consultations that began late Friday. It was the third time the Council has endorsed the use of force to support United Nations decisions since the organization was founded in 1945.
In 1950, the Council voted to repel North Korea's attack on South Korea, although the Soviet Union did not take part in the resolution. Force was also authorized in 1965 against breakaway Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, after its declaration of independence from Britain.
Mr. Pickering said in a Council speech after the vote, ''At no time since 1945 has this Council been asked to take on the kind of responsibility we are assuming today.''
 
China's Approval Unexpected
The size of the majority exceeded even some predictions by diplomats who had championed the measure. Only shortly before the balloting - by a show of hands in the hushed Council chamber - did it become widely apparent that China would also vote yes instead of abstaining, as it had earlier said it would.
With that, the measure received the unanimous backing of the Council's five permanent members - the United States, Britain, China, France and the Soviet Union, each of which has veto power. The other 10 members now holding seats on the Council are Cuba, Yemen, Canada, Finland, Colombia, Ethiopia, Malaysia, the Ivory Coast, Zaire and Romania.
The United Nations resolution was the fifth directed at Iraq since it occupied Kuwait.
On Aug. 3, the Security Council voted 14 to 0, with one abstention, to condemn the invasion, demanding the immediate, unconditional withdrawal of all of Baghdad's forces from Kuwait. On Aug. 6, the Council voted 13 to 0, with 2 abstentions, to order the trade and financial boycott of Iraq and occupied Kuwait. On Aug. 9, the Council voted 15 to 0 to declare Iraq's formal annexation of Kuwait null and void under international law. And on Aug. 18, the Council unanimously demanded that Iraq free all detained foreigners and implicitly warned of military action if they were not released.
The United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, said the vote signaled that ''the time has come'' for him to open urgent talks with Iraqi officials on easing the Gulf crisis. He invited the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, to join him for discussions in New York or Geneva, but there was no immediate response.
 
Backing of Nonaligned Sought
The final hours before the vote today were marked by efforts by Mr. Pickering and his British counterpart, Sir Crispin Tickell, to get backing from nonaligned nations on the Council. Resentment of the permanent members' veto power is widespread among nonaligned delegates here.
Representatives of the permanent members had spent days trying to agree on a draft resolution. The Soviet Union argued that a clear violation of the boycott should occur before the resolution was passed, while the United States pressed for a swifter vote.
 
Soviets 'Came on Board'
The Soviets ''came on board,'' as some diplomats put it, after telephone conversations between Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
The Cuban delegate, Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, complained in a speech just before the vote of the ''strange and tortuous wording'' of the resolution, which he said violated parts of the United Nations Charter.
But Mr. Pickering, seemingly untired by his marathon diplomatic labors, told his fellow delegates in a speech, ''History will judge us by our resolve in the face of Iraq's threats to international peace and security.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Diplomats' Position in Kuwait: Gray Area in International Law

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25

 BODY:
The Persian Gulf crisis poses questions of international law that appear clear cut in the case of United Nations actions, but murky when it comes to the protection of foreign diplomats in Kuwait.
The United Nations Security Council's approval of military force to promote the economic embargo of Iraq is clearly defined as legal by international conventions. But international law is less clear in defining the options that nations have to defend their embassies and diplomats threatened in Kuwait City, especially since Kuwait is occupied by a foreign power. While governments are required to respect the sovereignty of embassies and the immunity of diplomats, those rights are not clearly established in situations in which those missions come under the authority of occupation forces. 
The Security Council's unanimous resolution today gives the allied forces the right to blockade Iraqi ports and stop, board and even attack merchant vessels attempting to break the embargo. Iraq has claimed that the United Nations action violated international law, but according to American legal scholars the resolution is well within established legal convention.
''There's no question,'' said John Norton Moore, a law professor at the University of Virginia, ''that in the face of aggressive attack, the Security Council can authorize nations to take the measures necessary for an effective embargo.''
Mr. Moore said that within the limits of ''collective defense'' of Kuwait, whose invasion by Iraq the Security Council deemed illegal, force can be used against shipping as long as it is ''necessary and proportional.'' He added, ''There is an obligation to use the minimum force necessary to achieve the lawful objective.''
Minimum force, legal scholars say, would include knocking out a rudder or landing a military force to take over the vessel.
But scholars say President Saddam Hussein's threatened violation of diplomatic immunity moves the crisis into some areas of international law that have become increasingly murky.
Traditionally, a nation's embassy has been considered part of that nation's territory, frequently protected by armed guards belonging to that nation's armed forces. Diplomatic personnel assigned to embassies, and whose credentials are accepted by host countries, are given special legal privileges by which they are immune from most or all prosecution in the countries where they serve.
The rules by which embassies and diplomats function were codified by the 1961 Vienna Convention, which states: ''The agents of the receiving state may not enter except with the consent of the head of the mission.''
The convention goes on to say: ''The receiving state is under special duty to take all appropriate steps to protect the premises of the mission against any intrusion or damage and to prevent any disturbance of the peace of the mission or impairment of its dignity.''
 
Diplomats Told to Leave
Iraq, which signed the convention, would seem to be violating international law when it cuts off electricity and water to a number of embassies in Kuwait. Mr. Hussein has threatened to withdraw diplomatic immunity from embassy personnel that do not comply with his order to leave Kuwait for Baghdad and has implied that the diplomats will become hostages until the United States withdraws its forces from the area and the international community lifts the embargo.
But Iraq claims that the foreign embassies in Kuwait have no rights because Kuwait no longer exists. It was Kuwaiti, not Iraqi, authorities who accepted the credentials of diplomats in Kuwait City, and who granted the embassies their privileges.
 
A Sovereignty Issue
''The problem arises here because this is arising in Kuwait,'' said Abram J. Chayes, a law professor at Harvard University and legal adviser to the State Department during the Kennedy Administration. ''The legality of the whole thing comes down to who is the legal ruler of Kuwait. It's an issue of who has sovereignty.''
Legal scholars say there are no clear modern precedents to define the rights of foreign embassies in countries that have been annexed outright, without the creation of a puppet government.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
The Golf Cart Crisis

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., Aug. 25

 BODY:
Even on a day when he savored a hard-won diplomatic triumph at the United Nations, President Bush and his handling of the Persian Gulf crisis encountered irritating criticisms from unexpected quarters.
 
At the same time that
Mr. Bush is basking in beams of approval from Europe and receiving support from the Soviet Union, television comedians and journalistic commentators at home are suggesting that he set an example for the nation by giving his gas-guzzling speedboat a rest.
And he is getting conflicting reviews from American conservatives, with some doubting the worth of the mission and others, including two former Secretaries of State, Henry A. Kissinger and Alexander M. Haig, warning about the dangers of wearing out popular support by waiting too long to act in his effort to control the expansionist ambitions of Saddam Hussein.
This situation reflects the problem that while Mr. Bush has adeptly marshaled foreign support and stitched together a broad alliance, he has had little appetite or time for grappling with the implications of the crisis for the national economy, the impact on the Federal budget deficit of tens of millions of dollars a day in additional military spending and, finally, developing an election-year rationale for the overarching goals of his policy. 
Within the White House and among outside experts, there is a sense of a President launched on a stormy period that will be crucial to the verdicts on an Administration that had begun well but had not yet faced a test of such magnitude.
''I think we're seeing Bush feeling his way into a whole new world,'' said Stephen Ambrose, biographer of Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard M. Nixon. ''This is the first post-cold war crisis, the first in which none of the givens of his lifetime are there anymore. It's uncharted water for the White House and I don't think they're navigating it entirely successfully yet.''
As the focus of such attention, Mr. Bush has so far avoided the appearance of personal anguish that characterized the presidency of Jimmy Carter. He has tried to project the image of a leader unintimidated by perilous military action and willing to bear the responsibility of military command without being paralyzed by threats to the lives of American hostages.
Mr. Bush has clearly distinguished himself from his predecessors - more decisive than Mr. Carter, more in charge than Ronald Reagan - and yet is haunted and occasionally hobbled by the ghosts of their presidencies.
By holding to his summer vacation plans, Mr. Bush has rejected Mr. Carter's decision to stay in the White House during the Iran hostage crisis. But Mr. Bush's approach has sprung an entirely new trap: while Mr. Bush is hard at work here, the television imagery is of a President blithely speed-boating and golfing through what has become a dangerous summer for tens of thousands of American soldiers and thousands of American civilians.
''He may end up being the first President who's held hostage on a Cigarette boat,'' said Jody Powell, who was Mr. Carter's press secretary. ''He's sort of got himself in a position where he has to go fishing even if he doesn't want to. They made a decision about appearances that's got away from them and is now controlling him.''
 
An Intimate Portrait
Although Mr. Bush fiercely resists close inspection, the last three weeks have provided a intimate portrait of his leadership. They have revealed him at his most temperamental, grousing at reporters who dog his golf cart. They have shown him at his diplomatic best, telephoning around the world to hold together the anti-Iraq alliance.
They have also demonstrated the perils of the personal way Mr. Bush conducts his diplomacy. He has relied on a knowledge of the Middle East that comes from a long association with its oil-rich, conservative royal families and leaves Mr. Bush with a blind spot in assessing the currents of the Arab street and the intentions of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
In general, the Persian Gulf conflict puts the final focus on a picture that began taking shape in 1989 as the new President began shedding images accrued over the years in which he had been Mr. Reagan's silent and loyal No. 2: ''wimpy,'' ''excessively cautious,'' ''inarticulate,'' ''lacking in vision.'' ''He's had to wipe off eight years of cobwebs,'' said a senior Administration official.
The leader evident in today's crisis began emerging, this official suggested, in a May 1989 meeeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization at which he made a proposal to cut conventional armed forces. ''The idea was to tell the allies clearly that he was going to lead NATO, that he had the personal will and ambition to match the U.S. role as a superpower,'' the official said.
After the Malta summit meeting and the Washington meeting with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev this year, many of Mr. Bush's critics were acknowledging that he had moved effectively on the world stage. But there has been a lingering complaint that while he excelled at shifting gears quickly, Mr. Bush was disinclined to provide a broad vision for his actions.
 
Untested in Adversity
He was also untested in adversity, but in the Panama invasion last year, Mr. Bush demonstrated his willingness to employ military force. Newsweek magazine, which once speculated about ''the wimp factor,'' now calls him the ''WASP warrior.''
Administration officials say Mr. Bush is giving thought to the larger picture, pondering what the Middle East will look like if the military operation drives Mr. Hussein from Iraq. But there are indications here that the Administration is prepared to accept an ending in which Mr. Hussein remains in power in Iraq and it is not clear what its solution for Middle East security would be in that case, apart from an indefinite American military presence.
These internal deliberations have been conducted in a classic Bush fashion, in the smallest circle of advisers. Indeed, the President and his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, have spent hours together, often with fishing lines trailing in the Atlantic Ocean off Mr. Bush's speedboat.
But whatever the intensity and scope of these discussions, Mr. Bush has had trouble expressing his larger goals to the public. Mr. Scowcroft tried to do some of that for him today in an appearance on Cable News Network, saying the gulf crisis was reflecting ''the emergence of a new world order,'' with the United Nations functioning as originally intended ''to mobilize the civilized world against aggression and against aggressors.''
Turning to the political problem, Mr. Scowcroft said Mr. Bush is actually putting in a full day's work and is so pressed for time that he winds up taking ''a forced march around the golf course instead of a leisurely round.''
For Mr. Bush's part, he has been markedly accessible for a President in the midst of a crisis, giving regular news conferences, which he obviously enjoys, and three major speeches, which equally obviously he does not.
These speeches have summoned patriotic imagery and talked of stopping a Hitler-like aggressor. Mr. Ambrose, the Presidential biographer, argued that these are words more suitable to an older era. ''He's talking about the American way of life being at stake, about freedom being at stake,'' he said. ''That's typical Nixonian rhetoric, typical Vietnam rhetoric.''
One problem Mr. Bush may be having is that the importance of preserving oil supplies is an important part of his Gulf policy, but one that does not play well in public. The other problem is the hostages. Mr. Bush and his advisers have been absorbed in not allowing him to fall into the same patterns that paralyzed Mr. Carter and Mr. Reagan, not only adhering to the famous vacation but also making sure that Mr. Bush does not - as Mr. Reagan did -begin appearing with hostages' families and thus establish a hobbling personal relationship with them.
 
A Central Truth
Implicit in all his decisions is one central truth: If Mr. Bush orders military action, he will do so in full knowledge that it will likely cost the lives of Americans and others held hostage by Mr. Hussein. But Mr. Bush cannot speak that thought directly.
Administration officials have argued with justification that the speed with which Mr. Bush gathered other countries behind him is testimony to his personal diplomacy. Bush.
But what the Persian Gulf crisis has also demonstrated are the hazards of Mr. Bush's penchant for dealing only with the top officials of foreign countries. In this case, Mr. Bush's views are heavily tinted by his friendships with the ruling elites of countries like Jordan and Saudi Arabia.
''During a trip to Saudi Arabia in 1986, Bush met with King Fahd from 4 P.M. to 3 A.M. one day,'' a senior official said. ''He is a longtime friend of the Saudi Ambassador in Washington, Prince Bandar, who gave Bush an enormous party in air-conditioned tents in the desert and took him riding on the dunes in a jeep. They got stuck in the sand together.''
 
Personal Bonding
''But the scene that sticks in my mind the most is Bush on a yacht with King Hussein of Jordan,'' he said. ''They were going out sailing together and there was Bush, this tall, lanky American, rubbing suntan lotion all over the face of the King, who was much shorter.''
This personal bonding is critical to Mr. Bush. He is said to be unable to trust another leader until he has achieved it. But Administration officials acknowledge gaps in his understanding of the Middle East.
''There is an aspect of Arab religion, culture and political life that is not clearly understood by anybody,'' an official said. ''Since that's the card that Saddam is playing right now, this manifests itself not being able to understand Saddam's motivations or predict his next move.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Kuwaiti Exiles Talk of Iraqi Search for Westerners

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
Some Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait are searching for Westerners, Kuwaiti exiles in Saudi Arabia said yesterday in telephone interviews.
The Iraqi troops also appear to have confiscated from Kuwait and shipped home large quantities of food. As a result, the United Nations trade embargo against both countries may cause hunger and other hardship sooner in occupied Kuwait than in Iraq. 
Iraqi troops in Kuwait are said to have visited the large apartment complexes where many Westerners live, asking the guards for help in locating Americans and other foreigners, said a Kuwaiti businessman in Zilfi, a Saudi town about 200 miles from the border.
But a State Department official said the United States had received no recent reports of Iraqi soldiers going door to door in search of foreigners or of local residents being pressed to help find foreigners. The official insisted on anonymity.
Iraqi-controlled television and radio in Kuwait have warned residents against harboring foreigners, said a Kuwaiti Government worker in Zilfi who left his country on Monday. ''They said you will have the strongest punishment, but they didn't say what it was.''
The businessman belongs to a group that is bringing people out from Kuwait. He said he had made six trips, most recently coming out on Thursday, while a teacher said he had made three trips, returning from the last trip on Aug. 19. They spoke on condition that they not be identified.
Their accounts could not be independently confirmed.
 
Perhaps Too Great a Risk
The Iraqis have stepped up their border patrols and begun shooting at people attempting to cross the desert, the businessman said, adding: ''I don't think I will go back. I don't think I can do it again.''
Iraqi troops have obliterated graffiti critical of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, the businessman said. ''The Kuwaitis will write 'Saddam Is Bad,' and the Iraqis will paint over it, 'Saddam Is Good.' ''
Demonstrations by Kuwaiti women holding up pictures of the exiled Emir have been broken up by Iraqi troops, said a Kuwaiti businessman in Riyadh, Nasser Al-Rashed, the chairman and managing director of Kuwait's partially state-owned Public Warehousing Company. He fled Kuwait on Aug. 5.
Bread was still available in some bakeries on Thursday, and some gas stations were still open, Mr. Rashed said. Vegetables were also available, and Kuwaitis have stored food in their homes. But many warehouses stood empty, he said, and concern about the supply of food is increasing.
The United States Department of Agriculture says Kuwait produces some vegetables in greenhouses and has a small shrimp-fishing industry but relies on imports for 96 percent of its food. Kuwait imports much of its food by sea, but Kuwait's ports are now blockaded by the United States Navy.
Iraq relies on imports for 70 to 80 percent of its food, said John P. Parker, an Agriculture Department economist.
The Iraqi Government is more likely to feed its people than the Kuwaitis if the United Nations embargo proves prolonged, said Marvin Zonis, a professor at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, who studies Iraqi politics.

OPEC LEADER URGES HIGHER OIL OUTPUT

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: VIENNA, Aug. 25

 BODY:
The president of OPEC said today that the organization should help alleviate any oil shortages caused by the Persian Gulf crisis.
But his remarks were not accompanied by any signs that informal talks here on Sunday would mend a deep split in the group.
''I hope to God we save OPEC,'' Sadek Boussena, the oil minister of Algeria, told reporters at a Vienna hotel. 
Representatives of most of the 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are expected to join in the talks here amid what appeared to be a deepening rift between those that want to raise production and those that want even higher oil prices.
 
Nearly a 50 Percent Price Rise
Oil prices have already risen nearly 50 percent since supplies were disrupted after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
Mr. Boussena said OPEC should act, at what he called the right time, to help alleviate any oil shortages.
Neither in his remarks at the hotel, nor in an interview with Reuters, did Mr. Boussena elaborate on what he saw as the main threat to the group.
In the interview, he emphasized that his remarks reflected Algeria's position and that he was not speaking in his capacity as OPEC president.
Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister, Hisham M. Nazer, said upon his arrival in Vienna that he would have ''no comment to make at this stage.''
Saudi Arabia and Venezuela have been the main proponents of the talks, which were set after a militant group of oil producers blocked an attempt to hold a more formal emergency meeting to try to stabilize soaring oil prices.
At one point, the Saudis had said they were unlikely to attend any meeting unless it was a formal decision-making conference.
 
Severe Petroleum Shortages
The disagreement has come as the world's oil markets have begun to experience severe shortages of some refined petroleum products. Many oil experts expect the situation to worsen in the coming months as a United Nations-endorsed embargo against Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil sharply diminishes world oil supplies.
Prices have jumped about $10 above OPEC's declared target price of $21 a barrel, threatening to revive the group's negative image of the 1970's and forcing industrial countries to cut back consumption of OPEC oil.
The United States wants OPEC to raise production above the current quotas to help offset the loss of some four million barrels of Iraqi and Kuwaiti exports a day.
Saudi Arabia, which has up to two million barrels of spare production capacity, and Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates, with around 500,000 barrels each of spare capacity, say they will increase production with or without approval from the rest of OPEC.
Iraq, a member of OPEC, will scarcely grant such approval, delegates say.
 
Reason for Consultations
''I am a man of the law; I follow the statute,'' Mr. Boussena said, referring to OPEC's bylaws to explain why he had called only for consultations.
Algeria had not opposed a full conference, but it had thought that in the uncertain political atmosphere preparation was needed so that ''we could act smoothly,'' he said.
Mr. Boussena added that OPEC confronted ''maybe one of the most difficult challenges it has ever had to face.''
''We know that a shortage of oil, if that really occurs, will not help the global economy, of which Algeria is a part,'' he said.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
For an Egyptian Father, The Joy of Sons' Escape

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Aug. 25

 BODY:
Outside the Mourci cafe on a dusty Cairo back street on Friday, Mohammed Gamal was all smiles. In a telephone call from Nuweiba, a port on the Sinai peninsula, he had learned that his five sons had returned safely to Egypt on a ferry from Jordan, after a grueling 1,200-mile bus journey from Kuwait.
For Mr. Gamal, a 63-year-old driver, the call signaled the end of an ordeal that began on Aug. 2, when Iraqi troops overran Kuwait. His sons were among 250,000 Egyptians working in the Persian Gulf state, many of them as laborers. Like thousands of others, they arrived back in Egypt penniless, looted of their savings, their radios and other valuables along the punishing journey that brought them home through Iraq. 
Across Cairo, and down the Nile River valley, recent days have witnessed many scenes like that at the cafe on Darb el-Qatib Street, where Mr. Gamal stalked from table to table, accepting the congratulations of neighbors drinking sweet Turkish coffee and drawing on water pipes.
Amid the handshakes, Mr. Gamal offered a flurry of comments on the crisis that has made refugees of tens of thousands of Egyptians who were among an estimated two million working in Kuwait and Iraq.
 
Politics by Expletive
''Majnoon!'' Mr. Gamal exclaimed, using the Arabic word for crazy to describe Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader. ''Ragal!'' he said, referring to President Bush with a word that Arabs use to refer to a man of resolve.
Three weeks into the Persian Gulf crisis, there is little sign of a shift in the public mood in Egypt, the most populous Arab country and the one whose President, Hosni Mubarak, led a majority of Arab nations in condemning the Iraqi action and approving the dispatch of Egyptian and other Arab forces to Saudi Arabia.
Despite attempts by Mr. Hussein to stir a ferment among Egyptians by accusing Mr. Mubarak of betraying Arab interests, ordinary Egyptians appear to be backing their President to the hilt.
In Western embassies here, the support has been reassuring. Just as Mr. Mubarak's stand was crucial to forging an Arab consensus, any weakening of his position could be the beginning of an unraveling of Arab resolve.
While Mr. Mubarak has survived crises in the nine years since the assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat, his position has never been free of a potential challenge from Muslim fundamentalists, Arab socialists and others who distrust Egypt's close ties with the United States.
 
Most Pleas to Left Unavailing
In an ''open letter'' to Mr. Mubarak this week, and in statements against the Egyptian leader read on the Baghdad radio, President Hussein has appealed to these potential opponents. But indications so far have been that the appeals have failed.
Only a handful of leftist journals here have sided with Mr. Hussein, and he has found almost no support, at least in public, among Muslim clerics who constitute a potentially receptive audience for his attacks on Arabs who associate with the ''corrupt'' and ''imperialist'' purposes of Western powers.
Not that Mr. Mubarak has taken his stand without strains. The return of the migrants means a loss of the remittances that have shored up Egypt's foreign-exchange earnings, estimated by some economists at $2.5 billion a year.
While Japan pledged financial aid this week to help cover some of the losses, there will be additional heavy costs in resettling the returning workers. The Government has pledged to employ 100,000 of them in Egypt's already bloated bureaucracy, but others will swell an unemployment rate estimated at 20 percent before the gulf crisis.
Egyptian security officials have been alerted to watch for possible infiltrators placed among the returnees by Mr. Hussein. And while many arriving here have spoken bitterly of the Iraqis, officials here acknowledge that coming home to economic privation that caused many of the workers to leave in the first place could foster political discontent.
 
Egyptians Ignore Attacks
This appears to be the hope of leftist groups like the Socialist Labor Party, whose leader, Ibrahim Shukri, said this week that Egypt had ''committed a vulgar crime'' by condemning Mr. Hussein and supporting the dispatch of American forces.
Despite such statements, Egyptian volunteers continue to line up at the Kuwaiti and Saudi Arabian embassies here, applying to enlist in the Arab forces arrayed against Mr. Hussein. Nor has there been any sign of ferment against President Mubarak at Cairo's principal mosques.
Sermons that followed noon prayers on Friday, such as the one at the Saida Zeineb mosque in the heart of the city, were steadfast in their backing. ''I pray for Saddam to come to his senses,'' said Sheik Ibrahim el-Qahum, senior cleric at the mosque.
Since many mosques and Muslim groups here are at at least partly Government-financed, the support is partly expected. But diplomats were struck this week by a statement drawn up by a group of 50 Muslim scholars led by Fahmi Hoveidi, a leading figure in the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist grouping that has been no supporter of Mr. Mubarak's.
The statement called the Iraqi invasion ''a crime and an offense against all Arab and Islamic laws,'' and said that it ''must be challenged and reversed by force.''

HEADLINE: Bush's Trade Offer Gets a Warm Latin Reception

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay, Aug. 24

 BODY:
When President Bush made his offer to open a free-trade partnership with all of Latin America, President Luis Alberto Lacalle of Uruguay jumped to the telephone and said he would accept.
Then he started calling his fellow South American leaders and urging them to do the same before the news got cold. Maybe, he said, they ought to send a delegation of three Presidents to Washington immediately.
''When, after years of our complaining of neglect, the most important man in the world offers his hand, then I think we should grab it - and the arm and the elbow and the shoulder, too,'' Mr. Lacalle said. While the broader Latin American reaction did not come as quickly as the Uruguayan leader wanted, Mr. Bush's June 27 proposal has been very warmly received in an area looking frantically for ways to keep pace with the global movement toward free markets and free trade. 
Although there are doubts in the region about whether Mr. Bush can fully deliver on his free-trade offer, many leaders are excited about the prospect of being able to negotiate seriously on points that concern them. On the continent that once rang with cries against ''Yankee imperialism,'' seemingly everybody of influence now dreams of a special relationship with the man who once headed the Central Intelligence Agency.
''We are passing through the most brilliant moment in our relations with the United States,'' President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina declared recently. That was said in a country with a long history of testy relations with the United States over such points as economic nationalism, competing trade policies, nuclear programs and human rights violations.
Mr. Bush's proposal coincides with, and seems to have added momentum to, a number of attempts to open up trade within South America after three decades of protectionist and import-substitution policies.
Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay have signed agreements that are supposed to completely open their borders to one anther by the beginning of 1996, although many steps lie ahead to make the agreements work. Paraguay has expressed interest in the pact as well.
On Sunday, Mr. Menem travels to Chile to encourage the Government of President Patricio Aylwin to join the trade zone, which he hopes will expand to all of South America.
Chile has pioneered free trade and economic liberalization in the region for 15 years, finding most of its markets outside Latin America, and looks eagerly to any improvement in trade prospects. But it is leery about tying its hands at this point to Argentina and Brazil until they do more to dismantle their protectionist structures and come out of recessions that severely restrict their import possibilities.
''Today, economic integration is the principal tenet of foreign policy of all of Latin America,'' said Rubens Barbosa, a Brazilian diplomat who presides over the committee of representatives to the Latin American Integration Association, which has its headquarters here. The 11-member group includes Mexico and the South American countries except for Surinam and Guyana.
''The scenario of 1990 in Latin America is completely distinct from that of 1980,'' Mr. Barbosa said. ''Then, the model was substitution of imports with local products and to protect and defend national industry.'' Mr. Bush, saying he was willing to work on a bilateral or multilateral basis, proposed that the free-trade negotiations begin with a series of ''framework agreements'' between the United States and individual Latin American countries or groups of countries.
Mr. Barbosa said he thought the United States would end up facing five different negotiations: with Mexico, already under way; then with the Caribbean countries; Central America; the Andean countries, and the countries here in the southern extreme, including Brazil.
But some South American nations also seem inclined to jump into bilateral negotiations. Bolivia has already done so, and Chile will probably do it if the others do not quickly catch up to its policies.

HEADLINE: Women's Shelter Wants Women Only on Its Board

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Aug. 25

 BODY:
Every day more than 100 women drop in at Rosie's Place because they are homeless and hungry, and in most cases because they have been abused at the hands of men. At Rosie's, the first homeless shelter in the country for females only, women are always welcome.
But men are not so welcome, and a recent decision to ban them from the board of directors has divided the shelter's corps of 250 volunteers, the people often described as the heart of the 16-year-old organization.
Although men have volunteered at Rosie's since the privately financed shelter opened, a male volunteer who wanted to run for the board in July learned he was not qualified because of his sex. 
No man had sought a seat on the 19-member board until January, when Howard Ostar, a longtime volunteer, decided to run in the board election that month. Volunteers who have worked at Rosie's for at least six months are eligible for board seats and can vote in elections.
Although Mr. Ostar lost, Randy Bluffstone, a volunteer for more than two years, decided to run in the July election. But Mr. Bluffstone's bid was thwarted when the board amended its bylaws in March to exclude men.
Today three seats remain vacant because no female candidates have sought them. Agnes Cahill, president of the board, said the directors were considering eliminating the vacant seats or filling them with homeless women.
 
'The Normal Dirty Jobs'
Mr. Bluffstone, a graduate student in economics at Boston University, said he was shocked by what appeared to be deliberate discrimination by people who are keenly aware of bias. ''The male volunteers work in the kitchen and do the normal dirty jobs like all the volunteers, but we're barred from any position of control because of our gender,'' he said.
The board's policy has divided the shelter's 250 volunteers, at least 10 of whom are men. While Mr. Bluffstone continues to volunteer at the shelter, serving meals, washing dishes and socializing with the guests, Mr. Ostar left, saying he was frustrated at being excluded from managerial decisions.
Rosie's officials say the rule is not meant to discriminate, but rather to formalize the shelter's goal of providing female role models for women. About 90 percent of the women who come to Rosie's have been abused by men. Many are chemicallyepepdedent, and nearly 25 percent veve beeininfefected witththAIAI v vusus ililsoso s sltlts s veveununededofof beds, Rosie's has limited its overnight capacity to 20 so it can attend to each woman individually. ''Rosie's has led the way in how to provide a service to people in need without robbing them of their diginity,'' said Sue Marsh, executive director of the Massachusetts Coalition for the Homeless.
 
Not the 'Shelter Industry'
Kip Tiernan, the shelter's founder, who is known for her commitment to the plight of poor women, said Rosie's was determined not to join the ''shelter industry'' by expanding capacity to accommodate a growing homeless population. Instead, the board decided last year to concentrate on helping a limited number of women find permanent homes and steady jobs. To that end, the directors created two managerial positions, which were filled by women. Given the shelter's focus on women, supporters of the board argue that reserving board seats for women is appropriate. ''It is within the spirit of affirmative action that a place whose entire mission is steeped in the conviction to empower women has a policy for board membership that reflects this commitment,'' said Lisa Price, a volunteer for more than two years.
But Mr. Bluffstone argues that men can also provide important role models for the women who come to Rosie's. ''I thought I could make a contribution to the empowerment of poor women by showing them on the spot that I value their ideas and opinions,'' he said. ''But the board members are sending the message that men are not to be trusted. I think they're seriously misguided.''

HEADLINE: Public Dismay on Savings Disaster Grows, Poll Finds

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH

 BODY:
The public has grown increasingly disenchanted with President Bush's handling of the savings and loan crisis, but most Americans still place ultimate blame on the managers and owners in the industry, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
The high negative ratings for the President on the subject have apparently spilled over to his fellow Republicans. By a margin of more than 2 to 1, Americans said they faulted Republicans more than Democrats for the crisis, which experts now calculate will cost taxpayers at least $500 billion over the next 30 years.
And in a sober warning to regulators as well as politicians, the poll found a gloomy view of the future of the financial system. Fifty-nine percent of the public said they feared the worst of the savings and loans crisis was yet to come, while 62 percent said they worried about the safety of deposits in savings and loans, and 40 percent said they did not think money in commercial banks was absolutely safe. 
The savings disaster did not prevent Mr. Bush's overall approval rating, first reported last week, from matching his highest level so far, buoyed by public support for his handling of the Persian Gulf crisis. Seventy-six percent of the 1,422 adults polled by telephone from Aug. 16 to 19 said they approved of the way he was handling his job as President; only 15 percent disapproved. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus three percentage points.
 
'Noise,' but Nobody Is Punished
But his handling of the savings and loan crisis was approved by only 27 percent; 51 percent disapproved. In May, a Times/CBS News poll found that 32 percent expressed approval and 42 percent disapproval.
''So far it looks like Bush is just letting the taxpayers pay for it,'' said Merlin H. Spading, a 59-year-old retired employee of the International Business Machines Corporation in Rochester, Minn., who participated in the poll, then responded to questions in a later interview. ''We are hearing a lot of noise in Washington, but no one is going to jail, and they're not trying enough to recover the money from the assets that were taken.''
The poll's findings underscore what strategists of both parties have been saying in recent weeks about the Federal effort to bolster collapsing savings and loan industry: that a year after President Bush signed into law the largest Federal rescue in history, the public is becoming increasingly frustrated by the slowness and the cost.
The Government has seized hundreds of insolvent institutions, but top Administration officials concede that the bill for the bailout will be at least double initial projections and millions of taxpayers will have to pay thousands of dollars more in Federal taxes over the next 30 years because of inept regulation, mismanagement and fraud by executives.
 
Overshadowed by Persian Gulf
Until the confrontation began in the Persian Gulf, the savings and loan crisis was considered a major vulnerability for Republicans in this fall's elections. Democratic strategists now say success of the President's Persian Gulf policy could blunt the effect of the scandal, but they still predict that the savings and loan issue will become important in the 1992 Presidential campaign.
Administration officials say such criticism is unfair since Mr. Bush was the first President to confront the issue. But they acknowledge it has been difficult to counter the barrage of criticism in recent months, and cite two turning points.
One was the acknowledgement by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady that the cost of the savings and loan bailout would be more than twice what the Treasury first projected. The second was action by Federal regulators against President Bush's son Neil for his role in the collapse of the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association in Denver.
Regulators have accused the President's son of violating laws on conflicts of interest when he failed to disclose that he had business relationships with two major borrowers from Silverado. Loans to them ultimately caused huge losses at the institution and contributed to its demise.
''The S.& L. issue is a crystallizing issue,'' said Stanley B. Greenberg, president of Greenberg & Lake, a national Democratic polling firm. ''I think the perception is that Republicans are closer to big businesses and that they are in charge and therefore responsible. People tend to blame the people they think are in power.''
 
Bleak View of the Economy
Democrats also detect public concern about the safety of deposits in savings associations and banks as a potent political issue. The destabilizing effect of the savings and loan crisis on the economy, they say, is perhaps more critical than its links to campaign financing irregularities or its criminal aspects, particularly as voters sense the onset of a recession.
The Times/CBS News Poll found that particularly since trouble erupted in the Persian Gulf, Americans have become bleak about the economy. The poll found more people saying the economy was getting worse, not better, than at any time since January 1981, just before the worst recession in the postwar period. Indeed, 61 percent now say the country is already in a recession.
''I think people look at the S.& L. scandal as confirmation that the economy is in trouble, that it is going to cost taxpayers money and that people's living standards are going to be in trouble,'' Mr. Greenberg said.
The poll found that 61 percent strongly supported the Federal deposit insurance system, saying they would endorse an increase in their taxes if necessary for the Government to ''keep its promise to reimburse all depositors'' for losses in savings associations. Thirty-two percent said they would not favor a tax increase.
That contrasted strongly with a lack of support for higher taxes to protect United States interests in the Persian Gulf or to cut the Government budget deficit. In the poll, 53 percent said they would oppose higher taxes to protect Saudi Arabia against Iraqi aggression and 65 percent said they would disapprove of raising taxes to reduce the deficit.
 
Erosion of Public Confidence
The response echoed growing worry among bankers.
''Consumer confidence has definitely eroded, and it should come as no surprise,'' said Ken Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association, a Washington group representing small banks.
''Most people don't distinguish between banks and S.& L.'s, and until Iraq pushed the topic off the front page all they were hearing was bad news about the banking system,'' he said. ''I hope the people in power take note, because consumer confidence is very important. I bet confidence has gotten significantly worse in the last few months.''
Such uncertainty seems to be reflected in the blame the public places on Republicans for the crisis.
Asked which party was more responsible for the crisis, 35 percent of Americans blamed the Republicans, 17 percent blamed the Democrats and 17 percent said both parties were equally to blame.
On a separate question, only 3 percent held President Bush directly responsible for the crisis, while 18 percent blamed President Reagan and 10 percent blamed Congress.
Fifty-five percent blamed the managers and owners of the savings and loan industry.
 
Congress Seen as Culpable
When those who believed the industry was primarily at fault were pressed on who was to blame ''for allowing the owners and managers to cause'' the crisis, more than half cited Congress.
The poll also inquired about Neil Bush's role. Besides being accused of conflict-of-interest violations, Mr. Bush and other Silverado directors and officers may also soon be the target of a $200 million lawsuit by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, claiming negligence.
But the public was divided on whether the President's son was being singled out unfairly. Forty-seven percent said he was unduly the object of attention because of his relationship to the President, while 42 percent said his case was receiving the attention it deserved.
Describing the willingness of the public to blame industry executives and the President's son, Mr. Guenther said: ''The public has to hang somebody. It's true throughout history. People have to personify evil and wrong.''
Campaign contributions linked to savings institutions have been a source of particular anxiety among elected officials. Some members of Congress have said that not only are they returning all such contributions, but that they will also refuse to accept them in the future.
Attention has focused especially on five Senators who intervened with Federal regulators in 1987 on behalf of Charles H. Keating Jr., after they received very large contributions from the Phoenix developer and owner of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.
The poll appeared to underscore those concerns. Asked their voting sentiment if their Congressmen received contributions from the industry, 42 percent of Americans said they would be less likely to vote for the lawmaker again.
 
HOW THE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED
The New York Times/CBS News Poll was based on telephone interviews conducted from Aug. 16 to Aug. 19 with 1,422 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. The numbers were then screened so that only residences would be called.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of residential telephone lines and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
The percentages reported are the particular results most likely to match what would be obtained by seeking out all adult Americans. Other possible percentages are progressively less likely the more they differ from the reported results.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for those who currently have an account in a savings and loan institution, it is plus or minus five percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: EARLY MUSIC;
Minds and Ears Can't Go Back

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Richard Taruskin lays bare one of the most significant fallacies in the quest for musical authenticity: the tendency to be selective about what is ''authentic.''
There is, however, another, equally telling fallacy: the tendency to ignore the fact that what we hear in music is not simply a performance but a performance as it is experienced by our culturally conditioned ears and minds. 
Minds and ears that have experienced Wagner, Debussy, Stravinsky and Crumb cannot hear Beethoven's music in the same way his contemporaries heard it. For that matter, minds and ears accustomed to the sonic and rhythmic environments of daily life in the 20th century cannot hear Beethoven's music as his contemporaries heard it. Indeed, all the cultural changes - scientific, technological, social, economic, political, esthetic, philosophical, religious - that have occurred since the early 19th century alter the way in which we listen to music from that or any other period.
The quest for authenticity is valid to the extent that it tries to do justice, however imperfectly, to performance practices of the day. It is fallacious to the extent that is selective about what is ''authentic,'' and blind to the role of the listener in co-creating the musical experience.

HEADLINE: A Drugstore Industry Leader Raises the Level of Its Game

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. But during a recent crowded lunch hour in downtown Chicago, Jim McCallister's cigar became proof of just how quickly a customer can get in and out of one of Walgreen's drugstores.
Mr. McCallister, a 58-year-old Federal worker, was happily puffing onhis cigar before deciding to dip into a bustling Walgreen drugstore in Chicago's Loop. So he placed it on a ledge before entering the store, and emerged a couple of minutes later with a small bag of first-aid supplies, pausing to retrieve his still-burning stogie.
Mr. McCallister's brief shopping foray may not loom large in the annals of retailing, but it is typical of the experience of many loyal Walgreen customers, who prize convenience and efficiency. And it helps explain why Walgreen, a 1,552-store chain, is the fastest-growing major company in the $58 billion-a-year drugstore business. 
Today, despite a shaky economy that is being depressed further by higher energy costs because of turmoil in the Middle East, Walgreen is embarking on an ambitious and costly program of expansion. Walgreen, long a household name in the Midwest, is now browsing for sites in the Northeast and Northern California as part of its plan to open 600 new stores over the next five years.
Moreover, Walgreen is betting that it can succeed in new markets at a time when competition is stiffening. Supermarkets increasingly are adding sizable drugstore departments, while so-called ''deep discount'' drugstores that cut prices on basic goods like shampoo and toothpaste by up to 40 percent are proliferating.
''There are a lot of people going after their business,'' said Neil Stern, of McMillan Doolittle, a retail consulting firm in Chicago. ''Walgreen's is really the star in this industry right now.'' At the Walgreen headquarters in Deerfield, a suburb of Chicago, the company's management - a cadre of former druggists and drugstore managers, known for being tightfisted and detail-oriented - hopes to maintain its leading position in the industry, and its growth plan is crucial to continuing its momentum.
The Walgreen strategy is based on investing heavily in new stores and cutting-edge retailing technology in an effort to strengthen its already strong franchise.
Walgreen's does not claim to have the lowest prices on drugstore staples. Instead, the company's executives strive to make sure a Walgreen outlet is the store of choice for the harried shopper on a 30-minute lunch break. In fact, the average Walgreen customer buys two items in well under 10 minutes.
''Nothing is more important to Walgreen's long-term success than convenience,'' declared the company's 1989 annual report.
''That is the cornerstone of their strategy,'' said Mr. Stern, the retail consultant.
So far, Walgreen's strategy is working. Last August, the company announced its 15th straight year of record sales and earnings. For the fiscal year ended on Aug. 31, profits increased nearly 20 percent, to $154 million, and sales were up more than 10 percent, to $5.38 billion. Return on shareholder's equity was more than 20 percent for the year.
Although those attending the company's annual meeting are given a bag of vitamins each year, shareholders are in little need of pepping up. After three stock splits, 100 shares of Walgreen's stock bought in 1979 for $3,050, were worth $37,500 ten years later. Dividends, paid every quarter since 1933, have been increased 14 times in the last 12 years.
The company is conservatively financed. Despite a $200 million capital spending budget for store expansion and remodeling this year, Walgreen is paying for it with funds generated internally, not debt.
The company is also investing heavily in technology to cut expenses and improve efficiency.
Walgreen is in the process of becoming the first major drugstore chain to replace cash registers entirely with scanners, speeding up check-out times and eliminating the need for clerks to price items. The company is also introducing an electronic inventory control system that is expected to allow the company to reduce its inventory expense by $200 million, or 25 percent.
''They seem to be at the forefront of retailing technology,'' said Richard G. Elam, a Chicago-based analyst with Blunt Ellis & Loewi Inc.
The company's most significant high-tech edge in wooing the all-important pharmaceutical customers is its nationwide system of satellite dishes that connects more than 1,000 Walgreen stores.
The network allows pharmacists in stores throughout the country to gain instant access to a customer's prescription records. For customers who are traveling, it means a Walgreen store thousands of miles from home can handle prescriptions as easily as the nearby Walgreen outlet. In fact, the cigar-smoking Mr. McCallister was an out-of-town customer visiting Chicago. ''Walgreen's is the only company in the country that I know of where I can have a prescription on file in Florida and I'm here in Chicago and they'll fill it,'' he said.
Walgreen's has won such customer endorsements by concentrating exclusively on the drugstore business in recent years. Ill-conceived diversification attempts and heavy borrowing crippled Revco D.S. Inc., once a formidable competitor, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1988.
For a while in the 1960's and into the early 70's, Walgreen dabbled with its own diversification strategy, trying at one time or another to sell everything from men's suits to restaurant meals.
Yet the company strayed far less than many of its rivals. And by 1975, Charles R. Walgreen 3d, the current chairman and grandson of the founder, decided it was time to begin selling off the unrelated operations.
In 1988, Walgreen sold its 91 Wag's restaurants to the Marriott Corporation. This summer, the streamlining was completed when Walgreen's sold its private label manufacturing operation to an employee group.
L. Daniel Jorndt, Walgreen's president and chief operating officer, is a believer in the perils of diversification. ''If some Harvard M.B.A. pulls out all the data, he will see that the people that got in trouble in this business didn't get into trouble in the drugstore business,'' Mr. Jorndt said.
Today, Walgreen faces its most formidable competition from nontraditional outlets. Deep discounters, like privately held Phar Mor and the Drug Emporium, both of which offer low prices in cavernous no-frills stores, are siphoning off much of the toothpaste and shampoo business. The discounters, which trim suggested retail prices by up to 40 percent, are forcing the entire industry to accept lower margins.
From another direction, the nation's supermarket chains are pouring onto Walgreen's turf, lured by the higher profits available on health and beauty products compared with groceries. There are now 3,700 stores nationally that combine grocery and drugstore operations under one roof, accounting for 13 percent of retail drug prescription sales.
For his part, Mr. Jorndt says he is most concerned about the threat posed by the supermarket-drugstore combos. For example, there is now more shampoo sold in supermarkets than in drugstores - a significant shift from traditional buying habits - and, in fact, supermarkets have become the main source for nearly every health and beauty aid category.
Hence, Walgreen's strong emphasis on prescription drugs and convenience, both in catering to the customer and in selecting high-traffic store sites.
Walgreen's top management is closely involved in the choice of new locations - and, it seems, just about everything else.
Like many of Walgreen's senior officers, Mr. Jorndt and Mr. Walgreen worked as pharmacists in the stores. It has a top management team that for laughs will quiz each other on such details as, say, the daily sales results of the new store in Tempe.
''Our people thrive on details,'' said Mr. Jorndt, quoting Walgreen's founder, Charles R. Walgreen, who said, ''Success is doing a thousand little things the right way . . . over and over again.''
 
PROFITS IN PRESCRIPTIONS
 
CHICAGO
The Walgreen Company's booming prescription drug business has been a key ingredient in its success. Today, the company accounts for more than 6 percent of all prescription sales in the United States.
''Walgreen's pharmacy business is among the most impressive growth businesses in all of retailing,'' according to a report by Stephen F. Mandel Jr., an analyst at Goldman Sachs.
Indeed, Walgreen's drug sales have grown by an average of 25 percent a year during the last decade. And this year, the company's drug sales are expected to account for nearly $2 billion in revenues, or more than a third of the chain's total sales.
The outlook for Walgreen's retail drug business appears bright, now that America's baby boomers are entering middle age, the time when a person's use of prescription drugs typically rises sharply.
''We are in a segment of retailing that has very good demographics going for it,'' said L. Daniel Jorndt, president and chief operating officer of Walgreen's, noting that prescription usage ''really takes off when you hit 45.''
Not surprisingly, Walgreen tracks demographic statistics with a mercenary eye. Its 1989 annual report gleefully notes the number of people between 45 and 54 years old will increase by 46 percent during the 1990's.
Prescription drug customers tend to find a favorite pharmacy and become loyal, steady patrons. And during the wait to get a prescription filled, customers are likely to pick up a box of Kleenex or a tube of toothpaste. And drug retailing is a recession-resistant business, analysts note.
Still, drug retailers are facing pressure on profits. Behind the squeeze is the increased clout of the medical insurance plans, which now pay for roughly a third of all drug purchases and, by 1995, are expected to represent more than half.
Large health maintenance organizations and other third-party providers are able to negotiate price cuts with the large drugstore chains in exchange for the many customers they provide. Several studies by drugstore trade groups have concluded that much of the third-party prescription business is unprofitable for chains, even when factoring in the additional purchases made by customers. Chains are beginning to reject contracts from HMO's when the terms are too unfavorable.
But analysts are confident that Walgreen can remain the low-cost provider of prescriptions to third-party groups, thus gaining market share even though the profitability of that business will almost surely continue to decline.

More on the Trump Saga
 
For savings and loan bailouts, the Resolution Trust Corporation must approve. For Trump bailouts, it takes the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. On Tuesday, the commission approved Donald J. Trump's package of $65 million in new bank loans, with casinos as collateral. The Trump Shuttle is no longer for sale. So says Mr. Trump, but his creditors keep pressuring him to sell off property to pay down his debts. Mr. Trump swears that he has had many offers, although the $340 million value he assigns to the shuttle is $40 million to $190 million more than his accountants say it would fetch if he had to sell it in a hurry. The shuttle plans to add charter flights and Atlantic City service, and update its fleet. Mr. Trump said that he wants to provide ''a stable environment for our valued customers.'' Stable, but more expensive, that is, with fares rising $10 effective on Monday. 
 
Southland Fights Back
 
A good idea came too late at the Southland Corporation. A Southland executive in the Pacific Northwest found a sure method of shooing teen-agers away from the company's Hoagy's Corner Delis and 7-Eleven stores: Hit them with Mantovani, pour it on them from loudspeakers outside the stores. Others may call it easy listening, but when the strings swoon, the teens scatter. Southland, remember, narrowly avoided bankruptcy last month. Japan's Ito-Yokado Group took over the chain from its founders, the Thompson family, after a leveraged buyout went awry. Who knows but what, if Southland executives had piped in music their creditors couldn't stand, they might still be in charge today.
 
A Stock for Wartime
 
We all know that Wall Street has ways to cash in on every crisis. Hurricanes? Short insurance stocks. Strife in South Africa? Buy gold. Now comes a chemical warfare play. Survival Technology of Bethesda, Md., makes nerve-gas antidotes. The United States is keeping the company busy around the clock, making filled syringes that could become essential in fending off an Iraqi attack. On Aug. 7, Survival stock stood at $9 1/4. While the broader market has tumbled since then, Survival closed on Friday at $10 1/8.
 
Japan Prepares Arab Aid
 
The United States sends troops, Japan sends yen. At the urging of President Bush, Japan is offering Arab nations aid that could run into the billions of dollars to compensate for lost trade with Iraq and Kuwait. Japan's Constitution precludes direct military involvement. But Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan has reportedly discussed sending medical, transportation and communications experts, and possibly some minesweepers, to the region. His nation relies on the Middle East for more than 70 percent of its oil, more than any other industrialized nation. Japan, searching for a role in the world to match the size of its economy, already provides more foreign aid than the United States. President Bush is said to have asked Mr. Kaifu last week to also help pay for the international forces sent to the Persian Gulf. A recovery on Friday was not nearly enough to make up for sharp losses on the Tokyo stock exchange earlier in the week. The Nikkei index fell to 24,165.76 during the week, from 26,786.72 the week before.
 
Looting an S.&L.
 
A Federal judge on Thursday rejected Charles H. Keating Jr.'s suit to regain control of the failed Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. Lincoln's $2 billion bailout has been one of the most costly so far. ''What has emerged is not a pretty picture,'' said Federal District Judge Stanley Sporkin. Mr. Keating and his associates, he said, had ''abused their positions. Bluntly speaking, their actions amounted to a looting of Lincoln.'' Mr. Keating, who has accused regulators of having a vendetta against him, faces several lawsuits and investigations.
 
In Brief
 
Three former Northwest Airlines pilots were convicted on Monday of flying under the influence of alcohol, the first time professional pilots have been found guilty of the crime.
 
Shares of UAL Inc. closed at $93 1/2 on Friday as analysts said they doubted that employees would be able to finance their $201-a-share buyout bid.
 
The Control Data Corporation can sell six mainframe computers for $32 million to the Soviet Union. The United States Government, relaxing its technology export controls, granted a license on Monday. The computers, the fastest the Soviets have bought, are to be used to evaluate the safety of civilian nuclear power plants.
 
THE ECONOMY
 
Trouble in the U.S.
 
Friday's report on the gross national product removed any doubt that the American economy had been staggering even before Iraq invaded Kuwait. The Commerce Department confirmed its earlier estimate of 1.2 percent growth during the second quarter, down from 1.7 percent the quarter before. The Bush Administration had predicted 2 percent growth for the year. On Friday, a White House spokesman noted that the economy was still growing, but emphasized the need to reduce the budget deficit.
 
Profit Sag Drags Stocks Down
 
No, it's not a blind panic on Wall Street. It's a sane response to prospects of sharply lower profits, say some analysts. The Commerce Department reported on Friday that corporate earnings fell two-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter, even before oil prices took off. Economists say the economy is too weak for companies to pass along their higher energy and labor costs. ''A lot of people thought the trough in profits would be the second quarter,'' said William C. Dudley, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''But now, that is not the bottom.'' Investors had pushed the Dow Jones industrial average to within a fraction of 3,000 earlier this year on the prospect of higher earnings. But the Dow closed at 2,532.92 on Friday, down 111.88 for the week.
 
Oil and Recession
 
Oil rose to the highest prices since the early 1980's last week, causing all but the most optimistic economists to predict a recession. Oil for October delivery rose to $30.91 a barrel, up $2.63 for the week. Joseph Carson, senior economist at Chemical Bank, said he had predicted a mild recession even before the Middle East confrontation. Higher energy prices have caused consumers to fear for their jobs and incomes, he said; a decade ago, oil costs caused most to worry only about inflation. ''There's a totally different mindset,'' he said, which is bound to cause a deeper recession. Stephen S. Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley, said oil prices accurately reflect the risks. ''People are hunkering down as we move closer and closer to hostilities,'' he said. ''There is a legitimate fear of the destruction of some oil-producing facilities.'' Mr. Roach said recession is no certainty unless oil goes above $35. But among major Wall Street firms, he added, ''We're the only holdout.''
 
The Fed Holds Fast
 
The Federal Reserve apparently decided last week to hold interest rates steady until the effects of the Mideast crisis become more clear. For the time being, the Fed seems more intent on controlling inflation than stimulating the economy.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Helping Russia to a Better Shoe
 
The M.A.L. Sales Corporation has reached a tentative agreement to help the Russians make 50 million pairs of shoes over the next decade. First will come canvas-and-leather athletic shoes, then work shoes, with a total wholesale value of about $5 billion. Lined up end to end across the vast tundra, mountain ranges, rivers and steppes of the Soviet Union, they would stretch from Moscow to Vladivostok and most of the way back - and, Moscow hopes, last longer than the footwear the Soviets themselves make.
 
Oil Ripples Through U.S. Markets
 
Exactly a century ago, the superintendent of the Census announced the closing of the American frontier. But the myth o nature's limitless bounty persists, with residents of the arid Southwest insisting on lush lawns and Northeasterners shuttling by jet over short distances that other nations travel more often by train. The last decade began with the disposal of gasoline rationing cards, printed but never used. Last week, to secure its oil supplies in the Middle East, the nation was using ecomonic, diplomatic and military means that no other nation can match. Oil prices soared, stocks and bonds plummeted, as analysts saw war becoming more likely each day. But all its preparations for a battle hav served to emphasize the nation's dependency as much as its might.

HEADLINE: Twin Spotlights on Parsons of the Dime

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
The directors of the Dime Savings Bank of New York had one final misgiving about naming Richard D. Parsons as its president two years ago: whether, as a former aide to Nelson A. Rockefeller and Gerald R. Ford, he could resist returning to politics. ''You know, we're not going to keep that guy,'' one board member told the chairman. ''How many black Republicans are there?''
Mr. Parsons hesitated to give the board a commitment. Politics had been his passion, and he knew that his success in the business world had been built on his record in government. As an outside lawyer, he had become deeply involved in Dime management, winning the board's admiration. He decided that he wanted to run a company himself, and promised to stay out of politics for at least five years.
Mr. Parsons became the Dime's president in July 1988 and its chief executive on July 1 of this year, the first black to manage a lending institution anywhere near the Dime's size. ''It's a statement by and to corporate America that there are no more areas where African Americans haven't succeeded,'' he says. 
Trying to turn around a savings and loan that lost $92.3 million last year would burden anyone. But Mr. Parsons says that his failure also would disappoint blacks who consider him a model and confirm the prejudices of those who believe that blacks can't succeed in top corporate jobs. ''The fact is, in this society, you are going to be held to a higher level of accountability,'' he said.
Mr. Parsons says that more blacks should strive for business success but he recognizes the obstacles. Blacks remain better represented at the upper reaches of politics and government - a Supreme Court justice, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Democratic Party chairman - than in business.
Last month, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said she was planning a ''glass ceiling initiative'' to speed the promotion of women and minorities. Companies that do not cooperate, she said, risk having their government contracts canceled.
 
A Stress on Business
Mr. Parsons deflects questions about his political prospects, stressing instead his preoccupation with the Dime. ''I'm not in the business of being a political leader at this time,'' he said. ''I'm in the business of running a financial institution. '' Leading the second-largest savings and loan in New York's stagnant economy, even with a salary of $525,000, is no enviable position. The downturn found the Dime owning a junkyard of ''low-documentation'' loans, made without verifying applicants' jobs, credit ratings or incomes. After last year's loss, investors have driven Dime stock down to a quarter of the institution's net worth.
Some analysts say that at least $100 million more of the Dime's loans will sour by the end of next year. But they say the Dime is likely to be among the battered industry's survivors. It has enough capital to satisfy Government requirements, while Crossland Savings, New York's largest savings and loan, falls well below.
One of Mr. Parsons's first missions at the Dime was cutting costs - reducing the staff from 3,600 to 2,600 and closing all loan offices outside the New York area. At a lunch with middle-level managers, he heard complaints about layoffs so abrupt that employees had no time to discuss severance benefits. ''People are quite upset,'' said one woman. ''They come into work not knowing whether they are going to be there at the end of the day.''
Employees took scant comfort from his mention of ''great deals'' on foreclosed homes. They wanted to know why the stock had been a terrible deal, falling from a 1987 high of 27 to less than 6. ''My father bought some of this stock when it was 16,'' Mr. Parsons responded. ''I told him, 'You have to be patient.' '' Investors, he added, have failed to distinguish the Dime - ''the strongest thrift franchise in New York'' - from its weaker sisters.
Some analysts who have criticized the Dime's performance say that Mr. Parsons is the key to recovery. ''He's the right guy for the job despite his short experience,'' said Peter Treadway of Smith Barney. ''He has a clear understanding of what the dimensions of the problems are.''
 
Setting Strategy
The Parsons strategy is to clean up problem loans, continue cutting costs and capitalize on his broad customer base to sell a raft of new services. Too many customers think of the Dimeas just a place for savings accounts and mortgages, he says. Racks in the Dimes's lobbies are stuffed with brochures on insurance, annuities and investment brokerage. Marketing experts hired from commercial banks scheme for ways to grab more consumer business. Mr. Parsons boasts that, with half a million households having accounts, the Dime is fifth in New York behind Citicorp, Chemical, Chase Manhattan and Manufacturers Hanover. ''We have to reposition ourselves, with our customers first, then with our noncustomers,'' he said, sounding much like a commercial. ''The Dime is one-stop banking.''
But Mr. Parsons grants that if the New York real estate market continues to suffer, so will the Dime. The Dime's strategy, said Jonathan E. Gray, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, is ''largely defensive, because it must be.''
Mr. Parsons faces high expectations outside of his job as well. Charities, civic causes and company boards always try to recruit corporate chiefs, but as a black Republican, he has special allure. He is on the boards of Howard University, the New York Zoological Society and Philip Morris Companies Inc. He is a member of the President's Drug Task Force and chairman of the Wildcat Service Corporation, which provides on-the-job instruction for those whose past crimes, drug addiction or poverty might otherwise make them unemployable. ''I don't fool myself that all these opportunities to participate come to me just because I'm a great American,'' he said. ''People in this society are always looking for minorities to be involved.''
Black business people debate just what their responsibilities should be. Andrew F. Brimmer, the first black member of the Federal Reserve Board and now a consultant, resents the obligations heaped on people like Mr. Parsons: ''He's a businessman. That's what he gets paid for. First, he should be expected to run his institution. Second, he should be expected to run his institution.''
But Wilbert A. Tatum, the editor and publisher of The Amsterdam News, New York's black newspaper, says that someone in Mr. Parsons's position can't avoid extra burdens. ''One has a responsibility simply in being black and successful,'' he said. ''Not only in giving back, but also to prove over and over again to suspecting whites that you didn't get there by candlelight, that you got there by pure unadulterated competence.''
Mr. Parsons agrees, but he has no patience with those who hector him about racial responsibilites. ''I don't feel a need to apologize to anybody for being black, or not being black enough,'' he said. ''There are a lot of people who will come and lecture you on your obligations as a successful black man. I remember once, this person asked me to describe myself. I started saying, 'I'm a lawyer, I'm - ' She said, 'Wrong! See, that's the problem with you, you're a black man, and that's the single most significant factor.' Believe it or not, this was a white liberal.''
Mr. Parsons describes his own political philosophy succinctly. ''I am still a Rockefeller Republican,'' he said, ''fiscally conservative, socially liberal.'' The Rockefeller influence permeates his life. His office, which looks out on Rockefeller Center, is decorated with copies of Rockefeller's paintings and sculpture, gifts after Mr. Parsons helped launch a reproduction project. A favorite lunch spot is the Rockefeller Center Club, the dining room atop Rockefeller Center known as the Rainbow Room at night.
In 1986, the family sold him a home in Pocantico Hills, welcoming him as a neighbor where his grandfather had kept the grounds. ''I owe them,'' Mr. Parsons said of the Rockefellers one evening as the Dime's chauffeur took him to Pocantico Hills. ''I didn't go to the right school. I wasn't from the right side of the tracks. But when I was fortunate enough to hook up with Nelson Rockefeller, that's how I developed my own network.''
Now the Parsons influence is beginning to permeate the Rockefellers. Mr. Parsons sits on the board of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and is consulting on the reorganization of the family's charities and assets.
 
A Political Touch
In last year's New York mayoral contest, Mr. Parsons campaigned first for Ronald Lauder, a friend and former client, then for the Republican nominee, Rudolf W. Giuliani, a former partner in Mr. Parsons's old law firm. Mr. Parsons left the firm at the urging of Harry W. Albright Jr., another former Rockefeller aide who was then the Dime's chief executive. ''You can give advice, but wouldn't you really like to run something?'' Mr. Albright asked him.
Mr. Parsons found the Dime's record in minority hiring and low-income housing especially attractive. ''This is an institution that is committed to having a work force that mirrors the members of the communities it serves,'' he said. Of 400 officers, more than half are women and 30 percent are racial minorities.
Some customers have noticed that the Dime has a black chief executive. His appointment caused a few to close their accounts - and some others to open them. But some messengers haven't noticed the new boss yet. When Mr. Parsons works at a desk by his secretary's, delivery people tend to assume he is from the mailroom. Mr. Parsons signs for packages, and later laughs. ''Hey, life's too short,'' he said.
Self-reliance is Mr. Parsons's personal and political anthem. He talks about the human tendency to blame misfortunes on life's bad turns - a habit ''not unique to the minority community, but it is more prevalent.'' He tells of how one of his teen-age daughters, legally blind and nearly deaf, will go anywhere, try anything. But another daughter - bright, athletic, ''with all the gifts you could want'' - complains of life's unfairness. ''To her, each perceived iniquity is paralyzing.''
Mr. Parsons elaborated on this message before the Pocantico Hills School eighth-grade graduation class in June. He talked about being cheated out of a ride on the Coney Island Cyclone roller-coaster as a child. If he kept his grades up, his parents had promised, the ride would be his 12th birthday present. He made the grades; then, on his birthday in April, it snowed.
''It just wasn't fair,'' he said. ''Somebody had to do something to make it right. You were owed something. I took my case to my mother and she said, 'Son, life isn't fair.'
''Tip No. 1, graduates. Don't let the fact that life isn't always fair stop you from working hard and giving your all in pursuit of your goals.''
He says life has been eminently fair to him. ''I don't have any experience in my life where someone rejected me for race or any other reason,'' he said. Mr. Parsons says that his wife, Laura, a teacher of the handicapped who is white, is quicker to notice racial slights. ''Richard is not looking for racial discrimination, therefore he doesn't see people's prejudices,'' she said.
Mr. Parsons is a native of Bedford-Stuyvesant, the son of an airline technician who installed and repaired electronic navigation systems. He grew up with few ambitions. At the University of Hawaii, he was a varsity basketball jock and social chairman of his fraternity. But he soon encountered a stabilizing influence, a fellow student named Laura Bush. They married in 1968. ''Left to my own devices, I don't feel any compulsion to strive,'' he said. ''My wife became my focus and the person to whom I owed my best.''
He decided to attend Albany Law School in New York. Even while working part-time as a janitor and later as an aide in the State Assembly, he distinguished himself, finishing first in his class and first among the 3,600 lawyers taking the state bar examination in 1971.
 
The Law Practice
He joined Governor Rockefeller's legal staff. ''Nelson always thought he was one of the most able lawyers he had met,'' said David Rockefeller, the late Governor's brother.
When Nelson Rockefeller became Vice President in 1974, he took Mr. Parsons with him to Washington. Then President Ford borrowed Mr. Parsons to serve as general counsel and associate director of the Domestic Council, where he specialized in drug issues.
When Mr. Rockefeller left office in 1977, Mr. Parsons was invited by Harold R. (Ace) Tyler Jr., the departing Deputy Attorney General and a former Federal judge, to join what became Patterson, Belknap, Webb & Tyler, a large, old New York firm.
Judge Tyler became head of the firm, and Mr. Parsons went from associate to partner and management committee member in four years. He had strong prospects of becoming the first black to lead a major law firm. Mr. Parsons handled sticky matters of reorganization and pay.''You have a lot of people who all think they're God's gift to humanity,'' Judge Tyler said. ''Dick had a talent for sitting people down and explaining what needed to be done.''
Among Mr. Parsons's clients were the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Dime. Mr. Albright turned to him more and more for advice. ''He wasn't out there like a potted palm,'' lawyerly and aloof, Mr. Albright said. ''He was really involved.''
Now the Dime is in Mr. Parsons's hands. But his job is not necessarily secure. Some analysts say that the Dime's broad base of customers and low stock price have tempted larger, acquisitive institutions. Even at his most relaxed, over lunch at the Rockefeller Club, it's a matter that causes Mr. Parsons to pause, let out a long breath and say, ''That's a sensitive subject.'' The Dime's stock rose on takeover speculation in 1986, some analysts say, but management has shown little interest in striking a deal.
Given another minute to think about it, Mr. Parsons decides that a takeover at the Dime would not rattle him. ''If it ever changed hands, I could find another job. Oh, I could.''
 
PROBLEMS AT THE DIME
At the Dime, Richard D. Parsons entered a venerable institution, in business since 1859, named after the amount it took to open an account. But heritage hasn't helped the Dime cope with soaring interest rates and shaky loans over the last decade.
As rates demanded by depositors rose rapidly in the early 1980's, the Dime's income from low-interest, fixed-rate home mortgages lagged. The Dime's solution was to open offices around the East, offering adjustable-rate mortgages to almost anyone with a 20 percent downpayment.
The Dime's asset base ballooned from less than $7 billion at the beginning of 1987 to more than $12 billion by the end of 1988. Then came the end of the Northeast's boom. Checks from thousands of homeowners stopped coming. Nonperforming assets - banker talk for loans that are way behind - increased to $754.8 million at the end of the second quarter.
Harry W. Albright Jr., the Dime's chief executive before Mr. Parsons, said he had no choice but to pump out adjustable loans to match the bank's income with the cost of its deposits. ''I am entirely unapologetic,'' he said.
Fortunately, the Dime had in some ways remained conservative. Most of its loans are residential, where the underlying property is far more salable than, say, the half-completed shell of some Dallas office building. Still, bad loans left the Dime with a $92.3 million loss last year.
Mr. Parsons can boast that the Dime's income for the first half of 1990, $30.4 million, was almost twice that of a year earlier. But analysts expect more write-offs. Jonathan E. Gray, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, says that problem loans might rise to more than $850 million by the end of 1991. His warning: ''You could see several years of earnings eliminated.''
 
The World of Black-Led Lenders
Until this July, the largest lenders headed by blacks were less than a 13th the size of the Dime. These are institutions started by blacks, some more than 80 years ago, to provide credit for black homes, churches and small businesses when few white banks would. In their markets, the black-owned lenders had virtual monopolies.
Although studies indicate that some discrimination in mortgage lending persists, many large lenders are courting black business. On 125th Street in Harlem, a black bank and a black savings and loan compete with American Savings Bank, Apple Bank and Chemical, and two branches of Manufacturers Hanover. ''There was a time when, because of segregation, black businesses had a corner on the black market,'' said Edward D. Irons, dean of Clark Atlanta University Business School. ''Increasingly, there are going to be no racial barriers behind which minority financial institutions can hide.''
The challenge for black lenders is all the more serious because of their small size. The largest institution traditionally managed by blacks, the Independence Savings Bank, in Washington, had $253 million in assets at the end of last year - less than 3 percent of the Dime's total.
Black institutions are among the most severely afflicted of savings and loans. The business magazine Black Enterprise found that the number of black savings and loans fell by 27 percent, to 24 from 33, in 1989, while the savings and loans overall declined by about 10 percent. Black-owned banks did better, going to 37 from 35 last year.
Black lenders are at odds over whether to reach into white neighborhoods or expand in black ones. Independence has its headquarters not in a mostly black area, but on Connecticut Avenue in downtown Washington. ''We don't look at ourselves as being a Chinese bank, an Eskimo bank or a Greek bank,'' said William B. Fitzgerald, the president. ''We have a fully intergrated staff, a fully integrated board and fully integrated stockholders.''
The second-largest black lender, with $238 million in assets, has taken the opposite approach. Carver Federal Savings Bank has its main office in Harlem, with most of its six branches concentrated in black neighborhoods like Jamaica and Bedford-Stuyvesant. Its president, Richard T. Greene, sounds like an old-time country banker as he speaks of knowing his community intimately, providing church loans (''We haven't had a foreclosure yet'') and awarding college scholarships. ''We are keeping pace - slowly,'' he said, explaining that he introduced an automated teller machine just last year.
Most other black lenders have remained conservative; their size excluded them from lending to Bolivia, say, or Donald J. Trump. Like Carver, with its perpetually crowded lobby, they depend on the little people. ''That's expensive, but that's our clientele,'' said Mr. Greene. ''We cater to them smilingly.''

HEADLINE: All About/Coal;
Will Coal, the Plentiful Old Standby, Pick Up Speed?

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
All it takes to give coal more luster is a crisis in the Middle East. With the embargo against Iraq and Kuwait cutting off about a fifth of the world's oil supplies, coal demand can only increase. But even before the recent jump in oil prices, the United States coal industry was growing enough in both size and efficiency to make healthy profits. And coal reserves are vast: if the nation derived all of its energy from one domestic source, crude oil would last eight years, coal 100 years. The United States now imports as much oil as it produces, but exports about 10 percent of its coal.
United States coal production this year is likely to exceed one billion tons for the first time, the fourth consecutive annual record. Domestic demand has been growing 2 percent annually - about as fast as the economy, but faster than demand for oil or natural gas. Still, coal prices have remained flat, at about $25 a ton, since the early 1980's because companies have plenty of extra capacity. Industry analysts say prices now depend as much on the economy as on events in the gulf. ''As long as the economy continues to grow, I expect prices to go up this fall and winter, for the first time in a long time,'' said Scott Jones, an energy analyst with AUS Consultants of Philadelphia. 
Until the 1940's, coal was the nation's leading industrial fuel, for everything from railroads to home heating. By the 1960's, trains ran on diesel fuel, but the the electric utilities had emerged as major customers. Utilities now use 77 percent of the nation's coal.
One major threat to the industry comes from pending clean-air legislation. Producers are competing to buy mines and mining rights for cleaner-burning, low-sulfur coal.
Coal is classified by hardness, moisture and the amount of energy it produces. Bituminous, the most common, is a soft coal used by electric companies and steelmakers. The metallurgical coal that steel mills turn into coke is a grade of bituminous that contains fewer impurities and produces less ash.
The hardest coal, anthracite, is almost pure carbon. About four million tons a year are consumed in the United States, mostly for heating. Lignite, the softest coal, accounts for a tenth of domestic production.
 
The Producers
Fighting Pollution, Hoping for Exports
The coal industry is far more fragmented than the nation's oil industry. There are more than 1,000 mining companies, some independent, some subsidiaries of large oil companies that entered the market in the late 1970's.
The largest producer, the Peabody Coal Company, a unit of the Peabody Holding Company, was purchased by Hanson P.L.C. of Britain in June for $1.25 billion. Peabody produced 9 percent, or 86.7 million tons, of the nation's coal in 1989, according to the National Coal Association. Next came the Consolidation Coal Company, owned by E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, with 52.5 million tons, and Amax Coal Industries Inc., with 38.1 million tons.
Peabody has been less profitable than many of its major competitors because its mines are less efficient, analysts say. They expect Peabody's modernization - $129 million for capital improvements last year, up 36 percent over 1988 - to improve profits and shift its production toward low-sulfur coal. Low-sulfur coal, which is less polluting, is deeper in the ground and more expensive to mine than coal with higher sulfur, which can be shoveled from open pits. But new technology has enabled coal companies to get 15 to 20 percent more coal out of underground mines each hour with half the workers. Peabody has bought machines that haul coal from underground mines on conveyor belts rather than by trucks.
Exports of coal in 1989 reached 105 million tons, the third-highest total after a 1981 peak of 112.5 million and more than a tenth of domestic production. How much higher exports go this year depends on oil. ''If the price of oil stays higher than $25 a barrel, I would expect that there would be a moderate increase in demand overseas, as Europe and Japan switch back to coal electricity,'' said Daniel Roling, a coal analyst with Merrill Lynch.
The United States, with 35.1 percent of the world's proven, recoverable coal reserves, would be the main beneficiary of higher demand. The Soviet Union has 26.8 percent, followed by South Africa, with 9.1 percent.
 
The Steel Market
New Technologies Promise Efficiency
The United States steel industry buys 4 percent of the nation's coal. But here and abroad, steel mills have been using less. Last year, demand for metallurgical coal amounted to 38 million tons, down from 67 million tons in 1980. Economists predict that environmental legislation and lower steel production will cut the nation's production of metallurgical coal by an additional 4 million to 5 million tons by the end of the decade.
The world's steel companies are working on ways to produce steel with much less coal and less air pollution. Steelmaking is now very energy-intensive. Coal is heated in a tall, narrow oven sealed to keep out oxygen. The heating drives out chemical byproducts, primarily benzene, and produces red-hot coke, nearly all carbon, that burns more efficiently and at a far higher temperature than coal. Pollution comes from gases - primarily benzene and ammonia - that escape during the coke-making process.
The American Iron and Steel Institute, a trade association, is working on so-called direct steelmaking, which requires no coke and less coal, or in some cases none. Some methods burn coal instead of coke, while others rely on electricity. European and Japanese steelmakers also are working on these technologies. ''Over the next 5 to 10 years, steelmakers will need far less coal than they do now,'' said John Jacobson, an analyst with AUS Consultants of Philadelphia.
 
The Unions
Still Wedded to The Wildcat Strike
The coal industry continues to have some of the nation's most bitter, violent strikes. A 10-month strike by 1,600 members of the United Mine Workers against the Pittston Corporation that ended in February touched off wildcat strikes involving 27,000 other miners. More than 3,000 miners were arrested. Pittston, which is based in Greenwich, Conn., had insisted that reduced employee benefits and more flexible work schedules were necessary to survive in an increasingly competitive industry. Members of the United Mine Workers complained that they had been without a contract since February 1988 and said the company's demands would destroy the union and its gains from earlier strikes.
Sympathy strikes cost other coal companies hundreds of thousands of dollars a day. To some, the strike signaled new militancy in a union that once could cripple the nation's coal producers and many other industries. Pittston's new four-year contract provided raises of about $1.20 an hour over three years, to a minimum of $15.12, and full coverage of medical expenses for employees, pensioners and families. In return, Pittston won the right to schedule 24-hour production.
Since the Pittston strike, labor relations have calmed down, with no further strikes. ''This is similar to the thawing out in a turbulent period in a marriage,'' said William H. Miernyk, professor emeritus at West Virginia University School of Business. ''Both sides realize that after the fight you have to live together.''
 
SCRUBBERS AND OTHER DEVICES
Scrubbers have been the power industry's usual answer to pollution from coal. They are small chemical plants, attached to power plants, that reduce sulfur emissions from the burning of coal. The scrubbers include electrically charged filters that trap pollutants. But since the scrubbers cost an average of $100 million, with a 5 percent loss in generating capacity, the search is on for pollution control methods that don't scrub profits as well.
The pressure to adopt new methods is likely to increase with the passage of tougher air-pollution restrictions now before Congress. Better ways of controlling emissions would also allow power plants to use less expensive higher-sulfur coal. Sulfur emissions from the burning of coal create sulfur dioxide, which causes breathing problems and contributes to acid rain. The Government has already committed $1.3 billion in matching funds to 38 clean-coal projects, and industry experts expect Government outlays to reach $2.5 billion by the end of 1992.
The most widely tested alternative to scrubbers costs little more than a few tons of limestone. Fluidized bed combustion, as it is called, requires the limestone to be injected into the boilers where coal is being burned. The limestone acts as a chemical sponge, absorbing nearly all of the sulfur emissions.
But only a few utilities, among them American Electric Power Service of Columbus, Ohio, and the Tennessee Valley Authority, have tested this technique, and only at low levels of power production.
''It is still a technology that is seen as being risky,'' said Robert C. Porter, a spokesman with the Department of Energy. ''The technology has not yet been widely tested on the scale utilities are accustomed to.''
Another promising technology converts coal into synthetic gas. Coal particles are broken down, then burned in a gas turbine. When the coal is converted to gas, processes widely used by chemical manufacturers can remove nearly 99 percent of the sulfur. This method, too, is only experimental, Mr. Porter said, with tests at only two plants.

HEADLINE: Managing;
Teamwork or Tug of War?

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
Add team dynamics to the lengthening list of strains to come out of the tumultuous 1980's.
As companies try to speed products from concept to market, they are asking engineering, manufacturing, design and other departments that used to indulge in parallel play to work together. That means that managers are being asked to form cohesive groups out of people who don't know the boss or each other, and who often come from different cultures within their companies.
Increasingly, those managers are coming a cropper. For example:
* When Michael H. Sternett became the Eaton Corporation's Chicago area sales manager, he gave his people fairly innocuous orders, like go make 15 sales calls a week, and do not travel in pairs. Within months, his staff complained to his boss. ''They said I was unfocused, and that I had taken the fun out of the job,'' Mr. Sternett said. 
* Everyone at the American Telephone and Telegraph Corporation seemed to agree with the concept of making one group responsible for ordering materials, scheduling work, designing information systems - in general, for keeping the factories humming. Yet the newly formed group was frought with tension. ''Some of the people believed in centralization, some in decentralization. They didn't trust each other, and they certainly didn't trust me,'' said Laurence C. Seifert, the officer who headed the group.
* The Chase Manhattan Bank thought it had the perfect new-products team when it combined a production group and a sales group. The team members were quality conscious and motivated, and the team's new manager was outgoing and helpful. Yet within six months, the team was behind schedule on its goals, and hostility was palpable. ''The new manager did not understand that sales types and production types see things through different lenses,'' said Marie Eiter, vice president of executive development.
Such stories do not surprise management consultants. ''More new managers fail because they cannot turn the staff they inherited into a productive team than because of lack of talent or knowledge,'' said Frank Petrock, president of the General Systems Consulting Group in Ann Arbor, Mich.
There's a lot of research to back that up. John J. Gabarro, a professor of organizational behavior at the Harvard Business School, spent four years studying what differentiated successful management transitions from failures. His conclusion: ''Many of the executives who failed had not considered building a team to be high priority.'' Conversely, the Hewlett-Packard Company studied about 150 of its most successful managers, and found that each was very good at building teams.
Thus, many companies are trying to help executives solve team-building glitches. In the process, they are discovering that seemingly major problems have easy fixes.
For example, after his boss persuaded him to hold a series of air-clearing meetings with his sales staff, Mr. Sternett learned that he needed to establish clear objectives for the group as a whole. He set an office-wide sales goal, and switched from individual commissions to paying salespeople on the basis of how the whole office performed. ''It forced the senior people to make sure that the less experienced people got help,'' Mr. Sternett said. Within a year, the office was meeting its quotas - for the first time in a decade.
At CHASE, Ms. Eiter got the new manager and his warring staff to take ''management inventories'' - pen-and-paper tests used to help managers understand their own styles and orientations - and to discuss their different characteristics and attitudes. Ms. Eiter reports that, armed with this new understanding, they are functioning better as a team.
She now routinely administers the tests to groups going through a management change, and uses the results as fodder for half-day team-building sessions with the groups and their new manager. ''It helps new managers understand why some individuals always seem to fight the current,'' she said.
Sometimes, an outsider finds it easier to spot what is preventing a team from functioning. Frank Petrock, the consultant, interviewed many of Mr. Seifert's subordinates at A.T.& T. He picked up on fears that Mr. Seifert would brook no philosophical differences about decentralization and would be too much of a hands-on manager.
At Mr. Petrock's prodding, Mr. Seifert committed himself to delegating authority, and specified the criteria he would use for promoting people. That helped his subordinates trust him. To help them trust each other, he instituted twice-monthly meetings.
By the time Mr. Seifert moved on to another position last year, the group had cut back to monthly meetings. ''Everyone had grown comfortable with the idea of telling everyone else what they were doing on an informal basis,'' he said.
 
A MODEL FOR TEAM-BUILDING
The Hewlett-Packard Company has codified the steps a new manager must go through to build a successful team. Barbara Baill, management development manager, describes them, using her own job as a source of examples. Establish why the team exists. ''My purpose is to educate managers.''
Build a vision, set values. ''My vision is to build the world's most effective group of managers, and we will stress such values as being honest with each other.''
Create shared plans. ''I will make sure that people who work with senior management and those who train new managers are aiming at the same goals.''
Lead the action. ''I measure people by milestones, ask where they need help and reward them for good work.'' Evaluate results and processes. ''I am constantly checking to see if this model needs to be revised.''

HEADLINE: A California Pension Fund Cuts the New York Umbilical Cord

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
How many people does it take to invest $17 billion? Just one manager and two part-time traders if you are the California Public Employees' Retirement System.
DeWitt F. Bowman, the chief investment officer of Calpers, who is in charge of the fund's total stock and bond portfolio of $58 billion, showed off his organization's state-of-the-art trading operation at a recent industry conference - courtesy of a live, satellite hook-up.
The audience of about 80 people - including public pension fund managers representing about $550 billion in investments - watched the Sacramento-based traders, crammed into a room no bigger than a kitchen, monitoring their gargantuan stock portfolio on 10 color-splashed computer terminals.
The space-age trading system makes it easier for Calpers to manage most of its stock investing internally, without the aid of highly paid outside money managers, Mr. Bowman said. It also minimizes the fund's dependence on Wall Street brokers. Independent studies show that Calpers pays about 50 percent less in commissions on its internally managed funds than do similar large funds. 
''They are the cutting edge,'' said Bob Toigo, president of the Institute for Fiduciary Education, which sponsored the seminar. ''There may be somebody else out there, but in asking other people in the industry, Calpers has one of the most up-to-date back-office trading systems around.''
With a set-up like Calpers's, it is no wonder that Wall Street is feeling uneasy breezes. As the availability and ease of computer-based trading spreads, Wall Street's commission-based revenue, once the mainstay of the industry, is likely to come under even more pressure than it already has.
Competition among the brokerage firms has already driven down commissions, which accounted for 50 percent of the revenues of Wall Street firms 15 years ago, when they were more than 20 cents per share. Today, they comprise just 17 percent of those firms' revenues, and range from 5 to 7 cents a share.
Michael L. Goldstein, who analyzes Wall Street companies for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, called computer-based trading ''a negative in a business that already has a lot of negatives.'' He estimated that such trading would be economical for any fund that manages $10 billion or more, and some already 34 do.
Officials of Calpers said the cost of installing their new trading system lay essentially with the software, since they already had the staff and personal computers in house. They declined, however, to give figures on that cost, or on maintenance and other factors.
Not many years ago, Calpers, with its limited staff and budget, relied heavily on outside money managers to invest its funds, which represent the retirement future of 800,000 firemen, policemen and other state and local employees. Calpers paid a typical money-management fee for that service - perhaps one-quarter of 1 percent of the total amount being managed. Those fees helped cover the commissions that the money managers, in turn, paid to the Wall Street brokers who facilitated its orders to buy or sell stock.
However, thanks in part to software designed by San Francisco-based Vestek Systems Inc., Calpers since the end of last year has managed 77 percent of its $22 billion portfolio of United States equities using nothing more powerful than several personal computers.
Carl C. Wilberg, who, as principal investment officer, manages the $17 billion in equities no longer hires scores of research analysts to scrutinize corporate profits and spot promising opportunities. Instead, he and his pair of part-time traders seek to create a stock portfolio that exactly replicates the composition of the Standard & Poor's 500, minus the stocks of companies that invest in South Africa, which Calpers is prohibited by state law from buying.
As long as Calpers does as well as the stock market as a whole, which it can insure by buying a near-replica of the S.&P. 500, Mr. Wilberg and Mr. Bowman are happy.
Since installing its new stock-index-based system, Calpers's internally managed portfolio has matched or slightly exceeded its target, the South Africa-free S.&P. 500. And it has outperformed the external money managers it has hired. That is not particularly surprising since about 75 percent of all money managers consistently underperform the market as a whole.
While Calpers's indexed trading system has saved it substantial money-management fees, it has also enabled it to cut back sharply on the commissions it pays to Wall Street brokers.
Previously, if Calpers wanted to buy or sell stocks for its internally managed portfolio, its investment officers would type up the list of its trade requests and transmit that list to a broker who would not necessarily have a ''natural'' buyer or seller standing by. The broker might then have to do a lot of legwork to find sellers of certain stocks that Calpers wanted to buy, increasing the likelihood that the firm would not get the most attractive price. Or, if it could not find buyers for certain stocks, the firm might have to assume the stock position itself, adding it to its own inventory.
Of course, Wall Street charges for those services, particularly when it is required to use its own capital to accommodate a customer's needs.
Today, Calpers' computer-aided trading system gives it several options that allow it to limit brokers' involvement, and fees.
First, Calpers's computer software automatically generates a list of stocks that must be bought or sold for it to remain synchronized with the South Africa-free S.& P. 500. The trader then checks that list against a centralized listing service that brokers, who already have ''natural'' buyers and sellers interested in trading certain stocks, use to communicate with some of their most important customers.
If a broker has sent Calpers an electronic message indicating that it has a buyer for 3,000 shares of the General Motors Corporation, for example, and Calpers's software program indicates that it needs to sell 3,000 G.M. shares immediately, the trading system will indicate that the deal should be done, provided the price is the most competitive one it has received.
A Calpers trader will then send an electronic message to the broker asking that the trade be executed. (Calpers cannot execute the trade itself because securities laws require that all trades of publicly listed securities be displayed on a national market tape, to which only members of the exchange have access.) By trading with a buyer who already has an interested customer and by limiting the amount of work the broker actually must do, Calpers has bought and sold stock at more competitive prices.
''We're now saying we want a lot of the discretion taken away from the broker,'' Mr. Bowman explained.
And Calpers can reduce that commission even further. Its new trading system is also capable of generating and then sending a lengthy list of buy and sell orders instantly to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange via the exchange's electronic-delivery system, called SuperDOT. When it places orders using that method, Calpers pays only 2 cents a share to the brokers who execute the trade.
While other large customers may also have SuperDOT machines in their trading rooms, courtesy of their brokers, they cannot - without sophisticated software - trade long lists of stocks quickly and efficiently.
And Calpers has still another option. Because it has become such a large player in the markets, it can trade directly with other large institutions. Mr. Bowman says that Calpers has done such direct trading with organizations like Alliance Capital, International Business Machines and Wells Fargo. And in such instances, Calpers pays a brokerage commission of just half-a-cent a share.
With all of these options, Calpers has been able to reduce its commission costs on its internally managed funds to an average of 3.8 cents a share, compared with the 6.5 cents a share that it pays for stocks handled by outside money managers. And when an institution trades $9 billion worth of stock, as Calpers did last year, a few cents a share can make quite a difference.
 
DOING DEALS DIRECTLY
 
LOS ANGELES
Although computerized stock trading rules the day at the California Public Employees' Retirement System, there is still room for an innovation that relies on nothing more than old-fashioned personal contacts. At least several times a quarter, a Calpers trader will pick up the telephone and call an official at one of a dozen or so other pension funds and work out a direct, private stock transaction.
''If we have a list of securities we want to trade, we'll call our opposite numbers and see if they're interested in working something out,'' said DeWitt F. Bowman, the chief investment officer of Calpers. ''It's carried out person-to-person.'' This direct trading phenomenon, which Calpers has been involved in for about a year, is a throwback to Wall Street's earliest days, when traders conducted their business without need of intermediary brokers. It is also another example of how large pension funds are no longer satisfied with being passive investors. Just as fund managers are demanding that corporate boards of directors be more accountable to big shareholders, they also are recognizing they can operate more efficiently - and profitably - by taking a more active role in stock trading.
So far, Mr. Bowman said, only a small number of pension funds and other investors are involved in this informal direct-trading circuit. And they are active, typically, only when they have a large list of trades to make at once and when the odds seem strong of finding a suitable trading partner.
''But I think it's an activity that will grow,'' he added, ''as institutions become larger and tend to trade more in blocks, and as indexing becomes more popular.''
A chief advantage of these direct trades is that - like computer-based trading - they save on commissions. To comply with securities law, the trades are run through a brokerage house - but for a fee of only about a half-cent per share, compared with the 6 cents or so paid by the average institutional investor. (The use of the brokerage means the transactions become part of the permanent, public trading record.) But parties involved say an even bigger advantage of this direct trading is that transactions can be completed at the best prices possible.
When large buyers and sellers of securities, like pension funds, wade into the marketplace separately, their trades can cause big ripples in the price of stocks. But trading directly, the pension funds' activities, conducted outside of the market, can be carried out at one firm price.
''This defines the essence of trading: the direct negotiations of transactions between interested counterparties,'' said Donald L. Luskin, executive vice president at Wells Fargo Nikko Investment Advisors, a large index fund manager based in San Francisco.
Not wanting to be frozen out of this growing market, several brokerage houses have started to address the ''Rolodex market,'' as it is sometimes called, pitching ideas for new services, said Hilda Applbaum, an investment officer with Calpers.
Already on the market is a system called Posit, offered by Jefferies & Company, the Los Angeles-based brokerage. Posit has about 200 pension fund subscribers, including Calpers, which list their transaction desires anonymously on an electronic bulletin board.
Despite its use of Posit, Calpers says it prefers to go its own way.
''The whole reason for doing this is the informality of it, and the fact that you don't have another party in the middle,'' said Ms. Applebaum.

HEADLINE: Technology;
As Oil Prices Rise, the Hydrogen Car Is Looking Better

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
On the surface, the hydrogen-powered car looks as if it were made by a malevolent Rube Goldberg.
It backfires like the cars in the old comic movies. Its engine knocks incessantly. Its fuel tanks are huge and unwieldy, yet it still can't go more than 100 miles, tops, before it needs refueling. And it costs a fortune to run. 
But no one is ready to dismiss the hydrogen car quite yet. In fact, now that Saddam Hussein's march on Kuwait has raised the specter of gasoline shortages and skyrocketing gasoline prices, hydrogen's status as one of the most abundant elements on earth is adding to its luster as a motor fuel.
''The fact that hydrogen can be produced domestically is certainly in its favor,'' said Joan M. Ogden, a physicist at Princeton University. Added Stephen K. Lowe, chief of public affairs at Siemens Solar Industries, ''Another 40 days of war in the Middle East and people may not be talking about fuels just in terms of cost-effectiveness.''
Even before the Iraqi invasion, there was good reason to push for hydrogen-fueled cars. Hydrogen burns squeaky clean, spewing forth little else but water vapor and non-troublesome amounts of nitrogen oxides. ''The payoff in improved environmental quality is so high that hydrogen cars merit more research,'' said Susan J. Hedman, director of policy research at the University of Maryland's Center for Global Change.
Actually, in the early to mid-1970's, most car companies in the United States and abroad experimented heavily with hydrogen-powered cars. They all ran up against the same obstacles: It took more energy to get the hydrogen than the hydrogen itself provided. The processes for deriving that energy were polluting. And no one could figure out how to put enough gaseous or liquid hydrogen into a car to give it a decent cruising range.
According to A. John Appleby, director of Texas A. & M. University's Center for Electrochemical Systems and Hydrogen Research, a cylinder containing the energy equivalent of a gallon of gasoline in compressed hydrogen would weigh between 65 and 200 pounds. To say that it's better than electric - it would take a one-ton lead acid battery to give an electric vehicle the same energy as a gallon of gas - is faint praise.
Liquid hydrogen gives three times as much energy as gasoline by weight, but takes up about three times as much space. And it must be stored at 423 degrees below zero or it will boil away.
These problems have certainly dampened domestic ardor for hydrogen fuels. The Department of Energy spends only about $2.4 million a year on hydrogen research. Detroit, too, is concentrating on other alternative fuels like methanol or reformulated gasoline.
''Hydrogen will just not be available at cost and volume that is appropriate for motor transportation for 20 or 30 years,'' said Nicholas Gallopoulos, who heads the General Motors Corporation's engine research department. The Ford Motor Company is ''looking at it, sure, but it is not on the front burner,'' said Donald R. Buist, director of Ford's automotive emissions and fuel economy office, who guesses that gasoline would have to hit $4 a gallon before hydrogen came close to being cost competitive.
It is in Europe, where gasoline prices already are high, that research into hydrogen cars is proceeding apace.
BMW, for one, has an experimental sedan with a modified 3.5 liter, six-cylinder engine that converts hydrogen liquid to gas in a heat exchanger when the engine is running. Many experts say BMW's research could lead to liquid-hydrogen-powered trucks and buses.
Daimler-Benz has concentrated on hydrides, metal alloys like titanium iron and magnesium nickel that, when powdered, can absorb huge quantities of hydrogen. Heat from the exhaust or cooling system can free the hydrogen and send it to the engine.
Over the last decade Daimler has tested two hydrogen systems. One used hydrogen alone in a 2.3 liter, four-cylinder engine, fitted with a hydrogen distributor instead of a carburetor and a system that injects water to prevent backfiring and to reduce production of oxides of nitrogen.
The second combined gasoline and hydrogen for use in station wagons with fuel-injected, six-cylinder engines. The engine got only hydrogen when the car idled and only gasoline at cruising speeds.
The tests, which were funded by the West German Government, proved that ''the operation of vehicles with hydrogen is possible and controllable,'' said Dr. Hans-Ulrich Hoss, Daimler's head of hydrogen research. He said Daimler has a project scheduled for next year to develop a hydrogen-powered bus with improved storage technology.
Both BMW and Daimler report that hydrogen's reputation as a dangerous fuel is overblown. Unlike gasoline, it has no toxic fumes, and the famous pictures of the Hindenburg blowing up notwithstanding, it is no more explosive than natural gas.
Moreover, it is easy to prevent it from accumulating to explosive densities. Hydrogen molecules are tiny enough to leak through minute cracks in storage containers but are so light they quickly float away. And it is fairly easy to mount hydrogen storage tanks on rear axles or other crash-insulated parts of the car, and to equip cars with electronic sensors that open vents or windows to let out any leaking hydrogen.
The real sticking point is finding economical sources for hydrogen. Here, too, strides are being made. The European Community and Canada are testing the feasibility of using surplus hydroelectric power from rivers in Quebec to produce hydrogen. One of the game plans is to transport the hydrogen by ship to Hamburg, West Germany, where it would be used to run some 150 buses.
In the United States, many researchers are hoping that breakthroughs in nuclear fusion or in solar energy will provide economical ways to fuel electrolysis, the process of making hydrogen by passing an electric current through water to split it into hydrogen and oxygen. In fact, there already have been great improvements in thin-film silicon solar cells, manufactured from silicon derived from sand and capable of cheaply converting sunlight into electricity.
Some researchers suspect that solar hydrogen produced in the American Southwest would be roughly competitive with synthetic fossil fuels by the turn of the century. Mr. Lowe of Siemens could see photovoltaic cells fueling electrolysis near the sea, with the resulting hydrogen shipped to desert areas that would welcome it for its energy value and for the water it would yield.
While everyone still argues about hydrogen in cars, it is already being used in planes, where volume of fuel is not nearly as important as weight. The Russians have developed an airplane that flies on liquefied hydrogen. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, meanwhile, is studying whether slush hydrogen, a hydrogen slurry that takes up less space than liquid hydrogen, is a good idea for the space shuttle.
The Shuttle already uses hydrogen fuel cells, battery-like devices that, in Dr. Appleby's view, represent the best scenario for using hydrogen in cars.
''Instantly rechargeable electric vehicles equipped with lightweight hydrogen fuel cells would have three times the fuel efficiency of the internal combustion engine under urban conditions,'' he said. ''This is where the future should go.''

Protecting Creativity in a Global Market

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER J. STEFFEN; Christopher J. Steffen is vice president and chief financial officer at Honeywell Inc.

 BODY:
As this nation ponders its place in world markets, it is increasingly clear that the protection of intellectual property and the upholding of American patent laws are inexorably intertwined with competitiveness.
This view is not based on protectionist sentiments, but on the realities of international trade and patent law: many of the inventions thought to be protected by American patent laws have found their way into foreign products. Eventually they are exported for sale in the United States, with no payment to the inventor. According to International Trade Commission estimates, American companies lose $40 billion to $60 billion annually as a result of inadequate intellectual property protection from foreign manufacturers. 
One unfortunate impediment to the protection of intellectual property rights is the gridlock that has overtaken America's courts. Some foreign companies have successfully exploited it to their advantage. Their strategy has been clear and simple: forgo licensing agreements and sell a product. By the time the court addresses the issue, the patent will probably have expired.
It was only after 25 years of litigation that Texas Instruments Inc. won the payment of extensive royalties from nine foreign companies for a patent covering integrated circuit technology - which is used in basic consumer products like pocket calculators and digital wristwatches. Recently, Honeywell Inc. was more fortunate than many other companies fighting for their intellectual property rights. It was granted a one-year acceleration by the United States District Court in New Jersey in the trial date for a patent-infringement lawsuit against the Minolta Camera Company of Japan.
Positive steps are being taken. In 1988, Congress amended Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930. Section 337 provides for a halt in the importing of products that violate American patent law if a company has made either a substantial investment in the development of a technology, or significant effort to license it. The 1988 amendment modified the prior requirement that a company also had to manufacture the product.
Inventiveness, creativity and risk-taking must be nurtured and rewarded in the global marketplace. American business has been the world leader in technological advancement precisely because the United States economy rewards successes and provides incentives to take risks and invest in the development of new and emerging technologies. The same rules must now be made to apply in the global marketplace. To achieve this the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs must reach an agreement on a strong intellectual property package that provides for timely and effective resolution of patent-law violations.

Pressure on the Dollar

 BODY:
Another week and another milestone for the dollar. First, the dollar set a new low against the German mark on Aug. 14. Then, last Thursday, it fell to a low against the Swiss franc, 1.2560, and set another low aganst the mark, 1.5444. At the same time, the weary dollar fell further against the three popular high-yield currencies that are backed by high interest rates and are also net energy exporters, making them less vulnerable to the Persian Gulf crisis. On Thursday, the pound jumped three cents to $1.9555; the Australian dollar rose to 83.52 cents. And the dollar fell to a 12-year low against the Canadian dollar of 1.1293. The dollar got a little lift from tension in the Middle East on Friday, as the Iraqis surrounded foreign embassies in Kuwait City.

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
Shareholders Get a Say on Salary

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
How much is good corporate management worth? A great deal, no doubt, when markets are in upheaval and economic prospects grow cloudier every day; even in sunny times, nobody expects corporate executives to toil for free.
But an odd chain of events at the Emerson Radio Corporation, the $100 million consumer electronics company based in North Bergen, N.J., is giving that company's shareholders a chance to offer their opinion on the question at their annual meeting, which is scheduled for Sept. 24 in New York. Specifically, shareholders are being asked to ratify last year's $5.3 million buyout of the deferred pay claims of five top executives.
If the independent shareholders do endorse the deal, the executives will give $1.6 million back to the company in the form of future salary cuts; if shareholders balk, the executives will repay the money with interest and retrieve their original rights to deferred pay. Given the amount of money the corporate leaders have collected during a year in which both the company's share price and its financial health have deteriorated sharply, the shareholder debate could well be a lively one. 
The drama that has led to the pending shareholder vote began last summer, at a meeting of the company's six-member board of directors. It consists of William W. Lane, the chairman, and his brother, Stephen L. Lane, president; Donald Dvorkin, vice chairman and executive vice president; Jay M. Haft, a New York lawyer who is also a paid consultant to the corporation; Walter F. Mondale, former United States Vice President and now a lawyer in private practice; and Lyle Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Asociation and a former Federal Reserve Board governor.
On July 29, 1989, these directors approved a plan whereby the company's top executives, including the Lane brothers and Mr. Dvorkin, would give up certain deferred compensation rights in exchange for a single lump-sum payment totaling $5.3 million. Also sharing in the buyout plan were Harold Falik, executive vice president for finance, and Kunio Takei, executive vice president for foreign operations. As a result, the Lane brothers each collected $1.27 million; Mr. Falik got just over $1 million; Mr. Dvorkin got $926,200, and Mr. Takei got $814,00.
The plan, the 1990 proxy statement explained, was deemed ''fair and reasonable under the circumstances.'' The board believed that the company's share price, then about $5.50, would soon increase. That would boost the amount of deferred pay each executive could claim upon termination.
Further reflecting their belief that Emerson's stock was a bargain last year, the directors voted to repurchase $4.5 million worth of the company's shares and redeemed certain executive stock options at prices that ranged from $5.50 to $6.63 a share. The redemptions cost another $6.9 million, of which $5.9 million went to the Lanes, Mr. Dvorkin, Mr. Falik and Mr. Takei.
These same executives also got healthy increases in their base salaries and bonuses. In the 1990 fiscal year, which ended March 31, the Lanes each got just over $1 million, up 20 percent over the prior year. After heftier raises, Mr. Dvorkin's base package was $955,769, Mr. Falik's was $942,308 and Mr. Takei's was $835,000.
Unfortunately, the directors were wrong about the company's prospects. Unsold products piled up in warehouses, margins collapsed, and 1990 profits were scarcely ahead of those for 1989. The stock price has fallen to $3 a share, more than 50 percent below last September's level.
As its business worsened, Emerson experienced a sharp decline in its current ratio, a benchmark financial measurement. At the end of fiscal 1989, it had $2.40 in current assets for each dollar of current liabilities; by last March, it had just $1.60. That put the company in default of the terms of a $33 million note issue, which required a current ratio of at least $1.80 to 1.
Mr. Falik, the company's chief financial officer, said the noteholders have waived their right to immediate repayment until Sept. 30, a week after the annual meeting. By then, he said, the company will have either improved its current ratio, or ''we'll negotiate with the noteholders themselves'' to revise the note terms.
Aside from these financial problems, the company and its top executives are still battling with a shareholder group that has filed a lawsuit charging that executives misled investors about the company's prospects in late 1986 and early 1987 and took advantage of the resulting short-lived rally to unload their own shares. The executives have denied the charges. A second shareholder suit filed last fall complains that the company's 1989 proxy statement did not fully disclose the executives' legal troubles before seeking approval of the stock-option redemptions, a charge the company also denies.
In any case, in June, the board's audit committee - Mr. Mondale, Mr. Gramley and Mr. Haft - began to have second thoughts. The committee decided that the deferred-pay buyout should be submitted to shareholders, and met with the affected executives to negotiate the compromise that will be voted on next month. The audit panel also won approval for the creation of a compensation committee to review such issues in the future.
Bruce Coleman, the attorney with Coleman & Rhine in New York who represents shareholders in both lawsuits, is not mollified. ''If I were an Emerson shareholder, I would be outraged,'' Mr. Coleman said. ''What the situation really needs is a stiff dose of regulatory intervention, and soon.''
As a spokesman for the company, Mr. Falik sees it differently. He said the compromise negotiated with the audit committee is beneficial for Emerson shareholders because it will eliminate the deferred-pay liabilities on the company's books. He and his fellow executives have accepted the deal, he said, because ''we are shareholders, too; our main concern is the company.''

U.S. Takes Back Seat in Third World

BYLINE: By VICTOR H. PALMIERI; Victor H. Palmieri, chairman of the Overseas Development Council in Washington, was a former Ambassador at Large and coordinator of refugee affairs.

 BODY:
The United States and Japan have already traded places in the global financial hierarchy. Long the world's greatest exporter of capital, the United States over the past decade has become a capital importer on a gigantic scale to finance its chronic deficits. Japan's economic surge has made it the world's pre-eminent international creditor.
Now the same shift has taken place in the arena of third world development assistance. In 1988, Japan pledged to double its aid to $50 billion over the five-year period ending in 1992. In 1989 Japan became the world's largest aid donor in absolute terms. Moreover, Japan's program transferred 0.032 percent of its national wealth to the third world, more than twice the share of the United States. The growth of Japan's aid program will gradually but surely erode American influence in the developing countries. It will also erode the image of the United States as a leader in promoting development as a basis for peace, prosperity and political stability. 
At least as important as aid levels is the the use of aid. The American program has always been driven more by security concerns than by economic development or commercial objectives. Over 60 percent of America's $14.5 billion annual aid budget is targeted on security objectives. The current crisis in the Persian Gulf is likely to intensify this policy focus. By contrast, Japan's priorities have been the reverse. In addition, about 40 percent of America's declining bilateral assistance budget continues to go to Egypt and Israel, with the remainder divided among the rest of the world to promote democracy, stimulate growth and alleviate poverty.
There are already consequences from Japan's growing influence in the governance of the international financial institutions - the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and the multilateral development banks. Until recently, the United States has been a persistent advocate of what is called ''enlarged burden sharing'' by Japan, which means increased contributions to these organizations. But the United States has also been an equally persistent opponent of greater power sharing with Japan in the governance of these institutions. This policy is now giving way to an acceptance by the United States of Japan's entitlement to more voting power based on its level of capital contributions. As a result, it should not be surprising to see a Japanese as the next president of the World Bank, a position held by Americans since the bank's inception after World War II.
Until recently, Japan seemed willing to accept a subordinate role to the United States in part because of its traditional postwar acceptance of the United States as its mentor in global foreign policy. But, Japan's willingness to accept this ''junior partner'' status is now eroding.
Japan's leadership capacity in the development field is still limited by its lack of institutional and administrative resources. In the Philippines, for example, where Japan's program is larger than America's, Japan has just 28 aid officials, including its embassy staff, to administer its programs. By contrast, the United States Agency for International Development alone has more than 100 officials. In India, the United States has a staff of 25 while Japan has only 4. This lack of staff resources undoubtedly creates problems for the Japanese in the quality of their programs.
Japan's increasingly powerful performance in the aid sphere portends a major transformation over the next decade of America's role from leader to follower in promoting the development of the poorer countries. This transformation mirrors the decline of American economic hegemony worldwide. But the diminishing role of the United States in the third world is not just the result of Japan's commitment to spend more money. It is equally the result of America's failure to develop a new policy.

Detroit: America's Best Source of Oil

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER FALVIN; Christopher Flavin, an energy analyst, is vice president for research at Worldwatch Institute in Washington.

 BODY:
At least one fact has become inescapably clear during the past two weeks. The world cannot afford a continuation of the steady increase in dependence on Persian Gulf oil. Means are available to reverse this trend. We can make our cars, buildings and industry far more fuel-efficient than they are today. The question is whether there is the political will to do so.
Few can deny that the world is recklessly over-dependent on Middle Eastern oil. Indeed, the situation is getting worse all the time. World oil demand has increased more than 2 percent annually since 1985. Meanwhile, the Middle East's share of the world oil market is rising at more than one million barrels per day each year. 
This dangerous trend is hardly a surprise. Experts saw it coming for years. But political leaders studiously ignored the problem, slashing many of the programs that could have reduced oil consumption and thereby vulnerability to the kind of military crisis that now exists.
Automobiles are at the root of American oil dependence. Some 43 percent of the country's oil is now used in automobiles. And 20 percent is used in other forms of transportation like air travel and trucking. Any efforts to reduce oil consumption must start with these transportation systems that together account for nearly two-thirds of oil use.
Ironically, these facts seemed to be better understood in the 1970's when Congress approved fuel economy standards that nearly doubled the fuel economy of American cars during a 10-year period. However, these standards were then allowed to remain at the level achieved in 1986. Indeed, for several years the Reagan Administration provided the auto industry with exemptions to the standards already in place.
As a consequence, cars rolling off Detroit's assembly lines in 1989 were actually less efficient than those of the previous year. This is a tragic reversal. If the average fuel economy was just five miles per gallon higher, we would be importing two million fewer barrels of oil each day, and in a much better position to withstand the effects of the embargo on Iraq.
President Bush finally discovered the words ''energy conservation'' after American troops were on their way to the Persian Gulf. Mr. Bush, however, was Vice President in an Administration that attempted to eliminate virtually every program aimed at reducing oil dependence.
Even in 1990, the country is spending just $411 million on energy conservation, over 50 percent below the levels of the early 1980's and equivalent to a few days' expenditure on the American forces now in the Persian Gulf. The Bush Administration is asking for substantial cuts in these conservation programs next year.
Simply raising new-car fuel economy from the current average of 27 miles per gallon to 40 miles per gallon would reduce American oil consumption by 2.8 million barrels per day by the year 2005. This is nearly 10 times the rate of oil production that the petroleum industry thinks is possible from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which it claims is the largest potential source of new oil supply in the United States.
The automotive technologies to accomplish these goals are available. Prototype vehicles that get more than 70 miles per gallon have been developed, though they have not yet reached the marketplace.
The projected additional cost for a 40-mile-per-gallon car is $500. This sum would be more than offset by gasoline savings of more than $2,000 during the life of a typical car. Fortuitously, the Senate is scheduled to vote on a bill mandating fuel economy standards in September.
The folly of relying on the Middle East for most of the Western world's energy supplies has been clearly revealed. Political leaders need to understand the simple fact that the biggest oil field available to the United States is in Detroit. With American lives now on the line, it is time that President Bush got serious about the country's energy efficiency.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
What to Call the Poorest Poor?

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Two weeks ago, Prof. William Julius Wilson stood up before 1,500 colleagues and called into question the usefulness of a term that has become a fixture of the American political vocabulary and one that he, more than anyone, helped legitimize: ''the underclass.''
His influential 1987 book, ''The Truly Disadvantaged,'' championed the term to describe not the poor generally, but a small group who are most likely to become dropouts, teen-age parents, drug addicts or even criminals, and who live among others like themselves. Professor Wilson, a sociologist at the University of Chicago, recognized the politically potent qualities of the word. As a liberal, he accused others on the left of being ''timid'' about discussing the pathologies of the inner city. Calling for more candor, he said that using the term ''underclass'' would enhance liberal credibility in the debate. 
He's now unsure if that's still the case. While Professor Wilson says he's not abandoning his analysis -that cultural factors help restrict inner-city residents - he worries that the phrase ''the underclass'' may have destructive consequences. In his speech to the American Sociological Association, he quoted Herbert Gans, the sociologist, to the effect that it has become an ''increasingly pejorative term,'' one ''hopelessly polluted in meaning.''
Elaborating in a telephone interview last week, he said he feared the term, once useful, is now being used by some journalists and conservatives to argue that the poor have created their own plight. And Professor Wilson, who is black, worries it may take on racist connotations. In his speech, he said he might begin to substitute the term ''ghetto poor.''
 
Assigning Blame
There is more than semantics involved in the debate. At bottom, the sparring is a new round in an old fight about where blame for poverty should reside - with the poor themselves, or with society at large.
In offering his definition of ''underclass,'' a phrase first used by the economist Gunnar Myrdal, Professor Wilson was trying to provide a complicated answer. At its root, he argued, the growth of the underclass is an economic problem, caused by the flight from the inner city of jobs for unskilled workers. That problem has been compounded by the flight of middle-class blacks that followed the end of legal segregation. This weakened institutions like churches and clubs and left people who remained with little in the way of role models. With this isolation of the ghetto, he wrote, ''joblessness as a way of life takes on a different social meaning.'' While the destructive patterns of behavior have economic origins, he contends, they in turn help perpetuate poverty as ghetto culture creates additional obstacles to social and economic advancement.
 
While Professor
Wilson was trying to describe two sides of a coin, economic and cultural, he now worries that ''underclass'' conjures only one: an image of people unwilling to help themselves.
Nicholas Lemann, author of a five-year study of the underclass that will be published in February, notes that Professor Wilson's dilemma is one that liberals have faced at least since Victorian England, when distinctions were made between the ''deserving'' and ''undeserving'' poor. ''To some people, 'underclass' will be taken as just a new way of saying these people don't deserve any special help,'' said Mr. Lemann, who is a liberal. What's unclear is whether in the long run ''ghetto poor'' would fare any better.
Some on the left, like Professor Gans, prefer terms like ''jobless'' to ''underclass,'' arguing that it is the economy, not the people, that needs reforming. The solution, Professor Gans says, lies in more well-paying, low-skilled jobs. But others, including some liberals, say ''underclass'' is more apt, arguing that cycles of welfare dependency are so strong that they inhibit people even when jobs are available. They point to immigrants who have few skills but more success in finding jobs.
This debate calls to mind an earlier and unhappy one, the vitriolic fallout from the 1965 Moynihan report that noted with alarm the increasing number of black families headed by women. The report, now widely admired for its prescience, was attacked as a racist document that ''blamed the victim.'' The effect was to inhibit among liberals a frank discussion of the inner city. One person who doesn't think that chapter will repeat itself is Senator Moynihan, who agrees that the term ''underclass'' has ''lost its explanatory edge.'' In an interview last week, he said that liberals who speak candidly about the poor risk being misunderstood, but that ''not to try to describe reality is the biggest risk of all.''

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
In the Polls, the Economy Declines, Bush Doesn't

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Saddam Hussein has thrown America's election-year political forces into a strange and unpredictable alignment.
Generally speaking, two factors have greater weight than any others in determining which party will come out ahead in midterm elections, now only 72 days away. The first is the state of the economy and the second is the public standing of the President. They usually move more or less in tandem: a sour economy, for example, understandably sours people on the President and his party. 
But what happens when one indicator, the President's approval rating, is rising, and the other, the health of the economy, appears to be declining?
That is what has happened since Mr. Hussein sent his tanks across the Kuwaiti border. Confidence in the economy, which had been drifting downward, has gone into free fall as oil prices have soared, and most Americans believe the economy is in recession, according to recent polls. But approval of Mr. Bush, which had been drifting downward, has also soared in reponse to his tactics in the Gulf. These opposing forces are creating enormous political torque. ''It's the irresistable force meeting the immovable object,'' said Norman Ornstein, an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute.
In physics, such a collision produces an explosion. In politics, no one is quite sure what will happen. Before the Persian Gulf crisis, office-holders felt this would be an unpleasant year for them as voters acted out both their economic uncertainty and a general disgust toward politicians. The synopsis in political circles was that there was an ''anti-incumbent mood'' in the land.
All the sources of that mood are still palpable in the body politic. It was clear in the latest New York Times/ CBS News poll that Americans are deeply worried about the economy and other domestic concerns, despite their enthusiasm for Mr. Bush's foreign policy. What is far from clear, though, is how the divergent attitudes on foreign and domestic issues will influence the fall elections.
Ed Rollins, co-chairman of the Republian National Congressional Committee, had been advising his party's candidates to save their fire, and money, until the last three weeks of the campaign. Now he says, the situation is changing so quickly, and so unpredictably, that he is advising them to wait until the final 10 days.
The immediate political impact of the Persian Gulf crisis, as Mr. Rollins' advice suggests, has been to freeze most other politics in place. Kate Michelman, head of the National Abortion Rights Action League, worries that David Souter, Mr. Bush's nominee to the Supreme Court, is not getting enough scrutiny. ''The Administration is benefiting from the lack of attention,'' she said.
Similarly, Gerald Celente, director of the Socioeconomic Research Institute, which studies cultural and political trends, said, ''the Persian Gulf crisis has diverted the public's attention away from the nation's many festering ills,'' like the deficit, the collapse of the savings and loan industry and the declining economy.
Mr. Bush himself found it difficult to change the subject from the Persian Gulf the other day when he tried to lambaste the Democrats for what he said was their failure to negotiate on the budget. The little attention he got for his effort was mostly in the form of criticism for injecting partisanship into the patriotic fervor accompanying his dispatch of forces to Saudi Arabia.
On the campaign trail, the situation is somewhat different. Candidates who cannot find something good to say about Mr. Bush's Persian Gulf strategy are tending to say nothing about it. Disagreeing with the President is not likely to produce any political gain while Mr. Bush maintains a 76 percent approval rating, as he does in the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. Instead, candidates are proceeding, as if on auto-pilot, with their pre-crisis campaign themes.
 
Competing for Attention
But it is harder and harder to get attention. ''What Iraq has done is take everything off the radar screen,'' said Mr. Rollins.
Democrats had been hoping for a vigorous debate this fall about the state and direction of the economy, stressing their themes that the rich have gotten richer at the expense of everyone else. They wanted this partly to win elections this year, but they also wanted to test their themes for 1992. ''The public discourse would have been very strong,'' said Paul Tully, political director of the Democratic National Commitee. ''Now, maybe not.''
Some of the themes may still be voiced in campaigns, said Mr. Tully. But without reinforcement by the press, many campaign efforts fall flat.
Thus the most important spot in American politics may in many respects be Baghdad. Eddie Mahe, a Republican consultant who is advising several congressional candidates, said that if he knew what Saddam Hussein was going to do, he could predict how the fall campaigns will come out.
''If nothing happens that appears like George Bush has lost I think the American public will be uninclined to punish the President,'' said Mr. Mahe. Democrats do not argue with that, but insist that domestic concerns will still drive voters in congressional races.
But both Mr. Mahe and Mr. Rollins see the prospect of a special opportunity if, say around October, a widely popular Mr. Bush turns partisan and asks the American people to send him a more cooperative Congress. Mr. Rollins suggests that the President try telling the country that he cannot fight both the Democrats and Saddam Hussein. ''I think he could make a tremendous case,'' said Mr. Rollins. ''It could be a unique opportunity.''
Mr. Mahe concedes he and Mr. Rollins are envisioning a remarkable accomplishment: the party in power holding its own or even gaining seats in a period of economic decline.
A recession without the Persian Gulf crisis would have meant very bad times for Republicans, said Mr. Mahe. But with a successful handling of the gulf crisis as a counter to the economic trouble, it may be, Mr. Mahe said, ''that Republicans would not suffer the normal very adverse consequences that would be anticipated in an off-year election with a recession.''

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
The City's Rough Past: Frighteningly Familar

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
Crimes of violence up 30 percent in six years. Arrests up 20 percent. Five police officers killed in a year. Court calendars clogged. Citizens arming themselves. Racial tensions at a boil. Critics bewailing a ''carnival of murder.'' So it went in the New York City of the 1860's. Today's alarming crime rate and fearful populace have clear parallels in earlier eras of city history, although historians say they have to go back to the 19th century and earlier to find them.
As early as the 1750's, New York was already regarded as the most degenerate of the colonial towns, with frequent brawls spilling out of the saloons, gaming places and houses of prostitution, wrote James F. Richardson in ''The New York Police:
Colonial Times to 1901'' (Oxford University Press, 1970).
''Thronged as our city is, men are robbed in the street,'' an investigating city panel lamented in 1842. ''Thousands that are arrested go unpunished, and the defenseless and the beautiful are ravished and murdered in the day time, and no trace of the criminals is found.'' 
The 1850's brought stirrings of vigilantism and press complaints that the city was becoming as deadly as the Kansas badlands.
In a 1910 killing as fresh as today's headlines, a gangster named Johnny Spanish opened fire on a rival, Kid Jigger, on Forsyth Street, missing him but killing an 8-year-old girl playing in the street.
Just where today's metropolis sits on the chart of more than three centuries of criminal violence in New York City is a matter of dispute, one that may never be satisfactorily resolved given the lack of reliable records. ''You're in a fog bank when you get into this question,'' said Richard H. Wade, professor of history at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.
But Mr. Wade and other specialists say that the level of violence in the city today has no equal since at least the 1920's and invites comparison with benighted periods of mayhem in the 19th century. Some even say that when old accounts are discounted for exaggeration, this era may emerge as the worst ever, although some reported barbarous episodes of the past clearly surpass anything seen today.
''No doubt we've had higher crime rates than now,'' said Mr. Wade, citing a period from 1857 to 1870 when the state-appointed police force clashed regularly with a rival city police force called the Municipals, leaving hapless citizens at the mercy of mobs and gangs.
But the big difference today, he said, is the ubiquity of crime: where once it was largely bottled up in a few notorious districts, it now rages throughout the city.
Marvin Yablon, professor of operations research at the graduate center of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice of the City University, said he would be hard pressed to find a grimmer period than the current one. ''The locomotive driving things is beyond police capability,'' Mr. Yablon said. ''I have a sense now that it's going completely out of control. It has no limit. It seems to multiply.''
Mr. Yablon, a mathematician specializing in creating computer models of problems for scientific analysis, said the contraction of the economy was especially sinister because it reduces the chances of youths escaping the cycle of violence.
In absolute terms, last year's toll of 1,905 homicides was the highest ever recorded, according to the Police Department, and this year's toll looks worse. The figure yields a homicide rate of about 30 per 100,000 - or nearly eight times the rate of 3.8 per 100,000 in 1901 to 1905.
 
A Death Toll Today of Six Nightly
Through the 1940's and 1950's, murders averaged no more than 300 a year. As late as the 1960's, according to the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City, a business-supported watchdog group, three-quarters of all murders in the city were a result of personal disputes -lovers' quarrels, barroom brawls and the like. By the 1980's, however, it said, more than half the murders were a result of drug disputes and terrifying random robberies, with robberies themselves increasing more than tenfold from 8,757 in 1952 to 93,377 last year, despite a small drop in population.
Murder figures are reliable, ''because it's hard to dispose of bodies,'' said Thomas A. Reppetto, president of the crime commission and a former Chicago policeman who insists that crime in New York has never been worse. ''It's way, way more violent today,'' he asserted, scorning as unreliable exaggerations the popular accounts of rioting and gang warfare in the middle-1800's.
Yet Robert D. McCrie, assistant professor for security management at John Jay, said his research into 19th-century New York showed greater panic over crime in 1810 to 1830 and again between 1860 to 1880 than today. ''People wouldn't think of going out after dark without a weapon,'' he said.
James Richardson, in his police history, reported that between 1814 and 1834 the city's population little more than doubled while the number of complaints at the police courts quadrupled to 8,719. The next year, they jumped to 10,168.
In 1845, New York became the first American city to found a police department, modeled after London's.
In one night in November 1857, a contemporary account marveled, six men were shot or stabbed in barroom brawls. Now, with New York's population about 20 times larger, that is an average night's death toll.
Arrests in 1862 far exceeded today's rate. As Herbert Asbury reported in his popular classic of 1927, ''The Gangs of New York,'' the police in 1862 arrested 82,072 people, or 1/10th of the city. Last year, 308,164 people, equal to about 1/20th of the population, were arrested.
In 1864, five police officers were killed. Last year five were also killed; a sixth died in a fall chasing a suspect.
No era was without its cries for more police protection. In 1876, there was one officer per 475 citizens. In 1986, the ratio had dropped to one per 540 citizens. Today it is one per 280.
Scholars are coming to view some of the city's patrimony of violence as exaggerated. ''Every time historians get there, deaths go down,'' said Mr. Wade.
Still, accounts based on contemporary sources portray a New York horrifying even by today's debased standards.
 
Images of Militiamen Firing Howitzers
The Old Brewery, a notorious tenement in the heart of Five Points in Lower Manhattan, may not have housed 1,000 debauched poor, or averaged a murder a night for nearly 15 years before its demolition in 1852, as popular accounts have it. But a story in the Asbury book about one of its denizens, a little girl who lived with 25 others in a small basement room and who was stabbed to death over a penny she had begged, undoubtedly captured the tenor of the times: ''The body lay in a corner for five days before it was finally buried in a shallow grave dug in the floor by the child's mother.''
Similarly, the draft riots of 1863, in which Irish mobs turned on blacks and the police and sacked sections of the city, have been reinvestigated. And historians put the death toll at about 100, far below the hundreds or even thousand or more of early accounts. Yet even crime-hardened New Yorkers can only quail at the images of rioters cutting pieces from the bodies of lynched blacks amid pitched battles with police and militiamen firing howitzers.
Beginning in the 1830's, gangs such as the Plug Uglies, Dead Rabbits and Bowery B'hoys prowled the Five Points and Bowery and later Hell's Kitchen and other districts, thieving, brawling and murdering, undeterred by outnumbered and dismally untrained forces of the law.
For most of the 19th century and into the 20th, the police were abysmally corrupt and brutal, as exemplified by Captain, later Inspector, Alexander (Clubber) Williams, who starting in the 1870's grafted his way to a $300,000 fortune, a Connecticut estate and a steam yacht he attributed to speculation in Japanese building lots. Although he was brought up on charges 358 times and fined 224 times, he was never dismissed. Today Williams is remembered for his dictum: ''There is more law in a policeman's nightstick than the Supreme Court.''
In comparing the violence of bygone New York and today, Joel Rose straddles both worlds. A writer who has immersed himself in the gang culture of the 1840's for his as yet unpublished novel, he lives in a crime-ridden section of the Lower East Side, near Tomkins Square Park.
Mr. Rose says he looks back almost with nostalgia on the last century when thugs ruled his streets with brickbats and cobblestones, and more recently, when heroin addicts lined up peacefully for fixes. Now crack addicts are everywhere, jumpy, heavily armed and vicious. Last month, a crackhead he tried to befriend broke his hand with a lead pipe.
In the 1840's, he said, ''The city had newness and brightness, at least there was hope for a better life. Now I can't see any hope.''

CORRECTION-DATE: September 2, 1990, Sunday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about crime waves in New York misstated the year in which the ratio of police officers to citizens dropped to 1 per 540. The year was 1896, not 1986.

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
Cuomo's Green Period

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has been campaigning vigorously across the state. He has political advertisements on the radio. He has spent $300,000 on television commercials, just in August. ''The choice is very clear,'' he says solemnly, staring into the lens.
The choice Mr. Cuomo refers to is not the one between him and Pierre A. Rinfret, the Republican candidate in the Nov. 6 gubernatorial election. It is whether to approve a referendum on the 21st Century Environmental Quality Bond Act, a $1.975 billion measure that Mr. Cuomo contends will ''help make New York's future clean and green.'' 
Mr. Cuomo has campaigned aggressively for bond issues before, but rarely this early before Election Day. While no one questions Mr. Cuomo's sincerity in promoting the bond act, his political opponents believe the timing of his advertising blitz has as much to do with his own political condition as it does with the bond issue.
As a political issue, the environment is hot. As a political candidate, Mr. Cuomo is not, or at least not as sizzling as in past years. As the bond act's most visible spokesman, the Governor can expect to reap the benefits that accrue to politicians who wrap themselves in popular issues.
''I certainly hope so,'' Mr. Cuomo said in an interview. ''Adlai Stevenson said it: the best politics is good government.''
Environmentalists see the tactic somewhat differently. ''He's trying to attach himself to environmental protection, which is an area that people are very concerned about and an area where he has been weak,'' said Larry Shapiro of the New York Public Interest Research Group.
 
The Politics of Planting Trees
Mr. Shapiro and other environmental advocates commend Mr. Cuomo for helping to close the Shoreham nuclear plant, for proposing legislation to reduce acid rain and for backing a $1.45 billion environmental bond act in 1986. But they criticize his administration for permitting the licensing of garbage incinerators, for being slow to finance toxic-waste cleanups and for not declaring a moratorium on development in the Adirondacks, as recommended by a gubernatorial commission.
As Mr. Cuomo runs for his third four-year term, numerous private opinion polls indicate that his approval ratings have dropped. He faces the inevitable antagonism aimed at an incumbent who has been in office for eight years. The state's economy is sliding perilously close to recession. And this year's excruciating budget negotiations ended with the passage of a record $1.4 billion in new taxes.
The Governor is expected to have little trouble disposing of Mr. Rinfret, a largely unknown candidate who has disappointed even the leaders of his own party. But the strength of Mr. Cuomo's showing in November is important to his political future, both to his ability to govern New York and to his status as a potential Presidential candidate in 1992.
Mr. Cuomo has done little to suggest he is planning a race for the White House. But should he run, it would not hurt him to be able to boast of ushering in a bond issue that would dedicate a record amount of money to land acquisition, solid waste management and water quality improvement, among other purposes.
Since mid-June, Mr. Cuomo has made appearances on the measure's behalf in 19 cities, most of them in upstate New York where support for bond issues has usually been weakest.
At 10 of the events he has planted sugar maple saplings, the state tree.
The Governor also has spent his own campaign funds on the television commercial, which features pictures of billowing smokestacks, slimy seas and overflowing landfills.
Mr. Cuomo has declined to use any of his nearly $8 million war chest to help Democratic candidates for the State Senate, saying the funds were not contributed to him for that purpose. His aides said that principle does not apply to spending the money for the bond act commercials because Mr. Cuomo may benefit politically from the ads and because the bond act is crucial to his agenda.
Republicans maintain that the Governor is trying to divert attention from more damaging issues.
''If you had his record on taxes, spending and crime you would want to plant trees too,'' said Assemblyman John A. Faso, Mr. Rinfret's campaign manager.
Mr. Cuomo said he deliberately started the advertising campaign for the bond act early to give voters time to understand its import and to separate it from the noisy clutter of the fall campaign.
He said he also was motivated by fears that the state's financial problems could influence people to vote against the bond act. In the next fiscal year, the bond act would add an estimated $28 million to the state's debt-service payments, a figure that would escalate to $201 million 10 years from now before gradually decreasing.
''Some people, I believe mistakenly, regard the difficulty of these times fiscally and economically as being the reason to vote against the bond issue,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''I see it as a good reason to vote for the bond issue. Making that case takes an awful lot of argumentation and discussion.''

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
Know Your Allies

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
Americans have a pretty clear idea why the United States is fighting in the Arab Middle East, what rings true and what clunks like a counterfeit coin.
But when it comes to understanding our new Arab allies, who are supposed to help the United States, we are being fed a lot of political and journalistic hogwash. If we swallow it, the Middle East will wind up a more dangerous place than ever for us all.
Any politically literate American knows we are not fighting for democracy because there is none in the Arab world. We are not fighting for the right of the Kuwaiti royal family because no American would be fool enough to risk his life so that it can go on running the place like a private oil plantation. 
The crack that we are fighting for a few cents on the gallon is a cruelly undeserved accusation that President Bush is willing to sacrifice American lives for a buck.
No, the U.S. moved into war position to stop a psychopathically ruthless killer from controlling a resource that is basic food to industry and can mean the difference between economic life and death. It would have been suicide to do otherwise, the worst crime a free government can commit against its people.
But the new ''allies'' of the U.S. are being treated by Government and press with an unctuous tenderness that is not comical only because it is dangerous.
But almost everything Americans detest and have fought is not only alive but dominant in the Arab world.
Morally it is impossible to distinguish Hussein of Iraq from Assad of Syria. Like Saddam Hussein, Assad has slaughtered his own citizens by the tens of thousands. Like him, he has invaded and occupied a brotherly neighbor - Lebanon. He too is a terrorist leader specializing in killing Americans - remember Pan Am 103?
And like Hussein, he knows the value of hostages to any marauding tyranny.
The other Arab Governments are not quite as terrifying - except to their people, if we still care. In Saudi Arabia political prisoners are arrested without warrant, held indefinitely, tortured routinely. At the next of those elegant Saudi Embassy parties in Washington, some of the guests should bring along the latest Amnesty International report on Saudi Arabia.
Human rights reports from Egypt also are chilling. Political prisoners are subject to electric shock, cigarette burns, rape and sticks inserted in the anus.
All the Arab allies are indeed unified - by common governmental detestation of free speech, press, assembly or elections.
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait poured billions into Saddam Hussein's war treasury before he double-crossed them, and will again if he just lays off them a little. They would be happy to see him turn his attention from their oil derricks to the cities of another Middle Eastern nation, Israel.
Obvious questions: Should Mr. Bush reject help from any country in the fight against Hussein? And, be realistic, can he be expected to talk now about things like torture, Middle East fascism and religious hatred, and the planned extinction of Israel? Answer: Yes to both.
The Arabs joined the struggle against Hussein because he unexpectedly went for their throats. They knew this was their last chance to get the U.S. to rescue them.
Fine - but the U.S. would have strengthened its cause and helped its citizens if it had told Mr. Assad we did not want his flag or token detachments as long as he permitted terrorists to chain Americans to the wall in territory under his jurisdiction. And we can still tell our Arab allies we expect them to give their people a taste of something called human rights.
Already the Arabs are preparing a bill to the U.S. for saving their hides. If Saddam Hussein falls, or if he decides to pull out of any part of Kuwait, the Arabs will demand that the U.S. pressure Israel to leave the West Bank.
A ludicrous, hypocritical quid pro quo. Kuwaitis did not use their territory as Palestinians and other Arabs use the West Bank - a center for infiltration and terrorism and a base for the eventual extermination of the enemy. All Kuwait and the other oil states wanted was to be allowed to give Hussein billions to go fight somebody else.
The Arab coalition is of use now. But it could turn out to be a fatal pressure front, a prelude to a devastating war in the Middle East against Israel. Unlike the Kuwaiti princelings, the Israelis will not helicopter out.
In World War II there was a poster: ''Know your enemy.'' It might not be a bad idea to print up a new one: ''Know your ally.''

HEADLINE: A Week of Tension in the Gulf

 BODY:
Sunday, Aug. 19 - President Saddam Hussein of Iraq says foreigners in Iraq and Kuwait must remain until the United States withdraws from the gulf. Many are transferred to potential targets. American warships decline to use force to stop Iraqi tankers pending United Nations approval of such action. 
Monday - President Bush, shuttling between his vacation in Maine and Washington, uses the word ''hostages'' for the first time to describe the detained foreigners. Iraq says embassies in Kuwait must close by Friday or the diplomats will lose immunity and face arrest. Oil prices, which had risen for a week, fall slightly on Saudi Arabia's promise to increase oil production by two million barrels a day.
Tuesday - Iraqis force one American and eight Britons from their homes in Kuwait. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt issues an appeal to Mr. Hussein to pull out of Kuwait. Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain agree to send warships to the growing international force in the Persian Gulf.
Wednesday - President Bush authorizes the use of as many as 50,000 military reservists and says the American Embassy in Kuwait will defy Iraqi orders to close. Japan offers billions in financial aid to Mideast nations hurt by the boycott of Iraq. King Hussein of Jordan says he will travel among Arab nations to seek a diplomatic solution. He orders Jordan's borders closed to the refugees from Iraq.
Thursday - Saddam Hussein appears on Iraqi television with a group of Western hostages, who appear uncomfortable as the Iraqi President explains that they are ''heroes of peace.'' Iraq says any attempt to keep embassies in Kuwait open after a Friday deadline will be taken as an ''act of aggression.'' Most nations say they'll stand pat but evacuate most of their staffs. Jordan, unable to stop the refugees, reopens its borders.
Friday - Iraqi troops surround embassies in Kuwait, including the American Embassy. Diplomats and their families evacuated to Baghdad from Kuwait are not allowed to leave, despite Iraq's promise. Moscow warns Baghdad to pull out of Kuwait and release foreign nationals, and agrees to support the United Nations resolution backing force.
Saturday - The United Nations Security Council, including the Soviet Union, approves the use of force to support the military and economic blockade of Iraq. Mr. Hussein meets with President Kurt Waldheim of Austria, and Mr. Waldheim leaves Baghdad with 80 Austrians.

Sea Theme In Disney Plan For Long Beach
The Walt Disney Company's master plan for a 350-acre oceanside resort and theme park in Long Beach, Calif., boasts everything from the world's largest aquarium to underwater steel cages where tourists can swim with sharks.
The $2 billion project, to be called Port Disney, is the first of two competing plans by the Disney organization for another theme park in Southern California. The second proposal, details of which will be disclosed next year, would add a new attraction near Disneyland, in Anaheim, that would be similar to the Epcot Center in Florida.
The company will decide on the site after studying the attitude of residents and local governments in the two communities. If Port Disney is chosen over the Anaheim project, it would not open for at least 10 years, company officials said, citing the necessary public hearings, environmental impact studies and building permits. The centerpiece of the Port Disney project is DisneySea, a theme park of rides and attractions, revolving around Oceana, a futuristic bubble-shaped complex, and a marine research center. 
Other attractions will include five resort hotels; boats for rental, excursions, shows and dining; 400 new marina slips, and a cruise ship terminal to be operated by the Port of Long Beach. Land shuttles, water ferries and a monorail will link the north and south shores of Queensway Bay in downtown Long Beach to the resort. Long Beach is about 20 miles west of Disneyland.
 
Curfew Still On In Trinidad
The attempted coup by armed radical Black Muslims in Port of Spain, Trinidad, July 27 has crippled tourism in Trinidad and Tobago. Calls by cruise ships have been canceled, airline service is limited and some hotels are empty. The Government has decided that the current state of emergency will continue until Nov. 10. The curfew, from 9 P.M. to 5 A.M., is expected to go on until mid-September.
Hotel reservations for the coming winter are relatively high, the Hotel and Tourism Association says, but cancellations may be heavy as the season approaches. Before the coup attempt, officials had been encouraged that visitor figures for the two islands showed increases for last year and for the first six months of this year.
Many hotels with few or no guests have laid off employees, which, the association points out, is aggravating the already serious unemployment situation. The country's unemployment figure is around 28 percent. Representatives of the association have been told by the Minister of Industry, Enterprise and Tourism, Dr. Bhoe Tewarie, that while tourism is probably the industry hit hardest by recent events, the Government feels that security remains the major priority.
However, government officials say they are eager to win back lost tourism and to encourage reservations for the high season starting in December. Members of the country's Tourism Development Authority have been in the United States this month visiting cruise lines in an attempt to convince them that the attempted coup was ''an aberration'' and that Trinidad and, particularly, Tobago are safe for visitors. In 1989 about 218,000 people visited the two islands, including 29,000 cruise passengers.
 
Kosher Guide, Meal Service
Jews who follow the dietary rules of kashrut need no longer scoop tuna fish from cans or go without cooked food when far from home and a kosher kitchen. The Kosher Club (82-84 Genung Street, Middletown, N.Y. 10940; 914-344-1933) can help members locate the nearest kosher restaurant in the United States or will ship kosher meals directly to a member's hotel.
''I started Kosher Club because I needed it,'' said the founder and president, Stephen Ostrow, a commercial photographer. ''I am kosher and I travel a lot. Last year we visited New Mexico - it's a great state, I loved it - but there was nothing kosher so we lived on tuna fish and boiled eggs.'' With his wife, Monica, and some friends, Mr. Ostrow compiled a guide to 800 kosher restaurants in the United States, Canada and Mexico, complete with descriptions and information on each restaurant's rabbinical certification.
Prepackaged meals shipped overnight in dry ice ''are not airline meals,'' said Mr. Ostrow, ''but they are produced by the same people who make airline meals. They're basically enhanced TV dinners.'' Prices range from $8.95 for a chicken dinner to $17.95 for ribeye steak. Customers also pay shipping costs, approximately $4 a meal. Both guide and meal service are available only to club members; a year's membership costs $49.95, with $5 added for spouses. Members also get a monthly newsletter on kosher restaurants and discounts at about one-third of the kosher restaurants.
 
Historic Homes Open for Tour
A number of Washington's historic homes will be opened to the public on Sunday, Sept. 16, for the sixth annual Kalorama House Tour, which this year will benefit the Woodrow Wilson House Museum, the capital's only Presidential museum.
President Wilson moved into the 1915 Georgian Revival townhouse on Inauguration Day, 1921, the day he left office. After his death in 1924 his widow, Edith, remained in the home, subsequently bequeathing it to the National Trust for Historic Preservation to preserve as a memorial to her husband.
In addition to the Woodrow Wilson House, nine private residences will go on view from noon until 5 P.M., including the 1906 red brick mansion known as the Codman-Davis House, and the Studio House of Edwin Lind Morse, a painter and author whose father was Samuel F. B. Morse, the inventor and artist.
The Sheridan-Kalorama area, known as Embassy Row, has been home to four Presidents as well as diplomats, statesmen, writers and artists.
The tour begins at the Wilson House Museum at 2340 S Street, N.W., where visitors receive a map detailing the architecture and history of each home. Light refreshments will be served. Tickets for $12 may be purchased in advance at the museum or by calling 202-387-4062. Same day tickets are $15.
 
BATTLE OF BRITAIN CELEBRATIONS
Fifty years ago this year the Battle of Britain was fought in the skies over England when fighter pilots of the Royal Air Force turned back the German Luftwaffe. A continuing series of events, from flying displays to exhibitions of 1940 fashions, culminates in London on Sept. 15 with a parade, a flyover and fireworks. A service commemorating the battle, one of the most decisive campaigns of World War II, will be held at Westminster Abbey the following day.
The centerpiece of the anniversary events is an exhibition, ''The Battle of Britain Experience,'' at the three R.A.F. museums in the north London district of Hendon through Oct. 31. One of the world's finest collections of R.A.F., Luftwaffe and Italian planes of World War II is on display, along with a copy of an operations room used during the battle.
Many towns in southeastern England, which bore the brunt of the German daylight attacks, are holding various events. Among them is Folkestone on the south coast, which has a festival from Sept. 8 to 16 that includes an air show, parades, tea dances and a Glenn Miller Band concert. The Kent Battle of Britain Museum in Hawkinge, site of a former front-line airfield south of London, has copies of wartime planes and artifacts of the battle. A six-hour flying display is scheduled Sept. 15 at the R.A.F. base at Abingdon, Oxfordshire, west of London. Information is available at the British Tourist Center on Lower Regent Street in London (730-3400) and at local tourist offices.

HEADLINE: Japan's Imperial Present

BYLINE: By Steven R. Weisman; Steven R. Weisman is chief of The Times's Tokyo bureau.

 BODY:
In the 22d day of November this year, if all goes according to plan, an enigmatic and lonely 56-year-old man who has lived almost all his life in the shadow of his father will leave his modest home for the grounds of the Imperial Palace in downtown Tokyo. At 6:30 P.M., Akihito will bathe, put on white ceremonial robes and enter a shrine in a wooded glade. He will eat boiled rice and millet and then commune alone with the spirit of his mythological ancestor, the sun goddess Amaterasu Omikami. Three hours before dawn, he will emerge spiritually transformed as the 125th Emperor of Japan.
Akihito has been Emperor since the death of his father, Hirohito, in January 1989. But he has had to wait until after a long mourning period for his enthronement, for a day decreed as sacred by the Taiho legal code adopted from China nearly 1,300 years ago. Although about a thousand prominent guests are spending the night in buildings near the simple thatched-roof shrine, they will not be allowed to observe this rite.
The ritual was last performed in 1928, when Hirohito ascended to the Chrysanthemum Throne. Now, just as the late Emperor served as a symbol of Japan's dark militarist past and then as a revered totem of its miraculous rebirth, many Japanese see Akihito as an incarnation of a new era. 
Cautious and self-effacing, the new Emperor has been preparing for this accession all his life. He has let it be known that he wants to be a constitutional monarch, one who brings the throne closer to the people. Since becoming Emperor, he has established an informal style, stooping, for example, to shake hands with children and the handicapped, in contrast to his father, who expected everyone to bow to him. He is also the first Emperor to marry a commoner - Empress Michiko has dazzled Japanese with her style and grace - and the first to raise his own children.
But Akihito's modest personal profile is something of a paradox. The public ceremonies that culminate in his ascension will be the most elaborate display of the Emperor's ancient role as a Shinto priest since the end of World War II. For many Japanese, the rites demonstrate the nation's willingness to put on center stage the imperial traditions long sidelined or muted.
Akihito is acutely aware of the ambivalent attitudes that the Japanese have toward him. Most regard the Emperor as irrelevant, but even more than the subjects of Queen Elizabeth, for example, they expect him to behave in an exemplary fashion and maintain the institution as a repository of culture and tradition.
Officially, the Emperor was stripped of his powers in the Japanese Constitution written by the United States after the war. In an age when belief in traditional Japanese institutions is being tested, the survival of the monarchy depends on the faith of the people. Akihito is aware that, with his series of pomp-filled accession events, the Japanese will be watching his efforts to revitalize ancient rituals, establish his own identity and somehow make himself relevant on the threshold of the 21st century.
''I think he's now trying to rebuild the authority of the Japanese imperial system,'' says Akira Hashimoto, general manager of Kyodo News Service and a former schoolmate. ''He is genuinely searching for his own way to be loved by the Japanese people.''
Thousands lined the rain-spattered streets of Nagasaki in southern Japan in May as Akihito smiled and waved from a black Nissan limousine with a gold chrysanthemum crest. Once, Japanese had to prostrate themselves before the Emperor, but on this day people were craning excitedly for a glimpse. ''Now I can live longer!'' an old woman exclaimed as the motorcade sped by.
At a city park dedicated to victims of the atomic bomb attack in 1945, the crowd gasped when the Emperor set aside his umbrella and bowed deeply before the memorial, a gesture of humility that his father would never have made. Later, in front of the Nagasaki government headquarters, a bearded man burst emotionally into the national anthem:
 
Rule on, my lord,
Until the pebbles
Grow to mighty rocks...
''Banzai!'' the crowd shouted three times. ''Ten thousand years!'' Akihito and Empress Michiko nodded, turning into the building for a meeting with the Mayor of Nagasaki, Hitoshi Motoshima, whose relationship with the imperial family is an unusual one.
In the last months of Hirohito's life, Motoshima dared to criticize the ailing Emperor openly, accusing him of being partly responsible for the disaster of World War II. The Mayor was then subjected to death threats and snubbed by Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Last January, in front of the city hall, a rightist shot Motoshima in the back.
The Japanese prize subtle gestures, and it was an extraordinary sign for Akihito to meet in this way with a critic of his late father. Motoshima, who has fully recovered from the wound, recalled afterward that the Emperor nodded appreciatively when he described his recovery and his still sleepless nights. ''I think he could understand what I said,'' the mayor told reporters. ''As a human being, I think this man is great.''
Indeed, Akihito seems determined to move past the painful debates that dogged Hirohito until the end of his life. But the new Emperor does so as heir to a history filled with contradictions.
Japan's postwar Constitution defines the Emperor simply as a ''symbol of the state and of the unity of the people.'' He thus presides at banquets, greets foreign dignitaries, signs official documents and undertakes other duties as a head of state who is not actually a head of state.
In a similar paradox, the Emperor is a religious leader who is not a religious leader. Like his predecessors, he functions as the chief priest of Shinto - worshiping his mythical ancestors and other gods of the Shinto pantheon - although since the war, his religious identity is no longer formally recognized by the state.
For most of recorded history, priestly chores were the main job of the Japanese tenno, or heavenly sovereign. Real power in Japan has almost always rested with a succession of warlords and rulers who manipulated the Emperor and kept him up front as a symbol of their legitimacy. Only after the coup of 1868, known as the Meiji Restoration, was the Emperor elevated to the status of ''sacred and inviolable'' head of state. By the 1930's, the new concepts of state Shinto religion and Emperor worship were used to justify Japan's brutal military aggression.
Today, less than 5 percent of Japanese say that they believe the Emperor is divine. About the same number want the Emperor system abolished. Most opinion surveys show Japanese to be benignly indifferent, leaving much of the bitter debate about the role of the monarch to rightist and leftist extremists.
Radical leftists occasionally fire homemade rockets at various imperial homes, for instance, and they recently firebombed several Shinto shrines to protest the coming rite. For their part, rightists no longer engage in widespread assassinations of the kind that opened the way for a military takeover in the 1930's, but Emperor worship and violence - as shown by the attack on the mayor of Nagasaki - are still practiced.
When I visited the National Patriots Conference, a prominent rightist group, at a drab office building in Tokyo, a handful of middle-aged men were bustling around, planning for the enthronement with a large calendar listing all the ceremonies leading up to it. ''Akihito is not just a monarch but a spiritual being,'' says Rikio Kishimoto, the conference director general. ''He is like a father, and the people are his children. He is like the sun, giving everything and not expecting anything in return. He should be above us.''
as a teen-ager, Akihito was once asked if he ever wished he could be an ordinary boy. ''I don't know,'' he replied. ''I've never been an ordinary boy.''
His birth in 1933 was a cause for joy because, after four daughters, Empress Nagako had begun to despair of producing a male heir. Following tradition, Akihito was separated from his parents at the age of 3 and brought up by attendants who so zealously cared for him that he later told friends he was scarcely permitted to walk up the stairs by himself.
By all accounts, Akihito's childhood was painfully lonely. Schoolmates were kept at a distance and even asked to refrain from talking about their trips to the zoo so as not to deepen his unhappiness. A friend once came into Akihito's darkened room in the evening and found him alone by his desk lamp, aimlessly killing moths.
At the height of the war, in 1944, when American B-29's were bombing Tokyo, Akihito moved to a coastal area south of the city, then to the mountains. The next year, he returned, shaken, to find his school and house destroyed, surrounded by a devastated shell of a city, and his schoolmates wondering about their future in the occupation. Gen. Douglas A. MacArthur, rejecting the advice of many, decided not to remove or punish Hirohito on the ground that the Emperor had been powerless to stop the war. MacArthur reasoned that maintaining the Emperor would promote Japanese unity and friendship.
The Americans decreed that it would be dangerous for the 12-year-old Akihito to be further isolated, as tradition required. He was thus educated through high school and college among friends from the old privileged classes. With the enthusiastic support of General MacArthur, the imperial family also decided to recruit an American schoolteacher to tutor Akihito in English and in American customs. The teacher, Elizabeth Gray Vining, a Philadelphia Quaker and pacifist, recalled later that she found a shy, sensitive and friendly boy, frequently bored with his schoolwork, whose chief outside interests were fish and horseback riding. ''Poor little boy!'' she wrote in her memoirs. ''I thought that he led a very dull and restricted life, and I longed to set him free.''
Classmates of Akihito say Mrs. Vining was a strong influence. ''She opened his eyes and helped to instill him with democratic and liberal values,'' one recalls.
Approaching adulthood, Akihito vowed to raise his own children without the restrictions he had experienced. As it happened, the Imperial Household Agency, which runs the daily lives of the royal family, favored strengthening the imperial bloodlines with a bride outside the old aristocacy. An extensive search culminated in 1957 with the choice of Michiko Shoda, the daughter of a prominent industrialist, a brilliant, athletic and attractive student at the University of the Sacred Heart in Tokyo. A meeting was arranged in a game of mixed doubles at a mountain resort, where Akihito was defeated in tennis but immediately fell in love.
The aristocracy was shocked at the selection of someone educated in a Catholic school, albeit an elite one. Michiko's family also opposed the marriage, fearing the burdens that would be placed on their daughter. Akihito persisted, persuading her with a heartfelt declaration of his desire for a family.
His stubborn streak flared in other ways. When his old schoolmate, Hashimoto, then a young reporter, wrote a story quoting the Crown Prince as saying he was in love, Akihito accosted his friend at a reception and shoved him out the door, shouting, ''I don't like you!'' They subsequently reconciled, but Hashimoto is one of several acquaintances who discovered the Emperor has a temper.
''Nothing gets him angrier than an invasion of his privacy,'' says another old friend. Nevertheless, the difficulties that Akihito and Michiko's marriage ran into in 1959 were widely reported.
Friends today confirm reports that the young couple sought without success to dismiss Michiko's chief lady-in-waiting, a member of the old aristocracy viewed by them as a spy for Akihito's mother, Empress Nagako, and others in the family. In a recently published memoir, a senior chamberlain recalls Michiko plaintively asking why her mother-in-law disliked her so.
Although not a Christian, Michiko was also suspected by members of the old nobility of indoctrinating her children with Bible stories. The Crown Princess found herself further criticized for wearing the wrong kinds of gloves and dresses, carrying her baby son openly in public, breast-feeding and cutting a more glamorous figure than others in the family.
The Japanese public became anxious as these pressures took their toll. Michiko lost weight and appeared gaunt, fatigued and depressed. In 1963, four years after the marriage, the Imperial Palace abruptly announced that the Crown Princess, suffering from ''great mental strain,'' was being hospitalized for an abortion of what would have been her second child. Michiko went into seclusion for four months, and a palace spokesman denied widespread reports that she had suffered a nervous breakdown.
Friends say Akihoto has stood by Michiko, who today is admired for her elegance and grace but who is still widely viewed as a shadow of her early vibrant self. As Empress, some associates say, she has come into her own at last, insisting that many domestic matters be done her way and that her two sons, at least, be free to study abroad (at Oxford) and marry when they want. Her three children are said to have independent streaks, and the 30-year-old Crown Prince, Naruhito, has already disappointed ultranationalists by defending the Constitution and denouncing the shooting of Mayor Motoshima of Nagasaki.
Insiders say Michiko, who at 55 is a year younger than her husband, has also lately sought a rapprochement with some family members, but that strains persist with Akihito's sisters and mother, Empress Nagako, who is 87 and ailing. Most members of the imperial family have their own charitable and ceremonial obligations and live much more quietly than, say, the British royal family.
But there is occasional gossip about imperial carryings-on. In 1982, Akihito's bearded young Oxford-educated cousin, Prince Tomohito Mikasa, created a small scandal by boycotting several ceremonial events and letting it be known that he wished to ''secede'' from the family. He later changed his mind. Under postwar Japanese rules, only male descendants of Emperor Hirohito and his siblings keep their official status and draw annual imperial stipends, including about $1.7 million shared by Akihito's immediate family and $1.5 million by 15 others.
Akihito and Michiko live in the secluded Togu Palace outside Tokyo amid the mossy overgrown forests of pines, birches and azaleas on the sprawling grounds of the Renaissance-style state guest house, the Akasaka Detached Palace, with their 21-year-old daughter, Nori. Naruhito, known as Hiro, and his younger brother, 24-year-old Prince Aya, who married earlier this year, do not live with their parents.
Akihito tries to break out of his shell by inviting acquaintances in for tea or for meals. ''He is the first Emperor in Japan's history to have friends, a huge asset his father never had,'' says Yoshinobu Tokugawa, a schoolmate and historian who is a descendant of the last shogun. But another friend adds that he is an essentially lonely man: ''There is a wall between the imperial family and us, so we never know his true feelings.''
As his father did, Akihito writes poetry on important occasions and studies fish at the marine biology laboratory at the Imperial Palace. A couple dozen of his papers have appeared in the Japanese Journal of Ichthyology, and he wrote several entries on tropical gobies in the book, ''Fish of the Japanese Archipelago.'' He commutes each day by limousine to the nearby Imperial Palace grounds, where a new palace is to be built for him, and he is seen in public a few times a week at dedications, concerts, exhibitions and the like.
Declaring that he attaches ''great importance'' to his private religious obligations, the Emperor also performs about 20 major religious ceremonies a year at the three shrines on the palace grounds in his capacity as chief priest of Shinto. Many rites are elaborate and grueling, like the one on New Year's Day when he gets up before dawn and prays alone for several hours in a cold, dark shrine. Friends say they are awed by his discipline at both public and private events. ''Sometimes I feel he's like a doll, not a human being,'' says Hiroshi Matsumoto, another former schoolmate.
The main constraints on Akihito's life are the all-powerful Imperial Household Agency and the requirement that he keep all of his opinions to himself. The agency, whose 1,100-odd employees are famous for a protectiveness toward the imperial family that cannot be breached by politicians or other outsiders, has never felt accountable to the public and has tried to control, even censor, news about the royal family by threatening to cut off access for uncooperative reporters and photographers. The Emperor has a personal staff of several chamberlains and a dozen Shinto ritualists, as well as an informal circle of a advisers that includes professors and former diplomats.
Some around Akihito worry that he is kept uninformed. One person describes him as taken aback recently when he was told about economic tensions with the United States. ''After the war, the chrysanthemum curtain was opened,'' says a former schoolmate. ''But the bureacratic curtain remains shut.''
Behind the scenes, however, associates say that unlike his father, Akihito bridles at being overly dictated to. They say he takes an active interest in what he is told to say on diplomatic occasions, demanding explanations or changes to reflect his feelings. ''He doesn't want to give the impression he's a puppet,'' an official says.
Moreover, Akihito has adopted an informal style, marked by his use of colloquial Japanese - his voice is reedy and he has a slight lisp - a startling contrast to the courtly locutions of his father. He has also cut his retinue of security police, food tasters and the officials required to see him off at airports and train stations, and directed that his motorcade stop at some traffic lights. ''I find it natural that the imperial family should not exist at a distance from the people,'' he said last year.
Emperors of Japan have long been politically manipulated. When Meiji was ''restored'' to power as Emperor in 1868, for instance, he was only 15 years old, with shoulder-length hair, blackened teeth, plucked eyebrows, a powdered face and the flowing robes of a priest. To send the world a message that Japan had a constitutional monarchy, the nation's new rulers dressed Meiji up in a Prussian military uniform and put him on a horse with a sword and a plumed hat.
Meiji's grandson, Emperor Hirohito, lost his military regalia after the war but became a familiar icon in his baggy suits and fedora. Akihito, 5 foot 5 and birdlike with a helmet of graying hair, wears sharply tailored suits and, at certain ceremonies, flowing pleated kimonos that are an example of what one scholar calls ''forced archaism'' - the adaptation of traditions to suggest continuity and majesty.
To maintain the luster of the imperial system, of course, Akihito must do more than wear a number of different uniforms. Surveys show that the overwhelming majority of Japanese have a favorable opinion of him, but that sentiment is not so intense as it was for his father, who was highly respected as the nation's last ''god king,'' even among those who did not believe in his divinity. Some intellectuals and leftists dismiss Akihito as ten-chan, or the ''little emp,'' and make jokes about his being henpecked.
A factor in Akihito's favor is the increasing pride the Japanese take in their traditions. ''When I was growing up, intellectuals and students were all criticizing Japanese culture, including the Emperor system,'' says Shin-ichi Nakazawa, a 39-year-old author of several books on Japanese society. ''Today everyone is fascinated by royalty. In all our magazines and newspapers, you cannot find one harsh word against the Emperor system.''
Or, as a recent youth magazine put it, the imperial family ''saves us from being only a nation of shopkeepers.''
What sort of Japan will emerge from such pride in its heritage? Will the old nationalism of earlier this century be replaced by a new techno-nationalism, or economic imperialism, or a new willingness to participate as a partner in international relations? Japan's friends and rivals will likely be watching Japanese public attitudes toward the imperial system for clues.
Japanese rightists want to restore imperial sovereignty over the Government and armed forces. Most of the more than 800 right-wing groups in Japan limit their activities to sending out sound trucks blaring patriotic music and speeches denouncing the left. Only about 50 groups, with a total of 22,000 members, are believed by the police to practice violence, mostly in mysterious connection with mobsters known as yakuza.
People around the Emperor say he resents being used by this small group of Emperor worshipers, especially the extremists. The rightists, in turn, are said to be less than happy with his stated support for the Japanese Constitution, calling him a ''closet pacifist'' and leftist tainted by Christian influence.
Akihito's opinion about such matters has never been stated explicitly but gleaned from reading between the lines of his statements, and from keeping track of such gestures as the visit to Nagasaki. ''The position of the Emperor is to perform his duties according to the Constitution,'' he once told reporters, ''and I believe I should refrain from making remarks involving arguments relating to the Constitution.''
But there is little doubt among the people who know the Emperor best about where he stands. ''He is very much a member of his generation, a very strong pacifist, a strong liberal and a believer in democracy,'' says Edwin O. Reischauer, the former United States Ambassador to Japan and a longtime acquaintance.
As evidence of Akihito's pacifism, for example, an insider at the palace recalled a conversation in which someone described nuclear weapons as a ''necessary evil,'' only to be lectured curtly by the Emperor about the devastation they cause.
In rare instances, what appear to be the Emperor's own misgivings about Japan's past have surfaced. Earlier this year, he went along with a strong apology to South Korea for Japan's 35-year subjugation of the Korean peninsula - a much stronger act of repentance than Hirohito ever made. Asked last year at a news conference about his country's record of military aggression, Akihito said, ''My heart aches when I think of the great many people at home and abroad who lost their lives or suffered pains in the last war.''
If anything, Akihito's well-known distrust of ultranationalists is seen as a kind of guarantee against their ever trying to overthrow the Government in his name. More troublesome politically, then, is not the right wing's embrace of the Emperor but the way his status is used and supported by the Liberal Democratic Party, which has controlled the Government since 1955 and has always faithfully served conservative and right-wing interests.
In recent years, the ruling party has turned increasingly to the right, moving to restore patriotism and traditional values in a way that has struck some as a reminder that Japan has yet to digest its past. For example, the ruling party supports the whitewashed versions in Japanese school textbooks of the World War II offensive against China, Korea and other victims of Japanese aggression. And many Asian leaders were shocked at the time of Hirohito's death when then Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita declared that it was up to future historians to decide whether Japan was the aggressor in the war.
Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who created a stir in 1987 when he visited a Tokyo shrine to Japanese military heroes of World War II, is a favorite of the right in Japan. But a longtime acquaintance of Akihito said that the Emperor had once expressed disapproval of him.
A year and a half ago, Japan went through what was called a period of self-restraint while Hirohito lay dying, with businesses canceling New Year's parties and stores forgoing holiday window displays. But some Japanese accused the Government of encouraging an atmosphere of coercion that led to such actions. Other critics claimed that the ruling party took a reactionary step toward establishing Shinto as a state religion by holding a Shinto funeral for the Emperor in front of foreign dignitaries, although behind a screen.
By far the most controversial action by the Liberal Democratic Party has been its decision to spend $15 million in public funds for the religious part of Akihito's enthronement. (A secular ritual is to occur on Nov. 12 with 2,500 people attending, including Vice President Dan Quayle, the Prince and Princess of Wales and many heads of state.) The dispute revolves around the quasi-religious ceremony on Nov. 22, when the Emperor engages in purification rites and spends the night alone, eating specially prepared rice, praying for a bountiful harvest and communing with the gods.
Critics say the ceremony - known as a daijosai, roughly translated as ''great food-offering festival'' - should be dispensed with because its traditional function was to create a living god. Some Shinto specialists claim there are secret parts of the ceremony in which the Emperor simulates sex with the sun goddess.
The Government denies these contentions, and Akihito's friends say he himself has no illusions about being a deity. But many people still see the entire ceremony - not to mention the public financing of it - as an affront to the Constitution. At the very least, critics say, it signifies the ruling party's embrace of conservative forces in Japan. Indeed, a senior adviser at the Imperial Palace acknowledged in an interview that the decision to make the daijosai a public event was influenced by ''the strong conservative politicians and lobbyists who pull the strings from behind the scenes in this Government.''
A group of lawyers has announced a lawsuit to block the ceremony, and leftists and Christian organizations are also lobbying against it. In a powerful plea, four presidents of Christian colleges warned that the ceremony would be seen ''as a movement toward a return to imperial divine sovereignty'' in Japan. After their statement, right-wingers fired bullets into the house of one college president.
Few people in Japan think there is even a slight chance of Japan returning to militarism, even with the nationalist leanings of its political leadership. But some worry that with its rising economic power, Japan could adopt a more nationalist, and perhaps confrontational, approach on trade and other issues. The Government dismisses the fears about Japanese arrogance and the establishment of a state religion as baseless, asserting that most Japanese see the daijosai as a mere harvest festival of thanksgiving. ''Even if the Government is spending money for the ceremony, it does not mean it is supporting religion,'' Nobuo Ishihara, deputy chief secretary of the Cabinet, told me. ''Besides, the majority of the Japanese people feel the Government should spend as much as needed for the ceremony.''
Although no one thinks the Emperor will be vested with real political power in the foreseeable future, some experts do not rule out such a possibility in another generation or two, if only to make him a real, rather than symbolic, head of state to guarantee stability, like some Western monarchs.
Akihito, like all monarchs, is being constantly challenged to adjust public obligations to private pressures. The Imperial Household Agency, for example, is stumbling now to find a bride for Crown Prince Naruhito, a search that insiders say is difficult because of the horror stories about the treatment of Empress Michiko. Popular magazines are having a field day publishing profiles of possible candidates, along with their supposed defects and assets. The search for an appropriate bride for the Crown Prince is vital to the survival of the imperial system, which can only renew itself through such events as the wedding last June of Aya, the younger son, to the popular Kiko Kawashima, the daughter of an economics professor.
Given the dark legacy of war, the Japanese Emperor is always likely to be shadowed by history in ways that the other monarchs of the world are not, but he also draws on Japan's unusual cultural affinities.
The long sense of their own uniqueness - a quality of the Japanese many outsiders find both seductive and dangerous - seems to rest on the tremendous sense of gratitude the Japanese feel toward their parents and ancestors. I know many people who in one breath say that the Emperor is irrelevant to their lives and that Akihito is not especially impressive, but in the next say that he reminds them of their amazingly strong bond to history and their distinctive character.
Perhaps the mystery was summed up best when I was watching the Emperor create an undeniable emotional effect on crowds in Nagasaki.
''From his face, you can see that the Emperor loves peace,'' says Hideoki Ogawa, a 44-year-old electrician. ''He represents something precious but fragile, the fact that our blood has continued for 2,000 years in this one man, that we are Japanese and this is our homeland. If we deny him, we deny ourselves.''

HEADLINE: Men's Style;
A STORE IS BORN

BYLINE: BY RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
You don't have to be a romantic to sell men's clothing in Manhattan. But it helps. Consider Alan Flusser, whose recently opened Wall Street-area tailor shop is a florid evocation of old England. There are trellis-patterned carpets, chintz-covered chairs and an old-fashioned sofa in which customers can wallow as they ponder the distinction between a chalk and a pin stripe.
Or take Ermenegildo Zegna. When this scion of the family-owned Italian men's-wear business opened his first American store in July, he chose as its site a regal town house on Fifth Avenue. ''We wanted the store to look residential,'' says Randall Iserman, Zegna's manager. Clients can sip San Pellegrino and try on suits amid overstuffed furniture and walnut cabinetry. 
But retailing's ultimate romantic may well be Ira Neimark, Bergdorf Goodman's dapper chairman, a man with a very particular vision. Bergdorf Goodman Men, which opens this week at 745 Fifth Avenue, just across the street from its long-established sister, is a sumptuously appointed amalgam of shop, men's club and Old World hotel.
Not just any Old World hotel. Neimark has carefully tutored the store's designers, retail-space specialists James and Christine Nakaoka, in the distinction between garishness and graciousness. It is the difference, he likes to point out, between certain Paris hotels, where the clatter of heels on marble floors heralds one's arrival, and those where every footfall is absorbed by spongy carpeting.
Working with Angela Patterson, Bergdorf's vice president and director of store design, the California-based design team seemed to anticipate Neimark's subtlest whims. For the most part, they dispensed with mahogany paneling - a design cliche in men's retailing - and substituted gray limousine-cloth walls, vaulted ceilings and woodwork that varies in hue from ash to eggplant. The results - simultaneously soothing and intimidating - echo the main store's most distinctive features.
''We tried to create a mood of height and hush,'' says James Nakaoka - no negligible feat in a store with only three floors and 40,000 square feet of selling space. The centerpiece is a two-story rotunda, which lends Bergdorf's men's store its grandeur and defines its spirit as eminently classical.
This suits Neimark perfectly. ''We are not just expanding,'' he declares. ''We are adding a major traditional business.'' Indeed, Bergorf's men's-wear business, once perceived by some industry experts as catering chiefly to an avant-garde clientele, has now widened its reach. Cutting-edge designers like Giorgio Armani, Gianfranco Ferre, Dolce & Gabbana, Luciano Barbera and Dries van Noten have been assigned to the new store's top floor. In true haberdasher's style, the main-floor rotunda and surrounding alcoves house accessories by prestigious traditional makers like Charvet, W. H. Giddin, Ferragamo, Hermes and Chanel. Turnbull & Asser, the venerable London shirtmaker, has moved from its old nesting place in Bergdorf's main store to its two-story, Edwardian-flavored headquarters at Bergdorf Goodman Men. The rest of the store has been subdivided into individual showcases for suits, coats and sportswear by Ralph Lauren, Alan Flusser, Willis & Geiger, Etro and others who tread the fine line between fashion and tradition.
Custom clothing represents a minor portion of what Neimark projects will be a $40 million business. The store also carries top-quality handmade suits from Oxxford, St. Andrews and such relatively unsung makers as Kiton. A cashmere Kiton suit carries a $2,000 price tag - high, but not scandalously so in a store where a $650 suit is a bargain.
For this, Neimark makes no apology. The men's store, a monument to opulence, is, as he is fond of saying, ''geared to those people who go to the best hotels, the best restaurants, the best clubs and the best resorts.'' Amenities proliferate, some practical, some shamelessly pretentious. The store maintains a shoeshine parlor, 20 cordless telephones, a clothing repair service and a barber shop, and it will open its doors at 8 A.M. if a customer requests it.
Bergdorf Goodman Men also boasts its own concierge, but retailing old-timers are not impressed. ''Every guy that works for me is a concierge, a personal shopper,'' insists Murray Pearlstein, the president of Louis, Boston, on East 57th Street, one of Bergdorf's chief competitors. Clifford Grodd, the president of Paul Stuart, points out that his Madison Avenue store always opens its doors at 8 A.M. ''That's our shoeshine,'' he says. ''The idea that you can charge anything in your store, as long as you package it well, doesn't work anymore,'' he adds ominously. Still, retailing experts acknowledge that as more stores compete for upscale customers, men's retailing will inevitably become a ritual of seduction. Like the decor, which customarily includes well-worn Oriental rugs, brass fixtures and, in Bergdorf's case, waxy marble fireplaces, the service level at these stores tends to emulate that of an old-fashioned gentleman's outfitter. Alan Flusser, who pioneered the concept of the men's store as an exclusive club in New York, believes in the intuitive sell. To Flusser, the ideal salesman has been educated to look a man over, speak to him briefly without mentioning clothes and, based on this fleeting encounter, pick out the perfect swatch or suit.
There's a lot to be said for such cosseting, maintains Kurt Barnard, the publisher of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report. He points out that even in today's uncertain economy, there are more men willing and able to buy a $1,500 suit than there were 10 years ago. ''They want to be elegant, and they want to be catered to,'' he says.
All this bodes well for the luxury retailer - and for Bergdorf Goodman in particular. William J. Flatley, a retail analyst with the consulting firm Kurt Salmon Associates, which monitors the apparel industry, maintains that although suit prices have jumped in recent years, the man being wooed by Bergdorf's won't feel the pinch. ''Clothing is an integral part of his personality and life style,'' Flatley says. ''He doesn't settle for second best. He's looking for design leaders and trend setters. And he's willing to pay for that.''
And to be entertained in the process. Bergdorf's identifies its customer as one who views dressing well as something akin to a moral obligation, yet wants to look conspicuously relaxed in the act of consumption. Perhaps that's why Neimark furnished Bergdorf's pro shop with a putting green, where customers can practice between dressing-room visits. ''I was always impressed with the kind of man who plays golf,'' Neimark explains, recalling his first visits in the 1940's to Westchester's exclusive golf clubs. ''As we used to say in those days, 'He is diligent to his family, diligent to his God and diligent to his game.' ''

ON THE LAW OF NATIONS
By Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
211 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
Harvard University Press.

Once I'd made up my mind about ''On the Law of Nations,'' an elegant and persuasive history-cum-argument about international law, I decided to break an international law of book reviewing, the one that says the reviewer must keep his distance from the author at all times. With the Persian Gulf about to go haywire, I called Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York to ask how the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait fit into his thoughts. This was Monday, Aug. 6, the day after the Foreign Minister of Iraq's proxy government in Kuwait responded to the growing world outrage by warning that ''these countries should . . . not expect us to act honorably at a time when they are conspiring against us and other brothers in Iraq in an aggressive way.'' It was also the day after President Bush vowed: ''This will not stand. This will not stand, this aggression against Kuwait.'' 
By the end of that Monday, the United Nations Security Council would have voted military and economic sanctions against Iraq, presenting the rare and satisfying televised sight of the United States and the Soviet Union joined against an enemy in common. By Wednesday, America would be sending troops to protect Saudi Arabia, and Iraq would announce the annexation of Kuwait. By Friday, the Arab states would have met in Cairo to tell Iraq to get out of Kuwait and to vote to send combined Arab forces to join Western forces.
Before most of this happened, Senator Moynihan said: ''Know what I'd do? First, cut off the pipelines. Second, stop all imports of food. Iraq is the largest importer of U.S. rice, you know. Third, ask the Saudis if they are prepared to call for a collective response. Fourth, use military force but sparingly, in a naval blockade. We can influence the world through the U.N. If there were ever a time to use international law, here it is.''
As for President Bush's appeal for international law, made at Aspen, Colo., the week before, Senator Moynihan approved wholeheartedly, adding, ''I'm glad he's heard of it.''
Since many more people have heard of international law than know what it is, here's one definition, from David Scheffer, an international lawyer and senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington: ''International law is the body of binding rules of conduct among nations, expressed in treaties, in consistent and established behavior by nations, in the writings of distinguished scholars and in the rulings of judicial bodies.'' A sort of floating court, but a real one.
The Senator's responses to my questions, including his poke at the President, were what one would expect of the author of ''On the Law of Nations.'' Senator Moynihan demonstrates convincingly that since the 18th century, American leaders and thinkers have honored the ideals of international law, conduct to the contrary notwithstanding. In the modern Presidential era, however, even the pretense of reverence has been dropped. ''What happened?'' asks Senator Moynihan. ''How did a subject once so central to our thinking about world affairs become seemingly so peripheral?'' The paradox he explores, and regrets, is that after Woodrow Wilson ''governments became legitimate only as they could show that they were democratic,'' yet once the world did grow more democratic, international law lost its urgency and attractiveness.
His history creates his thesis: ''The United States is moving away from its long-established concern for and advocacy of international legal norms of state behavior.'' His thesis creates his argument: adherence to international law is the way to insure safe, civilized and intellectually proper behavior as we approach the next century. I add ''intellectually proper'' because one hears a sardonic, righteous anger in the book's voice, which, like the Senator's public-speaking voice, has the tentative assertiveness of the impassioned professor who suspects no one's listening.
Between the lines, Senator Moynihan is clearly fuming that an idea as morally impeccable as international law is routinely regarded as disposable and naive. His book is not only a forceful elucidation of the subject; it is a cri de tete of a man who often sees things more accurately than others, while others snigger at his frustrations or hurl impertinent accusations.
So it was in 1965 when Mr. Moynihan wrote in his report on the disintegration of the black American family, ''The children of our slums are being savagely cheated by a society which thinks it is too sophisticated to care about whether children have fathers and mothers have husbands.'' For that he was called racist. Before anyone else he (and his former Harvard colleague Nathan Glazer) understood how certain well-intentioned liberal social programs, such as busing, were hurting those they were invented to help. For that he was called reactionary. Small wonder the Senator always bears the dazed look of a sleepy baby. For his espousal of the principles of international law he will probably be called a mush-head - but not at the Iraqi moment, of course, not when the principles of international law are useful and convenient to the United States and much of the world community.
The whole argument over the efficacy of international law is in fact illuminated at moments like the Iraqi conflict. Why, say those who oppose the idea, should we accept international restraints when the other side won't abide by them? Mr. Moynihan quotes John Norton Moore writing in Foreign Affairs 10 years before the United States invasion of Grenada: ''International law is thought of as saying what cannot be done,'' that is, as an impediment to national security decisions. International law ''is an ass,'' wrote the columnist Charles Krauthammer in The New Republic, echoing Dickens's Mr. Bumble, because ''it cannot imagine the infinite capacity of nation-states for duplicity, mendacity and malice.''
Mr. Moynihan counters that one nation-state's malice is another's foreign policy, and law offers the best way to deal with the difference. He condemns as self-defeating and plain wrong the United States mining of the Nicaraguan harbors in March 1984, over which he resigned in protest from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, claiming the group was not consulted by the Reagan Administration. Similarly, he disapproves of the Grenada invasion and, most recently, of the assault on Panama and the arrest of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. Going to the trouble of amassing world opprobrium legally through the United Nations, he told me on the phone, may not give as much immediate ''pleasure as a weekend in Panama,'' but in the long run it works better for a stabilized world.
Unfortunately, one of the customs of international law forbids crossing a nation's borders to apprehend a criminal without the consent of his Government. That consent would have been a diplomatic feat in the case of General Noriega, who was his Government. One assumes Senator Moynihan would still stand by the principle.
Here's the anomaly, as well as the end point of his history lesson. Mr. Moynihan writes of those earlier American violations: ''As the United States became more committed to the advancement of democratic values in the world at large, it came more and more to do so by means of covert strategies. . . . This is not difficult to explain; it is difficult to defend. It costs too much, it achieves too little; and it gives power to presidents to do things that come to seem merely extralegal, rather than illegal. Not lawless, simply above the law. The intelligence community cannot help but make presidents feel this is what they are there for.''
The advancement of democratic values is the gut motive of this book. If the Senator appears a zealot for his cause (he has pushed it before, in a 1984 book, ''Loyalties,'' and recently in advocating that Lithuania's claims for independence be taken up by the World Court), it is because he believes that if America wants to show the rest of the world how to live, it must - as we are doing with Iraq - take advantage of the law at the same time it exercises its power.
He admires Presidents Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt, who, while frequently breaking the rules of international law themselves, nonetheless envisioned the world's eventual compliance. He admires considerably less President Ronald Reagan, who also broke international law but seemed to disdain it as a hindrance to beating up on evil empires wherever they were found, or were thought to be found - in freedom's name. Senator Moynihan may be suspending judgment on President Bush after Iraq. With dreams go responsibilities. The best way to promote democracy, implies the Senator, is to act lawfully.
That said, ''On the Law of Nations'' does not answer a question that the less expert among us find a lot more troubling than accepting Mr. Moynihan's argument. I have no difficulty understanding why it is good and right for the United States to confer with other nations and proceed through the United Nations Security Council before it moves against Iraq. I do have a problem understanding why the same moral recourse to international standards is not applied to situations such as Pol Pot's Cambodia or to the murderous civil war in Liberia this summer.
Why do we leap so furiously into the fray when money is at issue, as it is in Kuwait, and not when the matter is human life? A little irony of the Liberian situation is that while international law recognizes the right to rescue a few stranded internationals caught in the slaughterhouse, as we did in Monrovia, it does not recognize the right to stop the interior slaughter.
International lawyers see a logical collision between the principle of humanitarian intervention and the inviolability of national borders. The Nuremberg trials may have established the right to act against international criminals, but the world never used the Nuremberg precedent to create an international criminal court. It is hard to imagine nations signing a pact permitting external intervention - the United States certainly would not allow any world body to interfere with the prerogatives of Congress and the supreme law of the Constitution. Still, the question, when it arises, is urgent: will international law find an acceptable rationale to protect human rights when the lives of millions are at stake?
Mr. Bumble called the law ''a ass.'' Dr. Johnson called it ''the last result of human wisdom acting upon human experience for the benefit of the public.'' Senator Moynihan sides with Dr. Johnson. To the Senator the emphasis on Dr. Johnson's definition ought to be on ''last,'' since in the end Mr. Moynihan is calling for patience on the part of power, the exertion of wisdom over frustration. Not that such conduct on our part will ever rid the world of scoundrels. But it will make it easier to tell them from us.

BLACK IN SELMA
The Uncommon Life of J. L. Chestnut Jr.
By J. L. Chestnut Jr. and Julia Cass.
Illustrated. 432 pp. New York:
Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $22.95.
In the landmark towns of the movement, civil rights history is being rewritten. Unsung local heroes in Montgomery, Birmingham and Selma - where the bloody marches of 1965 inspired the Federal Voting Rights Act - have abandoned the heraldic story of Martin Luther King Jr. for the equally extraordinary day-in-and-day-out record of hometown life. The autobiography of J. L. Chestnut Jr., now 60 years old (a year younger than Dr. King would have been), is the story of Selma's first black lawyer and prodigal son, but it is also part of the history of the race, sweeping biblically from enslavement by segregation to freedom to the ambiguous aftermath of redemption. 
Mr. Chestnut grew up as a saxophone-playing cardsharp son of Alabama's schizoid black middle class. Branded early as a radical ''race man,'' in high school he wrote a paper slamming Selma's most powerful black, a shiny-suited Baptist minister, as a lackey of the white establishment. Coming home from Howard University Law School in the segregationist gloom of the late 1950's, Mr. Chestnut was like a rogue elephant in eerily placid Selma, where no one found it weird that a local black sleeping car porter returning from an out-of-town run had to check and see if a police car was parked in front of his house and then kill time till the white cop concluded his social call inside.
The first third of ''Black in Selma'' is a wicked, anecdotal diagnosis of segregation's sadomasochistic pathology. As the paradoxical ''nigger lawyer,'' Mr. Chestnut was in a privileged position to see into the souls of white folk, notably the soon-to-be-legendary, cattle-prod-happy Sheriff Jim Clark and his fabulously warped, blue-blooded handler, Circuit Judge James Hare. An amateur student of African history, Judge Hare lamented to Mr. Chestnut - whom he cordially considered a fellow, if lesser, intellectual - that Selma's blacks were descended from the most ''backward'' of the jungle tribes, the Ibos and the Congolese. When Mr. Chestnut laughed during one of his speeches on the telltale color of the gums or jut of the heel, Judge Hare pouted: ''Nothing is sacred to you, James.'' (J.L., not James, is Mr. Chestnut's given name, his father, J.L. Sr., having been named after a white banker his mother admired.) Mr. Chestnut's portrait of the sacred local customs would seem to be building inevitably to black Selma's rendezvous with destiny and Sheriff Clark's mounted posse on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. But ironically the narrative loses some of its authority at what ought to be its peak, the ''Bloody Sunday'' assaults on voting rights demonstrators at the bridge and the ensuing march to Montgomery. At the time, Mr. Chestnut tells us, he was hostage to a whisky habit, to the point of voluntarily sleeping off his benders at the city jail and then hollering about his constitutional rights the morning after. More significant, perhaps, he was on the wrong side of a major strategic split in the evolution of the movement. As a lawyer, and partisan of the N.A.A.C.P.'s glacial tactics of battling injustice in the courts, he only passively supported the massive civil disobedience pioneered by Dr. King - whose treatment here is almost absurdly anticlimactic. (''In the meantime, up popped Martin Luther King, Jr.'') In this crucial middle section, Mr. Chestnut's co-author, Julia Cass, a reporter for The Philadelphia Inquirer, misses the opportunity to dramatize and globalize his story. She has done a worthy job of shaping his vivid raw material into a life that moves between autobiography and oral history, elegant prose and colloquial outburst. But Ms. Cass's journeymanlike introductions to the book's chronologically arranged sections refuse to capitalize on Selma's sublime place in the history of the movement - curious for a book trading on that connection. (''Black in Tuscaloosa'' would not quite do the trick.) So the fascinating Hare-Clark-Chestnut relationship, for example, never transcends insider tidbit to become historical revelation.
Mr. Chestnut went on the wagon in time to be a real player in the next phase of the movement: translating the right to vote into political power. After joining forces in the early 1970's with two committed young black Harvard Law graduates, Hank and Rose Sanders, he became one of Alabama's leading civil rights lawyers, shepherding rural blacks into elective office. The difficulties he faced, though they may not be glamorously tragic enough for the general reader, confirm Alabama's role as America's crucible for race relations. In Mr. Chestnut's view, one goal is to forge a working relationship between black political power and white economic power, yet he reminds us of the quotation from the 19th-century abolitionist Frederick Douglass: ''Power concedes nothing without a demand.''
In the continuing absence of black economic progress, can black leaders keep their constituents motivated without turning to demagogy? The diminishing returns of the longstanding protest over the dismissal this year of Selma's first black school superintendent imply a stalemate in the win-lose dynamic that has characterized past civil rights struggles. As the Mississippi gentleman poet William Alexander Percy said of Southern politics long ago, ''Nothing is so sad as defeat, except victory.''

HEADLINE: VIEWS OF SPORT;
A Fond Look at 'a Sport for Everyone'

BYLINE: By DAVID N. DINKINS; David N. Dinkins, the Mayor of New York City, is an avid tennis player.

 BODY:
MOST people who know me are aware of my fondness for the sport of tennis. I was first introduced to the game more than 40 years ago in Trenton by my good friend Dr. Bill Hayling.
Bill, who also has the distinction of having delivered my two children, taught me how to hold a tennis racquet properly, and from that moment on, I became a die-hard fan of the sport.
In those days, tennis wasn't a very popular sport among African-Americans. Tennis courts, after all, weren't very accessible to us at that time. There was also a perception that African-Americans couldn't excel in tennis. In convincing form, Althea Gibson dispelled that myth by winning the United States national amateur singles title and the Wimbledon championships in 1957 and 1958. 
Ten years later, in 1968, my good friend Arthur Ashe won the first United States Open singles title, and he went on to win Wimbledon in 1975. What made Arthur's Open victory so remarkable was that 1968 marked the first year that the Open allowed amateur players to compete against professionals.
At that time, Arthur was an amateur. Few people believed that amateurs had a realistic chance of beating the professionals. Arthur stunned the sports world and won the tournament. It was tennis's version of David versus Goliath.
It was also a momentous occasion for African-Americans everywhere. Arthur's victories sent message to millions of Americans that tennis was a sport for everyone. His victory caught the attention of many African-American youths, inspiring them to learn more about the sport.
In 1969, one year after his Open victory, Arthur came up with Charlie Pasarell, one of the top-ranked Puerto Rican players in the world, to form the National Junior Tennis League to introduce tennis to millions of inner-city youths.
As a result of their efforts and the efforts of others such as Skip Hartman, Jim O'Neill, Bill Davis, and Brother George Roth, who formed the New York Junior Tennis League in 1970, today more than 150,000 New York City schoolchildren, many of them members of minority groups, in 340 public elementary and middle schools are introduced to tennis each year. This success is attributable, in part, to the generous contribution of the United States Tennis Association, headed by David Markin.
In addition to the schools tennis program, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation provides free tennis programs each summer to more than 8,000 young people at 40 sites.
These programs teach our young people more than just tennis. They reinforce values such as discipline, courteousness, good sportsmanship, team spirit and responsibility. And they provide our young people with an alternative to the streets and allow them to release creative energy in a positive way.
And because many of these programs are held within our schools, they teach our children the importance of a good education and encourage them to stay in school.
Of course, these programs also teach inner-city youths, especially those who are members of minority groups, about the wonderful game of tennis. And they are proving themselves to be quick studies. The national junior rankings indicate that players from minority groups are emerging as a force to be reckoned with in the tennis world.
In fact, the top-ranked players in the under-age-14 category in the boys' and girls' divisions are African-American. And 4 of the top 10 juniors in the boys 14's category and 2 of the top 10 juniors in the girls 14's category are members of minority groups.
I am encouraged by these developments and look forward to seeing these youngsters display their talents on the professional scene and make their mark on the record books.
This week, the United States Open tennis championships will be held at the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, Queens. The Open has been a tremendous boon to New York City's economy, generating more than $100 million in revenues to our hotels, restaurants, shops and places of entertainment annually.
Moreover, the quality of its competitors and the 450,000 tennis fans it draws each summer from here and abroad reaffirm New York's status as a world capital. Millions of tennis fans will see one of the most thrilling competitions in sports history. More than 250 of the world's best players will compete in this international tournament.
This year, Open fans have one more reason to cheer. The Federal Aviation Administration has graciously agreed to alter its flight patterns. This means there will be less noise and fewer distractions during the tournament.
I am pleased that my administration was able to assist the United States Tennis Association on this sensitive but very important problem. I supported this because the Open and the U.S.T.A. are an integral part of New York City.
The tournament has been held in New York City for the last 60 years, and it has grown and prospered here. Our city has contributed a superb mass-transportation infrastructure to the tournament, offering railroads, subways, and bus service directly to a major stadium. We are also the sports, entertainment and media capital of the world, thus enabling tens of millions of people to view the games both here and abroad.
Moreover, New Yorkers have a rich history of involvement in making the Open tournament the finest in the world today. Many New York leaders have made enormous contributions to the tournament.
As Mayor, and as a dedicated fan of the game, I am committed to working with the U.S.T.A. to insure that the United States Open tournament remains in New York City and retains its status as the most prestigious and exciting sporting event in the world.

Prices Ebb at Tackle Auction

BYLINE: By Nelson Bryant

 BODY:
ANTIQUE fishing tackle and related paraphernalia, including fish decoys, continue to capture the fancy of collectors, but record-breaking prices are apparently a thing of the past, at least for the time being.
At the recent R. W. Oliver's summer auction in Kennebunk, Me., 1,028 auction lots fell only a few thousand dollars short of the presale low estimate of $488,000, but that was largely a result of the good showing made by gear in the middle-to-lower price ranges.
Big-ticket items, among them handcrafted split-bamboo trout rods, did not do as well as anticipated, and the 51 fish decoys in the auction went for 10 percent less than the presale estimate, averaging $850 each. (All prices mentioned in this article include a 10 percent buyer's premium.) Fish decoys, which are dangled through holes cut in ice on lake or river to lure larger predatory species within spearing range, had been fetching fancy prices over the last few years. That, plus the interest shown in them by those who attended this year's eight-week fish decoy exhibition at the Museum of American Folk Art in New York City, had led auction officials to anticipate more spirited bidding. 
There was, however continued lively interest in early Lake Chautaqua, N.Y., decoys. A nine-inch perch of that genre, the first item on the block, went for $4,125. It was in near-mint condition and was probably fashioned just after the Civil War. Eleven of the 21 New York State decoys went for more than $1,000 each.
As might be expected, fish decoys made by Oscar Peterson did well, with only one, which was damaged, being bought for less than $1,000. The highest price paid for a Peterson fish in the auction was $2,530. Peterson (1887-1951) grew up hunting and fishing on the Lower Peninsula of Michigan,and he spent more than half a century carving and painting decoys. He may have created more than 10,000 decoys in his lifetime, of which perhaps 2,000 are still in existence. His work is assessed in Ron Fritz's color-illustrated book, ''Michigan's Master Carver'' (Aardvark Publications Inc., 104 pages, hardcover, $60).
Aardvark has published other books on antique fish decoys and antique lures. Its address is P.O. Box 252, Boulder Junction, Wis. 54512. The telephone number is (715) 385-2862.
There were 287 reels in the auction. They averaged $608 each, exceeding the lower range of their presale estimates.
Fly reels and bait-casting reels are the reels that interest collectors the most. Some early spinning reels do appear in auctions, but they have not, as yet, been major items. Early versions of the spinning reels that are in use today didn't appear in this country until after World War II.
As was expected, fly reels did best, averaging $750 each. The top fly reel, for salmon, went for $7,150, making it the most expensive item in the auction. It was a Hardy ''Cascapedia,'' size 3/0, in near-perfect condition.
Only about 100 of these reels were made. They date to the 1930's. A Vom Hofe Model 360 ''Perfection'' fly reel, for trout, fetched $6,050, and 11 fly reels by the contemporary maker Stan Bogdan ranged from $990 to $1,870. Bogdan, who lives in Nashua, N.H., is often in the strange situation of seeing his reels auctioned off at twice, thrice, or more, than he charged for them.
The highest-priced bait-casting reel in the Oliver auction was a J. F. & B. F. Meek that went for $5,500.
Lures also exceeded their presale low estimates, going for an average of about $180 each. The highest-priced lure was a 1916 Miller's Reversible Minnow at $1,650.
The top fly rod was a profusely engraved H. L. Leonard eight-foot Hunt 50-4 Model that sold for $5,500. Even so, the catalogue estimate of its value was $6,000 to $7000, and the large selection - 53 in all -of Leonard rods in the sale ran, as a group, 15 percent below their presale low estimate.
In all, there were about 200 rods in the auction, many more than in any previous Oliver's auction, and that may have contributed to the depressed bidding.
Offbeat angling items often appeal to collectors. As an example, the catalogue value of an Ideal Float & Tackle Company salesman's sample case containing lines, sinkers and bobbers was set at $275 to $375. It went for $1,320.
Until a year or so ago, record prices for rods, reels and lures were commonplace at auctions. In assessing the results of the Oliver's auction, Bob Lang, the company's tackle consultant, said the trend had been broken. He said this might be a ''result of a worsening economic environment and maturing collections.''
Oliver's conducts the only major fishing-tackle auctions in the country, having begun them in 1985. Serious collector interest in antique tackle began about 20 years ago. The company's next major tackle auction will be its annual ''High Rollers'' affair in February, held in conjunction with Ben Clark's Northeast Antique Angler's Show.

HEADLINE: College '90;
Headed in New Directions

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN

 BODY:
Back in those carefree days when we could count on the college football season starting some time after the beginning of the fall semester, when we could make our tailgating plans based on 1:30 kickoffs that had been chiseled in stone months before, and when we didn't need an announcement to know who would be in the Southwest Conference for the foreseeable future, even back then, there was this problem.
The problem was that unless we had spent four years of our lives in those quaint, romantic, leafy, hidden towns where many of these games are played, we often needed a map to find our way or we would wind up at a gas station, trying to remember directions to College Ave.
And now? Now that the college football landscape seems to undergo a fundamental change every other week, we need maps and directions just to get through a season. From the inaugural Disneyland Pigskin Classic between Tennessee and Colorado today at Anaheim, Calif., until the Army-Navy game Dec. 8, the 122d season can be expected to reflect the upheaval and uncertainty that preceded it.
Some obvious stops can be reached with simple directions. Major conference championships and nationalpoll implications could depend on the outcomes of games between Clemson and Virginia on Sept. 8, Tennessee and Auburn on Sept. 29, Colorado and Nebraska on Nov. 3, and Michigan and Illinois on Nov. 10. 
Texas and Oklahoma will struggle over their badly devalued bragging rights in Dallas on Oct. 13, if for no other reason than to provide an excuse for the mob that will insist on stumbling along Commerce St. the night before. That same afternoon, Penn State and Syracuse, which have met every year but one since 1922, will play for the final time in a series that became a victim of differing agendas.
But with the future of television deals uncertain, with underclassmen now free to leave when they decide the economic time is right, and with apparently imminent breaks in conference ties about to sever the emotional binds of decades, there may never have been so many questions:
Is the Arkansas outlook now directed toward the southwest, or the southeast? When Penn State joins the Big 10, how does one get from State College, Pa. to Iowa City? When will the Army-Navy game get a corporate sponsor? Does Notre Dame have enough money?
Since Southern Cal opens its season with Syracuse and Penn State, could the Trojans qualify for the Lambert Trophy as the outstanding team in the east? Is Traveler IV, the great, white Trojan horse, prepared for an appearance at East Rutherford, N.J.?
Do we really need 19 bowl games? And does anybody know how to get to College Ave.?
As we search for it, a road map though the season would include these stops along the way:
 
Sept. 8: A Ty For the Champions
The afternoon following Miami's Sugar Bowl victory last Jan. 1, just hours after the release of the news-service polls secured a third national championship in seven seasons, the date jumped off the Hurricane calendar: Sept. 8 - at Brigham Young.
For the third time, the Hurricanes would begin the defense of a championship with a high-profile game. (Miami defeated Auburn, with Bo Jackson, in 1984, and humiliated Florida State, with Deion Sanders, in 1988.) But most of all, the matchup provides a look at Brigham Young's Ty Detmer and Miami's Craig Erickson, the latest in parallel lines of outstanding passing quarterbacks at the two schools. Detmer's pass efficiency rating of 175.6 as a sophomore barely missed the National Collegiate Athletic Association record set by Jim McMahon of B.Y.U. in 1980.
 
Sept. 29: A Milestone for Tubby...
Not long before the start of his 25th season as the coach at Delaware, Tubby Raymond remembered his second season, a 2-7 year in 1967 during which someone mentioned something about winning 100 games. ''I said, 'A hundred wins? It'll take me 80 years to do that,' '' Raymond said. When the Blue Hens meet Rhode Island at Delaware Stadium on Sept. 29, a fourth straight victory would make Raymond the 21st coach, at any college level, with 200 victories, and the 12th to win that many at one school. ''I've always said I never won a game,'' he said. ''I never lost one, either. I'm along for the ride.''
The only imperfection in the coach's ride to No. 200, whenever it comes, is that his wife Sue will not be along. She died last April, after they had been married 38 years.
For 10 years, Sue Raymond taught English sign language at Delaware. She was 29 when she lost her hearing and made a discovery any coach's wife could understand. ''I could never appreciate how enjoyable a football game at Delaware Stadium could be until I lost my hearing,'' she once said. ''Now I can't hear the fans boo every week.''
 
Oct. 6: ... and Bowden, Too?
If Florida State is to produce the 200th victory of Bobby Bowden's 25-year career as a coach at Miami Oct. 6, the Seminoles will have to do it without Renegade. Renegade doesn't do road games.
Renegade III, an Appaloosa horse, will continue to create advantages in Tallahassee when he brings Chief Osceola to midfield to deposit a 10-foot flaming spear. His gallop last October, before the victory over Miami, seemed to be delayed when several Miami players appeared to block the horse's path.
But Bill Durham, a financial planner who conceived the idea and oversees the display, said both teams were in the way. ''Nobody wanted to leave the middle of the field,'' he said. ''If they don't leave the middle of the field, the horse won't come up in there.''
 
Oct. 20: Last Hurricane Warning?
The schedule says that Miami and Notre Dame will meet for the absolutely, positively last time on the afternoon of Oct. 20 at South Bend, when the inventive minds that introduced the concept of ''Catholics vs. Convicts'' will be given the opportunity to bid Miami farewell.
But before the young Domers say too many goodbyes, they should consider one reminder. This matchup, which prevented Notre Dame from winning a national championship last year and Miami the year before, will be automatically transferred into the marketplace, available to the most aggressive, highest-paying bidder of a bowl game without a conference affiliation. Like, say, the Fiesta? Maybe we should just pencil in a date in Tempe, Ariz., some prime-time evening in the first week of January, 1992.
 
Nov. 10: Making a Warmer Winter
When the sun begins to disappear before evening arrives and the leaves just disappear, before the big-time programs get around to the expensive business of defining their seasons, two games on Nov. 10 could carry a significance that is just as intense, if not as financially significant.
The game between Princeton and Yale could determine an Ivy League championship. Williams, which opens its season with a 13-game winning streak, will play at Amherst in a game that some of the alumni have been known to anticipate for months.
''They sometimes wonder how Amherst is going to be in the summer time,'' said Dick Farley, near the start of his fourth year as the coach at Williams and his 19th on the Williams staff. ''They ask at alumni reunions and golf outings. 'Who do they have coming back?' They don't seem to question too much the previous seven games.''
Last year Williams had to rally to preserve a perfect season. There was no championship, no league title, and no bowl game. No matter. ''You play seven other games,'' Farley said. ''You might not feel good about things. And if you win that, you can carry it through the winter.''
 
Nov. 24: The Last Bowl Charade
For the last time, invitations to bowl games will allegedly remain withheld until 6 P.M. on the third Saturday following the first Monday of November. After years of thinly-veiled arrangements and semantics games, a new, more realistic set of rules will be established for 1991.
The final zero hour, on Nov. 24, will be the end of an era. (One last complication: Notre Dame will play at U.S.C., after the deadline.) ''There's always been a question of what constitutes an invitation and what doesn't,'' said Don Meyers, the team selection chairman of the Sunkist Fiesta Bowl. ''We'd say, 'If we were to invite you to play in our game, and if we were to tell you your opponent would be Notre Dame, what would your position be?' It gets a lot more blunt than that.''
While coaches and athletic directors solicited invitations weeks ahead of time, the deadline became one of the most violated rules in collegiate sports. Faced with mounting pressures to establish a championship playoff, the bowls will remove the semantics from the process.
Meyers, for one, does not look forward to the passing of all the intrigue. ''It ran up everybody's phone bills,'' he said, ''but it's been a lot of fun.''
 
Dec. 1: Breaking Down a Wall
Auburn and Alabama will return to Legion Field in Birmingham on Dec. 1 for the 55th meeting in a long and often hateful series that began 98 years ago and changed forever last year. That was when Alabama played at Auburn for the first time, and lost a chance to compete for a national championship all in the same afternoon.
After the game, Bill Curry, following what became his next-to-last game as the Alabama coach, said that the deep disappointment his players felt at that moment might serve them one day should something truly significant go wrong.
Next up was Auburn Coach Pat Dye. The Auburn coach then went on to speak of the emotional significance of the Tiger Walk, the ritual that has the team stroll from its athletic dorm through its adoring crowds to Jordan-Hare Stadium.
''I'm sure that it must have resembled what went on the night the wall came down in Berlin,'' Dye said.
Little more than three weeks after young people had been drinking champagne atop the Berlin Wall, an audience of questioners stared at Dye, and then at each other. Is he really saying this? ''I mean, it was like they had been freed, and let out of bondage, just having this game at Auburn,'' Dye said. ''I can't imagine what it must have done to our players, and the effect it must have had on their emotion.''
Nearly nine months later, no one at Auburn or Alabama has been heard discussing the concept of unification.
 
Dec. 8 The Game Of His Life
After a one-year trip to the Meadowlands, the Army-Navy game will complete the season back home at Philadelphia, the traditional focal point of the armed services around the world for three hours on a cold Saturday afternoon.
This year, when the Cadets and Midshipmen meet in the 100th anniversary game at Veterans Stadium, Mike Burns will be able to look back at the day when the final football game of a painful, frustrating career became the game of his life.
After entering the Naval Academy as an enlisted man, Burns became a special teams player who suffered a broken leg on the opening kickoff of the 1988 Army game. Burns had gained 37 yards in his career before the game last season, with just 4 yards on 1 carry in 1989.
But as a starter for the first time in his career, Burns gained 57 yards on 8 carries against Army, including 20 yards in the drive that led to the game-winning field goal with 11 seconds to play.
A day later, his room in Bancroft Hall was lined with balloons and newspaper stories that included his name. After years of effort, watching football is not so painful for Burns anymore. ''I can come to grips a lot better after that game,'' he said from San Diego, where he attends surface-warfare school.
For the most important three hours of a Navy season, Burns was a hero, and he has the videotape to prove it. ''Although it has hit me, and I realize it's a great thing,'' he said, ''I think the actual cherishing moments are yet to come.''

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Vacancy Rates;
Black Monday's Fallout: An Emptiness Downtown

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
The shadow cast by Black Monday is growing longer and longer through the canyons of lower Manhattan, where commercial vacancy rates continue to climb higher than they have in years.
Meanwhile, the fresh crop of skyscrapers in west midtown continues to stand strikingly untenanted, with leasing at a snail's pace.
Almost three years after the stock market collapse of Oct. 19, vacancy rates in the heart of the Financial District - Broadway to the East River, the Battery to Liberty Street - have hit 23 percent for primary office buildings and 30.3 percent for secondary buildings, according to the Cushman & Wakefield brokerage. Throughout downtown, including the Financial District and other areas, the overall rate for both building classes was 18.5 percent in the second quarter.
The Edward S. Gordon Company reported an availability rate of 23.4 percent in the Financial District, which it defines as virtually everything south of Liberty Street. 
The vacancy rate for primary office buildings in west midtown is 19.2 percent, Cushman & Wakefield figures show. Gordon said the availability rate was 26.8 percent on the west side, in contrast to a 15.1 percent figure for mid-Manhattan as a whole.
New York is scarcely alone in the disarray of its commercial market. Many central business districts in the South and West have vacancy rates greater than Manhattan's, including Dallas, Denver, Houston, Memphis, Miami, Nashville and San Antonio.
Phoenix leads one list, with a rate of 29.3 percent. ''Phoenix has no zoning to speak of, so they just built much more than they could use,'' said Barbara Bennett, director of real-estate research at Cushman & Wakefield. (Other brokers, measuring different markets with different methods, come up with different rankings. The Grubb & Ellis Company, for example, puts Dallas at the top, with 22.3 percent, followed by Miami, Phoenix, San Diego and downtown Manhattan.) Although New York is not at the top in rates, the sheer amount of its vacant space dwarfs that of other cities. Depending on how one measures it, there may be from 45 million to 60 million square feet available in New York City. To picture 50 million square feet, imagine 22 Empire State Buildings, plus two Lever Houses. That is as much as the entire commercial real-estate inventory of the Seattle-Bellevue metropolitan area.
''Right now, the bottom is not in sight,'' said Stuart Lilien, executive vice president of the Lansco Corporation. ''There isn't any factor that's going to turn this market around in the near term.''
Lansco, a brokerage and consulting concern, has studied segments of the commercial market and found little in the way of growth potential. ''It seems like every company is undergoing a study on how they can eliminate employees or cut down overhead,'' Mr. Lilien said.
Even in the generally tattered economy, however, the ruins of the investment banking business stand out, together with the implications for downtown real estate.
Vacancies along Broad Street, where Drexel Burnham Lambert occupied hundreds of thousands of square feet before its collapse earlier this year, now exceed 30 percent, according to the Williams Real Estate Company. All told, more than 5 million square feet of space downtown has been vacated in the last year, Williams found.
''The Wall Street market has been devastated,'' Mr. Lilien said. ''People down there are shrinking, moving to New Jersey, moving to Brooklyn, moving up to midtown.''
The average asking rent downtown has dropped to $31.12 a square foot, from $32.76 in June 1989, according to figures from Gordon, which found that downtown space is almost $8 cheaper a square foot than midtown.
That might presage some fresh tenancies in lower Manhattan, although the commercial market there is rather ''inbred,'' in the words of Maurice H. Solomon, vice chairman of the Julien J. Studley real estate concern. Businesses from mid-Manhattan do not tend to migrate to the Wall Street area.
''I wouldn't be surprised if you saw some service companies or organizations going downtown - the deals are too good,'' Mr. Solomon said. ''Other than that, I don't see much hope for downtown. I think there's going to be more attrition in the financial markets. For the most part, you're going to see lean operations.''
''The only silver lining is that virtually no new office construction is coming on line'' to exacerbate downtown vacancies, said Brian Given, managing director of Williams. ''So hopefully the current supply will be absorbed over the next two to three years.''
Some of the hardest hit commercial properties are the older, smaller, secondary office buildings. In such structures downtown, the vacancy rate is 23.9 percent, according to Cushman & Wakefield.
Downtown is not alone in its woes. Nor are older buildings the only ones suffering.
Following is a list of new buildings, completed or under construction, in which more than half the space was reported available from July 30 to Aug. 3, according to a canvass by the Studley organization of leasing agents and owners. The names of developers, principals or owners are also given.
Discrepancies may exist, depending on the source. For example, Studley reported, from the leasing agent, that 505,300 square feet were available in Carnegie Hall Tower in early August. But the developers said a lease signed in June would have reduced the figure to 480,200. Last week, the developers said 460,200 square feet were available; the leasing agent reported 478,459 to Studley.

HEADLINE: Drawing Developers Into Day Care

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
On weekday mornings, 3-year-old Carolyn Keen, sometimes with a cherished toy in tow, heads with her father, Robert, for the Heller Industrial Park in Edison, N.J., where he is a forklift operator at Linden Motor Freight Company.
She spends the day with 100 other children at the John F. Kenney Childcare Center in Heller Park while her mother, Diana, works as a medical receptionist.
The three-year-old center, built by the park's developer, Isaac Heller, is a bright, cheery school-like building whose colorful playground climbing equipment seems mirage-like next to buildings where companies like Emerson Quiet Kool, Baxter Travenol Laboratories and Polygram Records assemble and pack their products for distribution.
The $1 million day-care center is one of the small but growing number that have been built or paid for by developers at workplaces throughout the country. The need for such centers has become more critical as more women join the workforce and dual-career families become the norm. 
In New York City, the City Council and the leading real-estate trade group have recently offered proposals to encourage developers to join the effort to expand day-care options. If they are successful, there may one day be centers like the one Carolyn Keen attends in the city's office towers and industrial parks.
There is a model for successful workplace day care in Manhattan, although it was not built by a developer. Called Fed Kids, it was created for the children of Federal employees at 26 Federal Plaza in lower Manhattan. It is one of 50 centers set up around the country with money from the Government's General Services Administration. The 4,000-square-foot center has been carved out of space at 26 Federal Plaza that had been the building manager's office - he moved to the second floor - and ground-floor retail space.
One of the City Council proposals - a bill offered by Councilwoman Carolyn B. Maloney of Manhattan - would amend the city's Administrative Code to exempt from some real estate taxes most existing office and hotel buildings that add day-care centers.
Another bill, also introduced by Councilwoman Maloney, would require builders of new hotels and office space to provide day care on the premises or nearby, or to pay the city a fee. The bill would apply to most new buildings of more than 50,000 square feet and to older buildings that add that much space. The measure also specifies that the day-care centers be at least 3,000 square feet or .01 percent of the new or additional square footage, whichever is greater. Builders would have the option of paying a fee of $1 for each square foot of commercial space built or added.
In June the Real Estate Board of New York, the trade group representing most of the city's owners and builders, put forth its own plan for developing day care. Private builders, the board suggested, should be allowed to build six extra feet of commercial space beyond the zoning limit for each foot they set aside for a child-care center. The board's proposals were part of a package of suggestions intended to jump-start New York's sluggish economy.
There is no argument that the city has a pressing need for day-care centers. According to Child Care Inc., a nonprofit organization in Manhattan that helps private and public groups develop day-care programs, a 1987 survey showed there are 146,300 children under the age of five in New York City who are believed to need day care but only 46,300 places for them in licensed centers.
Yet even if one of the current proposals is adopted, it could be years before a single center is built. Not the least of the barriers to developer-led day care is the dramatic slowdown in construction projects in the city over the last year or so. Because the proposals are tied to new commerical development or expansion, a rising real estate market is crucial to any measurable success for the initiatives.
A day-care center is not as easy or as cheap to build as such other popular tenant amenities as health clubs and cafeterias. The most basic center must meet tough construction, health and safety standards, and there is the additional cost of operating and maintaining it. It costs about $10,000 a week, for example, to operate the center in Heller Industrial Park. This includes maintenance, equipment replacement and staff salaries. Half the costs are paid by Mr. Heller and monthly tuition, $260 for each child, pays the rest.
Still, a recent study by the Child Care Action Campaign shows that some communities have used real estate development projects to expand the number of day-care centers. Founded in 1983 by Elinor Guggenheimer, the former New York City Consumer Affairs Commissioner, the campaign is a national nonprofit organization that lobbies on behalf of children. Its report was researched and written by Caroline Eichman, Barbara Reisman and Donna Euben.
''So far, the impact of these types of programs seems to be relatively small,'' said Ms. Reisman, the group's executive director. ''But what we also saw is that there is a tremendous interest in many, many communities that are struggling for ways to fill the gap as state and local governments see their budgets shrink. And in some places people are looking to the private sector to help out with child-care financing.''
The campaign's tally found that requirements or rewards have led developers to build 35 day-care centers across the nation in the last five years, with space for an total of about 1,355 children.
More than 100 government officials, legislators, public and private planners, child-care providers and developers were interviewed for the report, entitled ''Building Links: Developer Initiatives for Financing Day Care.'' It is an inventory of the projects and an evaluation of their impact.
In some places, including the New York metropolitan area, the development of day-care centers in workplaces has been voluntary. Mr. Heller is one of several real-estate entreprenuers who have created these centers as amenities to attract commercial tenants.
But the authors also found other ways in which developers are being drawn into the effort to expand day-care options.
Some centers have been built as a result of legislative mandate. Dubbed ''linkage'' by planners, this method requires developers to build or provide space for day-care centers or to contribute to a child-care fund.
In 1985 San Francisco became the first major United States city to adopt a linkage law. It was part of the city's broad zoning changes, intended to control rapid growth downtown. Since then seven other cities or counties - six of them in California - have adopted forms of linkage.
Zoning incentives have also fostered day-care development. The most common reward for developers who provide day-care space or funds is letting them put up larger structures than zoning laws allow. Portland, Cincinnati, Seattle and Hartford are among the cities using such bonuses. Currently, the campaign report says, 14 cities are considering bonus or linkage initiatives and statewide bonus measures are being considered in Massachusetts and New Jersey.
Not surprisingly, the group found that developers are more inclined to support day-care initiatives when the instrument of encouragement is a carrot - like tax breaks or building bonuses - rather than a stick - space set-aside requirements or contributions to a day-care fund.
Some question, for example, the prudence of establishing day-care centers in office buildings because it often forces parents to take young children on buses or subways during rush hour.
Mrs. Guggenheimer, the 78-year-old campaign president, who often travels on New York's subways, agrees that the workplace is just one option.
''There are other places that would be suitable, like schools,'' she said. ''But when parents have no suitable day-care alternative near home, and there is a day-care center where they work, for many the question of taking children on trains or buses is not important.''
Critics of linkage say that developers alone should not have to pay for a social service that is universally needed and used.
''I think that most resistance is dissolving,'' said Steven Trainer, a senior vice president of Wright-Rumstad Development Company in Seattle, which put a day-care center in the base of one of its downtown office buildings, Washington Mutual Tower, two years ago. ''Developers are begining to see the advantages from both a maketing and public relations perspective.''
Mr. Trainer said his company had thought about including such a center in the million-square-foot building even before Seattle adopted a building bonus day-care ordinance in 1985. The ground-floor center in the Wright-Rumstad building is just under 2,000 square feet and cares for 50 children 6 months to 2 1/2 years old.
To qualify for the bonus, which in Seattle allows an extra 3 1/2 to 16 square feet for each square foot of day-care space, the company paid to build the center and pays to maintain it. The city's bonus ratios are based on the size of the day-care center and where in downtown it is.
But it takes more than a change in zoning ordinances and support from the private sector to foster day-care development, as Hartford officials learned.
Hartford, which has had a building bonus for development of day-care and other amenities since 1984, has seen the construction of more than six million square feet of new office space. But not one developer has built a day-care center. The barrier, officials say, is not a lack of interest but a state requirement that conflicts with the city's ordinance.
''The state requires that all day-care centers have outdoor play spaces,'' said Patricia Williams, Hartford's Planning Director, who helped draft the city's bonus ordinance. ''So far, none of the builders have been able to find ways to meet that requirement because of site configuration or building design. It is frustrating but it shows that good intentions do not build day-care centers.''
There is hope, Ms. Williams said, that the intent of the ordinance will soon be realized. A site owned by one company, Oakleaf Development, is next to a church that sits on a large piece of property. Ms. Williams said the company is negotiating with the church to use part of its property for a playground for a child-care center Oakleaf hopes to build.
Outdoor play space is a vexing problem. At Fed Kids, in the heart of the cramped City Hall area in lower Manhattan, a portion of a public plaza was turned into a playground.
The G.S.A.'s startup cost for Fed Kids was just over $150,000. The agency expects the new annual operating budget for the center, which was recently expanded, to be about $26,755. Fed Kids serves 55 children from 16 months to 4 1/2 years; about two-thirds are children of Federal employees and the rest live in the community.
The McBurney Y.M.C.A., which holds the contract with Fed Kids Inc. to operate the center, keeps it open from 7:30 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. The charge for each child is $142.50 a week for Federal workers and $150 a week for parents who do not have Government jobs.
''When people talk about why the city does not have more centers like this one, they talk about the lack of space and high rents,'' said Susan Kossin, the first board chairman of Fed Kids, which has the G.S.A. permit to operate the center. ''But we started with about 3,000 square feet. You can do a lot with that. You don't have to wait for new construction to develop on-site day care. What you do need are people who want to see it happen.''
Councilwoman Maloney agrees and says that despite the troubled real estate market, support is growing for her bill to reward with tax exemptions developers who include day-care centers in their projects.
''I first proposed a bill like this 10 years ago,'' Mrs. Maloney said. ''We got nowhere with it. The Koch administration was not supportive and at the time, neither was the real estate industry.''
But Mrs. Maloney said she was encouraged by a meeting late last year with a group of developers and others in the industry.
''They support the tax-exemption bill,'' she said, ''and while many are firm in their opposition to any measure that would require developers to provide or fund day care, some agree that day care in the workplace makes sense.''
''I think that the real estate industry and other industries see that the city can be competitive only if we figure out ways to make working and living in New York possible,'' she went on. ''If we do not, we will lose to communities that have done it.''

Shops and Housing May Soon Join Yachts

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
Since the early 1900's a 14-acre peninsula in the west branch of Stamford Harbor has been a boat yard, a boat-building site and a marina, where forests of sailboat masts tower over yachts, speed boats and catamarans.
The North Atlantic In-Water Boat Show is held there each September, and United States Navy vessels were built there and launched from its docks during two world wars. Today it is known along the New York-New England coast as Yacht Haven, the last working boat yard of its size in the region.
Now the Stamford Planning Commission has approved a $90 million residential, commercial and marina complex for the site, and in a vote on July 31 it recommended a zoning change that would permit non-water-related uses for the first time.
The Strand, as the project is called, will go before the Zoning Commission in the fall, and it must also be approved by state and Federal environmental agencies, a process that could take up to a year. 
The Collins Development Corporation of Stamford has spent three years and $2.5 million for engineering, architectural and legal fees, land options and environmental-impact studies in preparing the plans.
''It has been quite a bit more complicated than anything else we've done,'' said Arthur Collins, the president of the firm, ''because of all the new government regulations, and because of its size and variety.''
The Strand would be the first major development in the South End. For 10 years the city has sought a savior for the area's patchwork of black, Italian and Polish neighborhoods. They are sandwiched between decaying industrial plants and oil tanks, cut off from the rest of the city by the parallel swaths of Interstate 95 and the Metro-North Commuter Railroad.
In many quarters the Strand is seen as a golden door through which people and commerce will finally flow and mingle, while less sanguine shop owners, restaurateurs and small-business owners downtown worry about a competing second city emerging on the other side of the tracks.
''The Mayor feels that the Strand will have a very positive impact,'' said Charles Morton, executive aide to Mayor Thom Serrani. ''A great portion of the waterfront is privately owned. As sites come up, Stamford wants projects with provisions for public access that will attract people from all over the city.''
A four-story Residential Village is planned for the seaward end of the complex, with 200 condominium units, shops, restaurants, a fish market, boardwalks, landscaped plazas and a wave barrier doubling as a fishing pier attached to Kosciusko Park, east of the project.
A Maritime Village on the upland sector is to house Yacht Haven's boat services in new quarters, a commercial fishing dock, more shops and restaurants, and a 20-room boatel. Commercial space in both sections totals 85,000 square feet.
The project, designed in Georgian-colonial style by Do H. Chung and Partners of Stamford, will be surrounded by 500 boat slips, almost double the current number.
Some 1,000 parking slots will be distributed underground and on the surface, and a public dock will serve excursion boats and a ferry service to La Guardia Airport.
Because the peninsula is in a flood plain, roads and buildings will be elevated 13 feet above the mean high-water mark, with buildings anchored in bedrock. And to stabilize the boat basin during storms, the developer must build a 60,000-square-foot floating concrete breakwater offshore.
Clam beds under the breakwater site are a concern of the state and Federal environmental agencies, as are water quality and flow and maintaining a viable channel and a viable marina.
''It's the only boat yard on the East Coast that can handle vessels up to 80 feet,'' said Arthur Rocque, director of the Coastal Management Division of the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, which will hold hearings on the project this fall.
Mr. Collins was recommended to Mayor Serrani as the developer by the Stamford Partnership, a 10-year-old economic development agency, on the basis of three residential-marine complexes he built in Stamford during the 1980's. The partnership secured citywide acceptance for the project by negotiating some unusual trade-offs.
Mr. Collins agreed to donate up to $2 million, in cash or construction, for low-cost housing in the South End. The partnership, made up of city officials, members of the business community and people representing South End neighborhood factions, will administer the funds.
Units, priced from $80,000 to $100,000, would be earmarked for South End families earning less than $36,000 a year.
The developer's donations will be proportionate to the density of construction that he is allowed at the Strand. In addition, he agreed to help stimulate local employment by using some neighborhood workers enrolled in apprenticeship programs run by Local 210 of the carpenters' union.
Complicated as it is, the Strand ''is much scaled back from a proposal by Northeast Utilities eight years ago,'' said Jon Smith, the Stamford planning director. ''They wanted 1,200 condominium units in 8-and 10-story buildings.''
Northeast bought the property from Yacht Haven for $4 million in 1970, citing the need for a power station that never materialized. When development proved too bothersome, Northeast offered Mr. Collins an option on a $20 million sale price. Yacht Haven, now a Northeast tenant, will have Mr. Collins as its new landlord.
Northeast retained a seven-acre parcel north of the Strand that is contaminated with old coal-tar deposits dumped by its subsidiary, Connecticut Light & Power Company, located next door. It will be leased to Yacht Haven for excess boat storage and parking.
''Northeast can't develop it as is, and doesn't want to set a precedent for its other sites by digging it up,'' said Michael Sinacori, real-estate operations manager for the utility.
The marina is to be built as soon as approvals are in place and financing can be arranged, probably next spring, but work on the residential units will not begin until the market improves. The condominium units will be priced from $200,000 for 700-square-foot studios to $400,000 for 1,800-square-foot, two-bedroom apartments. These are smaller and cheaper than other Collins projects. ''We cannot risk competing with single-family homes,'' said Arthur Collins Jr., senior vice president. ''We've got to go back to the basic rule that condos must be priced 25 percent below single-family houses to maintain market viability.''

 BODY:

Right to Co-op Documents
 
Question: I am a real estate broker specializing in residential loft sales. The lawyer of a client who is interested in a co-op requested access to the financial records but the board refused to comply. Doesn't Section 624 of the New York Business Corporation Law gives prospective buyers the right to see these documents? If I lose a sale because of the problem, would the board be liable? . . . M. A., Manhattan
 
Answer: The answer to both questions is no. According to Stuart Saft, a lawyer and vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives, the section of the law you cite gives shareholders the right to review corporation records. 
''The request should have come from the seller, as shareholder,'' rather than the buyer, said Mr. Saft. ''They don't have a right to access.''
As for a suit, Mr. Saft said: ''The broker would not have a case because the buyer would not. If anyone would have a case, it would be the seller.''
 
Ban on Weekend Work
 
Question: My husband and I live in a rent-stabilized apartment in a cooperative building. Because we both work, the only time we can have work done is weekends. I arranged to have my carpeting cleaned on Saturday morning, but the superintendent refused to let the man in to do the job, saying no work is allowed to be done on weekends. Can he do this? . . . P. F., Manhattan
 
Answer: Maybe. Cooperatives have the right to set house rules regarding such things as when renovation work or moving can be done. These usually apply to all residents, shareholders or renters. However, if you had been allowed to have cleaning work done on Saturdays in the past, it may be that the Division of Housing and Community Renewal would consider any new restrictions a reduction in your services. You could file a complaint with the agency, but a decision probably would take months. The division has a form for reduction-in-service complaints, available at its Manhattan offices at 156 Williams Street, N.Y. 10038 or 163 West 125th Street, N.Y. 10027.
Meantime, you might approach the superintendent again. Maybe he associates carpet cleaning with very loud equipment when it may make no more noise than a vacuum cleaner.
 
Rent-Stabilized Sublet
 
Question: I am a rent-stabilized tenant and am trying to sublet my apartment. I pay a very low rent so my landlord would like me to move. He has informed me that he will use any legal means to try to keep me from subletting. What are my rights? . . . C. G., Manhattan
 
Answer: An owner may not unreasonably refuse a rent-stabilized tenant the right to sublet for two years out of a four-year period, as long as certain procedures are followed. They include informing the landlord of intention to sublet by certified mail no less than 30 days before the start of the sublet in a letter that describes the terms of the sublet and gives the name and home and business addresses of the prospective subtenant.
Within 10 days of this mailing the landlord must respond, either asking for additional information, granting consent or providing a justifiable reason for denying the request. Moreover, according to Thomas R. Viola, a spokesman for the Division of Housing and Community Renewal, unless your landlord could show that the subtenant could not keep up with the rent or would be disruptive, he would probably have no legitimate reason to turn you down.
Mr. Viola also said that if it takes court action to get a sublease, your landlord might be liable for your legal fees if the agency determined he acted improperly.

How to Install a Dimmer Switch

BYLINE: By JOHN WARDE

 BODY:
DIMMER switches allow adjusting lighting levels; they also save energy and extend the lives of light bulbs. Most often, dimmer switches are used for controlling incandescent ceiling lights. Installing one is easy. The job involves simply replacing the conventional wall switch with the dimmer.
Two types of dimmer switches are common. The more expensive is the full-range dimmer, or rheostat. It has a rotating knob and can provide completely variable control from a dim glow to full brightness. Usually it has a 600-watt capacity (the amount is stamped on the device), which is more than enough for a typical living room lighting circuit. 
The other type is the high/low dimmer. It is less expensive and, unlike a conventional wall switch, has a toggle instead of a knob.
High/low dimmers usually have a capacity of only 300 watts and provide only two levels of brightness: full and about 30 percent of full. Nevertheless, where a full-range dimmer is not required, a high/low dimmer is an economical substitute.
Both types are available with a single-pole design, the kind to choose when only one switch controls a fixture. Full-range dimmers are also available with a three-way design, for use with fixtures controlled by two switches. Three-way dimmers are made so that only one of the two existing switches is replaced; thus, a light controlled by such a switch circuit can be operated from two locations but dimmed from only one.
To install a dimmer by replacing an existing wall switch, all you will need in most cases are a screwdriver, long-nosed pliers and a voltage tester (an inexpensive device consisting of a small light bulb with two wire probes attached, available at hardware stores).
Begin by making sure the tester works. To do this, simply insert the probes into the slots of a wall outlet that you know works; if the tester is working, the bulb will light.
Next, shut off the power to the electrical circuit containing the switch, by tripping the circuit breaker or removing the fuse controlling it. Afterward, try operating the switch to make sure the light does not function (which would indicate that the power is still on).
Then unscrew the switch's cover plate from the wall. Avoid touching any metal, either on the switch itself or the outlet box in the wall, until you can use the voltage tester, as described further on.
Beneath the plate, find and loosen the two screws that fasten the switch to the outlet box. Gently pull the switch out of the box to expose the wires connected to it; avoid touching the wiring or the terminal screws on the sides.
Single-pole switches contain two brass terminal screws; three-way switches contain three screws. Newer models of both also have a small green terminal screw for a ground wire.
If there are four screws, the switch is a four-way design, used with two three-way switches to provide an additional point of control. Dimmers are not made for these; replace one of the three-way switches instead.
Other switches contain no terminal screws. The wiring enters the switch body through holes in the rear. Most switches contain both holes and screws, but the wiring is attached by means of only one or the other.
Touch one of the tester's probes to the metal outlet box and the other, in turn, to each of the terminal screws or holes. If the outlet box is plastic instead of metal, touch one probe to any of the bare copper wires (these are ground wires) inside the box while touching the other probe, in turn, to the terminals. If the tester bulb lights, power is still flowing to the switch. Proceed no further until you can turn it off.
When you are sure the switch is safe, remove it. If the switch is a single-pole, simply loosen the terminal screws and remove the wires; or, if the wires enter terminal holes, insert the tip of a screwdriver into the slot near each hole, which will allow the wire to be pulled out.
If the switch is a three-way, put masking tape on the wire connected to the dark-colored terminal screw or to the screw or hole marked ''common.''
To install most dimmers, reconnect the wires to the terminal screws or slots matching those of the original switch. With single-pole switches, it makes no difference which wire is connected to which terminal. On a three-way switch, replace the wiring exactly as it was on the old switch, using your masking-tape marking as a guide.
Connect a short length of bare copper wire or green insulated ground wire to the green terminal screw on the new switch, if there is one. If similar wires are present in the outlet box, add the new wire to them by unscrewing the plastic cap (called a wire nut) that links them, twisting the end of the new wire around those already joined, then replacing the cap. If no bare or green-insulated wires are present, attach the end of the new wire firmly to any metal part of the outlet box.
Some full-range dimmers have short wires already attached to them. To install this type, simply join the short wires to those of the same color in the outlet box, using wire nuts.
Press the connected switch into the outlet box and fasten it, being careful not to disturb the wiring. Restore the power and test the switch. If it works, attach the cover plate.
Although most dimmers have a built-in electrical filter, they sometimes cause interference on television sets and radios plugged into the same circuit or operated nearby. To remedy the problem, move the TV or radio to another circuit and as far away from the dimmer as is practical. If that does not work, obtain a power-line filter for the appliance from an electronics store.

HEADLINE: ABOUT NEW JERSEY

BYLINE: By Anthony DePalma

 BODY:
VACANT city lots are powerful symbols. Betrayal, despair, mistrust - name it, and for someone the weedy blocks that dot every city represent a modern age that has all but said cities are worthless.
Each lot bears its own history. Right now, one of the most intriguing tales rises, along with a powerful stand of city weeds, at the corner of Johnston and Pacific Avenues in Jersey City, in the shadow of the New Jersey Turnpike extension. Once immigrant families lived here, and shopkeepers did good business along Pacific Avenue.
How that changed no one knows for sure but it did, and today that sector of Jersey City, not far from the waterfront and the northern entrance to Liberty State Park, has been all but deserted. Oh, there is a husk of a house here and there, and on the corner a liquor store appears to have a steady stream of customers. But all else has been swept away. 
Strange as it sounds, that barrenness is the very thing that attracts people like Stephen Roberson, a veteran community organizer who has seen more than his share of despair. On these empty blocks Mr. Roberson sees the chance to rebuild, from scratch, a community that truly has a stake in the future of the city.
This is no pipe dream. Mr. Roberson and the organization he represents, the Industrial Areas Foundation, have an enviable track record of having done the same thing in the worst parts of the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, in a project called Nehemiah, after the biblical figure sent to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.
More than 2,000 Nehemiah houses have been built in New York. More important, the new owners of the houses have a stake in the city and they have brought the moribund neighborhood back to life.
The foundation had wanted to do more in New York City, but officials there would not provide enough land. Frustrated by the city's reticence, the foundation has now turned to Jersey City, where it is willing to help build hundreds of houses at improbable low prices. Except that Jersey City leaders cannot get around to giving up the empty lots.
''It's one of the things that's most perplexing,'' Mr. Roberson said recently. ''It's almost as if the bureaucracy takes on a life of its own.''
Mayor Gerald McCann and other city officials say they believe in Nehemiah, and eight months ago they pledged to provide enough land for the construction of 600 Nehemiah houses, which would sell for $45,000 each. But so far they have not met that pledge.
So now instead of building houses, the organizers and the city are bickering. Jersey City officials say the Nehemiah people are too demanding and unreasonable. The advocates say the city lacks the will to deliver on its promise. And the empty lots stay empty.
Not one to just wait for the stalemate to break, Mr. Roberson is out seeking new allies in Trenton, knowing from experience how pressure can be brought to bear in useful ways. He came to Jersey City two years ago, after a seven-year struggle to build Nehemiah housing in Brooklyn.
Mr. Roberson, who was raised in Westwood, Bergen County, before beginning his nearly 20 years of activism, was invited to come to Jersey City by the Interfaith Community Organization, a group of clergymen concerned that despite the new office buildings on the waterfront, Jersey City was losing ground to some intractable urban problems - namely, failing schools, a withering stock of affordable housing and a plague of drug abuse.
''These were real solid issues that, on our own, we had a limited capability of addressing let alone solving,'' said the Rev. James V. Pagnotta, pastor of St. Joseph's Roman Catholic parish and co-chairman of the housing team for the Interfaith Community Organization.
Recently, the organization got the Jersey City Police Department to try community-based policing, a way of getting the police out of their squad cars and back on the beat, where they could meet people and get involved in neighborhood affairs before problems arise. The group has also worked to clean up Lincoln Park.
But the most visible and tangible project would be the Nehemiah housing.
In Brooklyn, the Nehemiah houses were built near a forest of public housing projects in one of New York City's most hopeless areas. Now the modest little two-story masonry buildings are filled with working families - 40 percent of them came from the projects - who plant flowers, trim bushes and show off the pride they feel about owning houses they never thought they could afford.
The Nehemiah method is fairly simple: the religious congregations put together a revolving loan fund to get the construction going. Architectural design and legal matters are kept straightforward and inexpensive. Construction crews make a small profit, the city contributes the land and the state provides mortgage guarantees and writedowns that keep the houses affordable to families earning as little as $20,000.
Simple, but successful. So successful that a few years back legislation was passed in Washington establishing a national Nehemiah housing program.
But it seems Nehemiah has won more support in other parts of the country than right here. The 2,000 units in New York were supposed to be just the start. More would have been built, but the city never delivered the land.
Mark T. Munley, director of the Jersey City Department of Housing and Economic Development, said Jersey City was willing to work with Nehemiah, but could not find the land. Vacant lots might appear to be everywhere, but many are polluted. Other nearly vacant blocks contain just two or three houses, but relocating residents is, even in the best of conditions, politically dangerous.
''We believe in the concept, and we want them to build,'' Mr. Munley said. ''But it's just impossible to give them what they want right now.''
The originator of the Nehemiah concept, a retired builder, I. D. Robbins, has said that to work as intended, and to keep prices affordable, Nehemiah must be able to build a large number of single-family houses on cleared, unencumbered lots. In that way, enough people with real stakes in the community will be available to support the rebuilding of schools, stores and other services.
After the first houses were built in New York City, officials there became reluctant to provide any more large parcels of land. Jersey City now, too, seems to be backing off its promise of last December.
Paul W. Hamilton, assistant director of the Housing Department, said Jersey City was ready to offer enough land to build 200 houses near Johnston and Pacific Avenues but not until next spring, after chromium contamination has been cleaned up. He also said that assembling the land for the remaining 400 residences would be difficult, and that it might be necessary to ask the Nehemiah program organizers to increase density and build garden apartments.
As of the middle of this month, Father Pagnotta said he had not received any word from the city about the chromium cleanup and therefore he could not say whether a spring start was acceptable. But he did say that some of the $4 million pledged to the construction loan fund could be lost if nothing happens by the end of this year.
He also ruled out building anything other than single-family houses. ''At one point they asked us to do garden apartments,'' Father Pagnotta said. ''We said no.''
Father Pagnotta, Mr. Roberson and other Nehemiah supporters went to Trenton last month to find a way to get Jersey City moving. They got in to see Gov. Jim Florio.
Like the local officials, the Governor initially embraced the Nehemiah program and set up meetings between the Jersey City contingent and several of his department heads. One of them, Randy Primas, Commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs, has agreed to visit Brooklyn's Nehemiah neighborhood on Sept. 25.
Father Pagnotta and Mr. Roberson are certain to be there with Mr. Primas, hoping he sees that Nehemiah means more than housing, and that rebuilding a community takes more than promises.

HEADLINE: Board Sends a Message For the Budget Season

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
AMID growing evidence that the county will have to lean more heavily on its property tax in difficult economic times, the Board of Legislators last week approved its first departmental budget of the new fiscal season and considered some unusual new sources of revenue.
After a public hearing on Monday, the Board unanimously adopted a budget of $35.85 million for Westchester Community College, including a county contribution of $12.8 million. The county's share represents an increase of $97,000, or less than 1 percent, over last year's allocation. The college had asked for $532,000 from the county.
Earlier, the Board had trimmed $185,000 from the college's proposed budget. In its final form, the spending plan represents a 7.7 percent increase over last year, but nearly all of that is coming from increased state aid. 
 
'Deep Concerns About 1991'
''This budget reflects our best attempt to reconcile the needs of Westchester Community College with our deep concerns about 1991,'' Katherine S. Carsky, Republican of Yonkers and chairwoman of the Budget and Appropriations Committee, told her colleagues at last Monday's Board meeting.
Diane A. Keane of Rye, the Board's majority leader, called the reductions made by the Board ''fair and sensible'' and said that its members had sent a message to other county departments about the future of their operating budgets. ''Every department has to cut tremendously,'' Mrs. Keane warned. ''If they don't, we'll do it for them.''
Without a sales tax to soften the blow, and with costs mandated by Federal and state programs rising while subsidies and local revenues shrink, county government officials have started searching beyond their traditional boundries for ways to balance the budget. A goal is to avoid a politically disastrous property-tax increase.
 
'To Think the Unthinkable'
A legislative commission has been formed to seek additional county revenues, or ''to think the unthinkable,'' as its co-chairman, Timothy S. Carey, Republican of Montrose, described its mandate.
The bipartisan group of legislators, local government officals and business leaders has asked the full Board to review the rents and fees charged by various departments and also to consider a method for levying a motor-vehicle-use fee. But Mr. Carey described those measures as ''saving a few dimes at a time when the state continues to demand more dollars.''
Earlier this month, his group, the Special Commission on Additional Revenues and Capital Enhancements - or Scarce, as it calls itself - reached considerably farther afield. It agreed to study the idea of selling such government assets as Playland and the County Airport.
 
A Proposal by Lauder
The commission approved a proposal by Ronald S. Lauder, the businessman, former United States Ambassador to Austria and New York City Republican mayoral candidate, to study ''privatizing'' the two operations.
''No one has come and said, ''I want to buy the airport or Playland,'' Mr. Carey said. ''But we must consider, long range, what is the best posture for Westchester.''
Selling the airport and thereby putting the operation on the tax rolls would have ''simply enormous'' economic benefits, Mr. Carey said. In addition, the one-time windfall from the sale itself was estimated at $60 million.
Mr. Lauder, the newly appointed chairman of the New York State Senate Advisory Commission on Privatization, appeared before the Westchester group to describe his state-wide effort to promote private enterprise in goverment as an alternative to higher taxes.
 
Profits and Yearly Revenue
Selling government assets like airports and amusement parks, Mr. Lauder said, can generate substantial one-time profits and put businesses on the tax rolls producing yearly income. ''We can have efficient, privately provided services and benefit from increased revenues without new taxes,'' Mr. Lauder said. There are a number of opportunities in the county, he suggested. ''Government just has no business running a business like an amusement park,'' Mr. Lauder, who is also chairman of the Central European Development Corporation, a private investment group, told the members of the local commission. He urged the county to ''get government off this roller coaster'' and sell Playland.
''You risk nothing by letting private enterprise work,'' he said.
 
Does Public Ownership Pay?
Promoting one of his favorite themes, Mr. Lauder said he would urge the state commission to study the consequences of a sale of the County Airport and to determine ''if the county taxpayers are getting their money's worth with public ownership.''
Last year, Mr. Lauder underwrote a study showing that the sale of the Kennedy and La Guardia Airports would produce a one-time payment to New York City of at least $2.2 billion and generate $212 million in general fund revenues yearly. While the County Airport is ''not exactly J.F.K. or La Guardia,'' Mr. Lauder said, ''privatization works as well for small projects as for big ones.''
Airport privatization has been carried out successfully in a number of European countries, including England. The British sold their airports, including London's Heathrow Airport, for $2.5 billion three years ago.
 
Reviews on Federal Level
But the concept so far has lacked political and governmntal support in this country. The Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Transportation are reviewing airport privatization, and the two agencies are expected to release their conclusions shortly.
Some Westchester officials are skeptical and several have argued that the county government has already developed a number of public-private partnerships. The county, for example, contracts with private businesses for airport management, bus transportation and garbage-transfer stations.
 
'People Feel Safer'
There are few unexplored areas, said the county's deputy budget director, Kathleen M. Tooher.
''We've taken the best of privatization,'' she said. ''The fact is people feel safer with government. You can yell at your legislator or your government official when something goes wrong at the airport. We are here, and that means public accountability and accessibility.''
County Legislator Martin L. Rogowsky, Democrat of Harrison, agreed. ''Government has accountability, and my election is a direct example of that. They voted my predecessor out because they didn't like his views on the airport,'' he said, referring to his victory last year over a Republican incumbent, Dominick D. Pierro. ''People wouldn't have that opportunity if a private operator ran the airport.''
Saying he favored further study of the possibility of privatization of county assets, Mr. Rogowsky added, ''the airport is the wrong place to start.''
 
The Issue of Control
The commission's cochairwoman, Audrey G. Hochberg, Democrat of Scarsdale, also expressed doubts about whether extensive additional privatization would help the county.
''The idea isn't any panacea,'' Mrs. Hochberg said. ''Public-private partnerships can be useful - and we have several - but I don't see selling Playland or the airport as worthwhile.''
The partnership concept works especially well at the airport, Mrs. Hochberg conceded. But she added, ''I wouldn't want to give up control.''
Privatization is ''worth looking at,'' County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke said last week, but he warned that private, profit-making industries often produced costs higher than those of government, especially for the ''big-ticket'' items like prisons and welfare.
He said he was not interested in having the County Airport become private. ''The airport is one of the few in the country that runs in the black,'' Mr. O'Rourke said. ''Why would we tamper with something that is kicking in $4 million or $5 million a year?''
 
Lauder Finances Commission
Mr. Lauder is the only member of the Senate advisory commission to be named so far, and is also its only source of funds. Additional members are expected to be named shortly, a spokesman for the State Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, said last week.
Mr. Lauder, whose family owns the Estee Lauder cosmetic business, has expended time and money on both sides of the Atlantic promoting the idea that a free-market economy would be more beneficial than government bureaucracy.
Private enterprise can do a lot of things better than government can, Mr. Lauder has argued in speeches, whether that means a ''new beginning'' in Eastern Europe or ''jump-starting'' old projects under new management in New York.

HEADLINE: PREPARING FOR THE WORST;
The Stuff Wars Are Made Of

 BODY:
In the last week the United States crossed a threshold in confronting Iraq over its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. It became more than a nation responding firmly to an international crisis; in its collective consciousness and in cold fact, it began preparing for war.
The signs were numerous. In characterizing the Americans and other foreigners held by Iraq as hostages, President Bush in effect accused President Saddam Hussein of direct hostile action against the United States. While declaring peaceful and defensive intentions, Mr. Bush repeatedly evoked memories of America and its allies justly confronting threats in the past as he argued for resolve now.
The American and foreign military buildup in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf hit full stride, and Mr. Bush called up the reserves, the first time they have been called since the Vietnam war. 
The costs of this effort, many billions of dollars even without the mammoth expenditures that would be required in a war, will weigh heavily on a Federal Treasury already battered by seemingly uncontainable deficits and on a national economy tilted toward recession. The Dow Jones industrial average lost nearly 4.5 percent of its value in one week as investors feared the worst.
The charts and pictures on this page and on page 3 illustrate the magnitude and complexity of the mobilization, and give some hint of its costs. Experts caution that even the best cost estimates are speculative, in large part a reflection of the uncertainty of the days, weeks and months ahead.
 
ALIGNED AGAINST IRAQ
The United States has been joined in the operation against Iraq by many counries from the West, Middle East and Asia. Full data on troop strength, equipment and deployments have not been released but many details are known. Iraq has about 170,000 troops in Kuwait and on the border with Saudi Arabia, of a force that has been estimated as high as 1 million but is probably less. Iraq also has 500 planes and 5,500 tanks but a weak navy.)

MOVING MOUNTAINS
The American military's principal action in the Persian Gulf crisis so far has been transporting thousands of troops and huge amounts of materiel from many points in the United States and elsewhere. Some highlights:
By rail. The Association of American Railroads says that rail companies hired by the Pentagon have transported to ports more than 2,000 flatbed and boxcar loads of equipment, including everything from M-1 tanks to ammunition.
By truck. The American Trucking Association said the Pentagon could call on thousands of truckers nationwide. For example, Landstar System Inc. of Stamford, Conn., ran 327 truckloads from Fort Campbell, Ky., to port at Jacksonville, Fla., 780 miles away. Cost to the Pentagon: from $1.05 to $1.30 a mile per truckload.
By sea. The Military Sealift Command says that as of late last week it cost $93 million to move equipment by sea. Much of the 447,000 short tons was sent on eight fast sealift ships, which carried the equivalent of enough fully loaded semi-trailer trucks parked side by side to cover 76 football fields, including end zones.
Forty cargo ships from the 96-ship Ready Reserve Force have been activated, and three commercial cargo ships have been chartered so far.
By air. The Center for Defense Information says 286 military transport aircraft are being used: 174 C-141's, each capable of carrying 200 troops and 34 tons of equipment; 32 C-130's and 80 C-5's. Both the C-130 and the C-5 can carry 340 troops and 130 tons of equipment.
Thirty-eight commercial aircraft also are being used.
 
COSTS OF DEPLOYMENT: AN EDUCATED GUESS
The Pentagon on Aug. 15 gave a preliminary estimate of $1.2 billion for the cost of Operation Desert Shield through Sept. 30. But that did not take into account subsequent developments like the call-up of reserves, and in any case military officials for strategic reasons are reluctant to provide many specifics about deployments. The estimates here were developed by the Center for Defense Information, an independent organization of retired senior officers that analyzes military policy. The number show how much it might cost, above and beyond normal military operations, to keep 100,000 American troopsin Saudi Arabia with other forces aboard ships in the region. There is no way to calculate the costs should war break out, the center says.

CARE AND FEEDING OF THE TROOPS
The Department of Defense has allocated $600 million for food, clothing and medical supplies for troops involved in Operation Desert Shield in Saudi Arabia. About $400 million is for food, $25 million for medical supplies and the rest for clothing. Here are examples of the quantities and costs of such supplies as of Wednesday.

OIL'S POWER OVER THE ECONOMY
The economic consequences of the gulf crisis are uncertain to say the least, but econometric models can show some likely effects of a specific disruption like a sharp rise in the price of oil. These figures compare forecasts of United States economic performance by DRI/McGraw Hill, a forecasting firm. The first, issued on Aug. 2, before Iraq invaded Kuwait, assumed that the price of oil would not go above $22 a barrel. The second, issued after the invasion, forecasts what might happen if oil purchased on contract goes as high as $27 a barrel. Contract oil generally costs less than oil bought on the spot market, where it has risen above $30 a barrel.

HEADLINE: FOCUS;
Developers in Southeast Florida Dangle Incentives

BYLINE: By PAUL BLYTH

DATELINE: BOCA RATON, FLA.

 BODY:
 From Fort Lauderdale to Stuart, home builders in Southeast Florida are offering all types of deals these days. Not only are they reducing prices, but they are also paying buyers' closing costs, buying down mortgage interest rates, supplying free amenities such as microwave ovens or electronic security systems, and offering combinations of all of the above.
They must do these things if they want to sell homes at a rate remotely similar to that of the boom period of the last few years. Although Southeast Florida is still considered a growth area compared to other regions of the country, sales of new homes have slacked off here since peaking in 1988. 
In the Greater West Palm Beach area, for example, which extends from Boca Raton to Jupiter, new-home sales boomed in the mid-80's: 6,961 in 1985, 9,619 in 1986 and, in 1988, the peak year, 11,114.
That number dropped to 9,749 in 1989; for the first five months this year sales were off 29.7 percent from the same period of 1989, according to a study by Appraisal and Real Estate Economics Associates, a Miami research company.
"I've seen developers resort to these types of sales gimmicks in past cycles," said Michael Cannon, president of the research company. "It usually comes about when a developer is not getting his projected sales volume and is straining to sell his inventory."
Karl Preusse, president of K. Hovnanian Companies of Florida and of the Palm Beach County Home Builders and Contractors Association, said most cash discounts range from $5,000 to $8,000.
However, his company, which has built more than 12,000 homes in Southeast Florida in the last 20 years, does not offer discounts; its principal incentive package for about a year has been to pay all or part of the buyers' closing costs, depending on the type of home and buyer.
For second-home buyers, Hovnanian usually will pay some closing costs, equaling about 2.5 percent to 3 percent of the mortgage. This deal is offered in Hovnanian's 500-unit Pine Ridge development in Delray Beach, which is primarily an adult community with three-bedroom single-family detached homes costing $110,000 to $125,000 and two-bedroom condominiums costing $60,000 to $80,000.

 For a first-time buyer -- meaning someone who has not owned a house in three years -- Hovnanian will pay all closing costs and a portion of the points lenders usually require to inititate a home loan. A point is one percent of the loan amount. This essentially means that Hovnania will pay up-front costs equaling as much as 5.5 percent to 6 percent of the mortgage.
If, for example, someone were to make a $20,000 down payment on a $120,000, three-bedroom home in Hovnanian's family development of Lawrence Grove in Boynton Beach, the company would pay about $6,000 in up-front closing costs, Mr. Preusse said. This deal is offered to first-time buyers, he said, because they usually have a harder time amassing the money needed for up-front costs.
"But 6 percent is about the maximum anyone here can do, because that is essentially the maximum Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac will allow," Mr. Preusse said, referring to the Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, respectively. "If you go any higher on discounts, then the folks at those Federal associations will reduce the appraisal value of the home."
Centex Real Estate Corporation, a Dallas home builder that entered the Southeast Florida market about a year ago, learned almost immediately that it also had to pay closing costs.
"It is a market-determined situation," said Centex's division manager, David Barclay. "Other builders use this as an incentive, buyers expect it here now as a common part of the purchase of a house, and so we have to do the same thing to be competitive."
Nevertheless, Centex, which closed on about 80 homes in its first year here, is more selective in its offerings. In its Boca Raton community of Hampton Park, where homes on quarter-acre lots cost $140,000 to $175,000, the company will pay for about 1.5 points to bring down the interest rate and an additional $2,500 toward closing costs.
But in a similar development farther north, where the market is not as built out, Centex offers no deals, Mr. Barclay said. Its Danforth Community near Stuart includes three- and four-bedroom homes on quarter-acre lots and in the same price range as the Hampton Park homes.
Yet offering as many incentive deals as possible seems to be more profitable than not. One of the first companies to pay buyers' closing costs in the greater West Palm Beach area also has been the area's leading home builder in the last few years.
DiVosta and Company, a builder based in the small town of Palm Beach Gardens just north of West Palm Beach, has paid for closing costs such as appraisal fees, credit reports and deed recordings for five years. Company officers say that amount usually equals about 4.5 percent of a mortgage.
DiVosta also includes several extra amenities in its base package -- items such as electrical security systems, microwave ovens, window treatments and automatic grass sprinkler systems. Those types of extras were part of what made DiVosta the leading builder in the Greater West Palm Beach area in 1989, with 764 closings and a dollar volume of $79.8 million, said its executive vice president, Robert S. Kairalla.
DiVosta's unit sales for the first half of 1990 are 18 percent above the same period of 1989, Mr. Kairalla said, despite an industry-wide decline of 29.7 percent.

 "We selfishly need the volume, and we do extra deals to get that volume because high volume helps us purchase truckloads of supplies at less cost," Mr. Kairalla said.
DiVosta's projects are big, but its home prices are comparable to those of other affordable housing in the area. Its newest project, the Oaks in Palm Beach Gardens, involves a plan for about 1,200 units on 320 acres.
Starting at $79,900 are patio homes -- four units to a building, each with its own enclosed patio. Single-family detached homes start at $155,000 and have three bedrooms, two bathrooms and a two-car garage.
Garden Oaks, another new DiVosta project also in Palm Beach Gardens, is completely made up of detached homes similar to those in the Oaks, but they start at $137,900. With DiVosta paying the closing costs, a buyer's initial investment would be about $13,800, and a monthly outlay of $1,390 that includes payment on a 10 percent, 30-year mortgage, a monthly maintenance fee and taxes.
As common as incentive deals are among the 40 or so major developers in Southeast Florida right now, they still do not match some offerings of past down markets, said Mr. Cannon of the Miami rsearch company.
"A few things I've seen in the past but haven't seen recently are free cars, the pre-payment of condo maintenance fees for a year, and payment of brokerage fees," he said.
But just about everything else goes.
"We will do practically any combination of things," said Mr. Wiener of Levitt Homes. "We've given free appliances, closing costs, price reductions. It all depends on what the customer will take."

HEADLINE: In Big Factory, Small Businesses Prosper

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
It is now 36 years since the mills of the Alexander Smith & Sons Carpet Company in Yonkers shut down. The factory, founded in 1845, was at its zenith during World War II, when with a work force of 7,000 people, it operated around the clock producing blankets and tents for the United States armed services.
Yet after the war, hampered by cheaper imports, outmoded equipment, higher wages and production costs, business began to decline. When the carpet company, Yonkers's largest employer, closed its doors in June 1954, 2,400 people lost their jobs. 
Now the two Nepperhan Avenue factory buildings are busy again - but with the buzz of many small workshops instead of one big one. The 34 tenants, employing about 300 people, include artists, cabinetmakers, hosiery manufacturers, meat spice manufacturers and a restaurant.
This revitalization is part of a trend that a city official says has brought a number of small firms into formerly empty space around Yonkers in recent years - years in which the city added a small number of manufacturing jobs while other cities in the region have continued to lose them.
 
Healthy Diversity
With diversity comes strength, said John Zakian, the executive director of the Yonkers Industrial Development Agency. ''Diversity helps keep the economy of Yonkers healthy,'' Mr. Zakian said. ''When you have a lot of different types of businesses operating, jobs are spread out, lessening the dependence on one employer. And if a recession hits one industry, others will still function.''
The rebirth of the carpet factory began in 1978, when the two factory buildings on Nepperhan Avenue, totalling 150,000 square feet, were bought by Allan Eisenkraft, president of the Yonkers Industrial Development Corporation. His original idea was to rent whole floors to a few tenants after completing the necessary rehabilitation work.
''Over the years after the carpet factory closed, the buildings had had a number of small companies as tenants,'' Mr. Eisenkraft said. ''But they were always half vacant and very dilapidated. The windows were a mess, for example. I had to replace about 6,000 panes of glass in 600 windows alone. When I began the project, a lot of people in the construction industry thought I was crazy.''
With the help of officials of the Yonkers Community Development Agency, which encourages developers efforts to rehabilitate vacant buildings, Mr. Eisenkraft said he was able to get two $100,000 long-term low-interest Federal loans.
''The rehab was a big job,'' Mr. Eisenkraft said. ''It took from 1978 to 1983 and cost several million dollars, yet I never lost sight of the light at the end of the tunnel because I was so certain there was a demand for what I was doing. I thought there were businesses out there who would need entire large floors for manufacturing, warehouse or distribution operations.''
Yet, to his chagrin, Mr. Eisenkraft said, ''when the time finally came, I found I couldn't rent full floors.''
 
'Nobody Was Interested'
''Nobody was interested,'' he said. ''Here I was sitting with one of the largest blocks of industrial space in the county and I had no tenants. But at the same time I started getting inquiries from people in light industry who wanted smaller space, so I thought I had nothing to lose and I tried subdividing one of the floors.''
The first tenant who signed a lease for 3,000 square feet of space in the factory building was a two-man architectural woodworking concern, Joseph Kenyson Ltd.
''And they're still tenants,'' Mr. Eisenkraft said, ''but they moved into 12,000 feet now and they have over 20 employees.''
So Mr. Eisenkraft continued to subdivide floors until he collected the diverse range of tenants he has now.
 
Top-Floor Community
The largest tenant, Hoisery Concepts, now occupies one-and-a-half floors, a total of 22,500 feet.
''Jay Kwon, the president of Hosiery Concepts came to the United States from Korea only four years ago,'' Mr. Eisenkraft said, ''and in that very short period of time he has built up a tremendously successful business.''
Artists studios are housed on the top floor. With its 12-foot windows and 16-foot ceiling, it is ideal for artists who need large, naturally lighted work spaces, Mr. Eisenkraft said.
One of the artist complexes on the top floor is run by Debra Sherwood, a sculptor from Seattle, who opened YoHo Studios two-and-a-half years ago.
Ms. Sherwood, who leases 7,500 square feet of space, sublets studio space to eight other artists. Ms. Sherwood, who managed a similar loft in Seattle, said she came to New York, ''because for an artist New York is Mecca.''
''But I knew enough not to look for studio space in Manhattan. My work is life-sized, and when I saw this converted factory, with its strong wooden floors, huge east and west windows and freight elevator, I was thrilled. It was what I needed for myself, and I knew I would find other artists it would attract and it had the added advantage of being so close to Manhattan.''
Subletting studio space, Ms. Sherwood said, ''is not only feasible as a business venture, it also allows interaction with other artists that is valuable.''
''Although, there is some risk attached: if you don't rent the space immediately you have to carry the rent yourself. But I have managed to fill this up in about nine months.''
The mill buildings generate new revenues for the city and attract other businesses to the area, Mr. Zakian said. ''Allan Eisenkraft is a risk-taker and we need risk-takers,'' he continued. ''In 1978 when he started renovating the mill buildings, it wasn't a popular concept. He took a tremendous risk. A lot of people are doing it now, but he ran way ahead of the pack.''
 
'A Microcosm'
The Eisenkraft buildings, Mr. Zakian said, ''are a microcosm of what is happening all over Yonkers.''
''We have more industrial space here than any place in the county,'' he said. ''And we have not lost manufacturers. In the last five years we've actually shown a slight gain in manufacturing in Yonkers.''
Mr. Eisenkraft, who recently received an award from the Yonkers Historical Society for the renovation of the mill buildings, is also involved with new development in the area. His project, the Nepperhan Mall, a 15,000-square-foot, two-story structure, housing six retail stores and five professional office suites was completed in March.
''Four of the stores are rented and the lease for the fifth is in the works,'' Mr. Eisenkraft said. ''My daughter, Sharon Rappaport, and her husband, Paul, are working with me now. The mall is largely in their hands. And despite the negative publicity Yonkers has had recently, we find once we can get a tenant to look at space, the chances are good that he'll sign a lease.''
Mr. Zakian said tenants used negative publicity surrounding Yonkers -mostly concerning the housing desegregation fight - as a negotiating ploy.
''The truth is that the external factors generating that kind of publicity, have nothing to do with the economic pluses of doing business in Yonkers and business people know that,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Tourism At Shore: Changing Patterns

BYLINE: By LEO H. CARNEY

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH state and local tourism officials say that the crowds have begun returning to the Jersey Shore after three years of being repelled by reports of coastal pollution, business somehow is just not the same, they say. The officials add that Shore tourism may never be what it once was.
Dozens of Shore communities along the coasts of Atlantic, Monmouth, Ocean and Cape May Counties that make up what used to be reported as New Jersey's $7.7 billion Shore tourism economy have been experiencing a less than expected increase in business.
When pressed these days, state and county tourism officials shy away from the once admittedly grandiose accounts of Shore tourism revenue and visitors, acknowledging, instead, that there never was a genuine study of Shore tourism, only unscientific ''surveys,'' and that an accurate monitoring mechanism to evaluate this economy will not exist any time soon.
Eugene Dilbeck, the new director of the State Division of Travel and Tourism, who assumed office only a few days before the summer season officially started, said many Shore businesses did better this summer than during the last three, either equaling last year's revenue or increasing it ''one or two points.'' 
Nevertheless, Mr. Dilbeck said, the increase in Shore resort rentals this year, which the division early last spring predicted would be 30 percent over the 1989 figure, turned out to be about 10 percent over all.
The decline in Shore tourism was so serious, Mr. Dilbeck said, that it would require a major marketing effort soon, one that would go beyond New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey and attempt to attract new visitors from states like Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.
 
Seeking Visitors From Other Areas
''We can't sit here and expect vacationers from New York and Philadelphia to come in record numbers anymore,'' Mr. Dilbeck said. ''We have to supplement tourism with more visitors from out of the region.''
Patricia Padula, a spokeswoman for the Monmouth County Office of Public Information and Tourism, said, ''The beach in New Jersey doesn't sell itself anymore.''
What Mr. Dilbeck and others said was that a sharp decline in tourism began to appear in 1987 with reports of medical wastes washing up on the beaches and other forms of coastal pollution. The pollution actually closed a total of only six or seven miles of ocean beachfront along the state's 127-mile coastline.
But the decline in tourism has continued, and most tourism officials agree this year that the slide has been indicative not merely of the vacationers' distrust of ocean quality, but also of longer-term socioeconomic changes. These include smaller families, working couples unable to coordinate vacation times, single parents and, most recently, a further tightening of the national economy.
In 1987 and 1988, Shore retailers and other businesses reported losses for those years of 60 percent or more as pollution incidents persisted and vacationers stayed away in droves.
Although even an official best estimate of how the Shore fared this summer will not be completed until next spring, officials said, interviews with Mr. Dilbeck and other tourism experts, merchants and beach managers showed that the regular yearly increases of 20 percent or more for many businesses, which were common during a good summer in the 1960's and 70's, had generally become a thing of the past.
As for this year, measuring business success at the Shore, Mr. Dilbeck said, has been ''a very subjective thing, depending on where you are and to whom you are talking.''
John F. Tesauro Jr., an owner with his family of Tesauro's Restaurant in Point Pleasant Beach, Ocean County, said he was doing ''an amount of business equal to last year's but with noticeably more families, mostly local residents and owners of second homes in the area, and we are selling less liquor.''
''Our bar business was down 15 percent in June from last June because these people are just not drinking as much at dinner,'' Mr. Tesauro said.
 
'They Just Keep On Going'
When traffic in the street backs up outside at 4 P.M., Mr. Tesauro said, ''it's day trippers coming from the beach, and they just keep on going.''
Dorcas Beatty, an owner with her mother, Dorcas Cotsworth, of a restaurant and outdoor cafe in Bay Head, said that business was on a par with last year's, but that an increase in menu prices this year had helped keep things equal with last year's income. ''We got a good crowd this summer, but people are not coming to Bay Head like they used to,'' Mrs. Beatty said.
''We own our building,'' she said. ''The reason you hear of so many restaurants going out of business at the Shore is that you can't turn a profit because of the high rents.''
As one other sign of a weakening economy, the Atlantic City casino industry posted a loss in the busy April through June period for the first time in the industry's 12 years of operation.
 
Decline in Beach Badges
In Ventnor, Capt. Billy Howarth, who has been a member of the community's beach patrol for 22 years, said he had witnessed a steady decline in beach badge revenues since 1985.
Five years ago, Captain Howarth said, the seaside municipality adjacent to Atlantic City took in $201,000 in beach badge revenue. When the final count for this year is in after Labor Day, he predicted that the total would be about $162,000, representing a $7,000 loss from last summer.
Captain Howarth's supervisor, Stan Bergman, the Chief of the patrol, described this summer as a good one, better than last year's as far as the size of crowds go. ''But the crowds these days are mostly on weekends,'' Chief Bergman said, ''and the weekdays are off from what they used to be. So is business.''
These losses have continued, the two men said, despite mostly clean bathing waters and, until last week, a hot, dry and inviting tourist season.
 
Tourism in Cape May
Established in 1781, Cape May has prided itself over the years in being the nation's oldest seaside resort. Because of that, Pamela Karwasinski, the manager of the Sevilla bed and breakfast inn, said the city was ''more laid back and people who come here are into the history and the reputation of Cape May.''
But Ms. Karwasinski said the trade at the 1879 inn, unlike that in previous years, ''was mostly weekend guests'' with repeat visitors who stayed for a weekend or a week two or three times over the summer.
''Our weekday business is down, and the Fourth of July holiday was a disaster because it came in the middle of the week and people were not sure what to do,'' she said. ''One of the first things people ask me when they call for reservations is how is the water, is there anything floating in it?''
 
Shorter Stays Noticed
Whatever the reasons, the changing trend in Shore tourism, which finally began to be accepted last year as the economic decline continued, has now become part of the fabric of doing business at the Shore. Ms. Padula said the trend was that young couples or families were either staying for regular weekends or long weekends or coming only for the day.
''It seems when they have a week or two to vacation together, they are flying off somewhere,'' she said.
Ms. Padula said the tourism industry ''has finally realized that this trend is now our trade and that we are marketing to it and trying to extend it to more of the year by promoting short travel packages and things like murder mystery weekends in the fall at the bed and breakfast inns, or Victorian Christmas weekends.''
In Wildwood, Cape May County, Jane Phillips, the tourism director, said business was good this summer, but ''slow on lodging, not as strong on room reservations and more spontaneous as far as finding a place to stay.''
Along the Monmouth County coast, many large old hotels have failed to bring in enough visitors in the last decade, Ms. Padula and others said, and have converted to condominiums, filling their dining rooms with catered affairs instead of hotel dinner guests. Others have gone out of business.
''In some areas, such as Asbury Park,'' Ms. Padula said, ''we don't know what the next two or three years will be like. But we hope the water stays clean.''

HEADLINE: Affordability in the Dearest U.S. Market

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN SHARP

 BODY:
When Casa Guadalupe, with its 22 apartments, opened recently in a rough East Los Angeles neighborhood, nearly 300 families applied. Small wonder; the two- and three-bedroom units had dishwashers, air-conditioning, balconies and enclosed patios - unusual upscale amenities in a low-income housing project bordering a major freeway.
''Most of the applicants were too poor to qualify,'' said Carmela G. Lacayo, president of El Pueblo Community Development Corporation, which developed the project; only 35 families could afford the $300 to $500 a month rent.
This experience underscores the disparity between incomes and housing costs in California, where home prices soared to the highest levels in the country before beginning to turn downward last year. Speaking of the strong demand for more affordable housing in the state, Jim Wilson, a financial analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco who follows the building industry, said: ''It's a huge, effectively untapped market.'' 
In the last year, goaded by government regulators and community activists, private lending institutions have flooded into this market by committing billions of dollars to finance low-income rental projects and affordable housing developments.
* In December, the Bank of America, based in San Francisco, announced a $50 million commitment that it said it would make every year to finance primarily low-income rental projects in the state. The bank lends to nonprofit developers at interest rates one point below the market rate.
* First Interstate Bank, based in Los Angeles, recently set aside $20 million in below-market-rate loans for low-income housing projects.
* In March, Wells Fargo Bank, based in San Francisco, increased its commitment with a seven-year, $1 billion lending program for affordable and low-income housing projects; since 1986 it has spent $137 million on similar projects.
* In April, Security Pacific, based in Los Angeles, pledged $2.4 billion for a program over the next 10 years; it is believed to be the largest such program of its kind.
One of the main reasons for the recent surge of such loan programs is criticism of lenders' performance under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977. The Federal law, meant to prevent redlining - limiting credit in poor neighborhoods - requires federally insured banks and thrifts to meet their communities' credit needs. But it was rarely enforced, said Jim Yacenda, community investment officer of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco.
Under the law, bank mergers and acquisitions could be challenged at hearings. Last year, community activists challenged Security Pacific's proposal to acquire 20 percent of Mitsui Manufacturers Bank on the ground that the former's Community Reinvestment Act lending was insufficient. In November, the bank met with representatives of 16 California community groups and in April it announced its $2.4 billion program.
''After the success of some advocacy groups, regulators started putting a lot more emphasis on the act,'' said Mr. Yacenda. They set up a system to rate an institution on its community record, though the ratings were not made public.
Under Federal rules adopted last year as part of the law budgeting money to close ailing thrift institutions, the Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies last month began reviewing - with ratings to be made public - the performance of lenders in providing services in and to poor neighborhoods.
''That was the wake-up call,'' said Donald A. Mullane, executive vice president of corporate community development for Bank of America.
''From a pure business standpoint,'' said one banker, ''it's become necessary for institutions to develop some type of program if they want to remain competitive.''
The competition to help less affluent home buyers as well as the working poor comes when fewer residents can afford to rent or buy. In the last decade, the median price of a home in California has doubled, to $196,521 last year, more than twice the national median of $93,100.
In that same decade, the real personal income of a California worker grew by only 9 percent, to $14,786, according to the Graduate School of Management, University of California, Los Angeles. The California Data Center, a state agency, said the median household income in 1988 - the latest available figure - was $30,200.
Because of the growing gap between earnings and home prices, only 18 percent of Californians can afford to buy a median-priced house, according to the California Association of Realtors (nationally, says the National Association of Realtors, it is 48 percent). As a result, 46 percent of Californians rent.
In the last decade, rents have risen as much as 110 percent in Los Angeles, which has a rent-controlled market. In its metropolitan area the median rent is currently $615 a month.
''The lower middle class and working poor are squeezed tighter than ever before,'' said Anita Landecker, director of California programs for the Local Initiative Support Corporation, a nationwide nonprofit group that provides or arranges financing for low-income housing.
The management of low-income projects, such as the one in East Los Angeles, requires that renters earn at least $14,600 a year, which is 50 percent of the median income in Los Angeles and considered very low-income. According to Federal Housing and Urban Development statistics, low-income applicants must earn at least $21,500 a year.
Based on the Los Angeles figures, very-low-income earners should spend no more than $365 a month for rent and utilities, according to HUD guidelines. However, the cost of building low-income units would make unsubsidized rents about twice what very-low-income renters can afford. Thus below-market-rate bank loans often complement state or Federal agencies that specialize in such projects. Government-assisted low-interest loans, deferred loans and tax credits make up the balance of the funds needed to build a low-income project.
Because the projects tend to be developed by nonprofit community groups, a developer's share does not have to be factored in, so such ventures can be profitable for lenders who invest in them.
''In most cases,'' said Mr. Yacenda, ''it is some of the best stuff in an institutions's portfolio.''
Traditionally, low-income housing projects have been viewed as high-risk propositions. But, said Gretchen Schaffner, senior loan officer for Low Income Housing Fund in San Francisco, although such projects tend to draw tenants who live on the edge of poverty, ''these are performing loans.''
Bankers and other lenders have realized that financing lower-income projects provides not just profits, but also improved public images.
Other factors play a role. The nation's savings and loan crisis has withdrawn a substantial amount of money from California's building and land acquisition activities and the commercial and higher-priced residential sectors of the state's real estate market have cooled considerably in the last nine months. With financing scarce for higher-priced developments, builders and lenders are discovering strong demand in the previously overlooked low-income sector.
Lending institutions that do not have large pools of capital or staff experienced in low-income projects often invest in financial pools, such as the California Equity Fund. In June, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation - Freddie Mac - pledged $10 million to build dwellings for very-low-income Californians. It challenged corporations to match that investment by contributing to the California Equity Fund, designed by the Local Initiative Support Corporation. For every $2 million raised in California, Freddie Mac has pledged $1 million. The Local Initiative Support Corporation hopes that its model will become the foundation for a new national housing policy.
Some California thrifts have long financed low-income rental projects through the Savings Associations Mortgage Company, a lending consortium formed by 11 thrifts in 1971. Since then, it has pooled $215 million in loans that have built 7,600 housing units in the state, including shelters for the elderly, troubled teen-agers, AIDS victims, developmentally disabled and the homeless.
Consortium staff members find low-income housing projects to finance, then invite member institutions to finance all or part of the loans. The consortium gets a fee from participating institutions for lending and servicing the loans. In the last 10 years it has had no foreclosures or deliquent loans - a better record than most of its thrift members, said Mr. Yacenda.
In the last nine months, the group's membership has increased 55 percent, to 75 financial institutions.
''We expect 1990 to be our best year ever, because of the increased interest,'' said Doris Schinder, president of SAMCO.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
SANCTIONS STARTING TO PINCH IRAQ ECONOMY, U.S. AIDES SAY; U.N.'S DIPLOMACY WELCOMED

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26

 BODY:
Amid tentative new stirrings of diplomatic activity in the Middle East crisis, American officials said today that economic sanctions against Iraq, while already starting to have some effect, will probably not have a decisive impact for months.
President Bush is counting on the sanctions, imposed by the United Nations three weeks ago and backed in the last 24 hours by a full naval blockade imposed with the Security Council's approval, to force President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to pull back from his conquest of Kuwait and to release foreign hostages.
Brent Scowcroft, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, insisted that those demands were non-negotiable. But he described as ''clearly acceptable'' plans by Javier Perez de Cuellar, the United Nations Secretary General, to attempt to negotiate a peace settlement. #3 Dependents Held Back American, French and British warships shadowed Iraqi vessels in the waters of the Middle East today but took no action to halt them. 
In Baghdad, the Iraqi authorities freed 55 dependents of staff members assigned to the United States Embassy in Kuwait, and all but 3 of them crossed the border into Turkey, the State Department said tonight.
A department official said she did not know why the three dependents, all young men, were held back by the Iraqis. She said the young men were on their way back to the Iraqi capital. Baghdad refused earlier in the day to free 54 staff members along with the dependents.
Iraqi troops tightened the pressure on American and other embassies in Kuwait, which are defying orders from Baghdad to close, but took no direct action to capture them.
 
'There Are Bread Lines'
With the situation relatively calm at the embassies and at shipping points, the situation in the Persian Gulf took on a slightly less ominous tone.
John H. Kelly, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, said on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press'' about the trade embargo against Iraq: ''We know that internal food prices are going through the roof for certain commodities like rice, sugar and so on. We know that there are bread lines.''
But other officials at the State Department and at the Pentagon, who insisted on not being identified, warned it could take from four months to a year before Iraq would experience widespread hunger or other distress of an intensity that would force President Hussein to reconsider his basic policies. #4 More Britons Seized ''It would be a serious mistake to give the American people the idea that this technique will bring fast results,'' an Administration specialist said. ''It won't do that.''
The United Nations announced that Secretary General Perez de Cuellar planned to meet Tariq Aziz, Iraq's Foreign Minister, in Amman, Jordan, on Thursday ''in order to engage in a full exchange of views on the crisis.''
A spokeswoman for the world organization, Nadia Younes, declined to comment about the possibility of a trip to Baghdad by Mr. Perez de Cuellar. President Saddam Hussein of Iraq was quoted on Saturday as saying that the Secretary General was ''always welcome'' to visit the Iraqi capital.
More Westerners were removed from their homes in Kuwait and Iraq by the Iraqi Army, perhaps for use as human shields. The Foreign Office in London said four more Britons had been seized on Saturday, including a woman expected to give birth in two or three weeks, bringing the total to 147. Eight more French citizens were also seized.
The Soviet Union, which voted at the United Nations early Saturday to allow members' warships to use force to uphold sanctions against Iraq, said it would not do so itself. Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Foreign Minister, said Moscow would ''assume its share of responsibility'' but had ''no plans to use force or to take part in such operations.''
 
Blowing Off Propellers
In a joint statement with Roland Dumas, the French Foreign Minister, who is visiting the Soviet Union, Mr. Shevardnadze called on Iraq to pull its troops out of Kuwait.
British, French and United States warships are already challenging scores of merchant ships each day. Now they are under orders to stop any suspicious Iraqi tanker. But some naval experts think that could be easier said than done, unless the blockaders are willing to contemplate sinking the vessels.
''Ideas like blowing off their propellers are just not practical,'' said a merchant captain docked at the Persian Gulf port of Dubai.
For the moment, said a Navy spokesman in Washington, Chris Bauman, ''There is no action.''
 
Power and Water Cut Off
In Kuwait, Iraqi troops continued to ring several embassies, including that of the United States. Iraqi authorities reportedly entered the Chinese Embassy in Kuwait today, Administration officials said.
Ambassador W. Nathaniel Howell and his skeleton crew of fewer than 10 aides were without electricity, running water or local telephone service, as were several of the other missions.
But Mr. Kelly, who spoke with him by satellite telephone link this morning, said Mr. Howell was in good spirits and predicted that the embassy could hold out for weeks, using an emergency generator and stores of water and groceries.
Britain, France, West Germany, Canada, Japan, Norway and Denmark are among the countries whose embassies are attempting to resist Baghdad's order to close.
 
Diplomats' Immunity Stripped
William Waldegrave, a Minister at the Foreign Office, told the British Broadcasting Corporation that the British mission had enough supplies of food and fuel to withstand a long siege. ''They are staying on,'' he said. Iraq, which invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and subsequently annexed it, says that Kuwait no longer exists and thus is not entitled to embassies. It has stripped the remaining diplomats of their immunity.
There was more talk about diplomatic maneuvering today, especially on the Sunday morning television interview shows, than in some time.
Speaking on the ABC News program ''This Week,'' former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger said he thought President Hussein was seeking a way out of the impasse. He said, ''If we remain firm and if we keep open the prospect that we will not stop, he will settle.''
 
'Despot and a Tyrant'
Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was national security adviser in the Carter White House, predicted that ''some form of an intermediary regional solution'' would be found and agreed with Mr. Kissinger that military action in the region was unlikely.
But Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said after church services near her country retreat at Chequers, northwest of London, that there could be ''no negotiation with a person who by force has taken someone else's country.'' Mrs. Thatcher, Mr. Bush's vocal ally in the Persian Gulf crisis, described Mr. Hussein as ''a despot and a tyrant'' who ''must be stopped.''
Asked to assess the chances for a negotiated settlement, Mr. Scowcroft said in Kennebunkport, Me., where President Bush is on vacation: ''I think the chances are good that our strategy will succeed. Just wait and see.''
The Iraqi press agency said the country was facing severe shortages of food and medicine and accused the United States of committing a ''crime against humanity'' by organizing the blockade. The agency said the Iraqi Red Crescent Society had appealed to the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva for assistance, on the ground that medical supplies and food for humanitarian purposes had been excluded from the sanctions.
 
Iraqi Food Imports
But the international committee said that as of late this evening in Geneva, it had not received any request for assistance from Iraq.
A spokeswoman, Karen S. Saddler, said in a telephone interview that the international committee had been unsuccessfully seeking Baghdad's permission to send teams to Iraq and Kuwait ever since the invasion. The committee's delegate general for Middle Eastern affairs, Angelo Gnaedinger, flew to Baghdad to appeal for permission to send Red Cross personnel to both countries, Ms. Saddler said tonight, and is still negotiating with Iraqi officials.
A State Department official said that according to information available here, no Iraqis appeared to be starving and that therefore no humanitarian food shipments were justified now. ''This is not a famine situation,'' he said.
Iraq depends on imports for about three-quarters of its food, including poultry raised with imported feed grain. As of July 25, the Iraqi Government's stockpiles held enough rice for three months of normal consumption, enough wheat for two months, enough beans and barley for a month and less than two weeks of corn, according to John P. Parker, an economist at the United States Department of Agriculture who specializes in Middle Eastern food supplies.
 
Shipments Through Jordan
The corn crop in Iraq is due for harvest next month, and should provide enough for a month and a half of normal consumption, he said.
Iraq is also expecting a bumper crop of fruits and vegetables this autumn from its northern region of Kurdistan, said another American official who insisted on not being identified. After many years of civil unrest, the region was quiet this year and agriculture prospered.
Some food has reached Iraq by truck across Jordan and by air, and it is widely anticipated that traditional local trade will continue with Iran and Turkey. Even when Iran and Iraq were at war, such commercial activity never completely stopped.
All of those resources could be considerably extended, of course, by the type of rationing that Iraq has already imposed, with troops enforcing regulations and black market activity punishable by summary execution.
Kuwait is even more dependent than Iraq on imported food, and Kuwait's warehouses, once full of canned goods, appear to have been looted by the Iraqi Army, said Nasser al-Rashed, chairman and managing director of Kuwait's partially state-owned Public Warehousing Company. He fled to Saudi Arabia on Aug. 5 and spoke in a telephone interview.

HEADLINE: In the Drive to Revive Schools, Better Teachers but Too Few

SERIES: TOMORROW'S TEACHERS: FIRST OF THREE ARTICLES.

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA

 BODY:
In the struggle to revive America's schools, the news is bittersweet. Despite growing evidence that more and better qualified people are choosing teaching, educators say there are nowhere near enough of them.
The nation still suffers from an acute shortage of academically talented teachers, minority teachers and math and science teachers. These teachers are needed more than ever, given an economy with less room for dropouts, a growing demand for sophisticated technical knowledge and soaring enrollments of minority children.
Yet teachers face a cruel paradox: Americans tell them the profession is vitally important yet continue to discount it. Before and after entering the classroom, teachers are confronted with the evidence that teaching remains a second-class profession of low pay, stifling regulations and restricted mobility. 
Take Amy Hanson, a B-plus student at Illinois State University at Normal. She wants to be a teacher and her parents approve. But Amy's sister, the ''brain'' in the family, wants to be a teacher, too.
''My parents say, 'Amy's going to be a teacher and that's nice,' '' she said. ''My parents say my sister's smart, she should do something else.''
 
A Trend Gradually Reverses
After more than a decade of decline in the numbers and quality of new teachers, experts say that more, different and smarter teachers are now flocking to America's schools. Nationwide alarm about education has spurred states to raise salaries and toughen standards for teachers. The widespread publicity has tapped a vein of idealism, attracting teachers from nontraditional backgrounds.
Students from elite colleges are volunteering for teaching programs modeled on the Peace Corps, like Teach for America, and enrollment in teacher education programs has been rising.
The annual number of new teachers climbed 20 percent from 1984 to 1986, rising to 126,000 from 105,000, the National Center for Education Statistics says. Many experts say that trend has continued, although national figures reflecting it are still being compiled.
The increases reversed 10 straight years of decline, from 216,000 new teachers in 1975, the first year the center began keeping such statistics. There are more than 2.3 million teachers in the country's public schools.
The recruits tend to brush aside the considerable deterrents to teaching. In dozens of interviews across the country, prospective teachers echoed the sentiments of Dana Wollenberg, a 21-year-old education major at Illinois State.
 
Good Intentions Not Enough
''I've always done very well in school, so my father wanted me to go to law school or be a doctor or go into computers,'' she said. ''For me, when I look into the future, I don't necessarily see computers but children, the best future that we have.''
These new teachers must meet higher standards imposed in the last five years by nearly every state.
The states acted after years of indications that the quality of new teachers, as well as their numbers, had declined from the mid-1970's to mid-1980's. Several studies concluded that in those years a higher proportion of academically weak students enrolled in teacher education programs.
Now 46 states are using or developing tests that students must pass before they can enter a teacher education program or get a teaching certificate, according to the Rand Corporation's Center for the Study of the Teaching Profession. At least 27 states require a minimum grade average or a minimum score on standardized tests before students can be admitted to teacher education.
Although few of these tests actually measure teaching ability, there is evidence that the new standards have helped weed out the least qualified. The American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education reports that in 1988 teacher education students typically ranked at the 70th percentile in their high school classes, maintained a B or better grade average in college and had a combined score on the S.A.T. test of 950, slightly above the national average. Less objectively, the reports accumulating from teacher education colleges around the country indicate that better students are signing up for teaching.
 
Numbers Up, but Not Prestige
But many teacher education experts and several recent reports conclude there is still a long way to go. Although standards have risen, many argue that they must go higher.
''We must expect higher-order learning from a greater number of kids than ever in the past,'' said Judith Lanier, on leave from her post as Michigan State University's dean of education to lead a statewide project to improve public schools and teacher training. ''That requires ambitious teaching, and we have to be more selective in choosing which teachers get in.''
An annual nationwide survey of college freshmen by researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles found that more students want to become teachers, but more aspiring teachers also come from the colleges that are least prestigious and academically selective. Although states set a minimum standard for entrance to teacher education programs, that standard is not exceptionally high: between a C-plus and B-minus grade average.
Moreover, too few members of minority groups and too few people with math and science backgrounds want to become teachers. Last year, 81 percent of teacher education students were female and 92 percent were white. Only 4.7 percent were black, 1.6 percent were Hispanic and 1.5 percent were Asian.
Two-thirds of schools surveyed in the past several years reported shortages of math and science teachers, said Linda Darling-Hammond of Columbia University's Teachers College. And the National Center for Education Statistics found that substantial numbers of teachers who did not major in math or science in college are nonetheless teaching math and science, pressed into service by the shortage.
The need for teachers becomes even more urgent as policy makers anticipate a wave of retirements. Half of those teaching in 1987-88 were age 40 or older, the National Center for Education Statistics says. Many will be leaving within the next decade, and a disproportionate number of those will be the most experienced and skillful teachers, primarily talented women who had few other career choices when they entered the field.
 
Education? Professor Laughs
Perhaps the most formidable barrier to finding more and better teachers is reflected in the experience of Cynthia Olson, a 21-year-old Illinois State student. She said her philosophy professor laughed out loud when she said she was majoring in elementary education.
Society continues to look down on teachers, and partly as a result of that attitude, the working conditions insure that many teachers give up the profession.
Discouraging tales of ridicule and derision can be found, both from idealistic college students and from those who have switched to teaching in mid-career. Friends of Lynn Klenk, an Illinois State education student, tell her that she is really majoring in fingerpainting.
Robin Jackson always wanted to be a teacher but let her family and friends talk her out of it. ''Everyone told me, 'You don't want to go into teaching; there's no money in it,' '' said Ms. Jackson, who at the age of 31 is just now leaving her job as an administrative assistant at the World Bank to become a teacher. ''All my friends looked down at the profession.''
One obvious measure of teaching's status is its continuing low pay. Teachers' salaries have risen across the country in the last decade after years of stagnation. The National Center for Education Statistics calculates that they have risen 19 percent since 1981, after a 14 percent decline, when adjusted for inflation, from 1973 to 1981. At least 30 states have set minimum starting salaries, and public school teachers earned an average of $30,788 in 1988, the National Center for Education Statistics says.
Yet that is still below what comparably educated people can earn in many other careers. And for many talented people who could become lawyers, doctors or scientists, a teacher's salary and a long summer vacation are not enough to compensate for the lack of autonomy or career mobility.
 
Frustrated After 6 Months
JoAnn Smith is the kind of teacher recruiters are searching for: smart, black and eager to teach inner-city children. But after her first six months as a fourth-grade teacher in Washington, D.C., she is already talking about leaving the classroom.
She is not daunted by the horrors she sees every day, from crack babies to victims of child abuse. What frustrates her is a common complaint of conscientious teachers: rules she cannot change that seem to work against her students' educational interests. For example, she found that because of space limitations the only way she could get students who needed extra help into summer school was to fail them.
''I'd rather be a consultant and be able to give my opinion freely or design curriculum,'' she said. Although the 23-year-old Howard University graduate knows that improvements are in the works, she doubts they will come in time to give her the power to make changes at her own school. ''Something is going to be done, but I doubt I'll be around to see it done successfully.''
Most teachers spend their days teaching material they did not choose and trying to conform to rules or educational requirements they had no hand in shaping. Unlike many other professionals, teachers often have the same duties 30 years into their jobs that they had the first year they entered the classroom. Although some districts are adopting ''master teacher'' programs for the most skillful teachers, for most the main route to promotion and higher pay remains leaving the classroom to become a principal or bureaucrat.
''We built the job of teaching for young, energetic women who were going to teach for only a few years'' before getting married, Professor Lanier said. ''The working conditions are geared for a different era.''

HEADLINE: Already Weak, New York Area Is Spending Less

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
Confronted with a fragile economy and haunted perhaps by the slide of the 1970's, consumers in the New York region are cutting spending and delaying purchases in a display of frugality that seems likely to make the slump worse.
''We're talking about net declines of a magnitude that we have not seen since the last recession,'' said Isaac Lagnado, director of research for the International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group.
According to the council, general merchandise sales declined by 2.7 percent in New York City and the northern suburbs, 8.2 percent on Long Island, 5.3 percent in Newark, 1.8 percent in Bergen and Passaic Counties in New Jersey and 0.1 percent in southwest Connecticut in the first five months of 1990 from a similar period last year.
 
Cutting a Costly Swath
The decline's severity would be even clearer if the figures were adjusted for inflation, which was about 3 percent for such goods, Mr. Lagnado said.
The spending falloff, which began last year in the city and spread to the suburbs, is cutting a costly swath. It is compelling department stores to hold seemingly constant sales, causing restaurants to adopt downscale menus and eroding demand for a broad range of service businesses, from advertising agencies and law firms to dry cleaners and hair cutters. 
It is also taking a toll on state and local governments, which have had to cope with fallen sales-tax revenues.
Retail sales, which are growing sluggishly nationally, are far weaker in some regions of the country, including New York. Economists attribute the local weakness in spending partly to continuing job losses on Wall Street since the stock market plunge of October 1987 and a slowing of wage increases and rising prices, which have left many people with less purchasing power. But they say it is also a consequence of the psychological response to the prospect of prolonged bad times.
''A great deal of this has to do with expectations,'' said Robert A. Dye, director of state forecasting for the WEFA Group, a forecasting service in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. ''Consumers have the expectation of a weak economy, they start to cut back and that can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy.''
At the Bally store at the World Financial Center in Battery Park City recently, a salesman, Ray Vera, was surrounded by $1,400 leather coats and $240 shoes but no customers. ''We're being hit hard,'' he said. ''It's devastating.''
Last August, the store took in about $9,000, he said. This month he hopes it will gross $6,000.
Mr. Vera attributed sluggish sales to a decrease in customer traffic and a new sense of frugality. ''Where they used to buy the $240 shoes, now they want the $170 pair,'' he said. ''Everybody's worried.''
A few doors away at Cignal, which sells European-style casual clothing, an employee who spoke only on the condition of anonymity said, ''people are buying a lot more conservatively.''
 
Reasons for Consumer Caution
''Right now should be a hot period -the back-to-school, back-to-fall shoppers,'' she said. ''But it hasn't happened yet. Maybe it will in September.'' There is ample reason for consumer caution. The region lost 13,000 jobs in the first five months of 1990, the first regional employment decline since 1982. Wages, which had increased 6.4 percent in 1988, rose only 4.8 percent last year. And the average annual pay in financial services jobs, which tripled from 1979 to 1988, dropped by more than $3,000 last year, to $75,243.
Personal bankruptcies rose 23 percent in New Jersey, 27 percent in New York and 38 percent in Connecticut in 1989 from the previous year. Mortgage deliquencies and foreclosures are up.
Unemployment, though edging higher, has remained relatively low. But that does not seem to be enough to stop many people from recalling the economic difficulties of a decade ago.
 
Scary Memories of the 70's
''People do remember that long downturn in the 70's,'' said Rae D. Rosen, regional economist for the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York.
Over the last three and a half years, the consumer confidence index of the Conference Board, a business research organization, has moved within a relatively narrow range for the nation. In contrast, during that time the index dropped to 64.6 from a high of 160 for New England and to 95.1 from 126.3 for the Middle Atlantic states. Below 90 is considered a sign of a greatly weakened economy.
Retail sales grew by 4.6 percent in the nation in the first five months of this year over the same period last year, unadjusted for inflation, according to the Commerce Department. While they increased in New Jersey by 5.1 percent, New York State showed only a 2.2 percent gain and New York City and Long Island had only a 0.9 percent gain, well below the inflation rate.
In May, national retail sales grew by 2.1 percent over the previous May, according to the WEFA Group. New Jersey posted a 4.3 percent increase, but New York State and Connecticut declined by 2 percent and 3.1 percent respectively. Of the states reporting monthly figures, only Kansas, Massachusetts and Indiana were worse.
 
Specter of Higher Energy Costs
Mr. Lagnado said that the shopping center council's statistics, which are based on a survey of large department stores and include purchases of items like clothing and appliances but not gasoline or food, are a more sensitive indicator of discretionary spending than broader measures of sales. He said the organization's figures showed much greater weakness locally.
One of the few areas in the region to register gains, according to the council, was Jersey City, which had a 23.1 percent increase in merchandise sales in the first five months of 1990, on top of a 16.3 percent gain last year. Mr. Lagnado attributed it to new retail and residential development there.
Economists say the region's problems are compounded by the prospect of higher energy prices, which would cut even further into disposable income, and a mixed tourist season.
Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, said he believed some of the weakness in New York City was due to the popularity of warehouse discount stores and catalogue shopping.
 
Sales at Macy's
He said he thought the city would continue to be a center for high-value goods, particularly clothing.
Even so, the Mideast group that bought Saks Fifth Avenue recently told bankers that it expected flat sales at the Manhattan store for several years.
Garrick-Aug Associates, a store-leasing firm, reports that average rents in Manhattan have dropped from more than $65 a square foot in 1988 to less than $55 a square foot now.
At Macy's last week, Delysia Barnett was buying a dining room set. She had already been shopping for a year, she said, and was drawn to the store by the sale. ''See that? Half off,'' she said.
 
Big-Ticket Items Suffer
Sales of automobiles and big-ticket items like electronics, appliances and furniture soon suffer when the economy weakens. So do expenditures for services, which could hurt New York City especially hard.
The city's once-thriving restaurant industry has been pinched for months. Clark Wolf, a restaurant consultant, said he believed people were eating out as much as ever, but ordering simpler food in restaurants closer to home.
Bruce Schaller, director of policy development for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, said nine of the the city's 50 black-car companies had either gone out of business or merged with other car companies. He attributed the shakeout to sagging profits among the corporate clients who hire black-car companies to provide large sedans on request.
Sitting in a barber's chair flipping through a magazine, the assistant manager of Great Expectations hair cutters in the World Trade Center, Elizabeth Fonseca, said business was not what it used to be.
 
'It Has Just Kept Geting Worse'
''After that first crash,'' she said, ''it slowed down and since then it has just kept getting worse.''
As a result, sales-tax revenue in New York City has also slowed. Allen Proctor, executive director of the New York State Financial Control Board, said that in the 1988 fiscal year, sales-tax revenue in New York City grew by 2.2 percent after adjustment for inflation. The next year, he said, there was no growth. And in 1990, it is likely to have declined by 1.5 percent.
Other parts of the region felt sales tax falloffs last fall and winter.
As governments struggle to close the budget gaps, taxes have gone up, which will further diminish spending power at a time it is already weakening.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
With Embargo, U.S. Farmers Lose One of Their Best Clients

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ROBBINS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., Aug. 26

 BODY:
The Middle East crisis is confronting farmers, the United States Treasury and taxpayers with costs that go far beyond the rising price of oil.
For farmers, higher oil prices take a heavy toll because petroleum is not only their fuel but also the basic ingredient in many agricultural chemicals.
And the American actions after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait have prompted Iraq to stop payment on nearly $2 billion it owes the United States Treasury for previous agricultural shipments.
For many farmers, the embargo on exports to Iraq means they are cut off from one of their better grain customers at a time when good clients are sorely needed. Baghdad had become a $1-billion-a-year buyer of American agricultural products. 
 
Rice Growers Are Hit Hardest
The loss of the Iraqi market will be hardest for rice growers and the states where rice is grown, principally Arkansas, California, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Iraq had become one of the world's largest importers of rice, buying most of it from the United States.
Last year Iraq bought 538,000 tons of American rice, worth about $180 million. That represented nearly 18 percent of all United States rice exports.
One reason the Iraqis bought so much American rice apparently was the United States' willingness to sell it on credit. But that credit was jeopardized in September 1989 by the discovery of irregularities at an Atlanta branch of an Italian bank that had lent money to Iraq.
This year Baghdad had bought 269,000 tons of rice, worth about $93 million, when the loan problems surfaced at the Atlanta branch of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro. The Agriculture Department's Commodity Credit Corporation had already granted $500 million of a requested total of $1 billion in 1990 loan guarantees. Consideration of the remaining $500 million has been suspended while an investigation of the bank continues.
 
Lending Authority Exceeded
Several of the bank's Atlanta executives were dismissed when it was learned that they had advanced letters of credit totaling $2.6 billion over several years, far beyond their lending authority, to cover Iraqi imports. Some of the loans had been guaranteed by the Commodity Credit Corporation.
Investigators from the Agriculture Department looked into several deals involving the bank and covered by Government guarantees. They found several irregularities, focusing on the fact that Iraq always seemed to pay substantially higher prices for its purchases than anyone else. Iraq also demanded ''after-sales services,'' which often included demands that sellers provide non-agricultural products like truck parts and tires free.
''If that also covered cash payments and kickbacks, it would be a serious matter,'' said an Agriculture Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ''We have no indication yet what happened. But we felt there were enough indications of irregularities that they needed further checking.''
 
Big Crops, Shrinking Profits
The break with Iraq could hardly have come at a worse time for American rice growers, said Andrew Aaronson, rice specialist with the department's World Agricultural Outlook Board.
''Prices are down,'' he noted. ''We've seen good crops around the world, among all major suppliers and even among many major importers.'' The price of long-grain rice from Thailand, for example, at about $265 a metric ton, has fallen more than 22 percent from last year's level of about $340.
Iraq's American purchases of wheat did not loom as large, but they were still important, particularly to Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado and Nebraska, where most of the hard red winter wheat favored by the Iraqis is produced.
Last year the Iraqis bought about one million metric tons of wheat, worth $164 million, and this year had bought about 500,000 tons, worth $89 million, when their credit was suspended.
 
'One of Our Better Markets'
''They bought only a little over 3 percent of our wheat exports,'' said Edward Allen, a wheat specialist, ''but even so Iraq was one of our better markets. Losing it was not as bad as it would be to lose the Soviet Union, but it's not insignificant.''
Farmers and exporters are especially sensitive to the loss of a customer this year, when the United States is producing its third-largest wheat crop ever and when world wheat production is setting a record, expected to reach 384 million metric tons and exceed last year's crop by nearly 50 million metric tons.
With supplies rising, prices have fallen. Export prices at Gulf of Mexico ports, for example, are running at about $125 a ton, down 26 percent from last year. #3-Country Deal Shaken A further uncertainty for the Treasury involves an unusual three-way deal made before the Iraqi invasion, in which Kuwait promised to pay for 200,000 tons of American wheat for Egypt.
Government credit guarantees had been temporarily suspended because of a lag in Egyptian payments. Kuwait then came to Egypt's aid, agreeing to lend it the money to pay for the wheat.
Some of that wheat was still on the high seas when Iraq invaded Kuwait, an Agriculture Department official said. ''We are still hopeful that the transaction will go on as planned,'' with the Kuwait Government in exile making good on the promised payments, he said.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
U.N. Leader to Meet With Iraqi Minister

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 26

 BODY:
The United Nations Secretary General, who said this weekend that he would personally intervene in the Persian Gulf crisis, is to meet with the Iraqi Foreign Minister on Thursday in Amman, the Jordanian capital, a spokeswoman said today.
The Arab League's representative to the United Nations, Clovis Maksoud, greeted the initiative by Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar as ''something that definitely reduces our level of anxiety.''
Mr. Perez de Cuellar ''inspires a great deal of confidence among the Iraqis in view of the long-established relations that he made during the Iran-Iraq conflict,'' Mr. Maksoud said in Washington. ''I am sure that he will be able to elicit a positive response'' from Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi Foreign Minister. 
In Washington, Brent Scowcroft, the White House national security adviser, said the Bush Administration would have ''no problem'' with an attempt by the Secretary General to mediate in the crisis.
 
U.S. Insisting on Pullout
But Mr. Scowcroft observed that the United States is demanding an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, a condition that Baghdad has been unwilling to meet even as it has signaled a possible willingness to negotiate with Washington.
Once an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait is accomplished, the United States is ready to ''talk about anything,'' he said.
The United Nations spokeswoman, Nadia Younes, said Mr. Perez de Cuellar was planning ''a full exchange of views on the crisis'' in the gulf with Mr. Aziz. Mr. Perez de Cuellar announced on Saturday that he would seek a meeting with Mr. Aziz as he ended a visit to Bogota, Colombia, before returning to New York.
The Secretary General said ''that the time had arrived for him to start a diplomatic process aimed at solving the critical situation in the gulf area,'' Ms. Younes said. She said Mr. Perez de Cuellar had been in touch with the United Nations representatives of several countries since he returned to New York.
 
No U.N. Comment on Hussein
Ms. Younes did not say when the Secretary General would leave for Amman. And the United Nations Secretariat issued no response to a remark on Saturday by Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein, that the Secretary General was welcome in Baghdad.
Mr. Perez de Cuellar announced that hoped to meet with Mr. Aziz on Saturday, hours after the Security Council adopted a resolution giving countries the right to enforce the economic embargo against Iraq by halting shipping to and from the country.
It was the fifth measure on the Gulf crisis voted by the Council since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
At his news conference in Bogota, Mr. Perez de Cuellar said: ''After the adoption by the Security Council of five very important resolutions, the moment has arrived for the Secretary General of the United Nations to start diplomatic efforts aimed to solve in all its aspects the critical situation in the gulf area.
''Therefore, I have invited today the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Iraq, Mr. Tariq Aziz, to urgently meet with me, preferably next week, in New York or Geneva, in order to engage with me without dela, in a full exchange of views on the crisis.''
 
Relying on Ties With Iraqi
Mr. Perez de Cuellar said he felt obliged to make use of the personal ties that he forged with Mr. Aziz during more than five years of negotiations on the war between Iran and Iraq. The eight-year conflict ended in a cease-fire in 1988.
The Secretary General suggested that the Iraqi Government was considering ways of seeking a nonmilitary resolution of the gulf standoff.
He said he would discuss all of the issues in the crisis with Mr. Aziz, including the Iraqi Government's refusal to let many foreigners depart from occupied Kuwait and Iraq.
The Secretary General said that he was acting on his own initiative, not at the behest of the 15-member Security Council. He said he felt he could intervene in the standoff without hampering efforts by the Council, which has also condemned the Iraqi annexation of Kuwait as null and void, called for the withdrawal of Iraqi forces and demanded that all foreigners be freed.
Mr. Perez de Cuellar expressed a hope that nations with a military presence in the gulf region would show prudence in the days to come, saying it would ease his task.
Mr. Aziz confirmed today that he intends to confer with the Secretary General this week.
Interviewed by Cable News Network in Baghdad, he said, ''We are open to listen to suggestions.'' He would not comment on whether his country was prepared to make concessions on its takeover of Kuwait.
Telephone calls to the Kuwaiti Mission to the United Nations late today went unanswered.
 
Secretary General's Role
Mr. Maksoud of the Arab League said that as ''the institutional personification of the United Nations,'' Mr. Perez de Cuellar ''has a stake in bringing about a diffusion of the level of tension, and restoring rational discourse as a prelude to a consequential negotiated settlement.''
He said the Secretary General faced the challenge of reconciling ''the requirements of legitimacy - that is, the Iraqi withdrawal and the restoration of the legitimate Government of Kuwait,'' without jeopardizing the chances for peace.
''It's a very difficult task,'' Mr. Maksoud said. But he said Mr. Perez de Cuellar had already helped to alter a ''collision course'' in the gulf crisis by seeking talks with Mr. Aziz.

HEADLINE: Church Poses No Threat To Park, Lujan Asserts

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GARDINER, Mont., Aug. 26

 BODY:
For nearly a decade, followers of Elizabeth Clare Prophet have come to the spectacular Upper Yellowstone Valley, drawn by the woman they call Guru Ma. Hundreds of members of her Church Universal and Triumphant settled here, near huge bomb shelters they have cut into the mountainside and stocked with radiation suits, food and automatic weapons.
Superintendent Robert D. Barbee of Yellowstone National Park and his assistant, Joseph Allston, have called development of the church land the single greatest environmental threat to the 2.4-million-acre park, with its geysers, hot springs, mud pots, bears and elk. With tensions growing, President Bush's Secretary of the Interior, Manuel Lujan Jr. asked to meet the spiritual leader to see if he could help work out a solution. 
Over coffee at the church-owned Ranch Kitchen restaurant on Wednesday, they talked amiably about bison, wolves, grizzlies, fences, geothermal wells, cattle and water. When it was over, Mr. Lujan was asked if he thought the church represented a threat to Yellowstone or its wildlife.
 
'We Can Work Things Out'
''I don't think so,'' he replied. ''I've always thought we can work things out. Our conversations were very pleasant. I came away with the feeling that we can be, in the final analysis, good neighbors by sitting around and discussing the issue and try to come up with some solution.''
Officials at Yellowstone were astounded, although they would not publicly contradict their boss. ''We could not believe it,'' one official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
During his four-hour visit to the park, Mr. Lujan also said the fires two years ago had ''devastated a lot of it.'' Many local officials and merchants said they were disturbed by the comment, which they said was overstated and undermined efforts by park officials and private agencies, which have spent millions promoting the ''rebirth'' of Yellowstone.
Mr. Lujan's staff soon found itself scrambling once again to explain his sometimes unpredictable comments. He had ignited similar exchanges of criticism and explanation in March when he said the Endangered Species Act had sometimes been used to stop economic progress.
 
No Endorsement of Church
His chief spokesman in Washington, Steve Goldstein, said then that the Secretary wanted only to make the law more flexible, not weaken it. This weekend Mr. Goldstein said Mr. Lujan's comment about Mrs. Prophet was not meant as an endorsement of the church's activities but only as an offer of conciliation. ''In no way does the Secretary support the activities of the church,'' Mr. Goldstein said, adding, ''Just because they practice a religion you might not agree with does not mean you can pretend they don't exist. They are the major landowner next to Yellowstone.''
Asked about the Secretary's description of the park as devastated, Mr. Goldstein said Mr. Lujan had been referring only to the worst parts of the park that he had seen in a helicopter tour. Mr. Lujan did not mean that description to apply to the whole park, Mr. Goldstein said.
In Nevada today, Mr. Lujan said a plan to protect the spotted owl in the Pacific Northwest would result in fewer jobs lost than originally thought and would probably protect fewer old stands of timber than environmentalists would like. In support of the plan, he said he had seen a spotted owl last week in Oregon ''and it wasn't in old-growth timber, so it showed me that the owls can live outside the old-growth areas,'' The Associated Press reported. He was not asked about his comments on Yellowstone.
Such comments from the man who is the custodian for the nation's national parks, have incensed political critics and environmentalists. George T. Frampton Jr., president of the Wilderness Society said the comment was ''on the par with a number of other goofy things he has said.''
 
Caution From Senator
''We probably know more about the Northern spotted owl than any species on the endangered species list, and scientists are unanimous in saying that it needs old-growth forest for nesting and reproduction in order to keep the species viable.''
In a letter to Mr. Lujan on Thursday, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, said that after nearly a decade of controversy and a leak of 31,000 gallons of diesel fuel from a bomb shelter at Mrs. Prophet's ranch, state officials must monitor the church closely. ''I hope your remarks do not reflect a lack of commitment to such monitoring,'' he wrote.
The church began buying land here in 1981 and now owns about 33,000 acres in four parcels just north of the northwest corner of the park. They are building a self-sufficient community that can live sealed off from the world.
The church has built a six-foot high wooden fence along 2.5 miles of the park's boundary, a fence that park officials say impedes animal movement.
In addition, the church plans to use geothermal energy to heat greenhouses by tapping underground sources at LaDuke Hot Spring. The park service has said it believes the hot spring is connected by a geological fault to the famed Norris Geyser Basin about 20 miles away in the park and such drilling could disrupt the natural water flow that causes the geysers. Congress has placed a moratorium on such projects in the area pending completion of a study on their possible effect.
A state court had halted work on the bomb shelter until an environmental impact statement is amended.
After Mr. Lujan's visit, church officials said they were pleased with what a spokesman, Murray Steinman, called a ''good exchange'' with Mr. Lujan.
Edward L. Francis, Mrs. Prophet's husband and chief spokesman, said in a written statement, ''We look forward to maintaining a positive dialogue with Yellowstone Park and the Department of the Interior in the future.''
In Washington, Representative Bruce F. Vento, a Minnesota Democrat who is chairman of the House Subcommittee on National Parks and Public Lands, said that Mr. Lujan may have had good intentions in meeting with Mrs. Prophet but that he undermined park service professionals. ''This coffee and cookie meeting only trivializes the serious issues of public interface with public lands,'' he said. ''These people are threatening public lands.''
After his meeting with the church leaders, Mr. Lujan said he was just trying to find solutions.
''They were concerned about the bison getting with their cattle, as are all other ranchers. We discussed the question of the geothermal well. Perhaps there may be some solutions there. We'll keep talking to see if we come to some kind of, something we can agree.''

HEADLINE: 2d-Largest Philanthropy Widens Role

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
Even here in Philadelphia, where the Pew family amassed a fortune from Sun Oil Company profits, the Pew Charitable Trusts are hardly a household name. But they are the country's second-most generous philanthropy, behind only the Ford Foundation and comfortably ahead of better-known giants like the Rockefeller, Carnegie and Mellon foundations.
For years Pew shrouded its charitable activities, citing the family's religious conviction that charity needed no rewards. There are no museums, universities or other landmarks bearing the Pew name. But now the charity, which has $3.3 billion in assets and gave away $145 million last year, is moving through a period of intense change as it seeks to become a major figure in national philanthropy. 
In a two-year overhaul, it replaced 95 percent of its staff and hired a team of specialists with impressive academic credentials to oversee its programs. And it is broadening its focus. Where once it concentrated largely on universities, parks and the arts, especially in the Delaware Valley, it is now moving into new areas like energy conservation and an ambitious program to help thousands of poor urban children by providing comprehensive health and social services to their families.
 
Some May Be Surprised
''Pew intends to make a major effort to help our disadvantaged population,'' said Dr. Thomas W. Langfitt, a 62-year-old neurosurgeon who has been its president since 1986. That, he added, ''might surprise some people accustomed to think of the old Pew as reactionary and secretive in its early years.''
The changes at Pew reflect a significant evolution of the family philanthropy. Until 1987, seven separate family charities operated under the Glenmede Trust Company, a banking entity widely seen as a shield for some members' financial support for conservative politics. The charity did not even publish a philanthropy report until 1980. Asked about gifts, J. Howard Pew, the Sun Oil chairman who died in 1971, is said to have shouted: ''I'm not telling anybody anything. It's my money, isn't it?''
Pew's program for the next three to five years is being developed by an almost totally new staff, mainly recruited from outside Philadelphia. The new executive director is Rebecca W. Rimel, a 39-year-old nurse who was engaged in research on head injuries when Dr. Langfitt met her at the University of Virginia and brought her to Pew to direct health activities. Her deputy, Michael Rubinger, is a New Yorker with 20 years' experience in neighborhood development programs.
The new Pew team leaders are widely recognized for previous accomplishments. But they are still strangers to their peers at other philanthropies and Pew's grant-seeking clients. For months they have been drafting white papers, outlining Pew's future interests in education, culture, religion, health and human services, and even global issues. (One, Drew E. Altman, a former Human Services Commissioner in New Jersey who directed Pew's $48 million program for health and human services, has left to become president of the Kaiser Family Foundation in California.) 'One Stop' Family Services Pew will continue to devote 30 percent of its budget to work in the Delaware Valley. But some local activities will be cut out, including an eight-year-old summer program to help thousands of high school students explore careers in business. The decision to leave that program drew criticism from some supporters and led to worries about other projects.
R. Anderson Pew, chairman of the charity's nine-member board, which has five family members, said Pew's activities generally evoked an ''unwarranted degree of fear, which only time will cure.''
''While Pew's resources are growing,'' he went on, ''competition for the charitable dollar also is growing. Organizations can no longer expect grants to be continued automatically and will have to demonstrate competence or get bumped by others that are better.''
Pew's most ambitious new activity is the Philadelphia Schools Collaborative, a $9 million effort to improve education at 22 local high schools. That program, said to be the nation's largest private donation to a public school system, is reported to have contributed to significant progress in reducing dropout rates.
The charity is trying to create another national model in Philadelphia: a service for children from birth to the age of 6. The aim is to coordinate more than 40 fragmented government-financed aid programs into a single ''one stop'' family service that would cover a whole section of a city. At one site, children, pregnant teen-agers and their family members would be able to get health care, counseling, training and other assistance.
 
Apprentices to the Future
Pew is also supporting Jobs for the Future, an effort to move high school students into apprenticeships that will train them for highly skilled jobs. This will be done at 15 sites around the country, and Pew is looking for other foundations to join the program.
''We are the only industrialized country without an organized way to help youth make a transition to work,'' said Robert B. Schwartz, a former special assistant to Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, who directs Pew's $35-million-a-year education program.
Pew is promoting an energy efficiency program in New England, initiated by the Conservation Law Foundation of Boston in cooperation with local utilities. It involves designing and installing energy-saving devices in homes, businesses and commercial buldings.
The charity's longstanding support for religious institutions will be augmented by fellowships and research, including studies of religion's impact on politics and on creating and resolving conflicts. And Pew will work with other philanthropies to encourage economic reforms and democratic institutions in Eastern Europe.
Pew, which spends $22 million a year on the arts, helped develop a consortium of major museums to use video programs to enhance visitors' appreciation of the arts. It provided $1.5 million for a museum loan program, to encourage institutions to lend other museums artwork that would otherwise languish in storage.
 
Beyond Philadelphia, and Back
The charity's housing efforts were once concentrated in Philadelphia; now it plans to promote low-income housing on a national scale and to consider special needs, like housing for the mentally ill.
''We see Philadelphia as a place to build models that can be replicated in other cities,'' said Ms. Rimel. ''But we'll also be searching nationally for innovations we can bring home to Philadelphia.''
Looking at the directions the philanthropy is taking, Mr. Pew said, he is mystified that some still consider the Pews (and there are now 1,000 descendants) ultra-conservatives.
''Our Aunt Harriet Pew in Civil War days ran an underground railroad helping slaves from Parker's Landing in Virginia,'' he said. ''You can't get much more liberal than that.''

HEADLINE: Give Me, Also, Your Skilled

 BODY:
America is about to enhance its reputation as a nation of immigrants, and not just for tired, huddled masses. Legislation moving through Congress would increase the number of immigrants, making it easier for families to unite and for businesses to recruit skilled workers. This first major overhaul of legal immigration in 25 years would be as welcome as it is overdue. 
America's willingness to admit foreigners has always been influenced by economic conditions and occasional xenophobia. From the 1920's to 1965, a national-origins quota system favored immigrants from northwestern Europe. In a 1965 reform, Congress gave more favorable treatment to immigrants from Asia and the Western Hemisphere.
Still, the vast majority of immigrants could qualify for admission only on the basis of their relationship to people already resident in the United States. Potential immigrants with needed skills had a hard time competing for entry with sons, daughters, brothers and sisters.
Now, America realizes how much it needs such skills, let alone the ambition and energy of the immigrants who possess them. Global competition and a decline in American work-force skills have prompted Congress to pay more attention to the needs of the economy.
A bill passed by the Senate last year would establish one immigration category for family members and one for independents, mostly workers. Under this bill, sponsored by Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Alan Simpson of Wyoming, about 630,000 immigrants would be allowed to enter each year, about 136,000 more than entered in 1988. Of the total, 480,000 would qualify under various family preferences; 150,000 would be admitted as independents.
For the first time, about a third of these work-based immigrants would be admitted without specific jobs but with specific skills needed in the U.S. That would be the same number of immigrants -54,000 - now admitted under sponsorship by specific employers.
In the House, a bill sponsored by Bruce Morrison of Connecticut is likely to reach the floor soon. It would allow up to 775,000 legal immigrants each year, including 520,000 for family members and 75,000 for skilled workers. The House bill also would admit about 55,000 ''diversity'' immigrants a year from areas that have not obtained many visas in recent years, like Ireland and Africa.
The House bill also contains a more troublesome provision that smacks of the old-time fear of foreigners. The bill would impose a fee, $500 to $1,000, on companies with 50 or more employees, for each foreign worker they hired. The money would be placed in a trust fund to retrain American workers. Unions defend the fund as reasonable social policy, particularly if a portion is targeted for women and minorities.
But there is little logic and no justice in imposing such a fee only on companies that can efficiently use new workers. There may be good reason for America to retrain workers, whether displaced by new machines, new products or new workers. If so, the retraining cost ought fairly to be borne by all. To load it all on a few industries with a $500 head tax is unfair, even punitive.
There will be time to iron out such differences. For the moment, it's enough to celebrate the recognition by Congress that skilled immigrants offer the economy new energy and hope.

HEADLINE: Protecting Democracy in Pakistan

 BODY:
Pakistan's President, Ghulam Ishaq Khan, carefully observed constitutional formalities when he ousted the elected Government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto earlier this month. Ms. Bhutto was nevertheless the victim of a coup in constitutional clothing, sponsored from behind the scenes by military leaders.
Subsequent events have heightened concern that Pakistan's brief democratic interlude could now be ending. A return to military rule in this strategically located country of 100 million would be a severe setback for U.S. policies and could disrupt a relationship that currently provides Pakistan with some $600 million a year in economic and military assistance. 
President Ishaq Khan cited corruption and incompetence as his reasons for removing Ms. Bhutto's Government. There's plausibility to both charges. But democratic practice calls for resolving them in less arbitrary ways. Incompetent governments can be voted out of office. Corrupt officials can be exposed and prosecuted.
Pakistan's present Constitution incorporates changes made during the rule of the military strongman Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq. These subordinated the elected Prime Minister to a President presumed closer to military thinking. Pakistan has been ruled by military governments for more than half its 43-year history. President Ishaq Khan used his constitutional powers to decree a state of emergency and install an interim Government led by a minority party the military likes better than Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan Peoples Party. This new Government, led by Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, has created special tribunals to try officials of the Bhutto regime.
New elections are still promised for Oct. 24, but such promises have been broken too many times in the recent past to inspire great confidence. An election that excluded Ms. Bhutto or key members of her party could scarcely be considered democratic.
Because Washington winked at anti-democratic practices during the Zia years, Pakistan's generals may be wagering that the U.S. will be indulgent again this time. That's a foolish bet. General Zia was treated with kid gloves because Washington valued his commitment to expelling Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
Those troops are now out. With Washington and Moscow talking compromise, a new military-backed regime in Islamabad could become an obstacle to an Afghanistan settlement. A new government also increases tensions in the still dangerous confrontation with India over Kashmir. Heavy artillery fire broke out along the Kashmir frontier last week. And Washington continues to worry about Pakistan's efforts to develop nuclear weapons.
Neither the Bush Administration nor Congress is likely to wink again should Pakistan abandon its hard-won democratic rule.

HEADLINE: Political Influence Corrodes the Civil Service;
Foxes in Chicken Coop

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Paul Volcker's discussion of the quality of Government personnel (Op-Ed, Aug. 5) omits salient facts. Mr. Volcker fails to mention that in 1979-80 Ronald Reagan ran against ''Washington,'' to get Government off our backs, and that the derision of bureaucrats was central in his arsenal of anecdotes and cliches.
What Mr. Volcker ignores is that Mr. Reagan made numerous appointments to head major Government entities of people with conflicts of interest who opposed the very missions of their agencies and who presided over their defunding, demoralization and the exit of quality personnel. These attacks on the Government service were warmly supported by the business community, which invested heavily and enthusiastically in Mr. Reagan's election and re-election.
This process of undermining Government, frequently associated with Republican party rule, goes back a long way and seems to be related to a market economy, the demands of its important constituencies and American cultural characteristics. In appealing for reform to educators and the public at large, Mr. Volcker misses both the agents and process whereby the quality of Government service is kept at a low level in this country.

HEADLINE: To Cut the S.& L. Losses . . .

BYLINE: By Bob Kasten; Bob Kasten, Republican of Wisconsin, is a member of the Senate Appropriations and Budget Committees.

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE, Wis.

 BODY:
Washington budget summit negotiators have been engaged in a political tug of war over which taxes to raise to pay for the savings and loan bailout. What they should be addressing is the more important question of how to keep the tab from rising. Policy-makers have ignored one of the most effective steps we can take to stem further S.& L. losses: A cut in the capital gains tax.
When we in Congress return from the August recess, we will have to deal quickly with the escalating costs of the bailout, currently estimated at $150 billion. Our task is now complicated by another economic problem precipitated by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and rising oil prices. 
A recession could trigger a new round of S.& L. failures, requiring taxpayers in the Northeast and Midwest to send even more of their hard-earned tax dollars to bailout the depositors at failed savings and loans in Western states.
The final cost for the cleanup depends on how many more savings institutions will have to be rescued -and how much money the Federal Government can recover from selling the seized assets.
A new U.S. Chamber of Commerce study has estimated that my bill to cut the capital gains tax from 33 to 15 percent would raise the value of the real estate assets held by the Government by 13.7 precent, and lower the cost of the bailout by $19.8 billion.
Since the 65 percent capital gains tax increase in 1986 - the greatest in U.S. history - the value of all capital assets, including commercial real estate and junk bonds held by banks and thrifts as collateral, has steadily declined.
The logic behind this is simple: The value of an asset is determined by the income you can expect to earn from it. The higher the capital gains tax, the lower the expected future income and, hence, the lower the value of the asset.
Because of the high capital gains tax, the Resolution Trust Corporation - the agency created to sell the assets of failed thrifts - has inherited a portfolio of devalued property. Furthermore, declining real estate prices have pushed more thrifts into insolvency, doubling the cost estimates for the cleanup over the last 12 months.
By increasing potential income, a capital gains tax cut would boost the value of all capital assets overnight. The Government's portfolio of foreclosed assets would command higher prices at auction. Savings institutions on the brink of insolvency could be given a new lease on life as the value of their capital assets rises, thus avoiding higher bailout costs.
On Aug. 2, L. William Seidman, the chairman of the bailout agency, told the Senate Banking Committee: ''There is no question in my mind that a great many people who are purchasers are buying these assets for the purpose of seeing them appreciate and selling them, and clearly if the [capital gains] tax was lower, they would be more interested.''
The less the Government has to pay to hold on to these assets, and the more revenue we get for them, the less taxpayers will have to pay.
In addition, the higher real estate values will strengthen the financial condition of institutions like the Federal Housing Authority and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, helping prevent similar kinds of taxpayer bailouts in the future.
Aside from easing the burden of the bailout, a 15 percent capital gains tax would spark the kind of investment and entrepreneurial capitalism that our economy needs to get back on track. And according to economist Allen Sinai, the cut would generate $30 to $40 billion in new tax revenue for the U.S. Treasury over five years and create 2.5 million new jobs.
Capital gains tax cuts aren't a ''give-away to the rich.'' By reducing the cost of the savings and loan bailout, this pro-growth tax cut will eliminate the need to raise taxes on working Americans.

HEADLINE: Welfare Chief Battles Crises and Critics

BYLINE: By THOMAS MORGAN

 BODY:
The job is daunting and she knows it. Barbara J. Sabol, New York City's new Human Resources Administrator, is struggling -some say without success - to nudge a mammoth bureaucracy not known for compassion into being more responsive to the city's most vulnerable citizens.
When Mrs. Sabol took office on April 4, one of the last major appointees of the Dinkins administration, the nurse and veteran social-welfare administrator promised a new management team and a new focus on preventive measures, rather than crisis intervention in foster care, child welfare and homelessness.
''We have an agency of last resort, and what we want to do is find ways to keep families together,'' Mrs. Sabol said in an interview earlier this month.
Community leaders, union officials and child-welfare advocates praise Mrs. Sabol's enthusiasm and openness to changing agency policies and to seeking advice from outsiders. 
But five months since she took office, while they like her plans for change, they say they see little of it. Homeless families continue to be housed in decrepit, unsavory welfare hotels. Child-welfare advocates say that the city's growing foster-care program is poorly run and that several thousand families each month who depend on public-assistance checks for food and shelter are still at risk of being dumped from the rolls for purely administrative reasons.
While Mrs. Sabol shares Mayor David N. Dinkins's philosophy that the best way to deliver social services is at the neighborhood level rather than in citywide centers, a concept that has been debated for years, her agency has not come forward with plans to accomplish that goal. How Many Are Minding the Store? And Mrs. Sabol's critics and some admirers are concerned that as she begins to revamp the agency, few are minding the store. She asked for and got resignations from more than a dozen top deputy or assistant commissioners, directors of borough welfare offices and scores of middle-level supervisors.
Some remain as acting supervisors until replacements are found, but advocates for the homeless and those on welfare say it is often hard to get decisions on policy issues and definitive answers from agency officials, particularly in the troubled Child Welfare Administration, which is without a permanent administrator, and from the Human Resources Administration's legal staff.
''When positions are not filled, that's a problem for our clients,'' said Jane Sufian, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society who monitors the foster-care program. ''When people are in acting positions, they are caretakers. You don't have someone to talk to about problems, who are going to be there on a long-term basis.''
 
'Vacuum in Decision Making'
David Tobis, a senior research scientist at Hunter College's Center for the Study of Family Policy, said, ''There is a vacuum in decision making, especially in the Child Welfare Administration.''
''They've gotten rid of the old management, which is positive,'' Mr. Tobis said. ''But the agency now has no clear direction. The management staff below does not know what is going on above. Sabol is a breath of fresh air and people hope things will improve, but the hammer has yet to hit the anvil.''
Mrs. Sabol, in the interview, countered those charges by saying that significant change takes time.
She said she is conducting searches to find the best qualified managers to head the agency's troubled divisions. She said her staff members have begun evaluating welfare guidelines, seeking ways to improve the system. And she has asked New York State's social-service experts to help the city improve training for caseworkers.
 
Impromptu Shelter Visits
Her years as deputy executive commissioner of state social services meant that she was no stranger within the agency when she arrived. She is known for detail, a deliberate personal style, 15-hour workdays and an inability to keep the plants in her office alive.
Often, without notice, the 52-year-old Mrs. Sabol drops in on social-service centers and homeless shelters and asks what caseworkers need to do their jobs better.
Mrs. Sabol has two powerful allies: Mayor Dinkins and her boss for the last six years, Cesar A. Perales, the New York State Commissioner of Social Services, who in the past has often been at odds with New York City officials.
At her urging, the Mayor, at a time of budget belt-tightening, has increased the H.R.A. budget to $6.1 billion from $5.4 billion to address a growing public assistance caseload and to start preventive drug-treatment programs.
Mr. Perales expects to work more closely with H.R.A. than in the past.
''I know how Barbara thinks,'' he said. ''She feels strongly about the responsibility of government to disadvantaged people, especially children. When she worked for me as executive deputy commissioner, she was very effective at running the day-to-day activities of this agency and was good at follow-up and details.''
She has put some new programs in place. Under Mrs. Sabol's guidance, H.R.A. has opened Medicaid offices at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center and Bronx-Lebanon Hospital to help welfare clients get timely medical assistance.
In addition, the agency has expanded its drug-treatment programs by awarding contracts totaling $23.9 million to 29 private and nonprofit agencies for drug treatment and related counseling services for 1,000 families.
 
Critics Want More
''Substance abuse is one of the major problems facing families,'' Mrs. Sabol said, ''and we want to match preventive services with drug treatment to help keep them together.''
Her critics say all this is good, but not enough, particularly as the number of people in need rises as the local economy weakens.
In roughly 700 sites around the city, the agency's 35,000 employees serve more than 1.4 million poor people whose needs are legion.
The agency's public-assistance caseload has already risen 10 percent over last year's level, to almost 400,000 cases. One agency official said the caseload is increasing by 12,000 to 16,000 new cases each month.
Nearly 50,000 children are in the city's foster-care system, the casualties of parents in the throes of drug abuse, homelessness and AIDS.
While the city has moved almost 3,000 families out of scandal-ridden welfare hotels during the year, several hundred remain there. City officials said they have failed to meet their own goal of closing welfare hotels because more people need assistance than was forecast last year, and projects to build or renovate more permanent housing are behind schedule.
''The issue isn't that there are families in welfare hotels but how to reduce the numbers of families seeking shelter that continue to drive the welfare crisis,'' said Steven Banks, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society's Homeless Family Rights project.
''With hundreds of families entering the shelter system each month, which is becoming the only way to get city-sponsored housing,'' Mr. Banks said, ''it's incumbent on the city to implement a comprehensive homeless prevention program rather than simply scramble and deal with families in welfare hotels.
''More than 400 families live in barracks-style congregate homeless shelters where there have been outbreaks of chicken pox and measles. We've not seen any plan by which the city will get all of the families out of such shelters by September 30, 1991, the court-ordered deadline.''
Mrs. Sabol said that her agency cannot do everything at once, or alone.
''H.R.A. has got to be working with community organizations in a partnership to solve these problems,'' she said. ''We can improve life chances for poor children. I know this. I tell our staff that if you are making decisions and want to know what to do, ask the question, 'Is this best for children and families?' ''
