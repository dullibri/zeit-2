HEADLINE: To Keep Czecho-Slovakia's Hyphen

 BODY:
Communism can pass easily into nationalism. The two creeds have much in common. Each offers a simple key to tangled problems. One exalts class, the other ethnic kinship. Each blames real grievances on imagined enemies. As a Russian informant shrewdly remarked to David Shipler in The New Yorker: "They are both ideologies that liberate people from personal responsibility. They are united around some sacred goal."
In varying degrees and with different results, old Bolsheviks have become new nationalists in Serbia and many former Soviet republics. And now the same phenomenon has surfaced in Czechoslovakia, where fragmented election results leave the 74-year-old federation in doubt. 
 The big winner in the more populous Czech lands was Vaclav Klaus, an unbending advocate of a swift transition to capitalism. But in smaller, poorer Slovakia, voters turned to Vladimir Meciar, an ex-Communist turned nationalist who opposes rapid market reforms.
As talks on forming a new government proceed, the larger burden for their success lies with Mr. Klaus, who speaks for the more powerful partner -- sometimes with an arrogance that fans Slovak outrage. And unless these rivals somehow work together, the country formally designated, down to the hyphen, as the Czecho-Slovak Federal Republic could well break apart.
This is not Yugoslavia. Europe's peace need not be unsettled if Czechs and Slovaks agree to go their separate ways. Yet Americans are right to be concerned about toxic nationalism -- and to worry about Mr. Meciar. His devotion to democracy can be gauged by his post-election call for the firing of journalists whose work he disapproved.
Adept at switching horses, Mr. Meciar first served the Communists, then joined the Slovak wing of the pro-democracy movement that made the Velvet Revolution in 1989. Sensing disenchantment, he formed a new populist party that has tapped separatist sentiments among Slovaks, who have long felt patronized by sophisticated Czechs. He found an eager audience, especially since unemployment in his eastern republic is nearly 12 percent, whereas the Czech rate is 3 percent, the lowest in Europe.
It is difficult to see what besides pride would be gratified should 5 million Slovaks press for independence from 11 million Czechs. Together the two republics could be welcomed as members of the European Community. Slovakia lacks the capital, skills and resources to expand an industrial base now chiefly made up of arms factories.
And there is a greater moral danger, described long ago by Thomas Masaryk, the founding President of Czechoslovakia, whose own nationalism was joined inseparably to belief in democracy. "Chauvinism is nowhere justified," Masaryk wrote in 1927, "least of all in our country." And he went on to say that:
"The new order in Europe, the creation of new states, has shorn nationalism of its negative character by setting oppressed peoples on their own feet. To a positive nationalism, one that seeks to raise a nation by intensive work, none can demur. Chauvinism, racial or national intolerance, not love of one's own people, is the foe of nations and of humanity."
It is a good standard for judging tolerance, on both sides of Czecho-Slovakia's hyphen.

HEADLINE: 1-800-TROUBLE

 BODY:
"THE DIGEST'S PRESIDENTIAL POLL IS ON!" the editors of The Literary Digest trumpeted on Aug. 22, 1936. "THE DIGEST'S smooth-running machine moves with the swift precision of thirty years' experience to reduce guess-work to hard fact." So saying, the editors sent out postcards to 10 million Americans and on the basis of the replies, predicted that Alf Landon would demolish Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Roosevelt won, 523 electoral votes to 8, and The Literary Digest went out of business. 
 Public understanding of statistics has vastly improved since 1936. Yet The Digest's monumental blunder is brought to mind whenever Ross Perot declares his devotion to the idea of the "electronic town hall." By that he means instant telephone voting by television audiences after he and various experts discuss an issue and lay out several blunt policy options.
The first problem with Mr. Perot's idea -- and hardly the only one -- is that calls to his 800 number would be likely to produce results as flawed as The Digest's postcards. The Digest miscalculated because it polled automobile owners and people listed in phone books. It systematically missed millions of people too poor to have either cars or phones in a Depression-bound society.
In Mr. Perot's case, the millions who respond to his 800-number appeals are likely to be better-educated people who care passionately about issues. But even if his policy option programs were riveting, millions will neither watch nor respond, for lack of interest or access to the kind of telephone or home computer needed. Mr. Perot would thus, like The Digest, be tapping a highly unrepresentative sample of the population.
It's easy to see why Mr. Perot is captivated by technology. Bypassing party structure and the primaries and relying on phone banks and live talk shows, he has jumped ahead of both President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas. If techno-politics works so well, why not techno-governance? The idea suggests efficiency and citizen democracy on a huge scale -- a proposition with great appeal to voters who feel disenfranchised by politics and who are eager for the grass-roots engagement once provided by the political parties.
Yet techno-governance's perils outweigh its promise. Quite apart from its unrepresentative response, the electronic town hall idea assumes an almost instant grasp of complex questions that can hardly be understood, let alone answered, in an hour of TV time.
In Mr. Perot's hands the system might also be used to end-run the Constitution. Indeed, on two occasions he has suggested stripping Congress of its constitutional authority to make tax policy so as to place that power directly in the hands of his electronic audience.
Nor would the system be safe from the manipulation Mr. Perot deplores. Norman Bradburn, director of the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, points out that a Perot Administration would be in charge of producing the programs, facilitating loaded selection of speakers and scripting of questions.
A CBS News program broadcast on Jan. 28 illustrates that danger. "America on the Line" invited viewers to call a toll-free number with their opinions of Mr. Bush's handling of the economy. One of the last images they saw was of a weeping, unemployed man; the people who called in were overwhelmingly unfavorable to Mr. Bush. A true random sample conducted by CBS at the same time, however, produced less negative percentages.
Even a plebiscite that worked perfectly might not always make sense. That's because good policy is often painful policy -- defending free trade against protectionist instincts, for example, or finding some way to help the Russians even when people generally are sick of foreign aid.
These policy decisions are not usually the product of tabulations from a call-in system. They are the product of deliberation, often raucous give and take and, frequently, the courage of leadership. A President needs that far more than an 800 number.

HEADLINE: Airport Noise Relief Still Lies Ahead

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Contrary to a May 21 news article, the House of Representatives has not given local jurisdictions increased power to enact noise regulations more stringent than Federal standards. The House passed the 1992 Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization package, which does not increase or decrease local power over aircraft noise. 
 In a somewhat bizarre attempt to rewrite the legislative history of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990, the House report accompanying the reauthorization package contains language indicating what several members of Congress state they really meant when the 1990 act was passed. The report's language is contrary to the public statements of Senator Wendell H. Ford, one of the major architects of the 1990 act.
The time has come for less rhetoric on this issue and more cooperation between all parties to reach common ground to achieve a quieter environment, while insuring shippers the service they need to compete in the world economy. Public officials should back off and let the 1990 act work; in places other than New York high-profile confrontations have been averted by a willingness by local officials to compromise. Attempts to achieve the same results with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey have been met with a stone wall.

 DINKINS CHASTISES EDUCATION OFFICIALS
Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday lashed out at the Board of Education, the day after school officials blamed city budget cuts for disappointing results in reading and math scores. But in a three-page statement, the Mayor never mentioned the test scores, which dropped sharply this spring. Instead, he focused on the board's quarrelsome handling of a new AIDS curriculum and what he called its "ineffectual governance" of the school system. Page 1.
 
CARDINAL'S MARCH CALLED TACTICAL SHIFT
John Cardinal O'Connor's decision to lead a march to an abortion clinic today is being viewed on both sides of the abortion battle as a striking departure from his usual tactics, one that even his allies in the anti-abortion movement acknowledge reflects frustration over recent setbacks in the efforts to stop legalized abortion. Page 27.

FINANCIAL EXCHANGES PLAN JOINT MOVE
In a development project that could bring all of New York City's major financial exchanges under the same Wall Street roof, executives of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and the city's five commodities exchanges are in preliminary negotiations to build a new trading complex. The proposal, acknowledged yesterday by several senior executives, and outlined in greater detail in discussions with people close to the negotiations, is being advocated aggressively by City Hall.

POLICE OFFICERS SUSPENDED IN NEWARK
Six Newark police officers under investigation in the shooting of a 17-year-old suspected car thief were suspended from duty without pay yesterday, and the city's Mayor and police director complained that the officers' statements about the shooting were too sketchy. Mayor Sharpe James has expressed concern about the possibility of street disorders since the youth, Howard Caesar, was shot early Tuesday as he walked away from a stolen car. Although emotions did not seem high around West Side Park, the scene of the shooting, Mayor James said that the officers' "cover-up" of their roles in the shooting had placed Newark "at risk."

 MAN CHARGED AS TEEN-AGER'S ACCOMPLICE
A Brooklyn auto supply salesman has been charged as the mystery man who sold Amy Fisher the gun used in the shooting of Mary Jo Buttafuoco and who acted as her driver. Miss Fisher, 17 years old, is accused of shooting Mrs. Buttafuoco on the doorstep of her Massapequa home. The police have said she was having an affair with Joseph Buttafuoco, a 36-year-old auto body repairman, and plotted for several months to kill his wife. Page 28.
 
 NEW JERSEY LAND PLAN ADOPTED
After more than six years of debate and revisions, New Jersey adopted statewide land-use guidelines yesterday that are aimed at forcing growth into compact population centers and away from random sprawl. State and local regulatory agencies are expected to base decisions about development according to the plan's five planning areas, from densely populated urban districts to environmentally sensitive, off-limits areas.

HEADLINE: FASHION;
Buyers' Market

BYLINE: By Carrie Donovan

 BODY:
DESIGNERS CAN DESIGN. THE PRESS CAN rave or rant. But it is retailers who turn fashion into reality.
During the five show-packed days in April when New York designers and manufacturers present their fall collections, Seventh Avenue vibrates with tension and anticipation. Prestige -- and, in some cases, economic survival -- is on the line. More than ever, in these difficult times, designers depend on retailers to get their messages across. And it is the retail executives' decisions -- and commitments of impressive sums of money -- that determine what will actually become available. 
 Neiman Marcus, with 26 stores around the country, has a reputation for consistently committing big money to high fashion. For example, the store's management will invest $24 million in the Donna Karan name for the fall season. Cynthia Marcus, the buyer for designer sportswear, has an intuitive feel for fashion typical of the store's executives. This time, Marcus found the American collections superb. "I feel strongly about giving customers options, and the market supplied them," she says.
Bloomingdale's is known for hopping on a hot trend and translating it into merchandise for sale at many price levels. This fall, the store will put more than a quarter of a million dollars into stylish leather.
Kalman Ruttenstein, Bloomingdale's senior vice president for fashion direction, is legendary in the industry for his ability to spot a trend and act on it. Now he's pursuing "men's wear, animal patterns, leather, the color gray and 'glamour.' " No doubt, come fall, this is what Bloomingdale's merchandise will reflect.

Inset, above: Neiman Marcus's top brass cluster around chairman Terry Lundgren, center, at Mizrahi's fall show.

Donna Karan, far right, explains her design philosophy to the Neiman Marcus team including, left to right: Cynthia Marcus; Ron Frasch, senior vice president and general merchandise manager, and Joan Kaner, fashion director. At the finale of Karan's show, store executives rush to congratulate the designer. Neiman Marcus's executive vice president, Andrea Jung, embraces Karan, while Terry Lundgren and the rest of his staff wait their turn. The Perry Ellis Company designer, Marc Jacobs, cajoles Marcus into trying on one of his top hats. The day after Jacobs's show, Marcus made her selections for the Neiman Marcus catalogues through Christmas. Marcus uses taxi time to plot and refine her buying strategy. Marcus, center, tells her assistant, David Cowdrey, and fashion director Joan Kaner what she has chosen from Isaac Mizrahi's fall collection -- and why. (pg. 52); Bloomingdale's senior vice president for fashion direction, Kalman Ruttenstein, center, is one of the industry's most powerful players. Here he leads store buyers down a Seventh Avenue side street in search of leather at a good price. Ruttenstein, center, can request that special styles be made up for Bloomingdale's. Here he asks a manufacturer, Kenneth Karlstein, far left, to have hot pants cut in tomato-red leather. Ruttenstein was cool as he appraised the Gianni Versace lingerie collection that he snared exclusively for Bloomingdale's Christmas season. Bloomingdale's is an enthusiastic supporter of newcomer Byron Lars, right. "In just three seasons, he's established his own look, and that's remarkable," says Ruttenstein, as he plans a Bloomingdale's event for the young designer. At Guess?, Ruttenstein sat waiting against a wall-sized poster to organize a special promotion of the company's jeans for Bloomingdale's. (pg. 54)(Photographs by Mark Peterson/J. B.

HEADLINE: TV VIEW;
For the Right, TV Is Half the Battle

BYLINE: By JOHN J. O'CONNOR

 BODY:
Marlon Riggs, a 35-year-old film maker, now has the unenviable distinction of having come under fierce attack from both sides of the right wing that have made television a primary target. They are the religious right, which pounces on sexual permissiveness, a favorite target being any program that casts gay men or women in a less-than-diabolical light, and the political right, which levels charges of left-wing bias and elitism. And one man's encounters with them are perhaps indicative of the larger spectacle of a quite serious turf war now being waged for nothing less than the whole of American popular culture.
Last year, Mr. Riggs's documentary "Tongues Untied," a personal essay about being black and gay, a minority within a minority, was shown on "P.O.V.," a PBS series featuring independently produced films with strong viewpoints. The film unleashed a storm of outrage in powerful right-wing circles, not least in the offices of both Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, and Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition. The latter went to the trouble of putting together, for circulation in Congress and other power mills, a seven-minute tape of scenes from the film, which, out of context, thoroughly distorted Mr. Riggs's intentions. 
 Tomorrow night at 10, "P.O.V." (Channel 13) will present Mr. Riggs's "Color Adjustment," a survey of the depiction of blacks on prime-time television, from Amos 'n' Andy to Bill Cosby. The format is conventional, bringing in cultural critics like Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Alvin Pouissant to reinforce some of Mr. Riggs's observations about the often dramatic differences between television images and public reality. Few viewers are likely to be startled; some may even gain fresh insight into the recent racial explosions in Los Angeles.
They won't include, certainly, the editors of a publication called Comint, the Journal of the Committee on Media Integrity, which aims, it says, "to promote balance in government-funded media." Comint, which is dedicated almost exclusively to attacks on public television, has published an unsigned review of "Color Adjustment," branding Mr. Riggs an "outlaw" and his film "dishonest." The indignant conclusion: " 'Color Adjustment' is cheap and uninteresting propaganda. It provides a clear example of how the public-television funding system is easily abused by an irresponsible and extremist fringe." Mr. Riggs, be assured, is neither irresponsible nor extreme.
 
Recent Skirmishes In a War Over Turf
 Suddenly, it seems, television finds itself surrounded by political skirmishes, triggered for the most part by the conservatives. Bill Moyers and independent documentarians. "Murphy Brown" and "The Simpsons." You name it, and someone, somewhere, will pop up with a diatribe on ideological bias or sexual permissiveness, often in tandem with a solemn defense of "family values," mantra of the moment. And the Senate vote 11 days ago that reassured public broadcasting of Federal financing through 1996 while re-emphasizing the need for objectivity and balance in "programming of a controversial nature" has not quieted those voices.
Much of the fuss might be compared to an unseemly fistfight, complete with bullying tactics and reckless rhetoric. But that would be underestimating the importance of a battle that may largely determine the role of censorship in our future.
One of the more piquant ironies is that conservatives who have long knelt at the altar of a free market can now be found advocating restraints, if not outright censorship, in culture and the arts. The travails of the National Endowment for the Arts aren't taking place in a vacuum.
At a Washington seminar on "the new global popular culture," hosted in March by the American Enterprise Institute, Irving Kristol, a co-editor of The Public Interest, noted, with a not-so-veiled swipe at television, "Over the past 40 years our popular culture has conquered our high culture." He maintained that "American popular culture is today less an ornament of American democracy than a threat to it." Robert H. Bork, a onetime Supreme Court nominee now affiliated with the American Enterprise Institute, concurred: "The proportion of popular culture devoted to trashing our values is on the increase . . . . The amount of corruption in culture is increasing."
 
Who Should Tend 'High Culture'?
 So popular culture, once a treasured weapon in the Cold War, falls victim to second thoughts. Now, increasingly, efforts are being made to control the ideas embedded in that culture if they don't mesh comfortably with one official line or another, or with someone's conception of "our values." At the top of the hit list is television, public television being particularly vulnerable to pressure campaigns because some 40 percent of its financing comes from Government sources.
Mr. Kristol makes a valid point about the erosion of high culture in this country, but one reason for that erosion, as far as television is concerned, is the virtual absence of coherent Government policies. Television has taken the mantle of First Amendment protection for its news operations and steadily expanded it to cover its entire schedule. Even vague guidelines for providing, say, quality children's programs or outstanding cultural events are just about nonexistent.
So the bulk of commercial television has been free to pursue its endless quest for bigger profits with more and more "accessible" entertainments. "Studs," the smarmy syndicated dating-game show, didn't happen by chance. Todd Gitlin, a sociologist at the University of California at Berkeley, puts it this way: "The problem is that American values have included the primacy of the market. The maximization of box office is not conducive to what is euphemistically and nostalgically called the marketplace of ideas."
Any significant consideration given in this country to elevating television content in terms of "high culture" -- a responsibility traditionally recognized by the British Broadcasting Corporation, for one -- has been left largely to public television. In 1967, the Carnegie Commission envisioned a system that would encompass "all that is of human interest and importance which is not at the moment appropriate or available for support by advertising." Indeed, any viewers interested in the performing arts or sometimes provocative documentaries, not to mention relief from commercials, will find very few "free" sources other than public television.
From the beginning, however, sufficient financing was a problem, and, with production costs soaring, tighter budgets have whittled away at lofty ideals. The current glut of old movies and reruns of "The Lawrence Welk Show" can hardly be considered of pressing importance. Yet, instead of devising ways to make public television more vigorous, certain segments of the right seem bent on destroying the system altogether.
 
Making Slippery Use Of an English Model
 The argumentative terrain of some conservative sectors can be slippery. Consider Comint's recent reprint of a lecture, "Public Television at the Crossroads," given by Laurence Jarvik at the Heritage Foundation. Mr. Jarvik argued that the system should be allowed to sink or swim in the commercial marketplace, effectively controlled, of course, by corporate interests generally partial to the status quo. He took a club to the fledgling Independent Television Service, which was created to finance public television programs done by independent producers. The service is currently financing some documentaries (one title: "Endangered Species: The Toxic Poisoning of People of Color") that are certain not to pop up on the networks during prime time.
Contending that new technologies have made the need for public television superfluous, Mr. Jarvik notes that "today approximately 90 percent of American homes are passed by cable lines." The statistic is pointless, except perhaps to cable operators. According to a recent A. C. Nielsen study, cable penetration of American homes is now about 60 percent, meaning that a whopping 40 percent still do not have access to cable.
Then, quoting some trenchant criticisms of public television made in 1988 by the documentary film maker Frederick Wiseman, Mr. Jarvik, recalling that Mr. Wiseman suggested the system be reformed along the lines of England's Channel 4, declares that "Channel 4 is a private commercial channel supported by advertising sales." That's far from accurate.
Created by an act of Parliament a decade ago, the British service is financed by money siphoned from commercial producers on another channel and does not directly depend on income from advertising. It commissions programs, and, by law, a substantial proportion of them must be obtained from independent producers. (This structure will change next year, and there is already talk that Channel 4 will be effectively neutered.) Innovation and experiment get top priority. "My Beautiful Laundrette" was a made-for-Channel 4 movie. Overall, the service has been partial to precisely the kind of material now being explored by the Independent Television Service.
Once again, the core issue is control. Charges that public television's content leans too far to the left are less than compelling when its schedule includes, on a weekly basis, William F. Buckley Jr., Morton Kondracke and John McLaughlin, in addition to such periodic specials as "The Conservatives" and a forthcoming series with Ben J. Wattenberg as host. Financing comes largely from foundations and corporations tilted to the right, often the same ones underwriting conservative critics of the system. Predictably, some commentators on the left find public television too conservative, citing an abundance of weekly and daily shows covering business but not one about labor or consumer issues.
Is the system elitist, a charge favored by the columnist George Will? Analyses of audience demographics can be interpreted either way, but just for the sake of argument, let's assume it's true. So what? Upscale, educated, discriminating viewers are sorely neglected by most network and cable programming. As presumably diligent taxpayers, they deserve to be recognized and pampered somewhere on the television spectrum.
And, evidently, they are reasonably satisfied with what they are getting from PBS. An intense campaign by Senator Robert Dole of Kansas and six other conservative Republicans to reduce proposed Federal spending on public television was resoundingly rejected in the Senate this month. No doubt reflecting their constituencies, the vast majority of senators concluded that editorial independence and freedom from Government interference remain ideals worth cherishing.
The current step-up in antitelevision salvos from the right must have its reasons. Perhaps, if nothing else, the conservative right senses that the heady empowerment gained during the Reagan era has peaked and now is the time to push as many agendas as possible. Most social commentators, left and right, agree that the country is going through a period of uncertainty, trailing the excesses of the 80's and the ensuing recession.
As ideological battle lines are drawn, easy labels tend to be blurred. If some conservatives worry about cultural erosions, a middle-of-the-road liberal like Michael Kinsley can write, in The New Republic, "Even conservative social critics have made the point that free-market capitalism, in its constant stimulation and satisfaction of appetites, is the most powerful force eroding traditional values and social arrangements."
Tough questions must be faced, and television-dominated popular culture is certain to play a major role in shaping the answers. It is only within the context of the gathering storm that the curious spectacle of a Vice President of the United States bullying a television character named Murphy Brown makes perfect sense.

HEADLINE: DANCE VIEW;
For Ballet Theater, Putting on a Good Show Is All

BYLINE: By Anna Kisselgoff

 BODY:
As American Ballet Theater enters its final week at the Metropolitan Opera House, it is clear that the season is ending on a very different note than expected. Last month, halfway into this engagement, Jane Hermann announced that she did not wish to renew her contract as the company's director, a title she shares with Oliver Smith.
Any appraisal of Ballet Theater cannot ignore this development. But neither should the season's performances and productions be neglected: Ms. Hermann's imprint has been felt more strongly than ever during her three-year tenure. The dancing this year reached a new peak, and the premieres were provocative, if not first-rate. 
 Those looking for a scandal will find it not within Ballet Theater but in the lack of sufficient national subsidy comparable to those that foreign governments give their arts institutions. The dance world may be bandying around names of directors of European companies or alumni of Ballet Theater and New York City Ballet to succeed Ms. Hermann after Sept. 1, but the truth is that there is no obvious candidate.
Not everyone is eager to run a ballet company under the stringent financial conditions that were imposed upon Ms. Hermann by the board. She will be remembered for having kept Ballet Theater together during one of its most difficult periods and for maintainingstandards in the bargain.
The main issue before the company is the same one that has been facing it for the last three years: Ballet Theater's board cannot or will not intensify efforts to raise money unless cost-cutting measures first go into effect.
Ballet Theater has no home theater and depends upon touring. Ms. Hermann once expressed hope that the board would subsidize the troupe's touring and that she could produce a money-making "Nutcracker" aimed at local audiences in several cities. (The children in the casts would come from those cities.) These experiments did not materialize. Although Ms. Hermann said she raised $2 million, the board did not give her the additional support she requested.
Stephen J. Friedman, Ballet Theater's new board chairman, has given assurances that the company will continue, and a search committee is busy looking for an artistic director. That is telling in itself: Ballet troupes in America are no longer run by zealous founders but by artistic directors who are employees of a board.
That Ms. Hermann was not a dancer or choreographer but an arts administrator may actually have been in her favor. Historically, very few ballet troupes in the world have been directed by artistic figures with major careers as dancers. A prime example is Ballet Theater itself. The founder was Richard Pleasant, a manager who was succeeded by other managers, including Sol Hurok, until 1945 when Mr. Smith and Lucia Chase became co-directors. Ms. Chase did consider herself a dancer, but the fact is that she performed with Ballet Theater because she was also the company's chief backer.
A choreographer who will impose his or her choreography on Ballet Theater and a director who insists on dancing are exactly what the company does not need. Ms. Hermann's lack of artistic reputation may have been resented by some of the troupe's board members and dancers. But her artistic staff, which includes the coaches recruited by the previous director, Mikhail Baryshnikov, did the actual staging and rehearsing.
A star name at the helm may lend excitement for a few months. But he or she will end up facing the same problems of every company that plays more than two weeks in New York: Declining attendance in a recession when ticket prices rise to meet costs, plus a dearth of major classical choreographers.
In the end, an eclectic company like Ballet Theater has always been about dancers dancing rather than about a single esthetic. Ms. Hermann was faithful to this vision: She put on a good show.
This season, for instance, showed off soloists and an ensemble in top shape, as seen in the fairies' variations in "The Sleeping Beauty" and the corps of "La Bayadere." Kenneth MacMillan's 1987 "Beauty" has been especially well coached by Georgina Parkinson, making for an astonishing unity of style. The troupe's male soloists are the best in American ballet, and the principals displayed general excellence.
Oddly, this overall high level gives the impression of uniformity, which can be mistaken for the routine. Even the guests (Fernando Bujones, Sylvie Guillem, Laurent Hilaire, Steven Heathcote) left little impact. It takes the super virtuosity of a Julio Bocca to stand out in relief. But Johan Renvall was able to do the same in less classical roles through the power of both his technique and his presence in two revivals, Antony Tudor's "Undertow" and Glen Tetley's "Rite of Spring."
Because the full-evening 19th-century classics and the MacMillan "Romeo and Juliet" were presented in weeklong blocks to save on backstage costs, the premieres dropped out of sight too soon.
Nonetheless, the lineup was imaginative. "Firebird" came back in a superior staging by Nicholas Beriozoff; the first American production of Frederick Ashton's "Symphonic Variations" will probably settle in once the dancers get used to its lyrical approach to Neo-Classicism. Michael Smuin's version of Prokofiev's "Peter and the Wolf" has enough virtuosity and wit to appeal to children and adults alike. (It returns Thursday through Saturday.)
More sketchy efforts came from Agnes de Mille in "The Other," a variation on Schubert's "Death and the Maiden" theme, and from John Selya in "Jack and Jill," a young-love duet that was also a showcase for its dancers. (Mr. Selya's "Moondance" was not seen at this writing.)
The equivalent of an adult movie was Ulysses Dove's "Serious Pleasures," whose subtext of sexual fantasies was loosely outlined. The company premiere of "Grass" by Mats Ek was in a similar vein, although a psychological cartoon that dissected a male-female relationship. Mr. Ek is not much at putting movement together, but he has a feel for the sharp theatrical image. The set, a cluster of green poles, recalls the more refined reeds that Isamu Noguchi created for the swamp of marital discord explored by Martha Graham in "Embattled Garden." While the choreography itself fails to build fully into a picture of mutual frustration, the sight of a man and woman thrashing through this grass makes the point.
Ms. Hermann chose new ballets based upon dramatic rather than formal concerns. As such, these premieres differed from the pure-dance works commonly seen elsewhere. It is a direction still worth exploring.

HEADLINE: Japan Unfolds Through Many Images

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY

 BODY:
Early in "Rising Sun," Michael Crichton's bestselling suspense novel, a Los Angeles police detective is dumbfounded to learn that the Japanese doorman who stands in front of an otherwise ordinary middle-income apartment building is a member of the yakuza, the Japanese mafia.
"You must understand," says the detective's older, more worldly partner, a font of wisdom about all things Japanese. "There is a shadow world here -- in Los Angeles, in Honolulu, in New York. Most of the time you're never aware of it. We live in our regular American world, walking our American streets, and we never notice that right alongside our world is a second world . . . a shadow world, available only to the Japanese." 
 As entertainment, "Rising Sun" falls somewhere between "Uncle Tom's Cabin" and "Reefer Madness." Its story suggests an updated version of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers," in which the aliens are little yellow men who dress in dark blue business suits and, like Godzilla, thrive on carcinogens. Why else would they smoke cigarettes nonstop? The message of "Rising Sun": unless we come to our senses, we'll all wake up one morning to find ourselves turned into Japanese pod people.
Daniel Burstein would agree, but for more convincing reasons. In "Yen!," published four years ago, he presents a worst-case scenario about the consequences of Japan's new global economic power. It's possible, he writes, that by 2004 Japan will be in a position to force the United States into financial receivership. He even quotes a prominent Japanese securities broker as suggesting that when the time comes for Japan to bail out this country, it should demand, and be given, the state of California, which would be turned into a joint U.S.-Japanese economic community.
Not since Pearl Harbor has Japan-bashing been such big and popular business. It's easy to understand why. The Japanese are nouveau riche and we are their nouveau poor. They sell. We buy. We scrape together our last pennies to acquire a shiny new Acura we don't desperately need. We jog with Sony Walkmans that make our ears sweat. We watch Japanese-manufactured videocassettes on Japanese VCR's through Japanese television sets. The purchase of Rockefeller Center was the last straw: who can take the Music Hall's all-American Easter pageant seriously, now that the Rockette-nuns are performing their sacred rites on what is, in effect, Japanese turf?
Mr. Crichton's novel is speaking to a receptive public, giving dramatic substance to the sort of statistics about creditor and debtor nations, gross national product and balances of trade that usually appear only on our financial pages or in more straightforward studies like "Yen!" "Rising Sun" is Japan-bashing for the bedside table and the beach.
It also is not the whole story, nor does it mean to be. Yet it doesn't discourage the idea that the Japanese can be safely characterized as a shifty, mendacious lot. "Rising Sun" encourages simple-minded attitudes and answers. It denies the magnitude of everything we don't understand about the variety, differences and contradictions within Japanese culture.
While I was plowing through "Rising Sun," images from Japanese films and passages from Japanese novels kept interrupting what was supposed to be a good read. There was no easy way to reconcile the Crichton stereotypes with, say, Akira Kurosawa's film "Dreams" and the transcendent wonder of a small boy as, against all instructions, he spies on the foxes' magical wedding procession deep in the forest.
There is no accommodation in this kind of literature for the farcical (and failed) double suicide that is the penultimate sequence of "Confessions of Love," the exquisite novel written in 1935 by Chiyu Uno, a sort of Japanese Colette who, when last heard from, was still going strong at 95.
Propaganda as apparently effective as "Rising Sun" not only oversimplifies American-Japanese relations, but it also freezes interest in a culture that, just possibly, may have a lot to teach us. Assuming an air of patriotic disgruntlement gets us no place. So they build a better mousetrap. So, once, did we.
At the time of Pearl Harbor, Japan was as much of a blank for me, at age 17, as it had been for most Americans in 1853 when Commodore Perry sailed into Tokyo Bay. Not many of us in 1941 had even heard of Lafcadio Hearne's essays about his life in Japan at the end of the 19th century. To my generation, anything stamped "Made in Japan" was a joke. As the box was opened, the object inside fell apart. Even the way the war was fought certified our differences. What kind of lunatics would become kamikaze pilots? Being willing to commit suicide for the Emperor was not only mad, we felt, but also unfair. If at all possible, we wanted to survive.
I saw my first Japanese film, or at least a part of a Japanese film, in January or February of 1946 in Otaru, a small seaport on the west coast of Hokkaido. This most northern of the big Japanese islands looked much like New England to the crew of an American LST. Facing the harbor, where our ship was anchored, was a large billboard advertising a local ski maker. Superimposed over the figure of a very Oriental-looking G.I., swooshing down a snowy slope, were the words, "Silver Manted Mountains Are Beckon" (sic).
One afternoon, after skiing, some of us went to a local movie as a lark. We squeezed into too-small seats near the back of the theater and, for no more than 15 minutes, watched a costume drama that was unintelligible and scarcely moved. It seemed to be composed entirely of close-ups of the rice-powdered faces of geishas as they talked, alternating with long, meaningful reaction shots in which their lowered eyes signified nothing. After much snickering, we fled.
I now sometimes fear that we could have walked out on something by Kenji Mizoguchi (1898-1956), whose films in celebration of women have long since secured a treasured place in the international film canon. It might even have been his classic "Utamaro and His Five Women" about the artist Kitagawa Utamaro (1753-1806), except that Mizoguchi used close-ups sparingly. "Utamaro and His Five Women" was made in 1946, but it seems unlikely that it could have been showing in a small provincial theater so quickly after its completion. Whatever it was, it meant nothing to any of us.
Mr. Crichton's description of the shadow world, which exists alongside ours but remains unseen in contemporary Los Angeles, Honololu and New York, would as accurately describe the world inhabited by the Japanese in Japan in relation to the American occupation forces at the end of the war. The Japanese remained largely invisible, unknowable.
Yet they knew about us. They grew up on American movies. The Hollywood stars -- Charlie Chaplin, Shirley Temple, Laurel and Hardy, Gary Cooper -- were as popular in Japan as they were in the United States. Even today, Japan is the largest, most avid offshore market for American movies in the world, second in size only to Canada. Though Japanese economic power is felt everywhere in this country, and though Japanese products are ubiquitous, our knowledge of Japan isn't much greater than it was a half-century ago.
According to the records of The New York Times, the first Japanese sound film to be released in New York was Mikio Naruse's "Kimiko," which opened at the Filmarte Theater on April 12, 1937. Naruse's particular fondness for stories that, like their protagonists, avoid open conflict at all costs did not amuse the Times's critic. Though Naruse's gently furious family dramas are today regarded as being the near equal of those of Yasujiro Ozu, New York did not see another Naruse film until the release of "When a Woman Ascends the Stairs" in 1963.
Japanese films and novels have never had a success in this country to equal that of European works but, since 1951 and the praise heaped on Kurosawa's Oscar-winning "Rashomon," their influence has been accumulating. For someone who, like me, had spent many months in Japan and seen virtually nothing that wasn't an American landscape, the effect was astonishing and invigorating, also intimidating. How was it possible not to see when I was there?
In fact, there is no way of seeing, as a Government-paid tourist, what one sees in the work of Kurosawa, whether in his samurai epics, culminating in the majestic "Ran," in his early social dramas such as "Scandal" and "Ikiru," or in his two last, most beneficent works, "Dreams" and his elegy for the nuclear age, "Rhapsody in August."
Thanks to Dan Talbot's fondly remembered New Yorker Theater, we were given the opportunity in the 1970's to appreciate nearly the full body of Ozu's work, though the artist himself had died in 1963. Of special interest are Ozu's postwar films, culminating in his "Tokyo Story," released here in 1972, which, though it never raises its voice, is a ferocious consideration of the effect of newly shifting values, hastened by the American occupation, on one Japanese family.
Far more lethal is Shoei Imamura's uproarious "Pigs and Battleships," made in 1961 but not released here until 1986. Though not characteristic of Imamura's other, more poetic films, "Pigs and Battleships" is a matchless, sometimes vicious melodramatic comedy about the small-time hoods, hustlers, whores and influence peddlers who gather around the U.S. Naval Base at Yokosuka.
Quite late, and on an irregular basis, the breathtakingly beautiful period films of Mizoguchi have become available, including "Utamaro and His Five Women" and the grandly cautionary ghost story, "Ugetsu." Over the years these works by the acknowledged masters have been supplemented by the films of an irreverent younger generation of directors led by Nagisa Oshima. Mr. Oshima's most notorious film to date, "In the Realm of the Senses," has still not been generally released at home because of its hard-core sex sequences.
The problem with a novel like "Rising Sun," and with Japan-bashing in general, is that it seems to make every Japanese look and sound alike. Gone are all of the exceptions to the rule that testify to the vigor of any culture. As much as anything else, this is the point of the Lincoln Center Film Society's current series, "Changing Japan: New Ways in a Traditional Society," now in its last week at the Walter Reade Theater.
There is still time, however, to see Kazuo Hara's bold documentary, "The Emperor's Naked Army Marches On" (1987), about an obsessed World War II vet. This aging fellow, mad as a hatter, roams contemporary Japan trying to assassinate Government ministers and distributing pornographic pictures of the Emperor. On one earlier occasion, it seems, he attempted to hit the Emperor with lead pellets fired with a slingshot.
The high point of this week's program at Lincoln Center: two films by Juzo Itami, "The Funeral" (1985), one of the most hilarious and humane movies ever to come out of Japan, and the lyrically funny "Tampopo" (1986), which pretends to be about the art of noodle making but is about the art of living in a world in the midst of momentous change.
(Mr. Itami, who has been relentless in satirizing the coziness of big business and government figures with members of the mob, particularly in his two "Taxing Woman" comedies, is now recuperating from what the Tokyo police have described as a yakuza-backed assassination attempt. The director was badly knifed but not robbed by four men outside his house on May 22.)
The extent of the changes in Japanese life can be appreciated only if one does some exploring. One has to go back to Kurosawa, to Ozu, to the novels of Junichiro Tanizaki (1886-1965) (particularly to the epic "The Makioka Sisters"), to the classic "Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon," a record of court life in 10th-century Japan, even to Yoji Yamada's hugely popular series of Tora-san comedies, which have been coming out twice a year since the 1970's, to celebrate the small-community values few Japanese recognize anymore.
"Rising Sun" tells us gravely that a building is "typically Japanese" because the outside gives no indication of what is inside, that it's very important for a Japanese to save face, and that, most frightening of all, "Everything works in Japan . . . Trains are on time. Bags are not lost."
Possibly as much to point is the career of the nonagenarian former flapper, Chiyo Uno, whose story, as reported by her translator, Phyllis Birnbaum, embraces a nearly nonstop succession of marriages and love affairs, all of which became material for her novels and stories. Uno, writes Ms. Birnbaum, "demonstrated dazzling pluck as well as a genius for emotional catastrophe." She was not exactly your average Ozu housewife. But the Ozu housewife takes on enriched significance just because there was Uno.
Their Japan is the Japan I want to know about. The other Japan can be Made in Hollywood.

HEADLINE: POP VIEW;
The Jazz Festival Revisits Itself

BYLINE: By Peter Watrous

 BODY:
When the JVC Jazz Festival rolls into town, as it does this Friday, it usually sets critics off in a head-scratching flurry: what, they wonder, is the state of jazz, expecting the festival to produce some answers. Because it's the largest American jazz festival and takes place in a city where jazz is a substantial part of the cultural scene, it has signficance. And it can provide some answers.
If we believe what this year's festival is telling us, the jazz world has become lackluster. The order of the day is the tribute, the re-creation and the just plain dusty -- a bad sign. 
 Here are some shows that prove the point: there will be two tributes for Dizzy Gillespie, who deserves it, though he has been celebrated regularly over the last year in honor of his 75th birthday. There will be one for John Coltrane, who has also been feted a lot lately; one for Stan Getz, who died last June, and likewise for the trumpeter and band leader Buck Clayton, who died in December. Clifford Brown is honored by a mediocre jazz trumpeter, Arturo Sandoval, who is paired with Thelonious Monk's son. Lionel Hampton gets an evening, and Gerry Mulligan is recreating the 1949 Birth of the Cool session, which featured Miles Davis, with a 10-member group.
Not that most of this will be bad, given the caliber of the people performing. And tributes in themselves aren't wrong; they've occasionally offered up some terrific music. But there's a blandness and predictability to the schedule, a trotting out of all the same suspects to perform the same old roles.
Where are the combinations of musicians that bring something new to the story? Where are the little signs that show that the festival's programmers know what's going on in the clubs, know the history of the music, know which musicians have special works locked up in a drawer somewhere, works that would make for thrilling and revelatory listening? And where are the new faces, the young musicians to be put on stage with the older ones, making it clear that jazz has some continuity?
The forthcoming festival, which runs through June 27, is a retreat. Last year's event, one of the best in a decade, included a host of young musicians; festival organizers were acknowledging that a mainstream jazz renaissance had occurred and they had to begin grooming younger musicians. That doesn't exist this year, with only a few exceptions. This exclusion is programming suicide: it keeps young musicians from learning how to deal with larger halls and keeps audiences from being introduced to new faces and ideas.
But the grayness coursing through the festival seems endemic to much of the jazz world at the moment. The growth of jazz over the last decade is slowing simply because there has been a startling lack of imagination on the part of just about everyone involved in the music, from concert producers and record companies to critics, musicians and audiences. It's no wonder that the music is often not taken seriously, given the sloppiness of the productions (granted, often because of jazz's limited economic base) and the redundancy of some performances.
And though the state of jazz can't continue to languish, change hasn't happened yet. In clubs, still hothouses for innovation, where musicians can show off their intellectual finery, the music can be immensely exciting. But more often, musicians run through the same tunes the same way, accentuating a sense of stasis. It is as if the entire culture is suffering a momentary intake of breath before the assault on the top of the mountain is taken on.
Even the thrill of the new, in the form of ranks of aspiring musicians arriving in New York, has cooled. After a decade of influx that shows no sign of receding, the expectation that should greet young musicians isn't there anymore. Having signed up all the promising musicians, labels can't deal with the next generation because of their limited resources. And the young musicians themselves aren't progressing as fast as they should; promise, in some cases, is in the process of wilting. In the mid-1980's, it was important to have generations dedicated to learning the fundamentals of jazz. But now that there are hundreds of musicians capable of playing mainstream jazz proficiently, it seems time to emphasize the art over the craft.
There are easy ways out of the problem. For every 10 mundane, badly produced jazz records, there is a record like Joe Henderson's perfectly produced "Lush Life, the Music of Billy Strayhorn" -- thoughtful, carefully experimental and cross generational. For every routine concert, there are the occasionally brilliant shows at Lincoln Center, where new ways of looking at old subjects get explored and where old and young musicians mix it up.
For every club show of endless solos, there can be an exhilarating performance like that of the drummer Art Taylor's group, meticulously arranged and conceived and also cross generational. Or events like the monthlong Dizzy Gillespie tribute at the Blue Note in which a different period from his career was featured each week. And that's nothing compared to the fecundity to be found at the margins of jazz and new music, where ideas flourish faster than ability and tradition plays a much smaller role.
Part of this generally rundown mood may stem from comparisons to what's happening elsewhere within jazz. Young musicians like Bobby Watson and Wynton Marsalis are working a deft balance between composition and improvisation, and at the same time have retained a dedication to swing. In the process, they have made mainstream jazz an experimental form again, leaving the standard theme and variation of most small-group jazz sounding limited. As for programming, the imagination shown by Lincoln Center's new season, which starts in August, with its thematic programming and its attention to history, leaves most other programs looking shabby. What might have passed as workable several years ago now comes off as drab.
The point is fairly simple: the jazz world has to start looking outside the jazz world for ideas. Young musicians have to figure out how to get beyond the standard forms without losing the essence of improvisation and swing. Jazz record producers and the people at labels who sign young talent have to start going to clubs to find what's there, who's doing what.
It is the right time. Institutional support for mainstream jazz is greater than ever, there are probably more young jazz musicians learning their skills than at any time since the early 1960's, and there is more exposure to the music than there has been for 20 years. There are even hints of a new direction being offered by some musicians. It's now up to the packagers and the producers to take advantage of the situation; the frame of the music should be at least as creative as the music itself. The lack of foresight puts jazz back where it has been for most of the century, at the back of the bus, a second cousin to the culture it represents.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: F.D.R. Jr.'s Homestead;
An Upscale Project Upstate

 BODY:
Most developers are adapting to the rigors of the recession by building smaller, less expensive houses. But the developers of Dalton Farm, a residential community in Beekman, N.Y., are taking a different tack. On their 560-acre tract, the former homestead of Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr., the late son of the 32d President who served as a United States Representative from New York, they have begun building a more upscale section, an 18-home enclave called Pondwood.
Dalton Farm opened in 1988 with plans for 162 modest town houses and 378 one-family homes. So far, 51 of the one-family houses and 48 town houses have been built. 
 Earlier this month, L.M. Dalton Corporation of Poughquag, N.Y., the builders, unveiled the Pondwood section, and buyers put deposits on eight of its homes. The project architect is Do Chung of Stamford, Conn.
Pondwood homes have 1,900 to 3,000 square feet of space, as opposed to 1,375 to 1,956 square feet for the other one-family homes in Dalton Farm.
Prices range from $215,000 to $320,000. The smaller models are priced from $165,000 to $232,000.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Downtown Brooklyn;
Planning Strategies for a New Retail Environment

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD

 BODY:
WHEN Alan Frisher decided to expand his health-food store last year, in the middle of a recession, people wondered if he might have overdosed on his own vitamins.
"Everyone thought I was crazy," he said, "But I thought if any area is going to come out of the recession, it will be downtown Brooklyn." He based his optimism on the explosion of new commerical development in the area in the last few years. 
 Since the late 80's, three major office complexes have been built and have already attracted such high-profile companies as Goldman, Sachs and Company, Morgan Stanley and Chase Manhattan Bank. In local radio commercials, the new downtown district is now being called "Wall Street East."
So far, the developments, some not yet complete, have brought a total of 10,000 new employees to the downtown, which stretches roughly from the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridge entrances to Atlantic Avenue and Court Street. And 4,000 more office workers are expected by this October.
All this has local retailers scrambling to expand and to find just the right formula to entice the burgeoning market into their stores. It might not be an easy sell, since the downtown shopping district is considered rundown and somewhat unsafe.
"We all know that just because people work in an area doesn't necessarily mean they shop there," said Francesco P. Cantarella, senior vice president of A & S, the district's major anchor, on the Fulton Street Mall. "These developments can be like wombs where people stay because they feel safe."
To draw them outside, retailers are sponsoring block parties, open-air fairs and other social events "to help familiarize people with the neighborhood," Mr. Cantarella said, "and to let them know the streets are perfectly safe and have a lot to offer."
Downtown booster groups, like the Fulton Mall Improvement Association and the Metrotech Area Business Improvement District, have been trying to rally merchants to spruce up their images to compete more effectively.
A year ago, Mr. Frisher moved his Downtown Natural Foods Market from Jay Street to Willoughby Street, in the new Metrotech Center, a $1 billion commercial and academic complex. In the process, he tripled his work space, from 900 to 2,800 square feet, and spent $250,000 on renovation.
"I call it classically modern with nice molding and upscale touches," Mr. Frisher said. "It was done to welcome all the new people from Metrotech."
In recent months, Mr. Frisher said, he has begun to attract some new customers. "I'm definitely seeing more business suits," he said. At the same time, he has managed to hold on to his regular clientele, mostly people who live in the neighborhood.
"The two groups have different wants and needs," he said. "The business people ask a lot of medically oriented questions, which I love."
To meet the needs of his new customers, Mr. Frisher, who holds a Ph.D. in nutrition, has also expanded the store's vitamin section and tripled the size of the juice bar, which is popular with the lunch crowd.
For some other shopkeepers, many of whom had to relocate to make way for the new buildings, finding their way in the new marketplace has not been as easy. One stumbling block is the rising cost of retail space.
When the new construction was first announced, retail rents skyrocketed to a high of $150 a square foot. "They've since leveled off to a more realistic level of about $50 to $75," said Jill Kelly, executive director of the Fulton Mall Improvement Association.
EVEN so, several shopkeepers either went out of business or had to leave the area. The survivors are still struggling to find a niche in what they consider an alien environment.
Sid's Hardware and Home Center, a fixture on Jay and Myrtle Streets for 60 years, had to move when Metrotech took over its space. It was relocated to one of the new development's office buildings.
"I had two buildings before, with 60,000 square feet," said a co-owner, Hymie Wengrosky. "Now I have about 25,000 square feet and very limited storage space." He said that having less inventory has sometimes hurt sales, "but I'd rather lose a few sales than have to pay the astronomical cost for dead storage."
If things go according to plan, rents could get even higher. Several more projects are being planned, including a 31-story hotel and office tower and a 2-million-square-foot office, retail and housing complex above the Long Island Rail Road terminal.
Stores with the best chance of surviving in this crowded atmosphere will be those with nationally known brands and upscale merchandise, said Paul Travis, chairman of the Ratner Group, the developer of Metrotech.
Two and a half years ago, Ratner also bought the Albee Square Mall, an indoor shopping center at Fulton Street and DeKalb Avenue. "We bought it in conjunction with the building of Metrotech," he said. "It is our belief that there'll be a great need in the area for an indoor shopping mall. So we're now working to upgrade the physical attributes of the mall and bring in nationally known tenants."
A prime example of Mr. Travis's preference for upscale shops is the opening of Au Bon Pain, a unit of the bakery and cafe chain, in the Metrotech Center last April. Paul Hinksman, the store's manager, said it is already a success. "We made $1,500 on opening day," he said, "and now we make $4,800 a day. This shop is doing much better than some of our Manhattan locations."
There are also positive signs in other product areas, such as consumer electronics. Radio Shack, in the Albee Square Mall, recently doubled its floor size, said Mr. Travis. And the Wiz, on the Fulton Square Mall, is opening another, even bigger, store on the same street. One will sell records, tapes and compact discs, the other, electronics.
Retailers like the Wiz have been in downtown Brooklyn through all its ups and downs. The store on Fulton Street, the first Wiz ever opened, dates to the 60's.
An even older presence on the street is the 112-year-old Gage & Tollner, the oldest restaurant in New York City, according to its owner, Peter Aschkenasy. Mr. Aschkenasy bought the restaurant four years ago, when the office developments were first announced. Since then he has been working out strategies to take advantage of his new market. First he changed the menu to "more universally accepted food, like lobsters and steaks," he said. Then he expanded the nighttime hours. '
"WE'RE starting to get regular customers from the new office buildings," he said. "And it can only get better.
Some of the other older retailers have been a bit more skeptical about the latest talk of yet another economic bonanza. They remember being promised more business, in 1984, after the $24 million renovation of Fulton Street, which transformed the street into a brick walkway, with landscaping and wooden benches. After that, the street lost the Mays department store in 1988, and merchants became skittish about what was next.
It was at that time that the new projects were proposed. "Many of the shopkeepers, especially the old timers, didn't believe that what happened would happen," said Ms. Kelly. "They were totally unprepared."
That was not going to happen to Victor Ashok Vora, an Indian immigrant who started out in downtown Brooklyn 20 years ago by working in a card store on Fulton Street.
He now owns two Hallmark stationery stores and a Baskin-Robbins in the Metrotech Center and another card store on Flatbush Avenue. He is hoping to open another Baskin-Robbins downtown and has great hopes for the future.
"It's like the immigrant's dream come true," he said. "I've paid my dues in downtown Brooklyn. Now it's time to take the benefit from it. I don't think there's any downside. The future will be bright. I'm glad I stayed around all those years."

HEADLINE: Streetscapes: The Empire State Building;
A Red Reprise for a '31 Wonder

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
In the biggest window replacement ever authorized by the Landmarks Preservation Commission, more than 6,300 new windows are going into New York's tallest landmark, the Empire State Building.
The new glass and frames give the 1931 building an airy, fresh appearance. The frames are also are a bit of a surprise because they are red, an unexpected contrast with the gray and silver skyscraper. An additional surprise is that research has shown that the original window frames were that color. 
 The Empire State was conceived as a 50-story loft building to succeed the old Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on the west side of Fifth Avenue between 33d and 34th Streets. That project faltered and the site went to new developers, including a General Motors executive, John J. Raskob. According to Hamilton Weber, the renting manager, the new owners got into the height race going on in New York and proposed an 86-story tower to beat Walter Chrysler's new spire at 42d and Lexington by four feet.
But the architects, Shreve, Lamb & Harmon, revised the plan for a greater margin, adding a giant metal finial to bring it to 1,250 feet. This was widely ridiculed as a meaningless gimmick in a pointless race for height, but the promoters said the finial was to function as a mooring mast for dirigibles. It never did.
Although the building is usually described as Art Deco, it is not so much a style as "a logical and simple answer to the problems set by the economic and technical demands," according to the architect William F. Lamb.
"As far as possible, handwork was done away with," he wrote in 1931, to favor the fastest, most economical construction techniques. The vertical strips of nickel steel and limestone could go up independently and railroad tracks were laid on each floor to speed delivery of materials. The demolition of the hotel and completion of the world's tallest building in May 1931 took 19 months.
The emphasis on systematic design and construction leaves the building outside of neat stylistic divisions. Some of the decoration is of the linear Art Deco of the 1920's, other elements are more abstract and streamlined, belonging to the Moderne of the 1930's. The limestone and metal trim give the building a very traditional, conservative cast, but the planarity of the facade -- the windows are flush with the wall instead of set in, another efficiency measure -- suggests contemporary European modernism.
The architectural critic Douglas Haskell thought that the limestone was a silly historicism, and that if metal had been used instead, the "swift and unfussy shaft" would have been a masterpiece. But Edmund Wilson, writing in the New Republic, called the building "New York's handsomest skyscraper," its neutral color reflecting the varying tones of the sky -- bluish gray, bisque pink, pale gray, silver -- "like a cake of ice."
The building's 3 million square feet opened only 46 percent rented, but The New York Times said that the income from admissions to the observatory was $1 million a year. A large transmission mast was added in 1953, but the World Trade Center and then the Sears Tower in Chicago beat the Empire State for height in the 1970's. It was designated a landmark in 1981.
THE original windows were typical of the time -- machine-produced rolled steel. Although more expensive nonrusting metals were used for the decorative elements, William C. Shopsin, the building's preservation consultant, says the windows were originally painted for protection against corrosion.
Over the last several decades most of the window frames were repainted in darker shades, although those in the lower part were more recently painted green.
When all of a building's windows are replaced at once instead of piecemeal, the Landmarks Preservation Commission requires testing for the original paint color with microscopic and chemical analysis. Both the commission and Mr. Shopsin were surprised when these tests showed the original color was a deep, tomato-soup red -- it seems out of character with perceptions of the Empire State's coloration as neutral.
But the use of color was a strong current in modern architecture at the time and indeed the windows of the McGraw-Hill Building of 1931 at 330 West 42d Street were originally the same color.
Although the replacement program will take several years, the effect is already striking. The new windows draw attention to the planar modernism of the facade and the color seems like a striking departure from the building's familiar sobriety. Together they produce a new-old view of the building that will take some time to come into focus.

HEADLINE: 2 G.O.P. Leaders Push New State Agenda

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
BY all accounts, Donald T. DiFrancesco, President of the Senate, and Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, Speaker of the Assembly, are potentially the most powerful political figures in the state. With Republican majorities in the Senate and Assembly large enough to override a gubernatorial veto, the two Republican leaders are positioned to determine what will become law between now and the end of 1993.
"Right now," Mr. Haytaian said, "the office of Senate President and the office of the Assembly Speaker are probably more influential than they have ever been." 
Since the beginning of the legislative term in January, the two men have produced a torrent of bills and proposed constitutional amendments that, if enacted, would result in the most dramatic changes in governmental policy in recent memory.
The Republicans have already flexed their political muscle by pushing through, over Gov. Jim Florio's veto, a rollback of the state sales tax from 7 percent to 6 percent. Their bills tightening the death-penalty statute and toughening the statutes on child pornography have been enacted into law.
Now they are developing legislation for changes in the automobile insurance laws, the state budget process, the health-care system and the Quality Education Act. And they have proposed as many as 10 constitutional amendments on issues ranging from initiative and referendum and the death penalty to limits on legislative terms and a requirement that the state pay for new municipal and county programs it mandates.
"The Republicans in the Legislature have taken on a major agenda of constitutional revision," said Alan Rosenthal, who is the director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. "I think they are hoping to restructure government to a very considerable extent."
At the same time Mr. DiFrancesco and Mr. Haytaian have pursued this wide-ranging agenda, they have been struggling to cope with a flood of bad news, ranging from reduced tax revenue of $310 million (not counting the $608 million loss from their own sales tax cut) to the threatened loss of $450 million in Federal Medicaid funds.
What remains to be seen is whether Mr. DiFrancesco and Mr. Haytaian can control their troops. Mr. DiFrancesco has the more formidable task, since the Republican majority in the Senate, 27 to 13, is exactly the number required to override a veto by the Governor, who is a Democrat. A single renegade Republican senator could kill an override attempt. In the Assembly, where the Republican majority is 58 to 22, Mr. Haytaian has a four-vote override cushion.
"My sense is that a lot of the Republican legislators have their own agenda," said Ross Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers, "which means they can stray off the reservation."
The Senate minority leader, John A. Lynch, Democrat of New Brunswick and the former Senate President, added, "Even in the best of circumstances, it's difficult to get 27 legislators to agree on anything."
The two point men leading the Republican charge are a political odd couple -- Mr. DiFrancesco, a slender, soft-spoken 47-year-old lawyer, and Mr. Haytaian, a bulky, blustery 54-year-old electrical engineer.
One recent afternoon, Mr. DiFrancesco sat in his office in the State House, his elbows on his desk, his chin perched on clasped hands. His unlined face, eyeglasses and precise, measured speech made him seem like an economics professor ready to lecture a class of sophomores.
On the other side of Mr. DiFrancesco's uncluttered desk sat Mr. Haytaian. Even sitting still, Mr. Haytaian radiated energy, as though at any second he might jump from his chair to bound off to his next appointment. His face is all contours and curves, etched with a permanent smile, and the words seem to tumble out of him.
 
 When they speak of their legislative goals, more differences emerge. Mr. Haytaian hammers away at themes that have aroused great public interest -- sales taxes, automobile insurance, limits on legislative terms. Mr. DiFrancesco wants to improve the way state revenue is predicted, in order to craft the state budget more accurately.
"The item first and foremost on my agenda is the budget process," he said. One possible change, he said, would be to provide for independent forecasting of state revenue so that income expectations can be predicted more accurately and future billion-dollar shortfalls avoided. Under current practice, revenue predictions are made by the State Treasurer's office.
He also said the Legislature would be looking at ways to make the Quality Education Act more efficient by "loosening up on the regulatory aspects of education" in the districts that are performing well, and by devoting greater attention to those districts that are below par.
"If we have kids in classes that don't have books because there isn't enough money to buy the books," he said, "then we're doing something wrong. Maybe we should buy the books ourselves."
 
Changes in Auto Insurance
 Other items high on his agenda: the revision of the state's hospital billing system, which was invalidated last month by a Federal judge, and changes in the automobile insurance laws that would encourage greater competition among insurance providers.
In the Assembly, Mr. Haytaian pointed out, Republicans are drafting amendments to the auto insurance law that would reinstate rate differentials based upon such factors as sex, age and geographical location. Governor Florio's Fair Automobile Insurance Reform Act of 1990 eliminated such differentials.
"It is not a 'fair' act," he said. "The act was a fallacy."
Mr. Haytaian emphasized the Republicans' determination to put at least some of their proposed constitutional amendments on the ballot in November.
 
Initiative and Referendum
 One measure legislators are grappling with is a constitutional amendment on initiative and referendum -- the process whereby registered voters in the state can directly enact new laws by placing proposed legislation on the ballot by petition.
Two versions of such an amendment are being considered by the Legislature. One would allow proposed legislation to be placed on the ballot upon the presentation of petitions bearing the signatures of 6 percent of voters who voted in the last gubernatorial election. The other would allow both proposed legislation and constitutional amendments to be placed on the ballot, but increases the petition requirement to 8 percent for legislation and 12 percent for amendments.
Another constitutional amendment being considered is the legislative veto, which gives lawmakers the ability to void regulations made by state agencies if the Legislature decides that the regulations do not reflect the intent of the enabling legislation.
Yet another amendment being considered by legislators, Mr. Haytaian said, is the issue of "state mandate, state pay," under which the state government would pick up the cost of any new municipal or county programs that the Legislature requires. A related constitutional amendment proposal, which would require the state to pick up the cost of county courts, is now before the Senate.
The list of potential constitutional amendments also covers such issues as the right of the electorate to recall the governor and legislators from office, changes in the death-penalty statute, a prohibition on forced regionalization of school districts and a provision to limit the terms of legislators.
 
Limiting Number of Amendments
 Mr. DiFrancesco, while supportive of such initiatives, said he would prefer not to put too many constitutional amendment questions on the ballot in any one year. More than four or five, he said, would be cumbersome and could be confusing to voters.
The ultimate success of the Republican agenda, political experts say, is dependent upon the extent to which Mr. Haytaian and Mr. DiFrancesco can maintain party discipline. And their ability to do that emanates from the built-in powers of their offices and the loyalties they have built up over their years in the Legislature.
Before a bill can come up for a vote in either house, it must be approved by one or more legislative committees, and the decision to post a bill for a committee vote is made by the committee chairman. The Assembly Speaker and the Senate President appoint the chairmen of the committees in their respective houses, and the committee chairmen tend to be sensitive to the political views of those who appointed them.
 
'Little Debt of Gratitude'
 The Speaker and the Senate President also exert considerable influence on other legislators because of their ability to raise campaign funds and distribute them to favored legislators. "If the Speaker or President raise a lot of money and give some of it to a guy who's running for the first time," Mr. Rosenthal said, "there's a little debt of gratitude there."
But political experts warn that the powerful potential to override a gubernatorial veto may not always be available. Some of the Republican legislative proposals, Professor Baker of Rutgers said, are an effort to make good on politically popular campaign promises, like initiative and referendum, that make some legislators uneasy.
Initiative and referendum, for example, is seen by some legislators as a dilution of their legislative responsibilities. And a constitutional amendment limiting legislators' terms -- a pet project of Mr. Haytaian -- is not exactly a popular topic among lawmakers.
Senator John H. Ewing, Republican of Bedminster, emphasized the difference between the override potential in the Assembly and the Senate. In the Assembly, he said, the Speaker can allow four legislators who confront "special circumstances" on a given issue to abstain or vote against an override.
"But in the Senate," he said, "we have no members to spare, so you can't let anybody off the hook."

HEADLINE: World Markets;
The Latin American Rebound

BYLINE: By Michael Quint

 BODY:
From riches to rags and back to riches. That is the uneven road followed by many banks in their lending to Latin American countries.
In the heady days of the 1970's, when banks were flush with deposits from oil-producing countries, lending to Latin America was good business, producing handsome fees and interest payments. By 1982, when Mexico defaulted on its loans, the business had soured and large banks around the world took big losses. But in the past few years the pendulum has swung again, as many Latin American economies have strengthened and their stock markets have soared. 
 "Recent economic reforms have been very beneficial to local economies in Latin America, and that has been reflected in their stock markets," said William R. Rhodes, vice chairman at Citicorp, a leading lender in many of those countries. Citicorp has benefited from rising stock prices, Mr. Rhodes said, because it has sizable investments in local companies. Many of these investments occurred when the bank accepted stock in a company in exchange for a bank loan that could not be repaid.
The last several months have been heady times in the Latin American stock markets, as capital that fled those countries in the 1980's has been invested locally once again. In Brazil, stock prices have increased 40.9 percent so far this year, after adjusting for the exchange of cruzeiros for dollars. In Chile, the gain in dollar terms has been 35.4 percent; in Mexico, 29.4 percent, and in Argentina, 21.4 percent.
In the United States, by contrast, the stock market has fallen 2.1 percent this year, and in Japan, the decline has been 23.1 percent.
According to Morgan Stanley & Company, which compiles data on stock market performance in about three dozen countries, Brazil has been the world's second-strongest market this year, following Hong Kong. Chile has been the fourth-strongest; Mexico, the sixth, and Argentina, the seventh.
Kevin J. Mulvaney, head of global banking at the Bank of Boston Corporation, noted that many banks, including his, are benefiting from the rebound in Latin American economies. In some cases, loans are proving to be worth more than banks had estimated years ago when they set aside reserves to cover expected losses. "Over the entire cycle, banks still suffered from their lending excesses, but in many cases they are now approaching a break-even point," he said.
Mr. Mulvaney added that companies like the Bank of Boston and Citicorp are earning strong profits at their large banks in Argentina and Brazil that accept deposits and make loans to local businesses and consumers.
American bankers have been slow to publicize their gains, partly because they are still negotiating with Brazil and Argentina over new loan terms. "We can't appear to be gloating over how much money we are making on some of our investments because of the political implications in Latin America," said one American banker, who spoke on condition that he not be identified.
At Citicorp, the most active American lender in Latin America, problems with its loans have been much better documented than their recovery. Profits were reduced at Citicorp by $4 billion in the late 1980's, when it increased its reserves to cover losses it expected on loans to less developed countries that were not paying their debts on time. In the past year, however, Citicorp has pulled $200 million from that reserve to apply against other problem loans.
John S. Reed, Citicorp's chairman, said last week at a conference sponsored by Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, a securities firm, that the value of Citicorp's various stock investments was now greater than the original amount of the loans that were exchanged for the corporate stocks. Mr. Reed, who is trying to persuade investors that Citicorp is stronger than indicated by its current stock price of $20.375, was not willing, however, to elaborate on the value of its stock investments, the companies involved or Citicorp's plans for those stocks.
The most recently disclosed gain at Citicorp came in the first quarter, when the company earned $218 million after taxes from the sale of various investments, including some in Latin American companies.
Mr. Rhodes said in an interview last week that Citicorp had already taken several hundred million dollars of gains from investments it took in exchange for loans. He added that "where the markets are right now, we would have several hundred million more."
Ronald Mandle, banking analyst at Sanford Bernstein, has estimated that Citicorp could have $1.5 billion worth of investments stemming from its earlier loans to Latin American countries. He noted that the company carries those investments on its books at only $600 million, but cautions that the $1.5 billion estimate could be off the mark by a few hundred million dollars.
Companies in which Citicorp is known to own shares include Telebras, the Brazilian telephone company; Fensa, Mexico's No. 1 soft drink bottler and brewer (Corona beer is one of its products), and several companies in Chile. In Argentina, where Citicorp owns part of Intel, a telephone company serving Buenos Aires, the value of its investment has tripled since late 1990.

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
Solidarity in Silicon Valley

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
Stung by the steady exodus of jobs and manufacturing from Silicon Valley, some of the region's biggest companies have come together in an unprecedented coalition aimed at restoring the area's economic vitality. Joint Venture: Silicon Valley, as the coalition is called, released a preliminary report last week showing that the valley lags the San Francisco Bay Area and the nation as a whole in the creation of new jobs.
High real estate costs and strict land use regulations have for years prompted companies to shift operations out of the valley, an area south of San Francisco that is home to many computer and semiconductor companies. But it is only recently that executives came to any kind of consensus about the damage these moves have caused. That helped to get arch competitors to join the coalition, said Thomas Hayes, chairman of the group. 
 "Enough pain was shared that people were motivated to come together," said Mr. Hayes, 32, who is also the manager of global corporate relations for Santa Clara-based Applied Materials Inc., a maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment. "If I had tried to get this group together a year ago it wouldn't have happened."
Participants include Apple Computer, Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Intel and Tandem.
Mr. Hayes says the aim of the group is to persuade companies to stop moving plants to places like Austin, Tex., or Portland, Ore., two fast-growing high-tech areas.
"There are so many pretenders to the throne, so many Silicon Islands, Silicon Glens or Silicon Prairies," he said. "This area can offer you not only a critical mass of technology, but a creative tension you won't find elsewhere."
The group has commissioned SRI International, a Menlo Park research concern, to develop an agenda for the public and private sectors to cure the area's ills. Mr. Hayes conceded that the birth of Silicon Valley was a happy accident, and that any formal attempt to reinvent the valley would smack of "industrial policy," heresy for entrepreneurs.
"We're not trying to tamper with the core advantage of the valley -- the entrepreneurial spirit," he said. "But when you look at what is ailing us, it has a lot to do with the environment here."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Will Somebody Please Borrow A Little Money?

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
If nobody goes shopping, is it really a recovery?
That is the question that economists may soon have to confront. The early 1992 burst of consumer spending has faded, and American consumers are reaching for their wallets not to spend but to pay off debts. "There is a worrisome trend toward prudence," said James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer. 
 Last week the Federal Reserve reported that consumer credit outstanding fell by $3.8 billion in April, the largest one-month decline since June 1980, when credit controls were crunching the economy.
 That is not, to put it mildly, the normal course of events after a recession ends. "There is no past recovery where we can find this happening," said Susan Sterne of Economic Analysis Associates in Stowe, Vt. Ed Yardeni, the chief economist at C. J. Lawrence, said it is raising the chances of a "triple-dip recession."
The weakness in credit creation has lasted longer than anyone expected. It used to be assumed that consumer credit always rose, no matter what. After all, the figure showed declines in just nine of the 120 months of the 1980's. So far in the 1990's, it is down for 14 of the 28 months reported.
Until last week, analysts could at least take comfort from retail sales, which seemed to be moving along at adequate levels, if not at the smart pace of January. But the Commerce Department said, in effect, "never mind," and revised downward the figures for February through April, at the same time announcing a puny 0.2 percent increase for May.
Wall Street's reaction was to heave a sigh of relief. When stock prices slipped early last week, the seers somehow concluded that inflation fears might have something to do with it. But the evidence of a weakening economy reduced those fears, and, according to the Wall Street consensus, provided another reason for the Fed to cut interest rates. This generation's economic patent medicine, guaranteed to cure whatever ails you, is lower rates.
In fact, lower interest rates may be part of the problem. With bank savings rates so low, the much higher rates on loans seem extortionate, and that may be discouraging some would-be borrowers. Or perhaps the trend reflects a demographic development, with the heavy-borrowing age group of 25- to 34-year-olds now declining for the first time since the 1950's. Maybe, suggests Ms. Sterne, "the 1980's taught the consumer it was more rewarding to own financial assets than tangible assets. He would rather buy G.M.'s stock than its cars."
In the long run, it is probably good for Americans to save more and spend less. But for now the figures throw doubt on the belief that consumer confidence is growing, and they make a vigorous recovery appear even less likely.
And that, in turn, makes it probable that most of this quarter's earnings surprises, unlike the first quarter's, will be the kind that make stockholders cry rather than cheer.

HEADLINE: The 'How' in Home Improvement

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Depot Don, meet Martha Stewart.
At Home Depot, the nation's largest chain of warehouse-sized do-it-yourself stores, socket wrenches and lawn mowers are now available through a bridal registry. And homeowners can get interior design advice along with their paint and wallpaper, and then have their preferences put on file for better service the next time they shop. 
 Customers can also find greenhouses in an expanded gardening section and get special guidance on energy-saving products.
These are among the newest services and test programs being introduced by the home-improvement chain whose dedication to service, epitomized by "Depot Don" how-to displays throughout its stores, has helped it shine in an otherwise troubled industry. Featuring customer training, low prices and more than 34,000 items, Home Depot has leapfrogged over all its rivals over the last five years and is currently more than twice the size of its nearest competitor, a feat considering that the Atlanta-based retailer is only 13 years old. Now it hopes that the latest innovations plus an ambitious expansion plan will help that growth continue.
Not that its growth appears in jeopardy. Home Depot has been setting performance records in the $115 billion home-improvement industry, with sales increasing more than 35 percent each year over the past 10 years. In the last quarter alone, sales rose 38 percent and earnings jumped 55 percent. And since the beginning of last year, the company's stock price has soared 160 percent.
Others in the industry, meanwhile, are scrambling to get back into the game after falling behind amid intense competition and price wars. Some, like No. 2 Lowe's, Channel Home Centers and Hechinger, are adapting Home Depot's warehouse strategy, while others are setting up smaller stores to target merchandise niches the leader doesn't have, like furniture. The Rickel's chain, for instance, has decided to open a specialized store in New Jersey.
Among other stores, Mr. Goodbuy's was forced to close its chain in Philadelphia last year because of a competitive squeeze. And Pergament Home Centers is now rethinking its strategy after opening and closing several small home-improvement specialty stores.
"Home Depot is creating both a consolidation and a fragmentation in the home-center business," said Ken Schept, editor of National Home Center News.
Home Depot's two guiding lights, Bernard Marcus and Arthur Blank, who founded the company in Atlanta with one store in 1979, preached that in a do-it-yourself time, it was as important to teach people how to do it themselves as it was to provide the materials. And so to a greater extent than any other home-improvement retailer, Mr. Marcus, as chairman and chief executive, and Mr. Blank, president and chief operating officer, have trained their salespeople to train the customers in home repair and refurbishing.
Over the last 10 years, their efforts have driven sales up a hundredfold, from just $52 million to more than $5 billion. For the latest fiscal year, net income rose 52 percent, to $249.2 million, and sales climbed 35 percent, to $5.13 billion.
Following an already aggressive expansion plan that has put the chain in 15 states, the company now aims to triple its number of stores from 184 now to about 525 by late in the decade. As part of the chain's strategy, it clusters its stores around a big city, with 14 Home Depots, for instance, in the Atlanta area. The clusters are heaviest in Florida, with 42 stores, and in California, with 56.
The current expansion is mainly in the Northeast, where the company plans to add 15 stores this year to the 25 it now has. While New England has been nothing less than a disaster area for many retailers during the recession, it has been one of Home Depot's strongest markets.
The chain's new-store thrust plus its compound sales growth are causing many to liken it to Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer. In about 25 years, Wal-Mart sprung from its Arkansas base to jostle Sears, Roebuck from its No. 1 perch by building the country's largest chains of discount stores and warehouse clubs. But some analysts see Home Depot as even stronger in its field than Wal-Mart is in its.
"If we could own just one retail stock for the next three years, our choice would continue to be Home Depot," said Dan R. Wewer Jr., retailing analyst for the Robinson-Humphrey Company, an Atlanta brokerage firm. "No other billion-dollar retailer has the potential to grow 30 to 35 percent annually with such a low level of business risk."
Mr. Wewer cites the chain's high average annual sales per store -- about $31 million, or one-third higher than its competitors; its skill in teaching do-it-yourselfers, and its rising market share. He predicts Home Depot's market share will jump from about 6 percent this year to about 14 percent by 1996.
Yet bright as most analysts see Home Depot's prospects, some doubt it can sustain its growth rate through the decade.
"Statistically, if Home Depot continues to rack up its current growth rate and the market keeps up its 4.6 percent annual rate, Home Depot could virtually own the home-improvement business by the year 2000," says Walter Johnson, senior editor of Do-It-Yourself Retailing, a publication of the National Retail Hardware Association, based in Indianapolis. But he quickly adds that he does not believe it will happen because the company won't be able to open enough stores in enough markets to support that growth.
"A lot of Home Depot's growth is coming from the mid-sized D-I-Y chains, and once a consolidation of these retailers ends, the industry's sales trend must slow," he said.
And Christopher Vroom, of Alex Brown & Sons in Baltimore, observed that the company recently suffered some first-quarter erosion in its gross margin, which is the difference between the total cost of the goods and the final selling price, after enjoying an increase in the previous six quarters. He attributed the decline to "a more aggressive pricing stance in several markets, including the important San Diego trade area, and to increased sales contribution from lower-gross margin lumber products." But Mr. Vroom said Home Depot's expense-cutting program helped to lift operating profit in the quarter.
In separate interviews, both Mr. Marcus, 62, and Mr. Blank, 49, stressed the importance of strong employee motivation to the company's past and future success. New salespeople are not hired for their product knowledge, Mr. Blank said, but for their ability to raise the customer's enthusiasm about a product or project. The sales people "bleed orange," Mr. Marcus said, referring to the orange aprons that all store employees, including executives, wear.
As incentives, salespeople are paid 20 percent to 25 percent more than those at rival companies, Mr. Blank said. And the company contributes to an ESOP that is available to all employees, as is a standard employee stock purchase plan. The company's stock price gains have enriched many of its employees, although, like many growth stocks, the shares have slowed their climb this year; at $68.375 on Friday, the stock is up $1 this year.
But both executives cited three other important reasons for the company's high sales growth and strong profits.
Since the company's founding, Home Depot has avoided the middleman or wholesaler, buying directly from the producer to keep prices lower than those of the competition.
In addition, Mr. Black said, the company has continually stressed cutting expenses. Since 1985, expenses as a percent of sales have fallen from 19.2 to 18.1 percent last year, one of the industry's lowest ratios.
Finally, the company has tried to keep its merchandise assortment current through continuous customer testing. Says Mr. Marcus, "One of the biggest lessons we learned was that we had to listen to our customers, whether they had requests on specific kinds of merchandise, needed help or counsel or just wanted to complain. Now it's like a religion in our company."
On the merchandising aspect, Mr. Wewer, the Atlanta analyst, observed: "Home Depot is continually testing new merchandise ideas. Some of the ideas, such as the addition of greenhouses to the lawn and garden department, could have a major impact, while the test of a bridal registry probably will not prompt us to change any earnings estimate but looks like a great idea."
Analyst Bo Cheadle, managing director of Montgomery Securities, the San Francisco stock brokerage firm, likes Home Depot for its hard-nosed internal discipline. He cites the fact that the company's "S.P.I." -- store productivity improvement -- test program is now being extended to all new stores. The program involves using night hours for internal store cleaning, restocking and packaging.
With the industry growing about 5 percent to 7 percent a year, Mr. Marcus believes the field can reach $200 billion by the year 2000 through higher sales marked by company consolidations and new entrants. Shooting for sales next year of about $6 billion, Home Depot should be able to lift its 6 percent market share to about 25 percent by the turn of the century, meaning sales of about $50 billion, Mr. Marcus insists, adding: "We think there's room for 1,000 Home Depots in the United States."
 
 
 
MAKING A SPLASH IN ELMONT, L.I.

It took only a little more than a year for the Home Depot in Elmont, L.I., to rack up a weekly sales total that was not only a record for itself but for all stores in the chain.
Home Depot's top management saw the achievement as the occasion for a celebration and rewarded the store's 360 employees and guests with a party on May 17.
"It was an expensive proposition," admitted Harry Alfred, the regional manager, "but it was worth it. It was like a happy family get-together."
The Elmont store, which opened in February 1991 and is one of seven on Long Island, quickly became the biggest volume producer in the entire chain. Home Depot isn't saying how much the store did in sales in that record week, nor which week it was. But it was clearly a good chunk of business for the company to show such appreciation.
Like other Home Depot stores, the one in Elmont upholds the importance of teaching the customer. Much is made of "Depot Don" displays throughout the 140,000-square-foot store. Named for a "Don Someone" in a Texas Home Depot who came up with the idea, the displays demonstrate how to install various products.
But clinics, as many as four a day, are the store's main customer aid. Trained staff or supplier representatives teach customers how to install dry wall, put up a fence or plan a new kitchen, among other projects. A year ago, the store hired three interior decorators to assist the customers in color matching and other design considerations, reflecting a new trend in the do-it-yourself field.
"We keep a file on customers, so that we know what they like in wallpaper, paint and lighting and can help them over the telephone," said Marina Lopez, one of the interior decorators who is a graduate of New York Institute of Technology. Asked if home-improvement stores were invading the previously sacrosanct province of furniture specialty stores by staffing decorators, she shrugged and replied: "Why not? It makes a lot of sense, doesn't it?"

In the Failure to Balance the Budget, Who Gains? Who Loses? 

In support of the constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, President Bush held a prime-time news conference, made speeches and invited Congressional leaders to the White House to talk up the measure. But the amendment failed by nine votes. Mr. Bush may have received a measure of consolation from the defeat: He can continue to run for re-election against Congress' record. Business, however, got no such break. For companies -- and their competitiveness -- the real issue was the impact of the deficit on interest rates. "We have high long-term interest rates because the demand for funds from the Federal Government is draining savings that should go into investments in plants and equipment and into modernization," said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities Inc. In the balanced-budget 1950's, "real interest rates were 2 to 3 percent. Now they are 4 to 5 percent," he said.

Continental v. American Airlines
 
No market is more competitive -- or merciless -- than the airline market. But when American Airlines lowered its fares and reduced its advanced purchase requirements, Continental Airlines -- which is operating under the protection of Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy code -- said it had gone too far. In a suit filed in Federal District Court in Galveston, Tex., Continental said American was practicing "predatory pricing." Continental asserted American's pricing strategy can only earn it a profit if one of its rivals is driven out of business. "Preposterous," said Al Becker, a spokesman for American Airlines. Continental's charges, which rely on highly technical data, will be difficult to prove.

Seattle Mariners, by Nintendo
 
Not since the Brooklyn Dodgers moved to Chavez Ravine have baseball aficionados been in such a tizzy. But last week, the baseball commissioner, Fay Vincent, stunned fans by announcing that the Baseball Group of Seattle will be permitted to take over the Seattle Mariners for $125 million. What alarmed fans even more than the Mariners 15-year losing steak --they lost more games than they won each season -- was that 60 percent of the cash will come from the Nintendo Company of Japan. It is the first time a company outside of North America has taken an interest in a major league team. Nintendo promised it would be a passive investor. That was enough to persuade Mr. Vincent.
 
Gerber Cuts a New Tooth
 
The biggest problem for the Gerber Products Company, the nation's No. 1 baby food maker, is that all of its best customers grow up. To grab a share of the toothsome-toddler set, Gerber announced plans to introduce a new line of vegetables, snacks and stews aimed at 2- to 3-year-olds. Do toddlers really need a line of canned goods when theyalready have peanut butter? "It is a completely unnecessary product," said Kate Clancy, a professor of nutrition at Syracuse University.

Critic Pans -- and Is Panned
 
Critics are supposed to be tough but fair, and movie studios are supposed to take their lumps along with their laurels. But last week, Paramount Pictures changed the rules when Daily Variety, a trade newspaper, ran a scathing review of "Patriot Games," Paramount's newest big-budget release based on the novel by Tom Clancy and starring Harrison Ford. The critical review, written by Joseph McBride, described Mr. Clancy's novel as "a right-wing cartoon of the current British-Irish political situation," -- not exactly the kind of quote Paramount can use to promote the film. The review prompted the studio to withdraw its ads from Variety. Peter Bart, Variety's editor, apologized to Paramount.

Two Utilities Link Up
 
When the Entergy Corporation of New Orleans said it planned to buy Texas-based Gulf States Utilities for $2.3 billion, it did so saying it would achieve economies of scale. The two companies told analysts the combination will save $600 million in fuel costs over 10 years. Under the terms of the agreement, Entergy will pay $20 a share for Gulf States stock either in cash or in its own shares at the option of shareholders. It would also link the two companies' power transmission grids and let other companies tap into their network. Wall Street liked the deal. Gulf States stock closed up $1.25 to $15.75 after the announcement and finished the week at $15.

U.P.I. Holds Its Breath
 
When TV-evangelist Pat Robertson withdrew his $6 million offer last week for United Press International, the 85-year-old wire service with 2,000 outlets worldwide, it looked like the end for the company. U.P.I., which filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code last summer, has just $22 million in assets and $60 million in debt. Mr. Robertson estimated it would take $31 million over 18 months to save it. But hours before it was supposed to close, Leon H. Charney, a New York lawyer and TV commentator, came through with an offer -- of sorts. Mr. Charney is providing $180,000 to keep U.P.I. open until June 22. During that period, he will study the service's books and possibly submit a bid to save it. "We are not making a whole lot of plans for coverage next week at the moment," said Doug Levy, a U.P.I. reporter.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Tokyo: How Much Is Enough?
 
Last month Japan's overall trade surplus jumped 88.9 percent from a year ago, to $7.87 billion, the Finance Ministry reported. Japan's trade surplus with the United States jumped 51 percent from a year ago, to $2.92 billion. But it seems even that was not enough for Tokyo. Last week, it accused the United States of unfair trading practices. The United States has a "buy American" provision in some Government contracts, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said. The United States trade representatives' office disagreed: "Everybody knows the United States has the most open market in the world."
 
On the eve of his visit to the United States -- and with the prospect of $24 billion in aid looming -- Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin said he would soon issue decrees lifting some of the barriers to privatization.
 
G.M.'s Saturn Hits Taiwan
 
The General Motors Corporation has been pummeled by its critics for its losses, but it is being praised now for the performance of its Saturn Corporation subsidiary. The cars have adorned the covers of the buff books, its dealers have scored high marks for customer satisfaction and the car's quality is rated at Japanese levels. But until last week, when the Saturn went on sale in Taiwan, Saturns were only available here. G.M. won't be turning the trade deficit around all at once-- not even America's deficit with Taiwan. Only a few hundred Saturns will be exported initially. And they won't come cheap. Though Saturn prices begin at $8,395 here, the cars will cost $22,800 in Taiwan, which is attributed, in part, to a 30 percent duty Taiwan will impose.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
A Cleaner-Car Council
 
When Detroit's Big three get together, it's usually to lobby in Washington. But last week they met to set up a program to design and manufacture cleaner cars. The United States Council for Automotive Research will conduct "pre-competitive" research in areas including battery technology for electric vehicles, pollution control, recycling and computer-aided design and manufacturing. The program "will enable us to reduce vehicle emissions in a more rapid and cost-effective manner than we might achieve independently," said John P. McTague, head of technical affairs at the Ford Motor Company. General Motors, Ford and Chrysler will be joined in the project by oil and utilities companies. Why are the Big Three making nice to each other with regard to technology? California's tough pollution controls go into effect in 1997 and so far they look lobby-proof.
 
Hunkered-Down Consumers
 
Nudging the nation's economy into the fast lane has not been easy. Last month retail sales rose by a slim 0.2 percent, the Commerce Department said.. Sales of clothing and building supplies actually fell, counterbalancing a rise in new-car sales. According to Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Company, "the consumer remains in a hunkered-down position, cautiously spending."."
 
Bad Guys: Energy and Tobacco
 
After behaving for months, prices at the producer level shot up last month by 0.4 percent, the largest increase in 19 months, the Commerce Department said. Sharply rising prices for energy and tobacco were responsible for most of last month's jump in inflation at the producer level. "We have to keep one eye cocked on inflation. It's still out there," said Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago. "It hasn't died."
 
Consumer Prices Hold
 
Producer prices may be soaring but consumer prices' wings seem clipped. The Commerce Department's Consumer Price Index increased by 0.1 percent in May -- barely a budge. Why the difference between the two indexes? While the producer index is heavily weighted with raw materials and energy, "the consumer index is weighted toward services and housing," said Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities in Chicago. But if the two indicators differ, what's the real inflation rate? "About 3.5 percent, a number we can live with, " Mr. Kahan said.

The Federal Trade Commission brought charges against the three largest makers of infant formula last week for overcharging the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children, which is funded by the Federal government and the states.

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
A Busy Agenda Gets Busier

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
One of the duties of a company leader is to get involved outside the company. John L. Clendenin, chairman and chief executive of the BellSouth Corporation, clearly is dutiful. He is the national president of the Boy Scouts of America. He is a trustee of the Conference Board, a business research group. And he sits on the boards of the Coca-Cola Company and the New York Stock Exchange, among others.
Now, Mr. Clendenin, as busy as he is, has taken on still one more outside post: chairman of the Committee for Economic Development, a prestigious New York-based business group that looks at economic problems, recommends solutions and tries to get some action. 
 "That's part of my role," Mr. Clendenin said in an interview last week, "to involve myself in some of these external organizations when I feel that doing those kinds of things is important for the country."
Which is not to say that doing those things isn't important to BellSouth, too. "The future work force of America is important to us, as it is to any major employer," Mr. Clendenin said. "It's not like working on education, for example, is foreign to my concern about BellSouth. I've got to worry about where we will get our employees in the next decade."
Education, he said, ranks "right up there among the great problems," and the Committee for Economic Development has a history of work in education policy.
Mr. Clendenin, 59 years old, succeeds Owen B. Butler, former chairman of the Procter & Gamble Company, as chairman of the committee. Mr. Clendenin has been chief executive of BellSouth, based in Atlanta and the largest of the regional Bell companies, since 1984.
And just how does he manage all his outside activities? "I spend a lot of time on this kind of thing before the hour of 7 in the morning and after 5 at night," he said.

HEADLINE: At Work;
New Questions About Arbitration

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
Like an investor who signs on with a broker, employees of stock and commodities exchanges and the National Association of Securities Dealers must agree to submit any grievances to an arbitration panel. In both cases, the panel is typically dominated by people with industry ties, and people filing complaints have long grumbled that the process is stacked against them.
Now, with a rise in awareness of sexual harassment since the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas controversy last fall and with the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, an increase in the number of harassment and discrimination grievances is widely expected. Critics say such cases are particularly inappropriate for the arbitration process. Employment discrimination "is a complex area of law," said Richard M. Gelb, a securities litigator in Boston. "Industry arbitrators know the industry, but they have no expertise in the area of employment discrimination. You're asking management to judge itself." 
 For years, controversy has roiled around the resolution of disputes between brokers and individual investors. The investors' argument that the process favors the brokerage houses got support last month from a two-year General Accounting Office study that concluded that arbitration programs, while not biased, do not "provide a reasonable level of assurance regarding either the independence of the arbitrators or their competence in arbitrating disputes."
The rules for investor-broker contretemps apply as well to employees of the brokerage industry. They sign a "Form U-4" agreement, which binds them to arbitration if they have complaints about the conditions of their employment -- or termination.
Theoretically, arbitration is economical and efficient. Proponents say conflicts that take years to resolve in court take mere months of arbitration, at a savings in legal fees and energy. "There's a light at the end of the tunnel," said Samantha Raybin of the Securities Arbitration Commentator, a newsletter in Maplewood, N.J.
But critics say the process is an involuntary quasi-legal nightmare, in which arbitrators are told they do not have to follow the law. Discovery, the method by which the facts of a case are elicited before trial, is truncated; proceedings are carried out virtually in secret, and many panels are not required to disclose how they reached a decision. "If the proceedings are private, a company can merely calculate in simple dollars what it costs to discriminate and budget it in," said Cliff Palefsky, a lawyer in San Francisco who is leading efforts by the National Employment Lawyers Association to change the arbitration system. He thinks public decisions would provide a greater incentive for companies to follow the law. "If potential employees could find out who has a reputation for discrimination, who has lost sexual harassment cases, they could make informed decisions," he said.
Mr. Palefsky complains that the lists of arbitrators drawn from pools established at N.A.S.D. and the exchanges are not made public, though arbitrators are required to disclose any potential conflicts in a proceeding. "You get a printout of where people have worked for five years," he said. "You should be able to ask, 'Have you ever been sued for sexual harassment? Do you believe in sexual harassment or civil rights law? Would you have trouble imposing the law?' You don't have the right to question arbitrators the way you would question a prospective juror."
The simplicity of the system is its beauty, according to proponents. Ideally, a complaint could be pursued pro se -- by the employee alone, without counsel. But even those who on balance favor arbitration are concerned that the process has come to resemble a legal proceeding, with a multiplication of briefs and motions, and more lawyers. "It has become a litigation practice, not an arbitration," said Thomas D. Giachetti, a Princeton, N.J., lawyer and stockbroker who has handled arbitration cases for several years. "You can't do it on a pro se basis anymore. You need experts."
Mr. Palefsky is preparing to file suit challenging the requirement that employees of the brokerage industry waive their access to courts and protections under the Civil Rights Act. Other such challenges have not fared well in the courts. Last year, the United States Supreme Court ruled that a former stockbroker suing under a Federal age-discrimination statute was bound by his compulsory arbitration agreement. In April, the New York State Supreme Court ruled that a sex-discrimination complaint brought by a Goldman, Sachs employee must be submitted to arbitration. Mr. Palefsky, who clearly relishes his barrister-on-the-barricades role, is convinced that this time the court will see his light.
 
 
 
LAWYERS NEED NOT COMPLAIN
 Deborah Masucci, director of arbitration at the National Association of Securities Dealers, strenuously objects to claims by employees' lawyers that her arbitrators do not have the expertise to hear employment cases.
"Arbitrators generally have a background in the disputed area," she said. "If we can't locate one, we will ask the parties to agree to an arbitrator."
Predictions that the Civil Rights Act of 1991 would provoke a rush of complaints have yet to materialize in arbitration offices. Ms. Masucci said some of her 6,000 arbitrators have heard harassment cases, but none has had a civil rights case.
The 2,900 arbitrators of the New York Stock Exchange also rarely see sexual discrimination or harassment cases, according to James E. Buck, secretary of the exchange. But should cases turn up, they would pose no problem. "Discrimination is not something where expertise is necessary," Mr. Buck said. "It's not like admiralty, where you have to know about arcane rules. The evidence is understandable to ordinary men."

HEADLINE: Dan Quayle Steps Front and (Right of) Center

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FOR months and years, he was all but invisible to the public, unless he made some foolish mistake. He was dismissed as a political cipher. People laughed at him in the spiteful way people laugh at the class geek.
But the wheel of electoral fortune has turned, and suddenly Vice President Dan Quayle is at the center of things. Like it or not, he has found ways to impress his views more sharply on the public consciousness than any other candidate for top office this year -- certainly far more vividly than the man he works for, George Bush, whose somnambulant behavior and cloudy message have given his Vice President the chance to grab the spotlight. 
 What he is trying to accomplish (it is far from clear whether he is making much headway) is the repair of the fraying coalition that elected Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan and, in 1988, Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle.
The key to that coalition was the group of voters who have come to be known as "Reagan Democrats" but who have, in fact, been voting Republican for President since they gave one last heave for their own party in 1964.
White, often eastern or southern European in origin, blue-collar or newly white collar, clustered in suburbs like Parma, Ohio, and Warren, Mich., and in urban quarters like Queens and South Boston, they flocked to the Republicans because economics mattered less to them than social issues such as busing, sexual permissiveness, drugs, long hair, patriotism, law and order.
Those Archie Bunkers and their families cheered George C. Wallace when he derided the "pointy-headed intellectuals" who he said "couldn't park a bicycle straight" and applauded Spiro T. Agnew when he spoke about the "nattering nabobs of negativism" who he said dominated the press.
In 1992, those voters have been slipping away from the President, partly because they feel he has betrayed them on taxes and on racial quotas, but also because the issues that Mr. Bush featured in 1988, largely through symbols -- patriotism through his visits to flag factories, law and order through the Willie Horton commercials -- have been declining in saliency.
Jobs, health care and education have come to the fore, and those are Democratic issues in most elections. At the height of the dominance of social issues, in 1968, with a generation in rebellion, Hubert H. Humphrey almost snatched a victory at the last minute by refocusing the attention of many voters on basic economic questions. Mr. Bush is highly vulnerable there this year.
So Mr. Quayle is trying to shift the focus back, playing the populist card as fervently as Ross Perot, who has caught the imagination of many of the Reagan Democrats in the last two months.
Unlike Mr. Perot, Mr. Quayle was born to privilege as the scion of a newspaper-owning family, but that has not stopped him from donning the robes of the common man determined to face down a "cultural elite" that mocks religion, family values and patriotism.
The White House did not seem quite prepared when the Vice President attacked the heroine of the "Murphy Brown" television show, criticizing the character as if she were real for having borne a child out of wedlock. Mr. Bush and his aides gulped and fumbled when asked for a response, fearful perhaps that it was bad politics to tangle with so popular a show.
But Mr. Quayle and his advisers, notably William Kristol, thought otherwise and pressed on.
Speaking to the Southern Baptist Convention in Indianapolis last week, he denounced sex education in primary schools, free condoms and homosexual parents and spoke of warring American cultures.
"They'll try to mock us in newsrooms, sitcom studios and faculty lounges across America," he said. "I wear their scorn as a badge of honor."
No wonder. Journalists rank almost as low as politicians in opinion polls, college professors have always been suspect to many in this frontier-rooted nation and few people have ever identified with Hollywood mores.
But different families have different values. Some exalt money, others exalt service. Some are religious, some are not. And some are opposed to abortion, like the Vice President, but a larger number support it in some form.
A new survey for The Reader' Digest suggests that one thing setting family units apart from one another is their structure. Married people with children, the national poll discovered, are likely to be far more conservative, more opposed to abortion, less enthusiastic about women working outside the home and less tolerant of the idea of homosexual marriage than single persons or childless couples.
Abortion in many ways typifies the complexity of the issues which Mr. Quayle seeks for political purposes to simplify. He himself told The Washington Post a year ago, "I think people make a mistake trying to exploit it in the political realm."
But in Indianapolis and again at an anti-abortion rally in Washington on Thursday, Mr. Quayle did just that, even though exit polls in California, for example, showed that even Republicans are overwhelmingly opposed to the absolutism of the Bush-Quayle position.
Is the Vice President bent on political suicide? Not necessarily, given the potential arithmetic of a hard-fought three-way Presidential race.
Charles R. Black Jr., the senior strategic adviser to the Bush campaign, put the matter as plainly as possible in a talk with reporters on Thursday:
"In any campaign, the first task is to solidify the base. In a three-way race, 38 to 40 percent may be enough. And in a three-way race with two pro-choice candidates" -- Mr. Perot and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas -- "I believe that the one pro-life candidate has an advantage."
Mr. Bush greeted the second round of thunder from Mr. Quayle more warmly than the first. But some of his advisers think that the Vice President, ever eager to cement his conservative standing for 1996, may push the President into a campaign that begins and ends with the conservative base and leaves most voters happy to chose between Mr. Perot and Mr. Clinton.
Without his bellicose advisers of 1988, Roger Ailes and the late Lee Atwater, the President has seemed willing to let Mr. Quayle stir the controversy on social issues, then follow up himself if the reaction seems favorable.
Those tactics have not stood him in good stead; he now trails Mr. Perot in most polls, and his overall job approval has plunged from 90 percent or thereabouts in March 1991 to about 35 per cent early this month.
But Mr. Quayle, for all his bristling combativeness, hasn't done much better. A Washington Post/ABC News Poll showed him with a 39 percent favorable rating last February and a 26 percent figure post-Murphy Brown.

Chart: "Quayle's Targets"
 
In recent days Vice President Quayle has singled out a number of people and groups for criticism during his speeches. Here are some of them:
 
The cultural elites . . .
 
". . . respect neither tradition nor standards. They believe that moral truths are relative and all 'lifestyles' are equal. They seem to think the family is an arbitrary arrangement of people who live under the same roof -- that fathers are dispensable and that parents need not be married or even of opposite sexes."
--Tuesday, in a speech to the Southern Baptist Convention in Indianapolis.
 
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo . . .
 
. . . is trying to "fall in with the crowd who wants to dismiss the importance of values." "The Governor knows better than that. He understands the importance of family values."
-- Wednesday, during a news conference at a community center in Hempstead, Long Island.
 
Ross Perot . . .
 
" . . . is a false solution to our problems. . . It would be a very bad idea to replace a genuine statesman with some temperamental tycoon who has contempt for the Constitution of the United States."
 
Senior Senators
 
"Since the constitution has limited Ronald Reagan and George Bush to two terms, we ought to be fair to the other elected branch and limit the terms of people like Ted Kennedy and Howard Metzenbaum."
-- Friday, speech to Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies convention in Washington. (pg. 3)

HEADLINE: Conversations/Warren Zimmermann;
Haunted by What the U.S. Didn't Do in Yugoslavia

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER

 BODY:
THOUSANDS of Serbian artillery shells raining death and destruction on Sarajevo. United Nations relief convoys attacked by irregulars. The ancient port of Dubrovnik under fire again. More than 15,000 killed and more than 1.2 million made homeless by 11 months of war. No end in sight.
These are scenes Warren Zimmermann left behind when he was recalled by the Bush Administration in mid-May from his post as United States Ambassador to Yugoslavia. The withdrawal of the Ambassador was an act of protest against the Serbian leadership for its aggression against the newly independent republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
 When he took up his post in Belgrade in March 1989, the Soviet Union and its East European bloc were intact. So was independent Yugoslavia. Though riddled by inflation and threatened by nationalist forces, Communist Yugoslavia was a country with a promising future.
Now there is no Soviet Union and no bloc, and the federal Yugoslavia the world and 23 million Yugoslavs knew for 46 years lies in ruins.
During Mr. Zimmermann's tenure it seemed as if United States policy toward the Yugoslav crisis veered between relative indifference and hands-on activism. Last week, in a quiet Washington office, the 57-year-old diplomat reflected on the nature and consistency of U.S. policy.
"If U.S. policy shifted toward Yugoslavia, it shifted at the beginning of the Bush Administration," he said. "We made it clear to Yugoslavia that we would continue to support the unity of the country, but that the disappearance of the Soviet Union as a major adversary made our support dependent on a different set of factors. We were ready to support unity, but only in the interest of human rights, only insofar as it was not to be maintained by force.
"Parallel with this," he continued, "was our analysis -- which turned out to be true -- that if Yugoslavia split up it would only do so with maximum violence. That explained why we urged Croatia and Slovenia to remain in Yugoslavia, and if they could not, at least to negotiate their way out. I think we maintained an entirely consistent approach to Yugoslavia and continued it past the outbreak of war."
 
Washington Reverses Itself
 Mr. Zimmermann was asked why Washington initially opposed the European Community's decision to recognize the separate republics of Croatia and Bosnia, and then reversed its stance.
The United States, he replied, was fearful that recognition would prolong the fighting in Croatia and trigger a war in Bosnia. "With regard to Bosnia, our fears proved out."
Was he implying that the German push for early recognition of Croatia provoked more violence?
"We opposed the German initiative at the time. I continue to think the initiative was wrong, but it is now a part of reality."
Did the United States step aside from the Yugoslav mess?
"We made a conscious decision a year ago to cede the leadership role to the E.C. for two reasons," he said. "First, the Community wanted the lead role. Second, Yugoslavia is in Europe. But we weren't sitting on our hands. It's easier to see with hindsight. We couldn't predict a year ago that the Community would have problems getting itself together -- problems with Greece, with Germany. We do represent something in Yugoslavia that Europe doesn't -- a democratic tradition, a country that helped Yugoslavs individually and collectively for many decades. So we cannot be absent from future dealings with Yugoslavia and we won't be."
So what would he have done differently?
"Obviously I have spent a lot of time thinking about this. It might have helped if we had urged earlier a very loose confederation rather than taking a neutral stance. But I am not even sure about this. You had competing and aggressive nationalisms that were not going to be influenced by democratic appeals. The greatest culprit is Slobodan Milosevic [President of Serbia]. In invoking the unity of Yugoslavia he did more than anyone else to destroy it."
After three years of Milosevic-watching, Mr. Zimmermann concluded that he was dealing with a split personality. "There were two Milosevics: The Milosevic I saw many times arguing that he had nothing to do with Bosnia, that Serbs there were not threatened, that no irregulars from Serbia were in combat in Bosnia, that his only wish was a negotiated settlement leading to peace.
"The other Milosevic -- never on public display -- was the man who gave moral, political and military support to the most extreme Serbian fanatics in Bosnia, who worked hand in glove with the army to stake out two-thirds of Bosnia for a Serbian population consisting of only one-third of the entire population.
"I hope he will ponder the contradiction between what he promised the Serbian people when he ran for election in 1990 -- peace and economic prosperity -- and what he delivered: two wars and economic disaster."
 
Critic of Nationalism
 As for Washington's intentions toward Belgrade, Mr. Zimmermann said, "U.S. policy is to get Milosevic to change his mind or, if he doesn't, to get the Serbian people to put the kind of pressure on him to cause him to change his mind."
He then appraised the situation of President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia. "Tudjman is a nationalist leader who made some very bad mistakes early in his presidency toward Croatia's Serbian minority. He also advocated a partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina between Serbia and Croatia. He has given at least passive support to Croatian military forces in Bosnia. That said, he is a man who has learned from his mistakes."
In the months before he was recalled from Belgrade, Mr. Zimmermann, a student of history, had been reading classics of Roman and Greek civilization and studies of contemporary Europe, which influenced his thinking. "Yugoslavia is a paradigm," he mused, "for other countries in Central Europe and the Soviet Union of a collectivist ideology of Communism replaced by another collectivist ideology, nationalism.
"Being collectivist, the ideologies are exclusivist: If you are not a member of the collective, you are an enemy and have to be liquidated. This ideology places total value in the collective and none in the individual. It is real in Yugoslavia and in other areas ."
Mr. Zimmermann spent seven years in Yugoslavia and remains deeply affected by the unending calamities. "Our thoughts will never be far from that tortured place," he said. "My wife and I decided to make a small compensation for all that we gained from our friendships with Serbs and Croats by bringing back with us a refugee." The 22-year-old woman's native city, Vukovar, was leveled by the Yugoslav Army last year. The Zimmermanns have given her a new home, and offered to help pay her college tuition.
As for the future he said, "I remain convinced that there are democratic forces throughout the territory of what used to be called Yugoslavia. But the fevers of nationalism are going to have to abate. I don't know how many more will have to die before it does. At some point or other there will be a strong impetus for those people who lived together for so long to come back into some form of an association. We're talking decades here. But I predict that this will happen."

The Odd Art of Summitry Without a Cold War

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BORIS N. YELTSIN and President Bush will hold their first full-scale summit meeting this week in a weird twilight moment of Russian-American relations -- a moment when the two countries have stopped being enemies but aren't quite allies yet. Consider a few recent scenes from the relationship:
It is last Tuesday, and Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, has just spent two days in Washington trying to explain to the Bush Administration why the Russian military is reluctant to give up all of its SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles, as Washington was demanding in the latest nuclear arms reduction talks. Mr. Kozyrev's discomfort shows as he leaves a meeting with President Bush at the White House. After all, his country is asking Washington for billions in economic assistance, but his military wants to keep its most advanced nuclear missiles. Mr. Kozyrev somewhat sheepishly explains to American reporters on the White House driveway: "I want to make one thing absolutely clear: We do not need those arms and we are not going to use them against the United States." 
 Well, that's good to know.
It is Sunday night and Mr. Kozyrev has just attended a private dinner given by a Russian artist at the hot new Washington Tex-Mex restaurant, Red Sage. Much of the dinner talk was about the importance Russia attaches to American economic aid, and the concerns in Moscow over America's inward turn. After dinner, Mr. Kozyrev walks out the door and finds himself looking straight at a shirtless panhandler sitting on a curbside bench. The man is cradling a white begging cup in his lap and has a cane by his side. He is totally befuddled by the security guards and police cars surrounding Mr. Kozyrev. A bizarre tableau takes shape with Mr. Kozyrev, standing at the panhandler's elbow, asking his American security guards whether he can walk back to the Russian Embassy, for exercise. He is told no: 14th Street is not safe and he might get mugged.
Who needs help from whom in this picture?
In a Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff office, Congressional aides are working on the language of the Bush Administration's multi-billion-dollar legislative package to assist Russia and other former Soviet republics, which is now slowly working its way through Congress. But they suddenly get word from the Administration that Russia is about to sell ballistic missile technology to India. Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Delaware Democrat who is probably the staunchest advocate in the Senate for the Russian aid package, demands that the bill be amended to say that if the Russians go ahead with the sale, Washington will not provide any Government-to-Government assistance.
Says one member of the committee staff: "We looked at this sale and said: 'Hey, wait a minute. Why should we write a check to the same Russian Government that is receiving a check from India for selling missile technology we think is wrong and violates an international standard on nonproliferation?' We decided to try to force them to make a choice in the same bill. But it was an odd position to be in."
Odd indeed. But it is probably best to get used to such bizarre contradictions, because they are going to be a staple in Russian-American relations for the foreseeable future -- for several reasons. To begin with, as Americans are just beginning to understand, the fact that the cold war is over and the fact that a freely elected President now inhabits the Kremlin do not mean that the interests of Russia and America will be compatible in every case, or even that their arms race is over.
"Russian nationalism, Russian history and Russian pride make some degree of strategic parity with the United States still very important to Russia," said Michael Mandelbaum, an expert on East-West relations at Johns Hopkins University.
 
Symbols of Power
 Although Russia is no longer an ideological enemy of the United States it is still a great power, and great powers don't just bid farewell to their past and willingly accept a diminished role. Ownership of the most advanced nuclear missiles is precisely what makes Russia a global player, and what distinguishes it from China or India or Ukraine. Russian democrats understand this. As aides to President Yeltsin are fond of saying: Russian democrats cannot afford not to be nationalists or they will be swept away. That means they cannot afford to look weak defending the symbols of Russian nationalism either, and among the most powerful of those symbols remains a global nuclear capacity.
Another factor is economics. Russia needs both American aid and markets abroad for its huge military-industrial complex -- a holdover from the cold war that cannot be converted overnight from making machine guns to making sewing machines. Mr. Yeltsin, for the near future, needs to be able to sell arms, win Western aid, and begin converting military factories to the sale of consumer products. It is going to be a tough circle for him to square. It is worth recalling that since the end of the ideological struggle between Washington and Beijing, American-Chinese relations have actually deteriorated -- partly because of China's human rights record, but also because of its trade policies, particularly its missile exports and the dumping of cheaply made goods from its state-owned factories on the American market.
There was a time when the mere arrival of a Soviet leader in Washington would electrify the city, and whoever was President could expect an automatic boost in stature -- and air time -- from the chance to demonstrate leadership at a summit. But in advance of Mr. Yeltsin's visit, Washington seems bored and distracted. Unlike cold war summits, there is no life-or-death quality to this encounter. To many, Mr. Yeltsin seems just another foreign leader begging for money that should go to American cities.
He comes, after all, at a time when America is looking only in the mirror. Indeed, last week when Mr. Kozyrev emerged from his discussions with Mr. Bush, the last question he got from the White House press was: "Mr. Foreign Minister, in your discussions with the President, did Ross Perot's name come up?"

HEADLINE: Wild Youth, Angry Police, and Shots in Newark

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD with JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, June 12

 BODY:
There was, perhaps, a certain inevitability to it all. For months, the police in this troubled industrial city chafed at legal restraints that kept them from controlling youths who, mostly for fun, stole about 40 cars a night, screaming through darkened streets doing "doughnuts" at deserted intersections and ramming police cruisers to explode their air bags.
Hampered by restraints prohibiting them from high-speed chases and prevented, because most of the thieves are juveniles, from imposing strict penalties on those caught, the police seethed in frustration. 
 To the youths, some of whom were not yet in their teens, it was a game, a taunt at the authorities in a city that offered little hope. "This is a ghetto," said Barbara Davis, a 53-year-old nurse and local advocate who lives in its heart. "These kids don't have much. Car theft is all the kids have to do."
 
Average Night Gone Awry
 Tuesday, several hours before dawn, those two cultures clashed again, as they had every night for months. But that morning, something went awry. Police officers trying to apprehend 17-year-old Howard Caesar fired several shots. Mr. Caesar was gravely wounded.
Six officers have been suspended without pay amid an investigation by the Essex County Prosecutor's office into a possible cover-up. Mayor Sharpe James of Newark has said that the officers' statements are sketchy and provide conflicting accounts.
The events of the early-morning hours of June 9 are not entirely clear, but a reconstruction by The New York Times, based largely on the accounts of neighborhood witnesses and on the limited details provided by Mayor James and the police, indicates the following:
*Police officers at the scene fired their weapons in clear violation of strict New Jersey regulations.
*They may not have known Mr. Caesar was hit because he was able to run away swiftly, disappearing into a relative's house.
*Officers at the scene were later observed searching a grassy area at the edge of the park with flashlights, apparently in an attempt to recover spent cartridges. No shell casings were recovered at the scene later, police officials say.
*At least one officer cleaned his gun before turning it in to investigators, in violation of standing rules. The reports required after an officer fires his weapon were either filed late or falsified, police officials say.
The six officers suspended in the inquiry are Kenneth Holloway, 30 years old; Michael Cavallero, 28; John Costa, 25; Naftalis Mendez, 31; Jose Montalvo, 23; and Gerard Piacenza, 23. Lawyers for the officers have said their clients are cooperating with the inquiry, but have declined to provide details of the officers' accounts.
The night, like so many others in the neighborhood, started with idleness and ended in gunfire.
Edna Williams, Howard Ceasar's aunt, said her nephew left home with several friends about 6 P.M.
By midnight they were in Mr. Caesar's old neighborhood, near West Side Park, where the family lived until this year. There they milled about outside one of their regular haunts, King's Fried Chicken, a simple fast-food store on 16th Avenue near 17th Street where workers stand behind a bulletproof shield. Residents of the neighborhood say it is a hangout for drug dealers, and even on weekdays several young dealers usually squat near the store, waiting for customers.
 
Simple Video Games, Or Tag With Police
 William Anderson, an unemployed 28-year-old, was at the restaurant that night and says that a group of several dozen young men, including his friend, Mr. Caesar, lounged about playing Street Fighter II, a video game based on karate. Sometime after midnight, Mr. Caesar, who is called "Bucky," left the store with friends.
Between 2 and 3 A.M., Mr. Anderson said he saw a black Camaro leading three police cars in a chase down 16th Avenue. That car chase, Mr. Anderson said, was typical of the nightly games of cat and mouse played by the police and local youths. As Mr. Anderson watched, the cars screamed past the restaurant and vanished. They returned several times over the next few hours, but Mr. Anderson said he could not tell who was in the vehicles.
After about an hour, at least one of the police cars parked on a road inside the West Side Park, Mr. Anderson and several other residents said. There, it apparently lay in wait for the Camaro, in a practice so familiar it is known by the slang term, "squatting."
Four of the six police officers later identified as being at the scene were from the West District, which encompasses the park. The two others were from the North District, where the car was believed to have been stolen from the mother of a Newark police officer.
By 4 A.M., the black Camaro drove into sight, paused at the intersection of 16th Avenue and 17th Street, then turned in several squealing, tight circles -- "doughnuts" -- that left black tire smudges on the asphalt.
Although commonplace, the noise awoke many residents. On the street, Mr. Anderson saw the Camaro slam into a curb, breaking its axle. The driver gunned the engine several times and then, leaving the radio blaring, emerged to check the damage. The driver was Mr. Caesar.
 
'Kill Him. Kill Him.'
 Over at the chicken store, Mr. Anderson and several others called out a warning that the police were nearby. Mr. Anderson said he saw Mr. Caesar start to run, then heard shots.
In an apartment nearby, Walter Brown, a 45-year-old welder, had leftfor dawn prayers at his mosque. "I was trying to go back to sleep," his wife, Vera, said. "But then I heard shots. There were two of them. Pow. Pow. And I heard someone shout: 'Kill him. Kill him.' "
Mrs. Brown, a 30-year-old factory worker, did not go to her window out of fear. But she did look at her clock. The red digital numbers showed 4:14.
A witness on the street, Shawn Freeman, 17, a student at Central High School, said Mr. Caesar had just gotten out of the car to look at the broken wheel when he was shot. "He grabbed himself and started to run," he said. "I couldn't understand it, but he was moving fast."
 
A Chase on Foot, An Injured Youth
 By that time, many residents were at their windows. In one apartment, a 15-year-old and a 26-year-old watched as two police officers chased the wounded Mr. Caesar down the street. A third officer, a heavyset man later identified as Officer Holloway, chased a passenger from the Camaro north up 17th Street.
As the chase continued on foot, Mr. Caesar, running fast despite injuries to his abdomen, liver, stomach and spleen, disappeared around the corner at 18th Street and into the stairwell of his cousins' home.
"When he ran by, I realized it was Bucky," Mr. Anderson said. "The way he was running, you wouldn't know he was shot."
The police returned to the park, having failed to catch either suspect. There, witnesses said, they searched for something in the grass with their flashlights.
Mr. Caesar, meanwhile, was bleeding profusely from his stomach. When Mr. Anderson and several others reached him, he lay just inside the front door, clutching his side. His friends carried him to the second-floor apartment, where the cousins, after a brief debate over whether to notify the authorities, called an ambulance. Mr. Caesar is listed in critical condition, and is on life-support equipment, at University Hospital.
The specific times of these events remain somewhat unclear. A police dispatcher called at 4:41 A.M. for response to a shooting. One minute later, the Camaro, which the authorities say was registered to the mother of Police Officer Dino D'Elia, was reported stolen by Officer D'Elia's brother.
 
A Vast Web of Regulations
 The six officers were in trouble. Under New Jersey law a police officer may fire at a suspect only if the officer thinks his own life or someone else's is danger. If a Newark police officer fires his service revolver, he must, under departmental rules, immediately give the weapon -- uncleaned -- to Internal Affairs investigators. Moving shell casings violates department regulations and state laws against evidence tampering. The officer must file a report to Internal Affairs.
Howard Caesar had been in trouble with the law before. Caught several times riding in stolen vehicles, he was sentenced to a state center for juvenile offenders last year. He was there when his father, Edward Caesar, a custodian for the Newark Board of Education, died of cancer, on June 14, 1991.
The death shattered the young man. "He wasn't here when his father died and he couldn't even talk to him before he died," his aunt said. "Sometimes he felt things were hopeless. There were a lot of things that discouraged him."
Like so many young men in Newark who look to a future without money or prospects of steady employment, he turned to the streets. Week after week, he sank further into an anarchic world in which cars are stolen for wild drives and the police are enemies to be outfoxed and outpaced.
Newark has the highest car theft rate per capita in the nation. "There's nothing else to do," said the 15-year-old charged as Mr. Caesar's passenger. "Everybody does it."
"We just joyride," said the boy. "We don't sell them." He said most cars can be entered in about two minutes and started with a screwdriver.
 
Growing Contempt From Police Officers
 The police, faced with dozens of thefts a day, and angered by accidents that just this year have hospitalized at least two officers and caused the death of a woman from Elizabeth, N.J., have responded with growing contempt of their own.
Several youths in the area this week described times when police officers "squatting" in the parking lot of the Eleganza Lounge on 16th Avenue, near where Mr. Caesar was shot, would fling bricks and stones at stolen cars in an attempt to scare or startle the drivers. A man who would identify himself only as Jabaar said, "I've seen them break windows of cars. They try to chase them, but they can't catch them."
Police officers are sometimes taunted at stop lights by juveniles in stolen cars. The youths make obscene gestures, then speed off. And two young men arrested for car theft were released on their own recognizance -- only to steal officers' cars as they left the police station.
According to Sgt. Henry Alston, an officer with the Newark auto theft squad, 1,623 cars were stolen in the city in May. Another 216 attempted thefts were foiled. Stressing the age of the boys involved, Sgt. Alston held up a computer printout about 7 feet long that represented the arrest records of two juveniles. One boy was 15 years old, the other 11. "We have situations where kids steal cars to go on dates," he said.
 
 
 
'DOUGHNUTS' TO BULLETS
 6 P.M. MONDAY: Howard Caesar, 17 years old, is picked up at his family's home by friends to go out for the evening.
ABOUT MIDNIGHT: Arrives at King's Fried Chicken, a neighborhood hangout on 16th Avenue.
ABOUT 2 A.M. TUESDAY: Leaves the chicken stand with friends, destination unknown.
BETWEEN 2 A.M. AND 3 A.M.: A black Camaro is seen cruising streets, sometimes chased by police cars.
BETWEEN 3 A.M. AND 4 A.M.: -- A police car enter West Side Park to lay in wait for the Camaro.
ABOUT 4 A.M.: -- Camaro seen making tight, tire-screeching circles -- youths call them doughnuts -- on the street.
SOMETIME AFTER 4 A.M.: Camaro hits curb. As driver gets out, people on street shout warnings of police officers in the park. Officers chase two youths and shots are fired, witnesses say.
4:14 A.M.: Vera Brown, whose apartment overlooks the street, says she hears shots on the street; checks her digital clock.
4:41 A.M.: Police dispatcher sends squad cars to area; the police say shots and subsequent call reporting them would have been earlier.

HEADLINE: THE EARTH SUMMIT;
NEGOTIATORS IN RIO AGREE TO INCREASE AID TO THIRD WORLD

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 13

 BODY:
Less than 24 hours before the end of the Earth Summit, North and South finally compromised today on principles that encourage richer countries to increase aid to the third world, clearing the way for formal approval of the global cleanup plan that is the centerpiece of the conference.
After 13 days of negotiations, third-world countries finally abandoned their campaign to extract a specific commitment from the industrialized world to nearly double aid to poorer countries by the year 2000. The money would help guarantee that the third world's development is environmentally sound. The compromise, worked out in a small group and approved in an informal general session this evening, will be formally adopted on Sunday.
 
Accepting U.S. Position
 Under the compromise, instead of pressing their demands for precise commitments of money, the third-world countries accepted that the United States was unwilling to be bound by a longstanding United Nations goal of raising aid levels to 0.7 percent of a country's economic output and that Britain, Japan, Germany and several other big aid donors refuse to commit themselves to that target by any particular date. 
 President Bush left the conference defending his environmental record and the Administration's stance on the major treaties at the Earth Summit, saying Americans are "the leaders, not the followers," on environmental issues and will be "pre-eminent" in carrying out accords signed at the conference. [Page 10.]
 
Japan Vows Leading Role
 Japan, too, made a promise today to "play a leading role" in future world pollution control. Japan's Prime Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, in a speech circulated here, promised to increase foreign aid for environmental projects and embrace pollution control as a scientific challenge. He did not join the other leaders gathered here because of debates in Japan's Parliament.
Japan's environmental aid will average $1.45 billion a year, compared with the $1 billion level of the last three years. Japan now contributes 0.3 percent of its gross domestic product.
In today's unusual North-South exchange, one of the rare occasions on which the third world enjoyed genuine leverage, the industrialized Northern countries committed themselves to reach the 0.7 percent target "as soon as possible" and pledged to see that the environmental goals in the plan, known as Agenda 21, are fully met. Implicit in the compromise is that the North must find more money for the third world.
The agreement notes that the planned Commission on Sustainable Development will monitor progress toward the aid target. And it says that a "review process" should "systematically combine the monitoring of implementation of Agenda 21 with the review of the financial resources available for such implementation."
Although the third-world countries accepted the compromise, they have serious reservations about the success of Agenda 21 without specific commitments of money. On Sunday, during the concluding session, Pakistan, the current chairman of the Group of 77, as the third-world countries are known at United Nations meetings, will express the bloc's disappointment at the financial offers the North has made so far.
 
A Warning on Financing
 And Pakistan will implicitly remind the North that it cannot significantly improve the environment without Southern cooperation. The statement will warn that without the additional assistance, the developing South will be unable to develop in an environmentally sound manner.
"We are saying we cannot generate the new resources needed to start up Agenda 21 without new help, so if the North wants us to meet those goals they must treat us more generously," Pakistan's United Nations representative, Jamsheed A. Marker said.
Third-world countries say they are owed that assistance because the developed Northern nations are responsible for most of the damage industrialization has inflicted on ecological systems so far. Third-world countries say the North should be willing to pay for the limits it has imposed on the development of poorer countries.
Other countries have their objections as well. Britain, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland are reluctant to commit themselves to reach the target by the year 2000, saying it would be unrealistic. Germany also said it wanted the summit meeting to acknowledge that it faces an exceptional financial burden as a result of unification, which leaves it short of funds for the third world. That irritates developing countries that have long feared that Communism's collapse would divert Western aid to Eastern Europe.
Saudi Arabia is continuing to object to passages in Agenda 21 that commit the world to save oil by using such "economic measures" as carbon energy taxes. Saudi Arabia, backed by several other oil producers including Kuwait, Iran and Libya, argue that those pledges, which threaten to reduce demand for their oil, are no longer necessary now that the Earth Summit has approved a new convention on stabilizing the atmosphere by curbing emissions of warming gases created by burning fossil fuels.
Western and most third-world countries oppose the Saudi stand and many delegates say that if Saudi Arabia persists in its opposition it may be voted down at Sunday's closing session.
Delegates also agreed today to give "special consideration" to a proposal put forward by the World Bank president, Lewis T. Preston, to replenish the International Development Agency, which lends on favorable terms to the poorest countries, at a level of $18 billion over the next three years and to add an "earth increment" of about $5 billion to provide inexpensive loans for environmental projects.
But they refused to give any specific commitment to adopt the World Bank president's proposals as the Group of 77 has demanded, saying that to do so would prejudice the outcome of the separate replenishment negotiations scheduled for next month in Dublin.
The 12 European Community countries have also said they will provide about $4 billion in environmental financing to insure that Agenda 21 gets off to a quick start in the third world, but it remains unclear how much new money is included in that offer.

HEADLINE: Russians Ask, 'What Country Do I Live In?'

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 13

 BODY:
A 16-year-old boy from Rubtsovsk, a town set deep in Siberia, recently sent a letter to a newspaper asking a question that is disturbing many Russians as they come to terms with the loss of the Soviet Union.
"I am a citizen of a nonexistent state, and I don't know where I live," Aleksei S. wrote to Komsomolskaya Pravda. "Is it the Commonwealth of Independent States, or is it the Russian Federated Republic? Is it Siberia, and is it the Sovereign Republic of Altai?" 
 Such confusion is not just a question of borders or competing claims of sovereignty. It is psychological and for some even traumatic. As it turns out, the collapse of the Soviet Union lighted a slow fuse that is still burning in the Russian national consciousness, leaving many people feeling robbed of a sense of place, of purpose and of identity.
 
'An Idea' Is Needed
 For the smaller republics, the union's final demise in December meant the birth of a new state and liberation from Moscow's tyranny. But for ethnic Russians the loss of the union has opened up an old and painful question: Without an empire, or a mission, what is Russia?
"An idea of Russia is needed," Sergei B. Stankevich, an adviser to President Boris N. Yeltsin, said in a recently published interview. "Now it is lacking."
The problem dates back to the Russian Empire, a vast continental sweep patched together through wars and treaties by an imperial dynasty that was first ousted and then wiped out by the 1917 revolutions. United by their culture, their church and fealty to the Czar, Russians have never known a nation-state in the West European sense. The very issues involved in the transition are causing President Yeltsin to go to the United States on Monday for talks with President Bush about aid, arms and economic reform.
 
25 Million in Other Republics
 What is called Russia today -- the Russian Federation, with its 130 nationalities and ethnic groups, its 31 autonomous republics and regions -- was carved out of the old Russian Empire, to make up the core of the Soviet Union. About 82 percent of the 150 million people living in Russia are ethnic Russians, and 25 million more are scattered through the other former republics.
Unlike Austria, which emerged as a homogenous country after the collapse of the Hapsburg Empire in 1918, Russia is itself still a mini-empire, held together more by inertia than by a common identity.
"The fact is that Russia is only now building its statehood, something it never had," said Oleg T. Bogomolov, director of the Institute of International Economic and Political Studies, who says he fears a trend toward regional separatism as local authorities grab more and more power away from a weakened Moscow.
 
More Painful Than Expected
 The breakup of the union has turned out to be more painful than many Russians had expected. Initially, it was widely seen as another aspect of the collapse of Communism, a way of getting rid of "the center." But after a delayed reaction, Russians are only now beginning to understand what it means to live in a truncated country, to see its status a world superpower reduced to one of an ailing regional giant, to be scorned by neighbors they once thought of as "brothers."
People joke bitterly about needing visas to go on summer holidays on the Baltic or Black Sea coasts, about having to change money to go to Ukraine, or about passing through "customs" to go to Kazakhstan. "Did you see my foreign car?" one Russian asked wistfully, as he pointed out his new Zaporozhets, produced in Ukraine.
"Russians have an identity crisis," a Western diplomat said. "They haven't come to terms with the idea of Russia within its current borders. Some wanted to see the commonwealth as a stage on the way to a renewed union and expected that the other republics, especially Ukraine, would want to come to a new relationship with Russia. Most people cannot conceive of Russia without Ukraine."
Ukraine's bolt for independence is difficult for many Russians to comprehend, given the historic links binding the nations. Furthermore, Ukrainian independence has meant the loss of the Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet -- two icons of Russian history known to every schoolchild from Moscow to Vladivostok.
 
A Cultural Riddle
 It also exposes the riddle of Russian identity, which is more rooted in culture than in geography. The empire left a legacy of many nations sharing one language. The result is a cultural knot that is practically impossible to untie: Nikolai Gogol, for instance, was a Ukrainian who wrote in Russian. The Soviet Encyclopedia calls him a Russian writer, while the Ukrainians claim him as their own.
Some, like the philosopher Aleksandr Tsipko, a director at the Gorbachev Foundation, argue that today's Russian Federation is a fiction, and thus vulnerable to challenges from within and without.
"The collapse of the Soviet Union along current internal borders leads not only to the death of the Soviet Empire, but also to the collapse of the state's historic core," he wrote in October, at a time when President Yeltsin was pushing the old union out of his way. "The Russian Federated Republic is not a 'metropolis,' as the British Isles were to the British Empire. It is the heart of the Russian Empire, the place where its boldest imperial conquests were concentrated."
In a recent interview, Mr. Tsipko predicted further decomposition, as parts of Russia itself drift away from Moscow, which has neither the power nor the will to hold them. In the meantime, he said, Russian nationalists, feeding on feelings of national humiliation, are bound to grow in strength.
Mr. Yeltsin's challenge, as he tries to pick his way past the "national" questions that keep erupting inside and alongside Russia's borders, is to define Russia's interests. But Russia is not of one piece, nor does it lie within one set of borders. The Chechen republic, a patch of the North Caucasus, has declared its out-and-out independence from the Russian Federation, while the Russian majorities in Ukrainian Crimea and in the Trans-Dniester region, a tiny sliver of independent Moldova, are clamoring to get back in.
 
Mixing Past With Present
 The Communists' antinational policies left other former Soviet republics with arbitrary borders and mixed populations, some of which are now the source of conflict and dispute. But Russia is alone with its vestigial imperial mentality, one that repeatedly confuses the idea of a multinational empire with the interests of a newborn state.
"People often mix up the Russian Federation of today and the historic Russia, which was the Russian Empire," said Otto Latsis, a commentator at the newspaper Izvestia. "People say the Black Sea Fleet was Russian, but it belonged to a Russian Empire, which consisted not just of Russia but of Ukraine. The problem is that the Russian people and the Russian Government want to see our Russia today as the full heir of the Russian Empire, but this is not so."
Without Ukraine, Belarus and the Baltic states, Russia's center of gravity has shifted eastward, a fact that Moscow seems to have understood better in recent months as it increased its diplomatic overtures to the new Central Asian states.
In an interview this week, Mr. Yeltsin brushed aside doubts about Russia's statehood. He said Russia's rich and ancient culture, and not the number of its nuclear warheads, would determine its status as a great power. "Today in any corner of the globe, people know what Russia is," he said. "This means Russia has a history, a rich history."
 
Western Dictation Seen
 But the fact is that without the union or the empire, Russia's standing as a world power has diminished drastically. Not only is Moscow no longer on a par with Washington, but there is also a growing perception that the West is dictating the terms of Russia's recovery.
Many Russians also have the sense that Russia, by far the largest of the former Soviet republics, has let itself become a punching bag for its neighbors. This sense of humiliation comes on top of the realization -- for many, only a recent one -- that the Communist system under which they lived for seven decades was not only fraudulent but also criminal.
"In the days of America's Wild West, there was a saying that a good Indian is a dead Indian," Mr. Stankevich said. "We have almost the same: A good Russian is a Russian in tears, repentant, pulling his hair out, showing how bad his country and people are, along with its whole history."
Understanding what Russia is is the nation's biggest challenge, Mr. Stankevich said. "The tragedy is that we don't know our own country," he wrote. "We don't want to know it, and what's more, we are proud of that."

HEADLINE: Washington Journal;
Monument to Jewish Culture Makes a Comeback

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13

 BODY:
With its boarded-up windows and weed-infested yard, the abandoned stone building on lower 16th Street in downtown Washington looks more like a forgotten mausoleum than a monument to the capital's once-thriving Jewish community.
But members of a new generation of young Jews, who are replacing the thousands of an older generation who fled to the suburbs, hope to change that. They plan not merely to give the old Jewish community center a facelift but to restore it to its role as a social and cultural focal point for Washington's Jews. 
 From 1925 until it closed in 1968, the community center, a 55,000-square-foot edifice at 16th and Q Streets, was the vibrant focal point of Washington's tightknit Jewish population. From the building's grand front entrance, new immigrants could see the White House. Inside, amid its ornate marbled columns, they could meet in its health club, classrooms and theater and kibitz about their plans for prosperity.
Some of those newcomers of the 1930's and 40's are among the best-known names in Washington today: Abe Pollin, owner of the Bullets and Capitals, Washington's basketball and hockey teams, and Charles E. Smith and Morris Cafritz, two of the area's leading real estate developers.
In the 1950's and 60's, with Jews joining the exodus to the suburbs, the Washington center became a casualty of its own success as Jews assimilated into the suburban culture. A 25-acre complex in Rockville, Md., a suburb of Washington, became the area's new Jewish community center.
In 1968, riots set off by the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. left the area around the Washington center in a shambles, and so the center's leaders decided to sell the building to the city government, which made it part of the Federal City College. But the college moved uptown to become the University of the District of Columbia, and the building has been vacant for 10 years. Today, though the row houses around it have been renovated with the gentrification of the neighborhood, the center remains an eyesore.
But the young Jews who have moved into the city and who plan to renovate the building hope to use it to encourage their generation to turn inward and preserve their heritage. They have already started a new center, now operating out of a town house as the District of Columbia's Jewish Community Center.
Whereas the old center served to Americanize Jewish immigrants, "the new purpose of Jewish centers is to help 'Judaize' Americans," said Elaine Mann, the assistant executive director of the Rockville center.
After several years of fund raising, the District's Jewish Community Center bought the building from the city government for $2.3 million in 1990. The remodeling is expected to cost $10.2 million, of which $3.2 million has been raised.
Some of the suburban Jewish leaders have questioned whether restoring the Washington center is the best use of members' money. They note that three times more Jews live in Montgomery County than in the capital. They say that almost half of the 30,000 Jews who live in Washington are young and single, and thus are less likely than suburban Jews with families to be "affiliated" -- that is, to socialize with other Jews and worship regularly.
But Arna Meyer Mickelson, director of the Jewish Community Center, says that is precisely why the remodeling should be "an enormous priority." She and other Jewish leaders in the area say that for younger, less-religious Jews, community centers are often better re-entry points into Jewish culture than synagogues.
Ted Farber, executive director of the United Jewish Appeal Federation, said the concern about the city's young Jews is reflected nationwide. "We realize that as we become more and more a part of the economic and social mainstream of America, we have to find ways to help our young people identify positively with their heritage," Mr. Farber said.
When the District's center considered new quarters, planners examined several possibilities. David Posner, assistant executive director of the center, said the history of the old center and its site, five minutes from a subway stop, settled the matter. "It was built within view of the White House, as a symbol of Jewish arrival in America," he said, "and this was always in our minds."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Undeclared Candidate;
Behind Two Issues, Outlines of Perot Presidency Emerge

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13

 BODY:
He has been scorned by his rivals as the Stealth Candidate, swooping into the lead in the Presidential race despite -- or because of -- his views' being virtually unknown. Yet while details remain almost nonexistent, the outlines of Ross Perot's vision for a Presidency are coming into view.
In interviews he has granted since he began flirting with a possible campaign, Mr. Perot has sketched out a set of principles that form the bedrock of his candidacy. As a successful business executive, Mr. Perot holds views that amount to a starkly pro-business platform, one that could easily be adopted by a Republican or by a Democrat like Paul E. Tsongas, the Massachusetts Democrat whom Mr. Perot admires. 
 But on the Government role in directing business, Mr. Perot departs sharply from the laissez-faire economics of the Reagan and Bush Administrations, arguing for a level of intervention often identified with liberal Democrats.
His overarching opinion is that the cure for the nation's economic ills is to place in the Oval Office an executive with clear-eyed business principles: strategic planning, test marketing, protection of markets, enhanced productivity and reduction of debt.
"Never forget," Mr. Perot said in a speech at the National Press Club in March, "the United States Government is the world's largest and most complex business. With that thought in mind, ask yourself which of these candidates for President would you let run your medium-sized business."
 
2 Issues and Then a Gap
 In essence, Mr. Perot is a two-issue candidate. Along with economic development, his emphasis is on reducing the influence of undefined "special interests" and making the Government more responsive to popular will. He would curb lobbying and political action committees, make all tax increases subject to public approval and involve voters in critical decisions through the use of "electronic town halls."
Once past those two broad issues, Mr. Perot's interest and ideas flag. Environmental policies, health care, gun control, abortion, foreign aid, affirmative action and education are, at this point, clearly second-tier concerns where he is much fuzzier.
"The point is, we have serious core problems in our economy," Mr. Perot said in April on the "Evans and Novak" program. "This is the overriding thing. You can bring up, you know, what are we going to do with every stray dog in Washington, and this, and this, and this, and this. I don't have positions on those things, haven't thought about it."
 
Critics Take Aim
 Critics of Mr. Perot say his proposals have not been well thought out. They note that linking new taxes to referendums would make it difficult to close loopholes that could inadvertently end up in the tax code. Barring campaign contributions from PAC's of foreign-owned companies would violate constitutional protections of free speech, and Federal laws and Congressional rules already restrict former Federal officials' lobbying of the Government.
The Bush campaign, in particular, is beginning to argue that questions about Mr. Perot's temperament and how he would carry out his sweeping proposals make his election too great a risk for the country.
Perot aides have said that such attacks are the type of character assassination typical of recent Republican Presidential campaigns. Mr. Perot and his advisers argue that he will be filling in details over the next few months and that as a newcomer to the campaign trail he cannot be expected to have legislative and administrative details at his fingertips, as do Mr. Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton, the perspective Democratic nominee.
Here is a sample of a Perot platform as gleaned from interviews.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. Mr. Perot advocates a strong role for the Federal Government in developing a long-range industrial strategy. He believes the Government should undertake an industry-by-industry study of various economic sectors to see how they can be strengthened. He says the United States should study Japan's Ministry for International Trade and Industry, which co-ordinates government and private-sector economic strategy for that country, and adapt such a model for America.
He favors loosening regulations to let banks make more loans to small businesses. A bank is currently required to maintain a reserve of cash or stock totaling 8 percent of all its loans to small businesses.
Mr. Perot, a computer services executive, also favors weakening Federal anti-trust laws, which he believes prevent large corporations from competing effectively with foreign companies.
In an interview with The New York Times in April, he said he would use the Securities and Exchange Commission to prevent heads of corporations from stacking their boards with hand-picked directors who would rubber-stamp their decisions.
TAXES. While Mr. Perot has supported tax increases in the past, he now says he is "absolutely opposed to raising taxes," except in times of emergencies like war. He opposes the type of middle-class tax cuts that have been proposed by Mr. Clinton, asserting they will do little to stimulate the economy.
"We've got Congress up here working on all kinds of tax fixes to give the average guy 300 bucks, which won't mean a thing," Mr. Perot said in February on the "Larry King Live" television show where he first announced his willingness to be drafted as a Presidential candidate.
Instead, though he is loath to use the phrase, Mr. Perot favors a reduction in the capital gains tax for small businesses, arguing that such enterprises have th makes sense for that money -- which is high-risk money, which is going to stay there for a long period of time -- to be taxed on a favorable basis," he said on the show.
BUDGET DEFICIT. While Mr. Perot has inveighed against the Federal budget deficit and the national debt, his plans to reduce the red ink have been attacked in several quarters as woolly. He has said he would save $180 billion a year by ferreting out fraud and would ask Congress to give him a line-item veto to curb future spending. He has not said where he would cut.
He has said he would save $100 billion a year by persuading America's European and Asian allies to pay more for their defense, but he has not said what he would do if they refuse. He has said he could save $20 billion a year by eliminating Social Security payments to upper-income beneficiaries. But, according to the Congressional Budget Office, retired individuals with annual incomes over $100,000 will receive only $9.1 billion in Social Security benefits next year, and they already pay nearly $1.4 billion in income taxes on those benefits.
The mainstay of Mr. Perot's assault on the deficit is to stimulate the economy. Like Presidents Reagan and Bush, he believes the country can grow its way out of debt.
TRADE. Mr. Perot denies he is a protectionist, but he often says that a tougher policy is needed in negotiations with American trading partners, especially Japan. In a recent interview with the Los Angeles Times, he said he would make the Japanese say, "We'll take the same deal on cars we've given you." He has expressed opposition to a free-trade agreement with Mexico, saying it would mean the exodus of jobs to Mexico. But he has also said his mind was not completely made up on the proposed agreement.
OPENING UP GOVERNMENT. Mr. Perot believes that the Federal Government is controlled by too many "special interests" and that average citizens have too little influence. To redress that, he has proposed a $1,000 limit on campaign contributions from PAC's, a ban on former Federal officials lobbying Government agencies and Congress, and having the polls open on weekends to encourage more people to vote.
A centerpiece of his campaign is the "electronic town hall," where the public would be sampled for its views on crucial policy issues. But he acknowledges flaws in the concept. Asked in April how he would know that such a gathering would produce a representative sample of public attitudes, Mr. Perot said the results would be confirmed by using opinion polls. But he told "TV Guide" this week that the concept of electronic town halls was "just an idea," adding, "I'm not stuck with this."
ABORTION. Mr. Perot has clearly said many times that he believes it is up to a woman to decide if she wants to terminate a pregnancy. It is unclear though whether he supports Federal financing of abortions for poor woman, and he appears to favor laws requiring minors who want an abortion to notify their parents first.
GUN CONTROL. While many early press reports described Mr. Perot as favoring restrictions on firearms, he has yet to express support for any gun-control measure. He is against both registration of handguns and mandatory waiting periods before a person can buy a gun.
He has said he wants "to get guns out of the hands of violent people," but he has not spelled out how he would do that. This week, in an appearance on the NBC News "Today" program, he essentially endorsed the National Rifle Association's view that what is needed is stiffer penalties for people who use guns to commit crimes.
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. Mr. Perot's record of hiring women and minorities while he was chairman of Electronic Data Services was not exemplary. He has said he understands the basis of racial preference programs, but on balance he seems to oppose the concept of affirmative action.
"It produces some advantages," Mr. Perot said this week, "but it produces tremendous stress and increases the level of stress in society if a less-qualified person is promoted over a more-qualified person. He said he "didn't want to do anything" that put stress between people.

HEADLINE: A Grim Wasteland on News at Six

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD

 BODY:
Another night, another nightmare.
The teen-age killer gives way to the subway slasher. The mob slaying segues into a spot on kids with guns. The face of a weeping mother dissolves into a close-up of a blood-stained shirt. House fires become "raging infernos." Traffic snarls. Kids fall out of windows. Babies die in random shootings. Manhunts are commonplace. 
 On a quiet afternoon marked only by a humdrum commuter crisis and a rehashed murder case -- "They said the rosary, then they murdered their friend" -- an early summer news stupor is spiced by accounts of a Royal ruckus. Did Princess Diana almost kill herself? Then, the weather.
Welcome to New York. Day after day, from 4 P.M. to midnight, at almost any time, the nation's largest city is investigated, poked, tossed and turned in quick-cut images projected to a potential viewership of some 18 million people, a population about the size of Iraq's.
The result, says Jay Rosen, a media critic and associate professor at New York University, is an "image of the city as a hellhole, an image the rest of the country is only too happy to accept."
In more than 80 interviews over several weeks, journalists, scholars and other New Yorkers, ranging from janitors to teachers to corporate executives, described New York -- as portrayed by television -- as a grim wasteland that bears almost no relation to their lives. The city thus exposed is a sustained scream, a bloodied mess.
It flutters on the screen as an unrecognizable distillation of its failures, a force of its own. Cumulatively, its images produce a distorted mirror for its citizenry -- one that, Joan Cooney, the former president of the Children's Television Workshop, says, "is injuring our brains."
New York is the media capital of the world. All told, some 4,500 members of the press are authorized to cover fires, riots and other mayhem. Of those, more than 1,000 are foreign journalists who beam New York's worst nightmares around the world. Home-grown competition is fierce, too.
Three tabloid newspapers are in a circulation battle that may end with the death of one of them. Six television stations vie for viewers. An all-news channel planned by Time Warner Inc. is scheduled to begin this fall.
Yet in the view of many people, all that competition has done little to raise the quality of the news that is carried. "We run a ton of garbage," complained Gabe Pressman, the senior reporter for WNBC-TV, one recent morning as he wove his car through traffic on his way to City Hall. "The whole thing is: Can we be more outrageous and sensationalist than the next guy? Can we tease people into the 10 o'clock news?"
The result, he lamented, is a jumble of bloodied sidewalks and an ever-changing image of a dangerous, disease-plagued town that does not really exist.
Some of the bleakness is starting to wear on viewers. "Every auto you see must blow up in a fireball, and every street is unsafe," said George Sickles, a 78-year-old resident of Greenwich, Conn., during a recent visit to the city. "I am afraid of the television. If I were dictator of the country, I would ban it."
That said, the retired union official shuffled through the concourse at Grand Central Station and into the "tunnel of death," which most New Yorkers refer to as the subway.
 
'An Ethic of Toughness'
 Mr. Rosen, who is working on a book to be called "What Are Journalists For?" says the media take pride in their unruliness. "There is an ethic of toughness that is almost completely unquestioned," he said. The result is that the city's better side lives in perpetual shadow. "There are certain ways that New York is a more civilized place than anywhere else. But you would never know it."
 
Striking a Balance
Tough Problems Or Exaggeration?
 Many journalists and news executives defend their portrayals as accurate reflections of a city wrestling with extraordinary problems.
"There's a cacophany of social insults and danger out there," said Chuck Scarborough, the WNBC-TV anchor who has worked in local news for 18 years. "The economy is off. Real estate prices are depressed. The homeless and poor haven't been decent enough to keep out of sight, and street crime remains a pervasive problem. "The atmosphere in the city is somewhat corrosive right now, and I suppose after you've been out there all day, it's not that reassuring to go home and flip on the news," he said.
Yet, a number of people in the business, though they acknowledge that much of the news is responsibly reported and presented, say balanced coverage has given way to reports that sensationalize the bizarre.
Kay Delaney, the international sales manager and senior vice president of Turner Broadcasting Sales Inc., faults the bottom line. "There are eight million of us running around here, and we are not all getting raped and mugged and pillaged every day," she said. "But people just think there's someone with a machine gun on every corner. I have friends who won't even come to town from Scardale!"
The tendency to highlight crime coverage may have peaked with the 1990 crime wave that prompted The New York Post to run the headline: "DAVE, DO SOMETHING." The coverage, said Albert Scardino, a former press secretary to Mayor David N. Dinkins and a former reporter for The New York Times, amplified existing problems, twisting them out of proportion. He described the coverage as "factual, but not fair."
Mr. Pressman agrees. "I felt at the time that we were exaggerating this stuff," he said. "People thought this place was just busting with violence, cruelty, inhumanity and corruption, and it's just not true.
"But we've been on an orgy of crime coverage for years now in this city."
 
The Daily Beat
Sacrificing Depth For What's Easy
 It was not always that way.
Back in the black-and-white days, when "I Love Lucy" was the top network show and Mr. Pressman was New York's only 'round-about-town reporter on television, he envisioned something bold and grand and new in the history of news: a swarm of reporters bringing New York right into our living rooms.
Today, his vision is a reality. The moment trouble strikes, high-tech vans drift across the three-state region, radios blaring, their retractable 40-foot antennae set to beam the latest tragedy directly to the family set.
But Mr. Pressman is having second thoughts. "The barbarians are always trying to get in the gates, and I think they are in the gates now."
Two forces have combined to whittle away at in-depth coverage. Consultants, citing the growing menu of viewers' options -- including the Fox television network -- continually stress the need for short, snappy reports that can hold the attention of the MTV generation. A weak economy that has trimmed newsroom budgets and withered revenues has also cut into resources for research and story development.
The easiest reaction, more than a dozen television news reporters and executives said in recent interviews, has been to cover the easiest stories. And those, said Michael Horowicz, a former producer at WABC-TV, tend to be "the murder du jour."
 
Fox Takes the Leap
 Many in the industry say that Fox was first to try the short-and-not-so-sweet approach. It still holds. On a recent afternoon at the Fox news studios on East 67th Street, a nightly newscast was falling into shape. On this day, the 7 P.M. report would present 25 stories and 3 commercial breaks in a half-hour.
The top story, on the closing of the Alexander's Inc. department store that put 5,200 people out of work, would run for 2 minutes and 15 seconds. It was considered long. A Newark drug bust was 13 seconds. A feature on models over 40 years old received about the same amount of time as a report of an organized-crime trial. Sixteen pieces clocked in at under a minute. Then, the weather.
Ian G. Rae, the station's executive vice president, says a good newscast should give viewers "a comprehensive view of what happened in the world." So at the news meeting, he approved a piece ("Yeltsin-Drunk?") that examined in 11 seconds whether Boris N. Yeltsin might be an alcoholic.
To get "a good news story into the mix," Mr. Rae approved a feature about a boy receiving a heart transplant. That ran for a minute and 41 seconds.
 
The Crime Story
 Crime is always a hit. "It tends to be dramatic," said Mr. Scarborough in an interview last Tuesday at WNBC. "It's reasonably easy to shoot, and the cast of characters is readily available. So we do a lot of it."
As Mr. Scarborough spoke, he reminisced about a series he did in 1983 that ran on 3 days, consuming more than 30 minutes of air time. The series, called "Anatomy of Murder," involved extensive interviews, complicated planning and several camera crews.
Today, he said, "there would be a lot of resistance" to such a series "because we have to grind out our stories more rapidly."
The result is palpable.
The 11 P.M. newscast of Dec. 6, 1979, a tape of which was supplied to The New York Times by WNBC, opened with a segment on the Iranian hostage crisis. That was followed by reports on inflation, a contested real estate law affecting Manhattan loft dwellers, a protest by residents of the Lincoln Towers apartment complex over fuel surcharges, a segment on gasoline costs and on a possible strike at the Long Island Rail Road.
Crime did not appear until more than half-way through the program, in a report about the arrest of several muggers and developments in a beheading case. After the news, sports and the weather, the show closed with a feature on a SoHo artist.
Last Tuesday, Mr. Scarborough reviewed the night's offerings and paused during the interview to tape a 4-second promotion for the 6 P.M. news: "Water guns lead to a shooting in New York. At five."
The news that night began with a report on the actor Ben Vereen, who had been struck by a truck outside his home in Malibu, Calif., followed by a segment on the number of children killed with guns. Then, on to that most irrepressible of stories, the saga of Amy Fisher, and an update on the Queens bus strike.
Then, Mr. Pressman provided a report on national politics. The program closed with a segment on a Long Island pet cemetery and a live report about a wild bear in New Jersey.
 
The Defense
Not Everything Is 'Bright and Sunny'
 William L. Bolster, the recently named president of news at WNBC, did not apologize for the station's news selection. "The very nature of the news is usually that we are telling you bad stuff," he said. "We're not in Faribault, Minn., here, where everything is bright and sunny."
The focus on disasters and mayhem, not the good news story in Harlem or the Bronx, is only natural, he says, because it sells. "People may say they want good news," Mr. Bolster says, "but it reminds me of the F.D.R. Drive: Everyone honks when they are tied up in traffic. But when they get to the wreck, they look, too."
"People are just less likely to read the editorial pages than watch the car wreck," he said.
Too, the complex pieces, reporting about the national debt, the savings and loan crisis and other arcania, he says, just do not make for good television. "It would take more time than we have, and it still would not be interesting."
 
Clammor for a Change
 Some voices are calling for change. Osborn Elliott, the former editor of Newsweek who is now the dean emeritus of the Columbia School of Journalism, calls it the "curled-lip school of journalism." He condemned the press for its relentless negativism and called for a new approach to news.
"It's time for the press of this city to wake up and recognize the fact that they are important members of the community and they should get with it," he said. "I'm certainly not asking the media to ignore crime, grime and whores. But they've got to start taking responsibility for art, culture, commerce and community life as well."
Such have long been the dinner party laments of some intellectuals who would have The New York Review of Books set the standard for tabloid journalism. But a strange thing is happening across New York's newsrooms. Collectively, it sounds rather like a clamor for good news.
Liz Smith, the nationally syndicated gossip columnist who writes for Newsday, says the city's press corps has slipped from the bonds of decency. "If you watch TV," she said, "you just think the whole city is falling apart. And yet you go out on the streets and New York is pretty much the same as it always was. I know we have problems. But there's no reason for the press to keep everyone in this state of horrifying anxiety.
"If they do a story about someone putting a baby in an oven, I don't want to see it four times before bedtime and then again when I get up in the morning," Ms. Smith added. "It just makes people feel really sick. When I get out of town, I just feel this sense of relief!"
 
Too Many Studies
 Bud Carey, who was recently named general manager of news at WCBS-TV, says excessive focus on market research has moved news coverage too far from its roots. He sees his mandate at the third-ranked station in the region as returning the network to more in-depth reports.
"This business," he said, "is always searching for the holy grail. One of the great tyrannies we deal with is overnight ratings."
Another tyranny is the city itself. To those who want to stress the sensational and grotesque, it is endlessly accommodating. Somewhere, at any time, a crime is being committed, a tragedy is unfolding. The region's reporters have but to move out in pursuit of the mayhem, chattering on cellular telephones and weighed down with beepers, pens, tape recorders and notebooks.
 
The Evolution
Fox and Tabloids Spicen the Stew
 No one can quantify when or how the shift in coverage began. But Pablo Guzman, a reporter with Fox, has a theory. "We all held our breath when Fox was taken over by Murdoch because we knew his track record," he said. "We were looking at all the guys over at ABC and CBS and NBC to hold the line. But after awhile, their newscasts started to get more and more like ours By the time the Trump stories hit, everybody scrambled as though this were World War II."
Donald J. Trump remembers the period with bitterness. "I've had reporters go up to people on my staff and tell them they knew something was incorrect, but they had to go with it because it would sell," he said.
Headlines do sell, whether they're the promotional spots for the 11 o'clock news or the huge type on the front of The New York Post. "A tabloid page one," said Donald Forst, the editor of New York Newsday, "ideally has an emotion and has to smack you in the eye. It has to go to the gut and make you say, 'wow,' or 'holy smoke,' or 'goddamn,' or whatever it is that you say."
Articles printed inside the newspaper are more sober, but it is the headlines that tend to linger: "TORTURE IN THE SUBWAY," "BODEGA TERROR," "PAID ME IN SEX."
 
Not a New Phenomenon
 In reality, the New York press corps, like some overgrown, obstreperous adolescent, has always had its moments of aggression and bad taste.
In 1851, competing with The New York Herald, The New-York Daily Times carried several tantalizing headlines on page one: "Woman Poisoned," "Accident to an Omnibus Driver," and "Arrest of an Escaped Prisoner." A short feature described the scandal of the moment, the appearance of women clad in bloomers lingering amid a crowd of conservatives that "manifested its hostility."
And through later years, crime has been a staple of the competitive battles among New York's great papers, including The Daily News and The Herald.
Today, The Times is again reacting to competitive pressures, trying to combat an impression that the paper is more interested in Botswana than the Bronx. "It didn't take a lot of study to figure out that the Metro section of old was shortchanging our readers," said Gerald M. Boyd, metropolitan editor of The Times. "We didn't have adequate resources in New York. Ditto Connecticut. Ditto Long Island." The paper responded by expanding bureaus across the region and adding pages to the section.
 
The Tabloids' Challenge
 The tabloids' challenge is more immediate and more difficult. "We're talking about declining readership and People magazine selling out like crazy," said Matthew V. Storin, just days before he said he would leave his post as executive editor of The Daily News to join The Boston Globe. The three papers, in a sense, are in a fight for survival. And the net result is that the tabloid wars are almost a parody of tabloid journalism."
"We turn the volume up on people," he added. "We definitely do."
On television, the increased volume is seen in a developing blur between the local news and "reality" programs like "A Current Affair" and "Hard Copy." And that energy is transferred back and forth daily between television stations and the tabloid press.
"The tabloids sort of validate what you can do every day," said Mr. Horowicz, who recently became the assistant news director at KCBS-TV in Los Angeles after spending two years with the "Geraldo" television show. "In New York, you can get away with doing a story about Donald Trump and Marla Maples, and you can lead the newscast with it day after day. It has no news value at all. But the public just eats it up."
So, the press keeps dishing it out. "New York is the trash journalism center of America right now," says Richard M. Clurman, who has spent 20 years at Time magazine and is the author of several books on the media. "There's a news chain now. What starts in the supermarket tabloids goes on up the chain."
 
Rethinking 'Good News'
 Mr. Clurman said he had begun to doubt his own longstanding belief that good news is not news. "That old cynicism we have been carrying, it's part of the atmosphere," he said. "It's a sort of self-fulfilling hypothesis. If you read every day that everything is crumbling and terrible, you start to feel crummy and terrible, and maybe you start to act crummy and terrible."
Some viewers just turn the bad news off. "It's depressing," said Marcia A. Buchanan, who lives in the Bronx. "They make it seem like everything is crime. Or it's gossip and it's stupid."
When Ms. Buchanan was laid off recently from her job at a New York advertising agency, she hardly blamed the nightly news. Still, she thinks the city suffers in indefinable ways.
"It affects the way people see themselves," she said. "Look at the Los Angeles riots. Everyone was scared to death. I live in a neighborhood that is black, Hispanic and white. But nothing happened there."
Mr. Scarborough is unfazed.
"Maybe we should be glad that we aren't running good news," he said. "Just think of it. We really will have to worry when the news is: 'Man arrives safely at work. Details at 5:00.' "

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Platform;
BROWN IS VOWING A FIGHT ON ISSUES

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M., June 13

 BODY:
His campaign for the Presidency over, Edmund G. Brown Jr. threatened today to disrupt the plans of Democratic leaders for unity behind the party's platform.
Mr. Brown, his ruddy complexion reflecting days spent in the sun and not on campaign planes, went before the platform drafting subcommittee this afternoon to insist that the party take strong stands behind disputed positions on economic policy, foreign affairs, labor law and other matters. 
 "I don't want to impale the nominee," Mr. Brown declared. But he maintained that "the Democratic Party at this point in history desperately needs to define itself in a way that can touch people's hearts and distinguish it from its two competitors."
What the former California Governor has in mind is not clear. Under the rules, the only way he can get a debate on his platform planks at the Democratic convention in New York next month is to rally the support of 20 percent of the 186 members of the party's platform committee. But that committee is filled with supporters of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who has sewed up the Presidential nomination, and Mr. Brown conceded today that he did not have sufficient support to cause trouble on the convention floor.
 
'Live From New York'
 At a news conference after appearing before the drafting panel, Mr. Brown said mysteriously, "Either inside or outside, we go live from New York."
Mr. Clinton and the party's leaders are putting together a platform that takes strong stands on matters like civil rights, legal abortion and gun control about which the party is more or less unified. But it takes more general positions on issues like health care, intervention in the conflict in what was Yugoslavia and tax policy, about which differences in the party are greater.
Mr. Brown, one of the few prominent Democrats who has not endorsed Mr. Clinton (the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska are others), ran through a litany of his positions on subjects like urban aid and nuclear disarmament on which he is to left of Mr. Clinton and the party's mainstream and demanded more specific language in the platform. "Are we going to bite the bullet or are we going to gum the marshmallow?" he asked.
Responding to Mr. Brown, members of the drafting subcommittee adopted a conciliatory tack. Steve Grossman, chairman of the Massachusetts Democratic Party, said many of Mr. Brown's points were worthy of consideration, but he added: "When we are together, we win. When we are divided, we lose."
 
Nothing Written Yet
 No decisions were made at the two days of platform discussions here. A platform document is to be written in the next two weeks and will be presented to the full platform committee in Washington on June 27.
But while words were not written here, the discussions left no doubt that these themes would be prominent in the platform:
*Overall economic growth will be stressed rather than a redistribution of wealth to the less affluent.
*More emphasis will be given to tax cuts and other breaks for business than was the case in previous platforms.
*National health care will be advocated but no specific system will be endorsed.
*The platform will avoid down-the-line support of organized labor.
*Strong support will be expressed for legal abortions and Government financing of abortions for women who cannot afford them.
*On gun control, the Democrats will endorse a waiting period before handguns can be purchased.
*To counter Republican emphasis on what it calls family values, the platform will decry teen-age pregnancies and emphasize the need for people on welfare to find jobs.
That is not enough for Mr. Brown. "There is a view of the world," he told reporters, "that says the platform should be verbal cellophane."
But instead, Mr. Brown added, "the soul of the party must be carefully delineated and expressed."
So what does he intend to do?
"We have 600 delegates," Mr. Brown responded. "I don't believe they are going to New York to be extras in a 'B' political movie. They want to be participants in a live debate and process."

HEADLINE: THE EARTH SUMMIT;
Lessons of Rio: A New Prominence and an Effective Blandness

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 13

 BODY:
The Earth Summit, history's largest gathering of world leaders, is winding up after a fractious 12 days of diplomatic free-for-all among 178 nations. A few clear lessons may already be emerging from the fracas.
One is the new-found prominence of the environment as an international issue, bidding to rank with economics and national security. 
 After Rio, "You can't be treated as a world leader on any issue without being a player on the environment," said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, a senior scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund, a research and advocacy organization.
Many diplomats here remarked on the paradox that the Bush Administration, immobilized in placating the American right wing during an election year, is abdicating leadership of the worldwide environmental movement just as the issue is moving to center stage.
 
'Landmark in a Process'
 A second lesson is that blandness can sometimes prove a surprisingly effective bludgeon. The parcel of treaties signed here have been portrayed by disappointed advocates as pitiful gutless creatures with no bite. But they have hidden teeth that will develop in the right circumstances.
That is why seasoned diplomats like Richard E. Benedick, the former State Department official who helped negotiate the ozone-layer treaty, said on the very first day, "The history books will refer back to this day as a landmark in a process that will save the planet from deterioration."
The Earth Summit, he said, "should not be judged by the immediate results, but by the process it sets in motion."
It might be years, he said, before the results are apparent.
A case in point is the climate treaty which, at Washington's insistence, has no targets or timetables for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. Yet it commits ratifying countries to control emissions so as to protect natural ecosystems.
 
Imperfect Treaties
 The treaty also has built-in flexibility allowing for stronger measures if the threat of global warming appears more serious than at present. The recent complete phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons was set off by just such a provision in the Montreal protocol governing protection of the ozone layer.
"This is a launching pad, not a quick fix," said Maurice Strong, the executive secretary of the conference.
Everything depends on how well the principles enunciated and the bargains struck in Rio between rich and poor countries are put into force.
The climate treaty, already signed by most of the 178 nations attending the conference, is now widely seen as a promising start to the arduous task of curbing the heat-trapping gases, chiefly carbon dioxide, that threaten to disrupt the earth's climate.
Most countries, the United States being the chief exception, also signed a treaty aimed at better conserving the world's dwindling inventory of living species. The two treaties are far from perfect, but between them they set in motion a long-term process for dealing with the two most pressing environmental concerns.
 
Guide for Issues
 By the end of the conference, despite early pessimism, an agreement emerged on basic principles for managing and conserving the world's forests. Of all the issues that divided north and south, haves and have-not countries, that was among the most contentious.
The new accord enables the United Nations to start negotiations on an international forest treaty, a result fervently sought by the United States but flatly resisted by certain third-world countries jealous to preserve sovereignty over their forests. Environmentalists attacked the pact as hopelessly weak, even a step backward, but it appears to have put forest management firmly on the international agenda for the first time.
Another important product of the Rio deliberations is a general statement of principles for sustainable development, along with a voluminous compendium of rather general recommendations, called Agenda 21, for nations to follow as a guide on virtually every known environmental issue. Probably no one has yet read or digested it all.
On the debit side, the agreements all tend to run toward the lowest common denominator, perhaps an inevitable result when an entire planet's welter of interests clash on matters involving economics.
 
Attention to Population
 Population, while it is addressed in Agenda 21, clearly received less attention than deserved even though, along with rich countries' wasteful consumption patterns, it lies at the root of the global environmental problem. A major world conference on population is scheduled for 1994.
Still unsettled was the crucial question of mechanisms and commitments for transferring money from rich countries to poor ones to promote economic development compatible with protecting the environment. The delegates had also not agreed on the establishment of institutions to carry out the summit meeting's recommendations.
On the scorecard of north versus south, the developing countries clearly succeeded in their goal of making economic development as important as environmental protection. While almost everyone agrees that economics and environment must go hand in hand, some environmentalists were disturbed that the Rio Declaration, the summit talks' over-all statement of principles, says explicitly that "human beings are at the center of concerns" for sustainable development.
Putting humans at the center of things, with the implied right to dominate and exploit the rest of nature, is what has caused the problem in the first place, environmentalists contend.
 
Role of U.S. Election
 Many delegates say that the conference would have been more productive had the United States adopted a leadership stance instead of a "defensive crouch," in the words of Jessica Mathews, a vice president of the World Resources Institute.
Had it done so, said Russell E. Train, chairman of the World Wildlife Fund in the United States, its specific objections on particular issues might have been taken more seriously. The United States stance is widely attributed to President Bush's need, in a three-way Presidential race, to shore up the Republicans' core conservative constituency.
Tommy Koh of Singapore, the take-charge gavel wielder who was chairman of the conference's main working session, was heard to remark that "This will teach the United Nations not to hold a conference in an American election year."
Delegates from many other countries readily agreed with Mr. Bush's assertion in his speech here yesterday that the United States domestic record on the environment is exemplary. But American allies expressed regret that he had brought so few international initiatives with him.
The Americans challenged the allies to join in a doubling of international aid for protection of forests, sweetening the proposal with an initial down payment of $150 million a year. Europeans reacted with interest, but reserved judgment pending a further review of the proposal and their budgetary situations.
"We've always been very happy to follow the American lead when we felt it was going in the right direction said Margaret Brusasco-Mackenzie, head of the European Commission's Division of the Environment. But the response she would now give to the President, she said, is that: "You've stopped somewhere down the road. We would like you to look outside instead of inside at the elections."
Once what a country did in its own backyard was its own concern. After the Rio conference, the world is more likely to be watching.

HEADLINE: Noriega Says Bush Deserved Protests for an 'Insulting' Visit

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ATLANTA, June 13

 BODY:
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the Panamanian leader who was ousted in 1989 and brought to the United States for trial, says President Bush deserved the protests and tear gas he encountered in Panama City this week.
In an interview with Cable News Network, parts of which were broadcast on Friday, General Noriega said Mr. Bush's visit to Panama on Thursday was arrogant and highhanded. He said the stopover had been handled "in an insulting way toward a country that still has not found all of its dead" from an invasion by the United States in December 1989. 
 After the invasion, General Noriega was captured by American forces and brought to Florida for trial on drug and racketeering charges. He was convicted on April 9 and faces sentencing on July 10.
At a news conference at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Mr. Bush said today that he was unconcerned about the opinion of "a discredited drug lord."
"As if his criticism means anything," he said.
 
'Panama Is Free'
 On Thursday, President Bush was hurriedly escorted from a city square in Panama City after police officers fired tear gas and warning shots to disperse protesters. The incident prevented him from delivering a speech hailing Panama's progress toward democracy.
The President said today in Rio that while "a handful of demonstrators" dominated the news, "that should not obscure the fact that Panama is democratic, Panama is free." He said the "warmth from the Panamanian people was overwhelming."
At least 325 Panamanians died in the United States invasion. Some Panamanian groups put the figure much higher, and General Noriega, speaking through an interpreter, asserted in the interview that Washington has covered up incidents of brutality.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	WASHINGTON, June 13 (Reuters) -- A $420 million aid package to Panama that was intended to invigorate the economy and foster good will toward the United States after the 1989 military invasion has been ineffective, The Washington Post reported today.
Quoting from the draft of a yearlong study by the General Accounting Office, the paper said analysts had concluded that the aid had had "no significant impact on the economy" or on the underlying causes of political instability in Panama.
The G.A.O. also found that too much money had been spent on bolstering the banking sector after United States officials "overstated" the threat of a post-invasion run on the banks that never materialized, the Post said.

HEADLINE: Colin Cameron, 65, Hawaiian Who Led Pineapple Company

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Colin Campbell Cameron, a descendant of missionaries to Hawaii who became a major resort developer and pineapple industry executive, died on Friday while swimming near his home in Spreckelsville on Maui. He was 65 years old.
He was found unconscious in the ocean, and rescue workers said the apparent cause of death was a heart attack. 
 Mr. Cameron was chairman and president of the Maui Land and Pineapple Company, the largest company on Maui, and president of the Maui Publishing Company, which publishes The Maui News.
His pineapple operations were the third-largest in Hawaii, and he was an early developer of resorts in Kapalua, in the 1960's.
He was also involved in a controversy in the late 1980's over his plans to build a 450-room beachfront hotel at an ancient burial site at Honokahua. After several years of excavating and protests, he agreed to restore the graves and find a new site for the hotel.
Mr. Cameron, a native of Maui, was a descendant of the Baldwins, a family that arrived from New England as Congregational missionaries in 1836 and became one of the Big Five families that dominated Hawaii before World War II.
He graduated from Harvard in 1950 and earned a master's degree in business administration there in 1953. He started work in a family pineapple company and became its executive vice president and general manager, then quit after a dispute with management. He later returned to buy a controlling share.
He was chairman of the Maui Economic Development Board and served on the boards of the Haleakala Ranch Company, the Bank of Hawaii, the Hawaii Electric Company, the High Technology Development Corporation, Bancorp Hawaii, the Hawaii Trust Company, the Lahaina Restoration Foundation and the Hawaii Resort Developers Conference.
He is survived by his wife, the former Pamela Andelin; two sons, Richard and Douglas; two daughters, Frances Ort and Margaret Alvidrez, and several grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Still Reeling From Gulf War, Jordanians Harden Attitudes

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan

 BODY:
Fifteen months after the end of the Persian Gulf war, attitudes here in the Arab country considered crucial to a Middle East peace settlement are hardening against Israel, the West and moderate Arab nations.
The process is being quickened by Jordan's continuing sympathy for Iraq in the face of international criticism during and after the gulf war; a severe economic crisis stemming largely from the war for which most Jordanians blame fellow Arabs and the West, and Jordan's disputes with Arab nations in the gulf. 
 The gulf crisis forced this country to absorb 300,000 Jordanians of Palestinian origin, most of whom were expelled from Kuwait in retaliation for Jordanian and Palestine Liberation Organization support for Iraq. Many of the Palestinians from Kuwait are still stranded here, penniless and jobless.
The blow to the economy of Jordan from this influx has been compounded by a cutoff of Arab aid in retaliation for its pro-Iraqi leanings. The lost aid includes free oil, mostly from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, a subsidy worth $700 million a year.
 
Elite Turning Against U.S.
 Jordan has been further penalized by the United Nations sanctions imposed on Iraq, its largest trading partner, with which trade has been sharply curtailed. Because Washington has taken the lead in imposing the sanctions, many among Jordan's once pro-Western elite are becoming hostile to American policy in the region altogether.
"Most people here feel the United States is applying a double standard of justice," said Rami Khoury, who manages a publishing company. "They see the continuing campaign against Iraq and the new campaign against Libya as an anti-Arab undertaking, not a question of international law."
[Angered by continued warm relations between Jordan and Iraq since the end of the gulf war, the United States said on June 8 that it was putting off indefinitely joint military exercises with the Jordanian Army originally scheduled for May.]
As a result of such tension, there appears to be overwhelming sentiment among Jordanians of all classes and political views to hold out for Palestinian statehood as part of a Middle East peace settlement.
Jordan's four milion people, divided nearly equally between native Jordanians and Palestinians who carry Jordanian citizenship, appear united in the view that there should be a separate Palestinian state in the West Bank, to which Palestinian refugees living here can return.
 
'Economic Suicide'
 "The Israelis call this demographic suicide, but look at it from our side: it is also economic suicide for us to continue to receive huge numbers of populations on short notice," Crown Prince Hassan ibn Talal said in an interview. He was referring to the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who flocked to Jordan to flee Arab-Israeli wars in 1948 and 1967 and those who fled the gulf crisis last year.
Many Palestinians stress that the gulf crisis and its aftermath have deepened convictions among Palestinians and Jordanians on this issue and that Jordan's national unity could not withstand any other outcome of the peace talks.
"After what happened in Kuwait, Palestinians need a Palestinian state as a place where they are not second-class citizens," said Rashida Abeidoh, a Palestinian refugee who settled here in the 1970's. "This will not happen in Jordan or anywhere else. It can only be so in a Palestinian state."
A growing sense of isolation here is clearly evident.
"One byproduct of the gulf war is that the gulf countries and other Arabs have distanced themselves from the Palestinian problem, leaving Jordan and the Palestinians alone to face the situation," said Elsayed Yassin, director of the Arab Thought Forum, a scholarly institute in Amman.
The most popular play in town is a scathing political comedy called "Hello: The New World Order." It has been playing to packed houses in the Stars Theater in downtown Amman every night, delighting audiences with a savage assault on the West and Arab governments and rulers, particularly those of the Arab gulf region and Egypt.
 
The King Is Rebuffed
 Over the last few months, several attempts by King Hussein to repair ties with Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries in the hope of easing the country's isolation have been rebuffed. These slights have pushed even moderate Jordanians to rally around the notion of opposing any reconciliation with the gulf countries.
Many Jordanians and Palestinians stress that their support for King Hussein is premised now on maintaining a helping hand toward Iraq, which is seen as unfairly persecuted.
This attitude first manifested itself in a burst of enthusiasm for President Saddam Hussein of Iraq when he refused to pull his occupying forces from Kuwait, and it seems to be the common creed of various political groups from Muslim Fundamentalists to Arab nationalists to Palestinian groupings.
"That the King stood up to the West and that he refuses to apologize or humiliate himself in front of the gulf rulers enhances his domestic support," said Asaad Abdelrahman, a prominent Palestinian in Jordan who heads a Palestinian scientific and cultural foundation.
In the last few weeks, a new dispute with Saudi Arabia over Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem revived deep antagonism toward the Saudis.
The religious and civil authorities were infuriated by the Saudi move to displace Jordan as custodian of the sites, a move seen as another in a long list of slights.
"Reconciliation?" said Taher al-Masri, a former Prime Minister and member of Parliament. "There is none at the moment. In fact, it is getting worse."

HEADLINE: Crucial Vote for Israelis, but Few Seem Interested

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEVASSERET ZION, Israel, June 13

 BODY:
Through the last 36 years of living and breathing elections since he emigrated to Israel from Spain, Yosef Mosianu never saw a campaign quite as dull as this one.
This has always been a country obsessed with politics, a roiling, fractious place where you could put two people in a room and somehow wind up with three political parties. To most Israelis, a dull election is an oxymoron. 
 But standing the other day at the cash register of his grocery store in this western Jerusalem suburb, Mr. Mosianu shook his head and said he could not get over his neighbors' lack of interest in the June 23 national election.
"Usually, they're running all over the place, handing out leaflets, arguing, fighting,"he said. "I feel nobody wants to talk about it now. The times when you tried to persuade somebody to vote your way are over."
 
Importance Dismissed
 With little time left before the vote, Israeli politicians and professional analysts are stunned by the apathy that voters have shown to what on paper should be one of the more important elections here in many years.
In many ways, the country is at a crossroads, involved as it is in difficult peace talks with its Arab neighbors, worried about ragged relations with the United States and faced with profound demographic change as a result of large-scale immigration from the former Soviet Union.
But those dominant issues have been little discussed as the major parties focus instead on personal attacks, evocations of old triumphs and disasters, and Tarzan-like chest-pounding over who really cares about Israeli security, the implication always being that the other side would sell the country down the river.
Moreover, there is no big-party leader with the commanding presence or tub-thumping speaking style of, say, Menachem Begin, the former Prime Minister who died three months ago.
As a result, signs of indifference are everywhere.
Campaign meetings are so sparsely attended that the parties have started canceling them. Standard features of past years like bumper stickers, banners and posters are scant. Party television commercials, once avidly watched as sources of entertainment if not enlightenment, are said by pollsters to be drawing as little as 20 percent of the viewing audience, which for the first time can divert itself by switching to a new second state channel or to one of 40 cable stations.
 
Final Mass Rallies Abandoned
 So anemic is the voter response that Likud and Labor are planning to abandon the mass rallies in Tel Aviv that are traditional campaign closers organized to put loyalists in a fighting mood.
"Once it was worth dying on the altar of a party -- to go wild, to be arrested and above all to vehemently hate the rival party," wrote Lili Galili, a commentator for the newspaper Haaretz. Now, many Israelis think like Shmuel, an unemployed and disenchanted young man tinkering with his car on a street here.
"The state," he said, "isn't worth voting for."
Regardless of where they normally fall on the political spectrum, many Israelis interviewed at random complain about their leaders in almost identical phrases like "they're all corrupt." In a recent telephone poll for the Israel Democracy Institute, two Israeli university professors, Yitzhak Galnoor and Yohanan Peres, found that 39 percent of the 1,200 people surveyed felt that their voices were not heard in the formation of Government policy.
"This is very pessimistic," Professor Galnoor said.
The disaffection seems to be especially keen on the right, leading many political commentators to wonder if Likud, after 15 years in power, is about to lose because some of its traditional supporters feel it is due for a comeuppance.
 
Likudnik Is 'Fed Up'
 Labor and Mr. Rabin are banking on people like Nomi Shamai, who lives in the poor Jesse Cohen neighborhood of Holon, near Tel Aviv, with five small children in two and a half rooms and money problems stacked up to the ceiling. She is fed up.
"I've always been a Likudnik," Mrs. Shamai said. "But Likud just spins its wheels. If Rabin is a human being, he'll help us."
A staccato of scandals has hardly helped the governing party. A new one burst open this week over allegations that Jewish farmers, including settlers in the occupied Gaza Strip, had embezzled millions of dollars from the Government by submitting deliberately inflated bills from Palestinian contractors who had built greenhouses for the Israelis.
According to the newspaper Hadashot, investigators are looking into the possibility that part of the payments to the contractors ended up in the hands of Palestinian terrorists as a form of protection money.
Opinion polls consistently show Labor to be leading Likud, but they also suggest a virtual dead heat on which of them will be in the better position to form a new government. Since no party in Israel has ever commanded a parliamentary majority on its own, the important question is not so much who winds up in first place but rather who is more likely to find enough coalition partners to control 61 of Parliament's 120 seats.
 
Less Interest, Less Violence
 A commonly held view among political specialists is that neither of the big parties will be able to form a Government on its own, and so inevitably they will turn to each other to reconstitute the "national unity government" that they maintained from 1984 to 1990. It is not an exciting prospect for many Israelis, and that, too, may explain the low-key nature of the campaign.
Not that relative calm is all bad.
Campaigners on the political left are particularly relieved, for in the past they could anticipate violence from supporters of Likud and small far-right parties, who would smash their cars and even drop lighted cigarettes into their opponents' pockets.
"It's a lot milder than anything in the past," said Galia Golan, a Hebrew University professor of political science and a campaigner for the left-wing Meretz Party. "I think the passions aren't there on the right the way they once were."

HEADLINE: Vienna in Bidding War for an Agency of Peace

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VIENNA

 BODY:
Not even many Austrians know that the first woman to win the Noble Peace Prize was a Viennese aristocrat, Baroness Bertha von Suttner, who received the award in 1905 for her book "Lay Down Your Arms."
Her advice was not heeded and World War I broke out nine years later. 
 But Austrians are being reminded of her achievement these days by a glossy brochure their Government is distributing as part of its campaign to get Vienna chosen as home of the only big new international bureaucracy that anyone is currently planning to create.
That will be the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which is to be charged with inspecting the world's chemical industries to insure compliance with the ban on such arms that is expected to be agreed to in Geneva this summer.
A likeness of the Baroness stares out from the brochure's pages superimposed on a picture of the Congress of Vienna, which created the post-Napoleonic European order in 1814, to support Vienna's assertion that it has always been a city of peace and would make a fitting site for the new disarmament organization.
But the prestige of being host to the organization and the extra business that its well-paid international civil servants would bring to the local economy have drawn The Hague and Geneva into the race as well.
And those three cities are now engaged in a bidding war, dangling an array of inducements in front of the governments negotiating the ban who will also decide where to house the new inspectorate.
Vienna's more recent peace credentials include being host city of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the European conventional-arms reduction talks as well as providing a home for the International Atomic Energy Agency, the agency charged with halting the spread of atomic weapons, and several other United Nations agencies.
"My country considers its offer the continuation and logical consequence of it's efforts made over decades to promote peace and arms reductions," said Austria's Foreign Minister, Alois Mock.
But after the oratory comes the cold cash. And Austria is offering to build the new chemical-weapons organization a tower along side the atomic energy agency's headquarters for a peppercorn rent of 1 Austrian Schilling a year -- or about 11 United States cents. But the organization pays the operating costs.
In addition, Vienna promises the future chemical-arms controllers unlimited supplies of Strauss waltzes, Sacher Torte and long summer evenings in the wine gardens of Grinzing, where Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert once drank.
The Netherlands is emphasizing the practical benefits it sees in choosing its capital city of The Hague.
Those include lower living costs than either Vienna or Geneva, more international flights for the chemical-weapon inspectors to jump aboard at nearby Schipol airport as they race off to check reports of cheating, 15 mosques and the Dutch people's linguistic versatility, which makes everyone feel at home.
The Netherlands is offering the organization a new Peace Tower completely free of charge for the first eight years, after which it must pay rent.
In contrast to the vigorous self-promotion by Vienna and The Hague, Geneva seems almost half-hearted in pressing its case, only entering the lists the day before the closing date for offers after many polls had shown most citizens oppose taking in any more international organizations.
A preliminary United Nations report on the three bids describes Geneva's as financially "the most onerous."
Switzerland is offering only $1.7 million toward start-up costs and an inexpensive mortgage for a building.
It is also stricter on administrative questions like work permits for relatives and spouses.
On the other hand, Geneva probably would be the easiest choice on the third world's purse strings, since 137 countries already have diplomatic missions there, compared with 98 in Vienna and 84 in The Hague.

HEADLINE: French Dispute Ended, Canada Goes Fishing

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, June 13

 BODY:
A quarter-century boundary dispute with France has ended with Canada's winning most of the fishing waters it has claimed off southern Newfoundland. The decision was welcomed as the first good news in months for the economically battered Atlantic province.
Officials in Ottawa and St. Johns said that all key areas for cod and other fish, which are critical to the livelihood of the south coast's 80,000 people, are now within the Canadian zone. 
 "Clearly we are very satisfied," said Victor Rabinovitch, Assistant Deputy Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, in a telephone interview from St. Johns. He added that Newfoundlanders had close ties with the small population on the French-owned islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, and that "it should be possible to work out reasonable cooperation with them in the future."
The 25-year dispute over the waters between the two islands and Newfoundland was resolved amicably in a 3-to-2 judgment handed down this week in New York by the International Court of Arbitration. Both sides had agreed to accept the panel's decision as binding.
In Ottawa, the External Affairs Minister, Barbara McDougall, hailed the result as "a good day for Canada and for our relations with France."
A French Government statement called the ruling a step toward better relations in the North Atlantic.
Canada has been at odds with France and other members of the European Community over what it considers excessive European fishing.
To placate Canada, the European Community in an unexpected action last month suspended fishing for cod in the northwest Atlantic, but warned that it might resume fishing in the fall if stocks are deemed to have recovered sufficiently.
Because of severe depletion of stock, Canada drastically reduced cod catch limits in February, causing widespread layoffs among fish-plant workers and trawlermen from the province. Unemployment has been running at over 20 percent, or twice the national average.
In the border quarrel, Canada had wanted France limited to a 12-mile zone around the two islands with no channel to international fishing waters in the Atlantic. France had laid claim to an area the size of Nova Scotia -- four times larger than the 3,607 nautical miles it was finally awarded.
The French zone now includes waters within a 24-mile limit of the two islands in addition to a 10.5-mile-wide corridor running south for 200 miles to international waters.
But Canadian officials said they were heartened by the discovery that most of the major concentrations of cod and other fish are in the newly decreed Canadian waters. They said that only 9 percent of the cod were in the waters awarded to the French.
Now France will have to negotiate an agreement with Canada on the management of fish stocks if it wants to have access to fish in the Canadian waters, Canadian officials said.
The area is not only a rich fishing grounds but may also contain reserves of oil and gas.
The ruling means that a moratorium on issuing oil and gas exploration permits that has been in place since 1967 will now be lifted. International oil companies had expressed interest in the region after the quadrupling of oil prices in the 1970's, but their excitement has waned as prices have subsequently receded.

HEADLINE: COMMENCEMENTS;
Chicago and University Share Outlook, Graduates Are Told

 BODY:
The relationship between the University of Chicago and its city was extolled yesterday at the university's 100th commencement ceremonies.
"It's no mistake that the Chicago school of economics grew up here, with its emphasis on open enterprise," David Bevington, a professor of humanities at the university, said in his address. 
 "The very phenomenon of the Chicago 'school' is a tribute to the University's openness," Professor Bevington said. "The university has encouraged not economic or political conservatism but rather a tolerance for multiple points of view including those that happen not to be politically correct."
"To me, this is quintessentially Chicagoan and reinforces the bond between our university and a city that for so long has contested the rival positions of wealth and social conscience, free enterprise and public responsibility," he said.
The university conferred more than 2,057 degrees this weekend. The graduate degrees were presented in three ceremonies on Friday, and the undergraduate degrees were presented yesterday at the Rockefeller Memorial Chapel on campus. Professor Bevington delivered the convocation address at all four ceremonies.
As a longstanding tradition at the university, honorary degrees are given only for outstanding scholarly achievements and only after lengthy consideration by several committees made up of scholars in the candidate's academic field.
For the centennial, 25 honorary degrees were presented to various scholars in such fields as economics, social science, biology, geochemistry, law, religious history, linguistics, paleoanthropology and astrophysics.
 
Carleton College
 Ceremonies for the 118th commencement of Carleton College were held yesterday at the campus in Northfield, Minn.
The 455 graduating seniors were addressed by the three recipients of honorary doctoral degrees. They were former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, now the chairman of the National Democratic Institute for Public Affairs; Mary-Claire King, a professor of epidemiology and genetics at the University of California at Berkeley; and Peter D. Baird, an Arizona lawyer who in 1966 helped defend Ernesto Miranda in the case that resulted in the "Miranda warning," whereby arrested suspects are entitled to be informed of their rights.
 
Bennington College
 Bennington College awarded bachelor's degrees to 126 graduating seniors yesterday morning, in the college's 57th commencement ceremonies. Two master of fine arts degrees were also conferred.
The previous evening, on the Vermont college's campus lawn, the graduates heard a commencement speech from Harvey Fierstein, the Tony Award winning playwright and actor.
The graduates were also addressed by Mark Spitz, a senior representing the graduates, and by Louise Friedberg Strouse, an alumna from Bennington's first graduating class, in 1936.

HEADLINE: Life Beyond the Subway Is Subject to Its Own Disruptions

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
Even on the best days, Danita Woodley's trip to work oppresses her. She leaves her house in St. Albans, Queens each morning, towing her toddler son, and rides a bus to Jamaica Center, where she catches the J train to her son's baby sitter in Brooklyn and then to work at Public School 290 in East New York.
An hour and a half -- and any number of possibilities for delay. 
 So when five privately operated bus companies that serve 225,000 people in Queens and parts of Brooklyn and the Bronx stopped running during a three-day strike last week, Ms. Woodley felt many things -- inconvenience, frustration and anger -- but surprise at the disruption was not among them.
The strike has underscored the fragility of the peculiar network of buses in Queens that has evolved over the decades into a lifeline for thousands who live beyond the subways' end. It has also aroused a lingering sense of resentment toward the city's mass transit system, which leaves many residents in Queens feeling isolated and underserved.
"I hate it," Ms. Woodley said, as she stood in a bustling throng of commuters at Jamaica Center on Wednesday evening, waiting for her mother to drive her home. But she added, with a scowl of disgust, "It's nothing new. It's always like this."
 
'Not an Easy Commute'
 Jonathan L. Gaska, the district manager of Community Board 14 in the Rockaways, where no buses at all ran during the strike, agreed.
"Even when transportation is working at its best, which is not very often, it is not an easy commute to Manhattan or to other parts of Queens," he said. "We truly are the end of the earth as far as transportation is concerned."
The city's transportation officials say subway and bus service in Queens meets the demand for it. But they acknowledge that the strike underscored two problems: the economic fragility of the privately operated, publicly subsidized bus companies, and the growing popularity of the illegal vans that siphon passengers from the buses.
The strike also gave impetus to the city's consideration of a variety of options that could change the companies' arrangement with the city.
Mass transportation in Queens has evolved as much through the vagaries of history, economics and demographics as by any clear, articulated design.
All across the city, neighborhoods developed as the subway lines stretched toward the city limits early this century. Woodside, Jackson Heights, Corona -- all sprouted along the No. 7 line to the village of Flushing. Rego Park, Forest Hills and Kew Gardens grew along the E and F.
 
Growth Beyond the Lines
 But there the subways stopped, leaving vast neighborhoods to the east to develop without service.
For that reason, large sections Queens, more than any other borough, have had to rely on buses as the only form of public transportation.
The bus lines, like the subways, were at one time all private companies, often fierce competitors. As they began to fold in 1950's, the city gradually took them over until most of their routes were incorporated in 1962 into what became the Transit Authority.
Only seven companies -- four of them in Queens -- remained in private hands. They are the only private companies in the country that provide traditional bus service on local street routes, city officials say.
The companies -- Command Bus Service Inc. in Brooklyn, Liberty Express Lines Inc. and New York Bus Service in the Bronx, and Green Bus Lines Inc., Jamaica Buses Inc., Queens Surface Corporation and Triboro Coach Corporation in Queens -- operate like the Transit Authority's buses, holding franchises on their routes and charging the same fare.
 
City Subsidies Growing
 Since 1974, however, the city has subsidized them, at first almost entirely with Federal funds, but increasingly with the city's own money. In 1980, the city paid $3.9 million, the state $12.8 million and the Federal Government $8.5 million. Last year, the city paid $57.7 million, the state $40.1 million and the Federal Government $4.1 million.
Janet Lanphier, deputy commissioner of the city's Department of Transportation, said that the subsidies basically covered the companies' losses and guaranteed a 3 percent profit (which can increase to as much as 6.3 percent if the companies pass certain standards of timeliness and cleanliness).
Also, the department, using Federal funds, has replaced the entire private bus fleet and the city now owns the companies' buses.
The strike last week by five of the seven companies -- those in Queens and Brooklyn -- came as a result of the increasing financial pressure on the companies, transportation and company officials said.
The strike ended after three days when the companies and the unions reached an agreement that gave the workers 6.5 percent raises over three years and improved benefits.
 
Economics Have Changed
 But even as the commuters returned to their routines, the city is considering a variety of options for dealing with the bus companies, including taking over the buses themselves or turning them over to the Transit Authority.
"Historically, it was cheaper to have the private buses, even with the subsidies," Joseph De Plasco, a spokesman for the Department of Transportation, said. "We think that is less and less the case."
Two other developments are likely to put greater pressure on the private companies and even cause some to go out of business. For one, under the new City Charter, three to six years from now the city will put the companies' franchises up for competitive bidding.
For another, there is continued growth in the illegal livery vans that shadow the bus routes, offering cheaper fares and quicker service. At Jamaica Center during the strike last week, a stream of commuters flowed from the subway terminal and poured into the vans jockeying for position as their drivers shouted a bewildering array of bus routes like carnival barkers.
"It's the chicken and the egg," said William Scarborough, the district manager of Community Board 12 in Jamaica, where scores of illegal vans operate. "They say they can't put more buses out because the vans are cutting into their ridership, but because of the level of service, people are tempted to take the illegal vans."
 
A System Is Lacking
 The vans have been so successful that the Mayor's office has sponsored legislation in Albany to give the city power to regulate the vans and perhaps integrate them into the system.
An integrated system, residents and officials complain, is exactly what has been missing in Queens.
Claire Shulman, the Borough President, said that it sometimes seemed that the mass transit system -- including the highways and railroad -- existed only to shuttle people from Manhattan to Long Island, but nowhere in between.
The Borough President's office has campaigned for more buses, more subways and an expansion of the Long Island Rail Road and has proposed building a light rail system linking the airports and other points in Queens.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Tries to Mend Frayed Relations to L.I.

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FIRE ISLAND, L.I., June 8

 BODY:
As the great engines of government began to throttle down in the far-off State Capitol, there was Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, in a beige rain hat and white paper booties, stalking blobs of renegade oil on a drizzly, storm damaged Long Island beach.
"We can use more people to pick up the blobs," Mr. Cuomo declared, surveying what turned out to be modest pollution on a three-mile stretch of beach. As he walked, he offered an extemporaneous discourse on the legal definition of erosion, culled from a long-remembered legal brief. 
 With dreams of a Presidential bid behind him, a state budget secured and the Legislature getting ready to go home, Mr. Cuomo is stepping up his presence around the state at a time when his popularity -- and that of most other incumbent politicians across the country -- has plummeted.
Nowhere is the challenge he faces greater than on Long Island, a vast expanse of expensive homes, high taxes and economic worries -- a place where many residents wonder whether the American Dream has gone sour, and where Mr. Cuomo more and more is viewed as a frayed and remote figure.
 
Links in Italian Ancestry
 In the past, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has had unusually strong support from this traditionally Republican bastion, where one of four residents is, like Mr. Cuomo, of Italian ancestry. But now polls show that his support has eroded more deeply here than in other parts of the state.
Battles over his cuts in school aid, which have led to higher property taxes in affluent suburbs, and skirmishes with business leaders have led many Long Islanders, including some Democrats, to conclude that the Governor has all but written them off.
Last year, in a budget fight, the Cuomo administration even proposed closing Robert Moses State Park, the site of the oil globs, as an economy move. Amid a public outcry, Mr. Cuomo disavowed the idea.
"There is an enduring sense that too many people have that there is some political bias against Long Island," said James L. Larocca, the president of the Long Island Association, a business group. "I do not believe that is true."
 
The Ghost of Gatsby
 According to this view, Mr. Cuomo, the scion of a poor family from Queens, long viewed the Island as a Gatsby-like refuge for wealth and privilege -- a Republican heartland, where even Democrats backed Mr. Cuomo's opponent, Edward I. Koch, in the 1982 primary that propelled Mr. Cuomo to the governorship.
To the support this, Long Islanders share remarks they attribute to the Governor about Long Island "fat cats" and "polo ponies," and they swap stories about supposed snubs.
In one story -- apparently apocryphal but widely circulated and vehemently denied by Mr. Cuomo's aides -- the Governor was presented with a cake in the shape of the state, and with his first cut, neatly sliced off Long Island.
Paul Townsend, the editor of The Long Island Business News, regularly publishes a series titled "Albany Is Shortchanging Long Island," citing among other evidence a report by an economist at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, that Long Island pays 17 percent of state taxes, but gets only 12 percent of state spending.
 
Plays Down Poll Standings
 Asked about his fall in public standing here, Mr. Cuomo said only that he remains far more popular than many other governors and has the highest approval rating of "anyone in the state." His visit here on Monday included a tour of a renovated theater at Jones Beach and a meeting with a business group.
Mr. Cuomo's aides deny that he has any bias against Long Island. Indeed, they attribute the complaints to Republican legislators searching for a scapegoat.
"His brother lives in Copaigue, and his sister in Williston Park," said Stephen Villano, Mr. Cuomo's New York press spokesman. "He knows what Long Island is like."
But many Long Island officials, Democrats and Republicans alike, said they had detected a resurgence in interest in Long Island only in the last year or so, as Mr. Cuomo suffered in the polls and the Island hit rough economic times.
 
'A Positive Thing'
 Lewis J. Yevoli, a Democratic Supervisor from the town of Oyster Bay, said that Mr. Cuomo may have hit bottom, and that there may have been "some unhappiness with his lack of presence on Long Island."
"There may be some basis in the frustration," Mr. Yevoli said. "But what the Governor is attempting to do is to focus on Long Island and to provide some assistance, and that is a positive thing."
A series of polls by the Marist Institute of Public Opinion, showed that Mr. Cuomo's approval rating on Long Island was as high as in the rest of the state through much of his time in office -- peaking at 77 percent in early 1988. But as his overall ratings faltered, his approval rating on Long Island fell five percentage points below the entire state.
A New York Times/WCBS-TV poll late last year put Mr. Cuomo's approval rating at 30 percent on Long Island, compared with 35 percent in Westchester and Rockland, and 41 percent in New York City. The margin of error ranged from three to five percentage points.
Through most of his term in office, Mr. Cuomo was identified with two issues on Long Island -- closing the Shoreham nuclear power plant and shifting state aid from relatively wealthy school districts to poorer ones.
 
Warring With Business
 Mr. Cuomo's decision to force the closing of the plant because of concerns over evacuation plans, made him a hero with environmentalists, but set off a bitter war with organized business groups. They blamed the closing for rising utility rates that, they say, are choking off new business in the region.
And last year, as the state struggled through deep fiscal problems, $300 million in school aid to Long Island was cut -- a quarter of all state aid to the region.
Mr. Cuomo railed against overpaid school administrators and called for the politically unpopular merging of independent school districts. A Democratic Assemblyman from Long Beach, Harvey Weisenberg, accused the Governor of viewing all of Long Island as "rich and spoiled" and using the children as scapegoats.
But as the recession became the worst on Long Island in a generation and Mr. Cuomo's standing continued to fall, he began a long and sometimes difficult courtship with business leaders. Last year, business groups were furious when, after an outcry from environmentalists, he dropped a proposal to set up a state economic development authority for Long Island.
Finally, Mr. Cuomo went to Long Island last fall and put forward his own economic blueprint -- speeding up some projects, including a fourth lane for the Long Island Expressway, reiterating some old proposals and offering a few new ideas.
 
An Airport in the Pines
 The keystone of the plan was state support for a proposal to expand an airfield in Calverton, L.I., in the midst of the island's fragile pine barrens, into a commercial freight jetport. The project, still under study, has so far succeeded mainly in alienating environmentalists.
A few years back, in what may have been Mr. Cuomo's most poignant connection with Long Islanders, he spent two hours visiting with Carolyn Schiller in her dining room in Levittown, after she wrote him in despair over the high taxes that were driving her from her home.
"I came away with a clearer understanding of the role of the state and a clearer understanding of the pressures the people of Levittown are facing," Mr. Cuomo said after the meeting.
Irving Gerber, the executive director of No More, an antitax group that once counted Mrs. Schiller as a member, said she had since "sold her home" and "moved upstate, where she pays one-third to one-quarter the property taxes."

HEADLINE: GOLF;
Couple's Swing: The Big Easy

BYLINE: By JAIME DIAZ

 BODY:
If Fred Couples wins the 92d United States Open, which begins Thursday at Pebble Beach in California, he will be be completing one of the greatest sustained 12 months of golf in the last 30 years: He would have two major championships, seven North American victories over all, and a run of top-six finishes equal to the most consistent years of Palmer, Nicklaus, Miller and Watson.
But no matter what happens at Pebble, Couples, like every significant player, has already contributed the identifying emblem of his swing, a hitting style that will be remembered as raw, electrifying and elegant all at the same time. 
 From the moment he joined the PGA Tour in 1981, Couples was noticed and envied by his peers for having an unhurried, unencumbered motion that produced both unbelievable power and a tremendous capacity to hit different kinds of shots. Even as he was compiling 10 years of respectable but unexceptional results, Couples was spoken of as a man with a gift.
Of course, the gift alone did not carry Couples to six significant tournament victories in the last year, culminating with the Masters in April. On the contrary, his biggest breakthrough has been in finding a way to score respectably on those inevitable days when the gift is nowhere to be found. Toward that end, he obtained from Tom Watson a metal-headed 3-wood that has become indispensable on tight driving holes, and solidified his short putting.
But amid the flux, Couples's big swing has remained unchanged. It is still essentially the same one he taught himself by belting balls around public courses in his boyhood home of Seattle.
"It's the way a 12-year-old would swing if you handed him a club," said Dave Williams, the former University of Houston golf coach who had Couples on his team from 1978 to 1980. "There's nothing doctored up about Fred's swing. He is just the most natural player I've ever seen."
Sounds wonderful, but not a guarantee of success. There has been a persistent view that golf is an unnatural game in which natural impulses are best restrained through adherence to contrived body positions. Because Couples's freewheeling motion creates some uncharted angles, there are those who believe his reign at the top will be brief.
Purists have a lot of fodder when they consider Couples. Most tour players recoil in horror from an elongated backswing that produces a so-called "flying" right elbow, a dramatic re-routing of the club from an outside to an inside plane, and a right-hand grip so loose that it sometimes comes off the club at impact.
But Couples belongs to the long tradition of self-taught and creative shotmakers that includes Sam Snead, Lee Trevino and Chi Chi Rodriguez. He is decidedly out of step with the tendency among today's players to rely heavily on swing instructors to forge their swings to fit textbook molds.
 
Relaxation and Ease
 From the moment Couples stands up to the ball with a miniumum of fuss or positioning, he sets a theme of relaxation and ease. Both his backswing and forward swing are "quiet," with his head providing a calm fulcrum. But amid such a seemingly peaceful endeavor, Couples releases the clubhead into the ball like a force of nature.
One of Couples's former teammates at Houston, Paul Marchand, a teaching professional, was fascinated by the power and purity of Couples's ball-striking the first time they played together as 18-year-old freshmen. Since 1987, he and another pro, Dick Harmon, have subtly fine-tuned Couples's game, but Marchand still speaks of the swing as something natural and unspoiled.
"I don't want to use the word genius casually, and I know he won't like that word, but I really think that when it comes to golf, that is what Fred is," said Marchand. "He just naturally excels at both the physical and mental part of the game. Mechanically, he's never copied anyone, and mentally, his approach to life, which is to keep things loose and fun, transfers perfectly into golf. I'd say 98 percent of what he's doing now is just Fred.
"The thing is, what Fred is doing in his swing is really classic. Through the whole history of golf instruction, there's the continuing theme of the free swing as the thing that every player strives for. You take the ability to do that and throw in a natural feel for the game, and you get Fred."
To Marchand and others, Couples's talents are grounded in being an exceptional athlete. At a well-proportioned 5 feet 11 inches and 185 pounds, Couples has great physical abilities. Both his father and older brother played minor league baseball, and Couples himself harbored ambitions to play baseball professionally until golf became his passion.
"We would have intramural softball games in college, and no matter how deep the outfielders played, Fred always seemed to hit it over their heads," said Marchand. "In basketball, he had so much range on his jump shot that we called him "Downtown" after Fred Brown. On tour, one of Fred's favorite things is just talking sports on the practice tee. He's just a ballplayer, plain and simple."
What works for Couples probably wouldn't work for someone with less athletic talent. At the same time that he appears so natural, he is decidedly unorthodox.
His grip, with his left hand turned away from the target in an extremely "strong" position, is one that encourages a great deal of hand action in the swing. Most pros use a "weaker" grip to minimize the sometimes capricious action of the hands, particularly under pressure.
 
Open Stance
 Couples also addresses the ball with the imaginary line across his shoulders, hips and feet pointing to the left of his intended target, in contrast to the accepted method of lining up directly at the target. But the "open" stance is also one used by players such as Trevino, Rodriguez, Paul Azinger and Ray Floyd, all of whom say they are able to "see" and swing toward the target better from this position.
On his backswing, Couples starts his club outside the target line along a very upright plane. By the time he gets to the top of his swing, Couples has made a shoulder turn that is exceeded in pro golf perhaps only by John Daly's. Remarkably, in contrast to his massive shoulder turn, Couples's lower-body pivot is mimimal. His left heel stays on the ground and his hip turn is perhaps only half of his shoulder turn. It's an economy of lower-body movement in consistency on the forward swing.
As a result of his enormous upper-body turn, Couples's right elbow at the top of the swing gets away from his body more than is considered ideal. This disconnection of the arms from the body requires a compensatory move on the forward swing. When Couples's timing is off, making the move too late can cause a push to the right -- his most recurrent missed shot. Bringing the arms forward too early can cause a pull or a hook to the left.
"Fred has had the problem of getting too long and loose, and we've gotten him to tighten his turn a little bit," said Marchand. "If he's had a swing thought in the last four or five years, it has been to get a little bit more compact."
While the backswing could have some extraneous movement, Couples's return to the ball is a study in simplicity and efficiency. Whatever technical flaws Couples commits in his backswing, he rectifies them the moment he starts back to the ball.
With a deft turn of his hips toward the target, Couples reroutes the club to inside the target line, dramatically dropping his right elbow into his side. This "figure 8" move is a staple of another great player, Trevino. " 'Cupcakes' does it, too," says Trevino with a satisfied smile, employing his nickname for Couples.
"Once he drops down into that solid position, that's when Fred can really freewheel," said Marchand. "He uses his lower body very efficiently. It's not a big move with his legs, but it's a tremendous leg action exactly at the right place. It's a very quick and well-timed move. It's some kind of violent release, but because Fred is so smooth, it looks real peaceful."
So peaceful, that photos of Couples just past impact have shown his right hand actually coming off the club.
Couples, who actively avoids talking about his swing, said he trusts Marchand and Harmon because they have struck a delicate balance.
"They don't try to change me, they just try to improve what I have," he said. "I work on things on the practice tee, but once I'm on the course, I don't want to be standing over the ball worried about my swing.
"I try to picture the shot, step up and hit it. I don't try to analyze my game while playing. I'm not someone who hits a bad shot, then stands there and tries to figure out what went wrong. I just try to hit the ball solid. It's just timing and coordination. I don't even want to know how to explain it."
It's the same way a lot of geniuses feel.

GRAPHIC: Photos: Fred Couples is hoping to add the U.S. Open to his list of titles. (pg. 1); When he sets up to hit, Couples lines up in an "open" stance, facing slightly left of the target. He starts the club outside the target line. At the top of his swing, Couples's right elbow moves away from his body -- too far away in the opinion of purists. It forces him to compensate on his downswing, sometimes causing him to push the ball to the right. Couples positions himself perfectly as he moves into his downswing. It is efficient, and seemingly effortless, but it is loaded with power. Rotating his hips toward the target, he reroutes the club onto an inside plane, sliding his right elbow into his side. He's so smooth that it often looks as if he's not swinging hard at all. (Steve Szurlej/Golf World)(pg. 2)

HEADLINE: The Physicians' View When Managed Care Comes to Town

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

DATELINE: HUNTINGTON, W.Va.

 BODY:
West Virginians like to say they are "independent cusses," which may be why this is one of the few states where health insurers still have little influence over how a physician conducts his or her practice.
But physicians here, like most across the country, are under growing pressure to trade independence for security. Employers and insurance companies are pressing doctors to join a web of insurer-sponsored medical networks, often called managed-care networks, that try to slow rising health costs by limiting fees and weeding out unnecessary or inappropriate treatments. 
 Half-a-dozen physicians in this quiet Ohio River city of 55,000 people voiced their fears and hopes about plans for a new network at a recent dinner organized by state Blue Cross representatives hoping to persuade them to sign on. Their comments illustrated well the concerns being heard from many of their counterparts nationwide.
The West Virginians seemed reluctant to forfeit professional autonomy, but they recognized that their options are shrinking as more employers offer their workers financial incentives to go to doctors belonging to networks. Employers typically cover 80 percent of the charges by a network doctor and only 60 percent for care by physicians outside the network.
Since not all doctors in most communities are invited to join a network, those selected are under pressure to conform to rules against wasteful or unnecessary practices, or risk being dropped and losing a steady source of patients and income.
Even though they are not members of an insurer network, the Huntington doctors said they were already devoting hours of their own and nurses' time each day to defending their judgment calls against second-guessing by insurance-company nurses and doctors who had never seen their patients and sometimes had little knowledge of their medical specialties.
Dr. Robert A. Hess, a family practitioner, said his nurses often wasted time answering questions from "persons who don't know anything." Dr. Kenneth Wolfe, an ear, nose and throat specialist, added: "I will only talk to doctors. I let my nurse talk to their nurses."
The doctors also said they would resist joining a network that forced them to subtract 10 percent or more from their charges, which they said was the discount taken by some large employers like the CSX Corporation.
Another concern is the practice among some networks of requiring permission from a "gatekeeper" doctor before seeing a specialist. Some networks subtract the specialist's fee from the gatekeeper's income. "It's a financial incentive to not give treatment," Dr. Wolfe said. "Some cases are not going to get needed care."
But the Huntington doctors seemed ready to accept a pre-set schedule of fees and to be paid only for services the insurer deemed appropriate -- if they could help set the charges and guidelines. They also offered to let Blue Cross representatives review their patients' records periodically to look for improper charges, as an alternative to the current time-consuming practice of daily second-guessing by insurance-company nurses.
Mountain State Blue Cross and Blue Shield, based in Charleston, is one of at least three large insurers recruiting doctors for networks in Huntington and in Charleston, the state capital. The Prudential Insurance Company recently started a network for telephone workers at a Bell Atlantic affiliate in Charleston. And the Aetna Life and Casualty Company is planning a network in Huntington and nearby Ashland, Ky.
Mountain State Blue Cross invited the six Huntington doctors, all of whom have large practices, to discuss its plans with Ralph D. Alexander, a senior consultant with Milliman & Robertson, a national actuarial and benefits consulting firm that specializes in starting networks.
Mr. Alexander said the new Blue Cross network would address many of the concerns of physicians. Doctors in the network would help draft "practice standards" to govern their work. Their patients' records would be reviewed periodically to see whether the physicians were conforming to the standards, but the doctors would not have to answer to insurance reviewers before or during treatment, he said.
There would be a schedule of approved fees that, taken as a whole, would not be lower than customary charges in the area now. But the doctors would not be told the amounts that the network will pay before they sign up, Mr. Alexander said later in a telephone interview.
For their part, the doctors denounced wasteful practices, particularly inappropriate diagnostic tests, which they said some patients demand and some doctors willingly perform. "I like the side of it that would get rid of some of the waste," Dr. Wolfe said, citing a patient he had seen who had been given a certain test 30 times. "In 19 years," he said, "no patient of mine ever had that test more than three times."
But some of the physicians were cautious in approaching a project that they all knew could affect their practices and incomes. Dr. Terrence W. Triplett, a family practitioner, said afterward that he was concerned that the network might exclude some local specialists. "Does that mean I would have to refer my patients out of town, to end up having to ship them 50 miles away? I wouldn't like that."
Dr. Triplett said that his overall impression of the Blue Cross concept was positive but that he would like to see the network rules spelled out. "The information given at the meeting was fairly superficial," he said.
Some Huntington doctors were skeptical of the whole idea. Dr. Dennis Burton, president of the Cabell County Medical Society, said in an interview that the state "is a very traditional medical market." Dr. Burton, a neuroradiologist who said he had not been invited to the Blue Cross dinner, added: "West Virginia is in the lower 25 percent of the U.S. in medical costs, so there is not a big incentive to control costs."
But even so, economic forces are pushing doctors to join networks. "I don't know that we, as physicians, are in control of these things," Dr. Triplett said.
Huntington lost 13.9 percent of its population between 1980 and 1990 as jobs dried up in its depressed coal-mining hinterland. And Dr. Subrat Lahary, a surgeon, noted at the Blue Cross dinner that the Federal Government has cut Medicare payments for surgery in half for the elderly, who are at least 30 percent of his patients.
Dr. James S. Todd, executive vice president of the American Medical Association, said most doctors view managed care as "a fact of life."
He added, "It has the potential to improve the quality and effectiveness of care. But in many areas of the country, cost comes before almost everything else."
Some networks have exclusive contracts with particular hospitals, but Mountain State's network will use both of Huntington's large hospitals, thus avoiding inflaming the Blue Cross plan's already tense relations with the state's hospitals.
Mountain State was established by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Ohio, based in Cleveland, after the former Charleston-based Blue Cross plan collapsed in 1990, leaving behind millions of dollars of unpaid bills. Some doctors said that, consequently, they still had "problems with trust" in dealing with the Ohio Blue Cross unit.
In April a Federal jury in Charleston awarded $7.4 million in actual damages for unpaid claims, and $15 million in punitive damages, to 13 West Virginia hospitals that had sued Ohio Blue Cross and Blue Shield, , which is appealing the punitive award. In a related development, the national Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association agreed in February to pay $8.6 million to the hospitals.
Medical networks already cover 77 million Americans. Networks like those in West Virginia, which typically pay doctors a fee for each service, are sometimes called preferred provider organizations. Another type of network, the health maintenance organization, typically pays doctors a pre-set amount for each patient, no matter how much treatment they provide. A growing number of H.M.O.'s, called point-of-service plans, permit patients to go outside the network and still get some of the bill paid, just as preferred providers do.
About half the nation's doctors work with medical networks, which are supposed to slow the steep increases in medical costs, at least for the employers who use them. But the networks have barely gained a foothold in West Virgina, where annual medical costs per employee are about $2,700 in Huntington and $3,000 in Charleston. West Virginia is also one of only four states that do not have a locally based H.M.O. (The others are Alaska, Mississippi and Wyoming.)
Philip Cline, vice president of the J.H. Fletcher & Company, which makes mining equipment, said the company's medical costs for 152 employees averaged $2,150 last year. Employees pay the first $250 of their medical bills each year, after which the company pays all charges.
"Most people in West Virginia are independent cusses," Mr. Cline said. "They want to pick their own doctor."
But few employer health plans are as comprehensive as Fletcher's. One reason for the low figures in the state is that many West Virginians pay a hefty share of their own medical bills. Michael Marra, benefits manager of the Ashland Oil Company, one of the region's largest employers, said it pays about 65 percent of the health-care costs of nonunion workers, or $2,404 per employee in 1991. Ashland employees paid the remaining 35 percent.
The new networks hope to reduce employers' costs even more. "There is going to be a lot more competition in health care," said Tom Wolf, a former hospital board member and businessman in Huntington and Ashland, Ky., who owns a string of McDonald's restaurants and a radio station. "I think doctors are going to be making a lot less money," he said.

HEADLINE: Making Sure a Woman's Place Is in the House

 BODY:
To the Editor:
To have representative numbers of women and minorities in positions of leadership and power in this country, we will need far more than the five new women in the Senate and 20 in the House of Representatives you project in "Steady Local Gains by Women Fuel More Runs for High Office" (The Week in Review, May 24). Even doubling the number of women in Congress would leave that body nearly 90 percent male. 
 Last summer, after nearly 20 years with the Federal Government, I reluctantly left my job in Washington and moved with my family to Madison, Wis., enabling my wife to become director of a new Asian American studies program at the University of Wisconsin. A choice had to be made: my career or hers. Though I've adapted to new situations before, including two years in the Peace Corps, I found the switch to the so-called mommy track surprisingly difficult.
I knew from the outset that job hunting in a new environment during a recession would not be easy. What I didn't anticipate were the discomforts of financial dependence, career uncertainty and underemployment -- the traditional situation of women.
On the other hand, by taking a leap of faith into the backseat, I've learned quite a bit about myself, about my children, whom I now see more, and about my wife, whom I now see less because she's working so hard and joyously. I've also come to realize how important, if painful, it is for people like me to step aside so that others can come to the fore.
Political partnerships, such as that between Hillary and Bill Clinton, are mistakenly perceived as a liability. They should be praised and could be a model for correcting gender inequities in the House and Senate. Certainly, the wives of some incumbents could do at least as competent a job as their husbands, as evidenced by Representative Lindy Boggs.
A second way to equalize the numbers of men and women in Congress rapidly would be for incumbents to identify and act as mentors for like-minded and talented women who would replace them in office. During the transition, the men would be the power behind the throne.
"Ladies First" must become the political chivalry of the 1990's if we are to achieve a truly representative government in the coming decades. Too bad, the men most apt to step aside are just the ones who are already progressive on women and minority issues.

HEADLINE: Mr. Quayle's Lectures, and Leadership

 BODY:
No one disagrees with the values that Vice President Dan Quayle posits for the nation. Of course two devoted parents are better than one; of course children need to learn right from wrong; of course adolescent pregnancy extracts painful, perilous costs.
Then why is the Vice President railing about a so-called "cultural elite" that, he claims, opposes those values? That's election-year politics, a straw man. The question is not, "What are the right values?" It's whether or not Vice President Quayle, and his Administration, have a plan to help poor, broken and desperate families live by the values he rightly cherishes. 
 Nearly a quarter of America's children live in single-parent families, most of them headed by mothers. Nearly half the women who raise children alone receive no child support. That's true even though Federal law requires the Government to help states track down deadbeat fathers and force them to pay up.
Plenty of the people Mr. Quayle derides as "sophisticates" believe the Government has to do better at fulfilling that responsibility. Does Mr. Quayle?
Plenty of people think more states need to develop training programs that include a wide range of services, including education and job training, to help poor mothers get off welfare. Does Mr. Quayle?
Plenty of people believe that women who leave welfare for work should receive transitional day care when they need it, as mandated by Federal law. Does Mr. Quayle?
If he agrees with these value judgments, then he needs to say how he and his Administration want to help these families in distress. These and other highly constructive provisions are all found in the Family Security Act of 1988. But the act currently has only about a quarter of the funds needed for it to work. The Administration has opposed increasing financing.
The states too have been slow to respond, in part because, given the recession, they lack the matching funds required. A proposal circulating in Congress would provide Federal funds even if the states can't match them. This proposal deserves the Administration's support.
The Vice President preaches a good sermon on family values. If he means to act on them, pressing to underwrite the Family Security Act would be a practical way. He could even start tomorrow when he visits New York, home to such a disproportionate share of troubled families. In the process he could demonstrate the difference between lectures and leadership.

HEADLINE: Immigrants Don't Take Jobs of the Poor

 BODY:
To the Editor:
On behalf of the New York State Task Force on New Americans, I take issue with "The Riots: Underclass vs. Immigrants" (Op-Ed, May 15) by Edward N. Luttwak of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Mr. Luttwak scapegoats immigrant communities in Los Angeles for the disorders that followed the verdict in favor of the four police officers who beat the motorist Rodney King. 
 Mr. Luttwak, presenting a view that has been invalidated by most academic studies, argues that immigrants are taking jobs from the American underclass, resulting in social unrest.
The presumption that immigrants take jobs from those in the unskilled underclass has lost support among economists. George Borjas argues in the book "Friends of Strangers" that ratios of immigrants in major metropolitan labor markets have trivial effects on wage rates and no effect on employment. Immigrants, it seems, are doing jobs that American-born workers do not want.
In 1990 the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, the American Immigration Institute and the Hudson Institute released a survey of 38 leading economists, including 7 former Nobel laureates and 20 past presidents of the American Economic Association. The survey concluded that immigration had a very favorable impact on the country's growth and that immigrants did not take American jobs.
Almost two-thirds of those who were surveyed believed that increasing the level of legal immigration would have a favorable impact on the United States standard of living.
The displacement notion was rejected by New York State. Last year, our task force and two Assembly legislative commissions held a six-hour hearing on the impact recent immigration had on the state economy and labor force. Our hearing and subsequent research confirmed that the displacement of poor native workers by immigrants is largely insignificant. A more comprehensive view would support legislation to keep American jobs in the United States and upgrade training for local workers, while maintaining the economic benefits that immigrants contribute to the United States economy.
Perhaps more objectionable is Mr. Luttwak's attempt to cast African-American interests against Latino interests by commenting that black leaders "betray the uppermost interest of their poorest followers in order to coalesce with Hispanic groups that oppose all serious efforts to contain immigration." It is this racial demagogy that creates tensions between ethnic groups and harms the goal of racial and ethnic harmony. It is these tensions that create riots; the issue Mr. Luttwak professes to resolve.
Mr. Luttwak is making a transparent attempt to pit the American poor against the immigrant poor, and the Latino immigrant against the African-American. The reality is that immigrants are not the cause of riots, unemployment or the depression of wages, but have been a blessing to America. We are indeed a nation of immigrants.

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
A Rare Charmer in Griffin's Clothing

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
"I'M talking to this guy from Mercedes," my friend said, "and what he says is that one of these days Saab is going to put out a car that looks like something. When that happens, this guy says, the rest of the manufacturers are going to be in real trouble."
My friend was chuckling when he told me, because he worked for Saab, and he knew there was truth to the comment. A lot of people are pretty sure the Swedish cars are great, but only a certain segment of the population finds the styling sufficiently palatable to go out and buy one. 
 Svenska Aeroplan AB, Saab for short, has been producing odd-looking automobiles ever since the first one rolled off the line in 1949. And, when the 9000 Turbo came into being in 1985, the theme continued. The 9000 was less weird than its siblings, true, but the design was still a bit clunky.
The trunk and roof are high, the nose is low. It is a front-wheel-drive four-door sedan, and there is a close-coupled and bulky look that fails to appeal if what you want is pizazz. So it may be that it took a particular sort of gussying-up to make me take notice.
And that, for at least one model in this year's lineup, is exactly what Saab has done.
The car is the Griffin 9000 special edition, basically a 9000 CD Turbo, but dressed in rare fashion with a leather-and-polished-walnut interior and every creature-cosset known to man.
The company calls the metallic paint Eucalyptus Green, and the interior is mauve, in this case sort of a cross between purple and brown, with the leather seats trimmed in suede. Being a gadget freak, I freely confess to being smitten, but all of the come-on also makes me realize that the 9000 is a truly wonderful car.
And I'll risk it here: The solidity and performance make this the best sports sedan I have ever driven, and the suspension makes it one of the best-riding cars on the road.
Given that, the $42,195 sticker (plus $440 destination charge) is a steal, and -- except for one thing -- that bargain status ought to give pause to the other makers of European luxury cars. That one thing, unfortunately, will be the Griffin's scarcity.
According to the company, it is building one green Griffin for every 620,000 Americans, which translates into total production of only 400 cars. The tester was No. 11, according to the silver plaque on the dash, and owners of these numbered "editions" will get gold cards authorizing free scheduled maintenance for the first three years.
As for the car itself, there are special 16-spoke molded wheels shod with performance tires, a black-and-chrome vinyl band around the midsection, black and chrome bumpers, a standard four-speed automatic transmission, and an intercooled and turbocharged four-cylinder engine that produces 200 horsepower.
For safety, the '92 model has new side-impact protection and increased rigidity, resulting from reinforced partitions in the doorsills, a new front-seat crossmember on each side of the car and a strengthened connection between the sills and the pillar behind the door.
In addition, a driver's air bag is standard and "pretensioners" instantly lock both front seatbelts if impact occurs. Antilock brakes also contribute to safety, but that is to be expected in a car that has everything from heated power sideview mirrors to headlights with their own washers and wipers.
The front buckets are heated, too, of course, and there is a flip-and-slide sunroof, full power equipment including a one-touch driver's window, central locking and a cellular phone that hides under a burled walnut panel in the center console. A nice feature also makes the phone portable, so you can take it with you to use elsewhere.
Beyond the leather-wrapped wheel, the instrument panel is dominated by a 140-mile-an-hour speedometer and a 7,000 r.p.m. tach. The remaining gauges account for gas, temperature and turbo boost, and then there is a trip computer to tell you average speed, instant and average fuel economy, range, outside temperature and estimated time of arrival at your destination.
The audio system is sensational, as well it might be with a 150-watt amplifier, and the compact-disk player has a six-disk changer in the trunk. Unlike most such changers, you can also put a disk into the player itself, which means you don't have to get out of the car to play music that isn't already loaded.
Good as that is, the player creates one of my two small complaints about the Griffin. Everything in the car is so nicely placed and so neatly done, that I don't understand how this happened or why the interior designers didn't notice, but the ashtray, which is good, is above the sound system in the center of the dash. And when it is pulled out, it blocks your view of both radio and CD player.
Spaces for the three elements are the same, and if the ashtray were moved to the bottom the problem wouldn't exist. The only other complaint has to do with placement of the window switches. They are down in the console between the seats and are harder to use there than they would have been had they been located on the driver's door panel.
The buckets are comfortable, power adjustable and with memory settings for three drivers of different sizes. In back, there is an amazing amount of legroom, and the car actually offers more interior space than any other luxury import, compact or otherwise.
There are grab handles for everybody but the driver, and the seatbelts have up-down adjustments to make sure the occupants are secure.
In back, too, the windows go down all the way, something not often found in today's sedans. Should the rear passengers shun the breeze, though, they are accommodated by their own separate air-conditioner.
A remote trunk latch resides in the driver's door, and it opens the high lid to full vertical, exposing a cavern that measures 17.8 cubic feet. The liftover, as low as it can get, is right over the bumper, and a pass-through allows long items such as skis to intrude into the passenger compartment through a panel behind the rear seat's fold-down armrest.
The trunk houses a full-size spare in a well under the floor, and a hideaway on the right side of the compartment holds tools. And, should the weight of the cargo upset the car's balance, the problem is taken care of by an automatic load-leveling system.
The suspension also includes stabilizer bars, front and rear, and there is a computer-driven traction-control system to prevent wheelspin on slippery or otherwise unfriendly roads. However inhospitable the surfaces, though, it's a sure bet the Griffin won't let you know it. You just have to beat those 1-in-620,000 odds.

HEADLINE: A CLOSER LOOK;
Ecology, the Economy and Bush

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE awkward interplay between election-year maneuvering and environmental concerns received plenty of attention last week as President Bush took a hang-tough, us-against-the-world approach toward the Earth Summit. At the same time, a factor that played a huge role behind the scenes was largely ignored. That factor was economics.
The Administration demanded and won a weakened version of a treaty on climate change on the grounds that accepting tough new rules to limit carbon dioxide emissions would hurt economic growth. Similarly, Mr. Bush said he would not sign the biological diversity treaty, which aims to conserve millions of plant and animal species, because the Administration feared it would damage one of the economy's fastest growing sectors: the biotechnology industry. 
 The United States was the only major country to reject the biodiversity treaty, helping turn Mr. Bush into the Darth Vader of the Rio meeting, which was attended by more than 100 heads of state. The United States also found itself isolated when it refused to join Germany's call to strengthen the climate change treaty by requiring nations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Many scientists believe the buildup of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere is contributing to the earth's warming.
 
No Apologies
 In Rio, President Bush proclaimed to the other assembled heads of state: "America's position on environmental protection is second to none, so I did not come here to apologize." But nothing about this trip, it seemed, was auspicious -- certainly not its beginning in Panama, where the stench of tear gas and the echo of gunfire from a nearby demonstration forced the President to flee a pro-American rally before he could address it.
Once he arrived at the summit, a lot of what Mr. Bush said and did was focused on the domestic American economy for domestic political reasons. But in seeming so openly to be carrying water for American industries that seek protection from new environmental restrictions, he ran the risk of unflattering comparisons to his trip to Japan, which turned into an effort to sell American autos and auto parts to a clientele that thinks them inferior.
This was particularly evident when the Americans in Rio tried to paint the Germans and Japanese as Johnny-come-latelies on the environment. In fact, in some areas, particularly carbon dioxide emissions, the Germans have been working for some time to make their industries and those of their neighbors environmentally efficient.
Over the last few months lobbyists from a variety of industries have sent a barrage of letters to President Bush and conveyed their views to Vice President Dan Quayle's Council on Competitiveness, which many critics of the Administration say is calling the shots on environmental policy in this Presidential election year. The German environmental minister, Klaus Topfer, said in an interview in Rio that he hoped the cold war was not being replaced by a North-South rivalry on environmental issues. "I am afraid," he said, "that conservatives in the United States are picking 'ecologism' as their new enemy."
 
Focusing on Growth
 Many American business executives and economists, meanwhile, argue that after the initial costs of investing in new technology are absorbed, reducing emissions would lead to greater energy efficiency and, perhaps, higher profits. The Administration's failure to come to grips with this, say many environmentalists, is typical of the live-for-today approach that marks its policies toward oil consumption, forests and other finite resources.
But at home, Mr. Bush has been lambasted far less for his positions on the environment than for overseeing the slowest three and a half years of growth of any postwar Presidential term. So it did not seem a coincidence that Mr. Bush put his accent on economic growth at the summit.
In rejecting the biodiversity treaty, he said it could weaken patent protections for biotechnology companies and thus discourage research and innovation. "Remove incentives and we will see fewer of the technological advances that help us protect our planet," he said. This approach has a welcome audience in most pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, which say that the treaty would hamper efforts to test and use organisms from the third world for new products, and that its ambiguous language would make them share patents with developing countries.
Many scientists backed the treaty, however, fearing that one-fourth of the planet's species could disappear over 50 years. The treaty aims to get developing countries to do more, like protecting forests, to help species survive. To compensate them, it says countries that provide species used in products shall be provided technology under "most favorable terms."
Sounding the alarm for industry, G. Kirk Raab, president of Genentech, a leading biotechnology company, wrote a letter to President Bush saying, "The vague language relating to 'technology transfer' and equitable sharing appear to be code words for compulsory licensing and other forms of property expropriation."
Pharmaceutical companies regularly screen thousands of tropical plants in search of a cure for cancer and a means of crippling the virus that causes AIDS, for example. Industry officials admit that they cannot quantify how much the treaty might add to costs and reduce research, but they argue that developing new drugs is an uncertain process already, and new costs would only put more pressure on it.
Environmentalists say such opposition is overblown. They interpret the treaty as saying companies do not have to turn over technologies or pay royalties unless they agree to. And they argue that if the Administration really cared about Rio, it could have easily negotiated a few changes in the treaty, or accepted the ambiguous document and negotiated more satisfactory implementing documents in future years.
As for the climate change treaty, the Administration argued that it would be wrong to accept strict regulations to reduce carbon dioxide, noting that many scientists say no one has definitively proved that greenhouse gases are warming the globe. Administration officials also cite studies showing that a program to cut carbon dioxide emissions, perhaps through a tax on fossil fuels, would reduce output. Environmentalists, though, say there is enough evidence linking carbon dioxide to global warming to warrant acting now, and they cite studies showing that cutting carbon emissions could create jobs overall by creating a need for new technology.
 
The Checkbook
 The Administration also expressed some reservations about Agenda 21, the summit's overarching, non-binding, moral document, which sets a blueprint for global environmental protection. But in the end, Mr. Bush signed it. Agenda 21 calls on industrialized countries to vastly increase their aid to the developing world, especially to protect its environment. Mr. Bush said "the day of the open checkbook is over," but he nevertheless pledged $1.4 billion for research on climate change and $150 million to preserve the world's forests, which absorb carbon dioxide.
While it blocked a tougher climate treaty, the Administration boasts that the United States is one of the few countries with an action plan on carbon emissions -- a plan it says will limit the growth of emissions but will not cut them to 1990 levels. "A serious longer-term commitment is going to require a full public policy sea change," said William Cline, an economist for the Institute for International Economics.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on June 14 about logging in the national forests misstated acreages involved in a bill before Congress. The bill would perserve about two million acres of the Montana Rockies as wilderness and release about four millin acres to the Forest Service, which could open it to logging, mining, grazing and other uses.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAPMAIGN: Voters;
Words on Bush's Lips in '88 Now Stick in Voters' Craw

BYLINE: By JEFFREY SCHMALZ

 BODY:
Fed up with politics and politicians, many Americans have seized on one catch phrase as a symbol of their disgust, repeating it over and over like a sarcastic mantra, "Read my lips: No new taxes."
 In interviews with hundreds of voters around the country in the last five months, the slogan, which was the bedrock of George Bush's 1988 campaign for President, was uttered time and again by voters angered not so much that their taxes had increased as by their belief that Mr. Bush had lied to them, breaking not a routine promise but a sacred compact. 
But the political fallout seems to extend far beyond Mr. Bush. If so strong a commitment by the President of the United States cannot be trusted, many people seem to think, then no politician or his word is good. As a result, the President's reversal seems also to have hurt Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the presumed Democratic nominee. And it seems to have helped open the way for a Ross Perot.
 
'Yeah, Right'
 "I'm disgusted with all politicians," said Ron Purkhiser, a 50-year-old welder in Akron, Ohio. "They say one thing, then they go ahead and do the opposite. 'Read my lips: No new taxes.' Yeah, right."
 No one seems more taken aback by the sweep of the reaction than political insiders. After all, they had thought, the pledge not to raise taxes was so obviously impossible to keep that no one took it seriously. But in their public opinion research, they are finding that people took it quite seriously and that they viewed it as the ultimate test of whether a politician's word was any good.
 "I think a lot of us didn't have a sense of just how serious a pledge George Bush had broken," said Peter D. Hart, a longtime Democratic poll taker who is conducting surveys and discussion groups for The Wall Street Journal and NBC News. "Now I'm finding that it's cost him more than anything else and hurt politicians in general. The promise was as close as a politician can come to putting his imprint in Grauman's Chinese Theater. The voters took it as a blood oath. How can a politician take a blood oath to the voters again?"
 Mr. Bush's reversal seems to have most benefited Mr. Perot, who is seen as a nonpolitician and therefore someone who might actually be trustworthy. It has also helped him avoid taking specific stands. People say they find it refreshing when he says he cannot offer specifics because he does not know all the answers. And in any case, they say, they prefer vagueness to lying.
 
Many Sources of Outrage
 "I'd like to see Perot be more specific," Robin Johnson, 30, said in Canoga Park, Calif., after signing a petition to put him on the November ballot. "On the other hand, even when politicians come up with a stand on the issues, you can't believe it." Then to prove her point, she added, " 'Read my lips: No new taxes.' "
 To be sure, many other factors are helping fuel the cynicism about government and politicians. People are frightened about the economy. They sense a nation adrift. They are at once outraged and amused by members of Congress and their check-writing scandal.
 And to be sure, voters are awash in contradictions. Perhaps their biggest source of frustration with government is their sense of gridlock, that nothing is being accomplished. Yet it was to break such a gridlock in budget negotiations that Mr. Bush agreed to the tax increase.
 On the one hand, voters say they want frankness. On the other, they make it almost suicidal for a politician even to open the possibility of a tax increase.
 Just last week, Mr. Perot said he would "absolutely not" raise taxes except in "an incredible emergency," and even then only with an unspecified form of advance clearance from the American people.
 But whatever the arguments or contradictions, Mr. Bush's reversal is a visceral issue for many voters. They think they were lied to, and that's it. And this was no ordinary promise. The slogan made for the most memorable moments of the campaign, with Mr. Bush affirming it time and again.
 
Some See Help for Perot
 "The Congress will push me to raise taxes, and I'll say no," he said in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention on Aug. 18, 1988. "And they'll push, and I'll say no. And they'll push again, and I'll say to them, Read my lips: No new taxes."
 William J. Bennett, who was Mr. Bush's Secretary of Education and director of drug policy, as well as a political adviser, recalled meetings where he and others urged the President not to go back on his promise.
 "There's no question this has helped fuel Perot, has made the people cynical about government," he said. "Some of us fought as hard as we could, at some point beyond the limits of courtesy, for him not to sign on to the tax increase. I spoke to him several times. I said his pledge wasn't just a campaign promise. It WAS the campaign. You can't take the definition of yourself and flip it. I've found that the American people don't have to agree with you. What they want is a straight line, being true to your word."
 Richard G. Darman, the White House budget director, who played an important role in the budget negotiations with Congress, did not return a telephone call seeking comment. But Mr. Bennett and other Republicans familiar with the President's thinking argued that Mr. Bush had not made his promise cynically, that he had genuinely believed that economic growth would make a tax increase unnecessary.
 Two people present at White House political discussions said some of Mr. Bush's political advisers had argued that everyone knew all along that the promise would have to be broken, and that therefore actually breaking it would be politically manageable. They even argued that Mr. Bush might be portrayed as politically courageous for doing so.
 
Taxes Increase for Few
 Around the country -- in shopping malls and union halls, in libraries and bowling alleys -- few people interviewed said their Federal taxes had significantly increased. Most do not even know the specifics of exactly what taxes were raised. But no matter. They know that George Bush broke his word.
 "The politicians say: 'I'll do this. I'll do that,' " said Keith Ditmor, 51, who works in the chassis department of the General Motors plant in Ypsilanti, Mich. "Then they get elected and do nothing. If I had my way, I'd throw out every politician. I would. They're liars. Look at George Bush. 'No new taxes.' "
 In Woodside, Queens, Laura Stevenson, a 27-year-old sales manager, said: "I basically think that once they get into office, they're going to do whatever they want. Look at good old George Bush. He hasn't kept his promise."
 The President announced that he was receptive to a tax increase on June 26, 1990, as part of a broad budget agreement with Congress. The plan, which he later signed into law, raised to 31 percent from 28 percent the income tax rate on adjusted gross incomes over $80,000. In addition, personal exemptions were phased out as income exceeds $100,000. The payroll tax for Medicare, which had been collected on only the first $54,000 of earnings, was extended to earnings of up to $125,000. The gasoline tax was increased by a nickel a gallon. And taxes were raised on alcohol, tobacco and luxury items.
 
'It's Credibility'
 "But don't make the mistake of thinking this is an anti-tax issue," said William Schneider, a political analyst with the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington research group. "That's not what this is about. It's credibility. I ask Perot petition signers, 'Where does he stand?' They say, 'It doesn't matter to me that he has no position, because then he's not going to lie to me.'
 "This election is Perot on one end and Bush and Clinton on the other end, the typical politicians," he continued. "The flip on taxes is a great symbol. It said he can't be relied on. He lies. And other politicians are getting put in the same basket. That's why Clinton's phrase 'I didn't inhale' is so resonant."
 Mr. Bush now says that if he had it to do over again, he would not have agreed to the tax increases. But the damage is already done. Patrick J. Buchanan ran extensive television commercials before the New Hampshire primary that merely showed Mr. Bush speaking over and over, "Read my lips: No new taxes." Surveys of Republicans leaving the polls after primary voting in New Hampshire, Florida and Texas found that 3 in 10 were influenced in their balloting by Mr. Bush's reversal on taxes, with their votes going overwhelmingly to Mr. Buchanan.
 But the overall effect of Mr. Bush's reversal on him and politicians in general is difficult to measure. Many poll takers believe it is responsible for part of the large mistrust of politicians. A New York Times/CBS News survey of 1,530 adults conducted in late April found that 71 percent of people agreed with this statement: "There is practically no connection between what a politician says and what he will do once he gets elected." It is not possible to compare that with sentiment before Mr. Bush's reversal; the question was not previously asked.
 But the voters do not need any poll results. They know what they think.
 "Campaign speeches are all fabrication," said Harold Klein, 68, in Miami Beach. "Bush and his read my lips. We've been lied to for so long."
 In Sherman Oaks, Calif., where people stood 10 and 20 at a time to sign Perot petitions, Michael Banger, 32, wrote his name with a great flourish. Like so many of the signers, he had a look of satisfaction bordering on pride. Or was it revenge? "Read MY lips," he said. "No more politicians."

HEADLINE: Incinerators See Shortages of Trash

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
THE superintendent of the Windham Energy Recovery Facility, Thota S. Naidu, expected 38,000 tons of trash to burn in the incinerator last year. He got 31,000. "I think I know where it went, but I can't say," said Mr. Naidu, who several weeks ago met with officials from the nine northeastern towns under contract to the incinerator, warning them that they must meet their tonnage obligations. "Let's just say it went to the place where they could get rid of it cheapest." At the Windham incinerator, the disposal fee is $86 a ton, and that fee will increase to $98.75 on July 1 because of operating costs. There are landfills in Rhode Island, on the other hand, charging $30 a ton. It was only five years ago that a garbage barge from Islip, N.Y., went on its famous odyssey because it could find no place to unload. Today, the seven regional mass-burn centers in Connecticut find themselves competing for trash.
Rebellion appears to be stirring in those towns that are locked into contracts requiring them to pay twice as much or more than what their neighbors are paying to get rid of trash. "Six years ago I saw this coming," said Donald E. Burdick, the First Selectman of Griswold, which is wrangling with the regional authority over where its trash should go. "I said garbage was going to be like education, the cost was going to go out of control, and it has." 
 Charles L. Atkin, a supervisor in the State Department of Environmental Protection's solid waste unit, said that trash across the state had become a valuable commodity, necessary to fuel the expensive waste-to-energy plants that have been constructed.
Mr. Atkin said the garbage situation has become so bad that some incinerators have had to import trash. When an incinerator in Preston was being tested, for instance, the operator had to bring in garbage from New York.
Mr. Atkin and others attribute the turnaround to several factors, but most significant in everyone's assessment is the poor state of the economy. Simply put, when people don't buy things, they don't throw away things. The state's mandatory recycling law has also taken its toll. Recycling has cut by about 25 percent the material that would otherwise go into the trash, material like paper, cans and bottles that are reused, and yard waste that is composted. So-called source reduction has also had an impact, Mr. Atkin said. People are being more careful to buy things that are not overpackaged, and state and Federal laws are starting to restrict some forms of packaging.
In the late 1980's, some towns signed contracts with regional resource recovery authorities that required them to deliver a certain amount of garbage at a set price each year. If they do not deliver, they still pay. Mr. Atkins said his office has been getting an increasing number of calls from communities that wanted help in making sure trash got to the town-authorized disposal center.
"If it's a question of illegal dumping," Mr. Atkin said, "we can go after the haulers for that, but if they're just bringing it to another town because it's more economical, we really can't get involved. It's a nightmare to try to police it, especially if you have a hauler who's picking up in five towns, that might be sending to different facilities."
At the Bridgeport incinerator, the disposal fee is $65.50 a ton for trash, but member towns often charge commercial haulers even more, to cover the cost of operating transfer stations. In Fairfield, for instance, the fee is $75 a ton to commercial haulers at the town transfer station, and the director of solid waste and recycling, Richard S. Cellar, said he worried that these haulers are going directly to the incinerator, or to disposal centers outside the region, and that Fairfield will not meet its minimum tonnage requirement.
The Town of Fairfield has hired an enforcement officer to check up on haulers. "A few years ago you had to worry about people sneaking in garbage that didn't belong to the town," Mr. Cellar said. "Now you worry they're not bringing you what they should."
 
Drumming Up New Business
 At some incinerators, one method of coping with the shortfall has been to look for new business. Bridgeport recently signed contracts with the towns of Woodbridge, Bethany and West Haven, and is trying to sign Stamford, which has been told to upgrade or shut down its aging trash incinerator. "The closer the plant runs to capacity, the more cost efficient it becomes," Mr. Cellar said.
But in many cases towns are not interested in signing a contract. Today several plants are offering rates that are below the contract rates; at the Preston center, for instance, member towns pay $65 a ton, outsiders pay $55.
That could change quickly if the economy turns around and trash starts to pile up, Mr. Atkin said. In that case, the same incinerators begging for garbage today could have a surplus, and the below-contract rates could climb above negotiated prices. But towns are often tempted to turn away when a hauler brings trash someplace where it will not cost the town as much.
"It's a very significant problem, one we've spent a lot of time with since last November, when we saw it starting to develop," said William R. Darcy, president of the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority, an agency that owns or has financed five of the state's seven regional incinerators.
A few years ago there was no need for enforcement officers, Mr. Darcy said. Today he dispatches between six and eight officers daily to follow trucks and to police the state line for bootleg garbage.
 
No State Governance
 Mr. Darcy said state law does not give his organization the authority to penalize errant haulers. Instead, he notifies the towns and they can decide to suspend the hauler's collection license, levy a fine or take other action.
"We don't want to raise prices to the municipalities because some are not delivering the tonnage required by their contract," Mr. Darcy said.
The situation led to a confrontation in eastern Connecticut, where the Town of Griswold received a $47,000 bill for trash it had not delivered. "They haven't fulfilled their contractual obligation," said Milton Y. Suzich, executive director of the Southeastern Connecticut Regional Resources Recovery Authority in Preston. "They're not doing all they can to insure the town's waste is going to Preston."
Griswold's First Selectman, Mr. Burdick, acknowledged that some residents were taking trash to a landfill in Canterbury, but he said he did not believe the contract required Griswold to track down the offenders. "I hope we don't have to go to court to break the contract, because that's costly and only the lawyers win," Mr. Burdick said. But the regional authority, he said, is "out to create a monopoly, and that's supposed to be against the law."
Mr. Suzich said that about half the other 10 towns under contract to the southeast regional authority were also falling short of what they had promised to deliver, so that instead of 154,000 tons required by contract the authority expected to collect 140,000 tons from the 11 member towns this year.
 
Now Garbage Counts
 But the authority has determined that all the other towns are taking steps to make sure all their trash gets to Preston.
Madison and Guilford, for instance, have sent police officers to check on trash haulers, and have conducted hearings on two haulers whose loads started dropping without explanation. "They're getting the message that they can't bring Madison garbage to another town," said Madison First Selectman Thomas R. Rylander. "We have to protect the garbage that we have." Realizing what he has said, Mr. Rylander laughed, and added wistfully, "It wasn't too long ago towns didn't care where their trash went.
"Just a few years ago nobody wanted garbage," he continued. "All we had were landfills, and we didn't want stuff being put in there, so if they brought it somewhere else we were just as happy. But everybody's looking for garbage now. It's a very popular item."

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY Q & A: THE REV. KATRINA MARTHA SWANSON;
Trying to Preserve an Inner-City Parish

BYLINE: By TINA TRASTER-POLAK

DATELINE: UNION CITY

 BODY:
ST. JOHN'S EPISCOPAL CHURCH here celebrates its 145th anniversary this year, but as is the case in many urban parishes across New Jersey, its long-term survival is uncertain. The migration to the suburbs, waning church attendance and costly maintenance have led to the closing of inner-city churches throughout the state.
The Rev. Katrina Martha Swanson, who has been at St. John's for 13 years, feels the pressure. In an interview, she spoke of the difficulties and rewards of ministering to her congregation, the impact of the recession and unemployment on her parishioners and her concern that urban churches are being sacrificed to the interests of suburban churches. 
 She also discussed the unsuccessful efforts she and her husband, the Rev. George Swanson of Ascension Church in Jersey City, have made over the last four years to rebuild his fire-gutted church. The couple have sued the Episcopal Diocese of Newark to gain control of more than $700,000 in fire insurance money for that purpose.
A spokesman for the diocese said that the diocese had refused to relinquish the money because the rebuilding of a church must have the bishop's consent, and that the small size of Ascension's parish made it difficult to support a parish or a priest. Ascension has since been turned into a mission church.
The daughter of a clergyman, Ms. Swanson was born in Boston 57 years ago and grew up in the mid-Atlantic states. She is a graduate of Radcliffe College and was in the first group of 11 women ordained by the Episcopal Church. She and her husband have two sons and live in Jersey City.
Q. How has Union City changed since you have been here?
A. There are more younger people. Many families with more children. There's a greater mixture of new people. There's a large Cuban population and older Swiss and German immigrants, but there are many more people from South and Central America, the Caribbean, India and the Middle East. The congregation has changed a lot. We have a great increase of people from South and Central America.
Q. You've become known for your bilingual sermons. Do you think the Hispanic people you minister to, and other ethnic groups, feel assimilated into American society?
A. I am not sure people coming to the United States want to be assimilated into the American culture. They want to be citizens. But they are pretty clear about the benefits of their own cultures, for example courtesy and nurturing -- two aspects they don't find in American culture.
Traditionally, first-generation immigrants have come to America and never learned the language. Frequently, they never go out into the ordinary work force. After a generation or two, their families do learn the language. Here in this community we have both first and later generations, and the early generations still have not assimilated.
Q. Is religion alive in Union City?
A. This is one of the saddest things in cities across the nation. People have neglected God. People say, "I'm of this or that faith," and maybe they are saying prayers at home. But they are not joining together to worship God on a regular basis.
Q. Why?
A. In the 1950's when the church was strong, social life was connected with the church. Perhaps our social structure is so mobile, maybe church life along with family life has broken down. Maybe people are more apt to recognize their relationship with God when they need God. That was true in biblical times. People today are too tied up with their own lives to remember that they have a relationship with God.
Q. How active is your congregation?
A. I wasn't here years ago when there was standing room only in this church. Today, the congregation, by and large, has two kinds of people. There's a core group of people who feel that it's part of their lives to be here every Sunday; that's around 40 or 50. And then there's a group of people, also about 50 people, who feel comfortable being in church once a month or quarterly, all of whom feel they come regularly.
Congregation members are very active in their community service, however. For example, they help with the homeless shelter; they run an annual party for elders. They take seriously Jesus's suggestion to do things for others.
Q. How has your church been helping the homeless?
A. When the Marielistas, a group from Cuba, came to Union City in 1980, religious leaders got together to discuss how we could respond to their needs. At that time the Rev. Gary Kugler of St. John's Lutheran in Union City opened up a shelter to house them. Gradually, the shelter was used by other homeless people. For many years the shelter has been begging other parishes to help them. Last year, a group of other church people started the Inter-Religious Fellowship to help St. John's with its overflow of homeless people. We became one of those parishes this winter.
Q. Have recent hard times changed the way people interact with the church?
A. During the last few months people have been greatly affected by unemployment. A lot of people are getting onto my prayer list for finding jobs. Normally people get onto a prayer list when they are sick or have family problems or when someone has died.
I see a lot more asthma, which is caused by the emotional stress of the recession. It may be a symptom of an increasingly polluted environment; people from places like the Caribbean or other countries with cleaner air may find it harder to adapt, but I've seen an overall increase in people who've lived here a long time. People are also hanging onto colds and viruses longer.
I've also seen a lot more depression. People are so stressed out. Running all the time, so terribly busy trying to hold down two or three jobs.
Q. Do your personal views mingle with your priestly practices?
A. Some of my functioning as a priest has my personal signature -- for example, my deep belief in openness and inclusiveness. Some of my important concerns have to be put on the back burner, like inclusive language, language that does not exclude women.
A lot of church language uses male language. It takes a lot of work to change that, and because I work so hard at the bilingual service, delivering the sermon in English and Spanish, I don't have the energy to clean up the language of its male domination.
Q. Are female priests any less accepted than their male counterparts?
A. There are many more female priests today than there were 10 years ago. When I was first ordained in 1974, people would stop and ask me whether I was really a priest. When I moved to Hudson County from Kansas City in 1977, people here really seemed to accept me, to take me for granted. I didn't get many questions.
Interestingly enough, the questions are beginning to start again. I don't whether it's due to some sort of antiwoman backlash. It seems the women's movement is not as well accepted as it was four or five years ago, that women are having a tougher time.
Q. Does being a man rather than a woman cast a different slant on being a priest?
A. Normally I like to avoid that question. Being a priest is an individual thing. I liken it to a snowflake image; each priest has his or her own imprint, his or her own answer to God's call. But male priests are a little more corporate minded, a little bit more ambitious. Women priests are more mission and pastorally oriented.
Q. What's it like being married to a priest?
A. There are pluses and minuses. You really understand one another's life. Having gone from clergy wife to priest partner, though, gave me a much deeper understanding about the priesthood even though I'm fourth generation of a clergy family. The negative side is that we both have tough schedules.
Q. How do you and your husband influence each other?
A. George and I have worked at not competing; rather, we work as partners. We're more apt to seek out each other's ideas. For example, I learned through him that it was inappropriate for a priest to be authoritarian. Now I value the idea of shared ministry. From me, George has borrowed a style of worship. At St. John's we encourage people to add their personal prayers to the liturgy.
Q. How has the controversy over Ascension Church affected your personal views on the politics of the church?
A. The authority of the canon law mandates that a congregation buy fire insurance. The people of Ascension had been buying that over the years. And when the church burned down and they needed to have their fire settlement, their money was stolen from them and a contract was broken.
I was deeply disappointed. The Episcopal Church has meant a great deal to me. I've been so proud that it's been so broad and so democratic and a church where all people participate in decision making. And this action was very, very disappointing.
Q. Why is the diocese reluctant to rebuild Ascension?
A. The diocese looks at the church's survival in terms of a balance sheet; it is a valuable piece of property that can be sold in order to build churches in the suburbs.
The administration often tells horrified stories about Hoboken having three churches within walking distance and the same in Jersey City. People outside cities don't relate to urban living.
Q. Are urban parishes losing their will to survive?
A. The battle will be more quickly lost unless the religious communities in the suburbs feel a bond with us. We need to bring people from the suburbs on board to work with the people in the cities. In the past year we've had people from the suburbs helping out, volunteering with painting projects.
Many religious leaders in the suburbs grew up in places like Union City. If we create a link, then the people of the suburbs will be more apt to vote with us, they will be more willing to protect our integrity, rather than grabbing money for their own needs.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living in: The East Village

BYLINE: By BRET SENFT

 BODY:
LAST month, after eight years uptown, Lisa Russell moved to the East Village. "It's funkier, and a lot more fun," said Ms. Russell, a People magazine writer. "Most of my life was happening here anyway -- there are more cafes, bars, movies."
In a Manhattan sobered by recession and social ills, those in search of a counterculture life style may find its last vestiges here. Rents are high, but food is cheap. And the multicultural mix includes a handful of anarchists serving as guilty conscience to a neighborhood seeking, privately, at least, to improve its qualtity of life without betraying its history of social consciousness. They hold mini-demonstrations and Friday night speakouts. 
 "This neighborhood is an example to the world of standing up against oppression and the police state," said John Potak, one of a group of loosely organized activists who, among other things, have set up a RAGE-ON! (Revolt Against Gentrification Erasing Our Neighborhood) hot line -- 713-5743 -- for details of coming demonstrations.
The area has known quieter days. It began as a farm, or bouwerie -- embracing what is now Fourth Avenue to the East River, 17th to Fifth Street -- bought by Peter Stuyvesant from the Dutch West India Company in 1651. To the east, the property's salt marsh was filled in and in 1834 became Tompkins Square Park.
Part of Stuyvesant's property in 1799 became the site of St. Marks-in-the-Bowery, a landmark church at Second Avenue and 10th Street that was damaged by fire in 1978 and restored in 1984.
Poor immigrants, initially Irish and German, flooded the area in the 1850's, spurring tenement construction. Italians and Eastern European Jews arrived in the early 1900's, Poles and Ukrainians after World War II, Puerto Ricans in the late 1940's, beatniks in the 50's and artists from Greenwich Village in the 60's.
Beth Flusser and her husband, Richard, moved to Stuyvesant Street 32 years ago and raised two daughters. "Back then it was an affordable place to live, with a 'new frontier' quality about it," she said. "There was no commercial activity."
Then came gentrification. Suzanne Wasserman, on Stuyvesant Street from 1982 to 1988, has since moved to Stuyvesant Town. "There were incredible changes during those years," she said. "It went from very quiet, all Ukrainian little shops, to yuppie restaurants everywhere and heavy traffic."
Changes include new, upscale Italian restaurants on East Fourth Street: Frutti di Mare, La Strada and Cucina di Pesce. Stingy Lulu's Luncheonette, a 24-hour, 50's-style diner, opened last month at 129 St. Mark's Place. Then there are the Indian restaurants -- about two dozen on Sixth Street between First and Second Avenues, with some on the avenues.
PERFORMANCE venues include La Mama E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street; Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue; the Living Theater, 272 East Third Street, and two multiplex theaters: Loew's Village Theater VII, 66 Third Avenue, and Village East City Cinemas, 189 Second Avenue.
A thriving gallery scene in the mid-80's all but vanished by the end of the decade. Pat Hearn, for one, had galleries on East Sixth and East Ninth from 1984 to 1989, but is now onWooster Street.
"The galleries needed more storage and office space," she said. "And the rents kept escalating -- for the price of a small storefront, people went to Broadway between Houston and Broome, for example, to buildings renovated specifically for galleries."
The neighborhood's funkiness seems to include graffiti-covered buildings, garbage strewn by the homeless collecting redeemables and heavy drug traffic.
"This is where people come to get drugs," said Rick Carmen, chairman of Community Board 3. "And for many without other economic opportunities, it is our neighborhood's biggest employer."
Yet the allure of bohemian decadence keeps housing prices up. The building stock includes "more five-story walk-ups than anything else," said Gary Brenner of City Estate Agency. Rents in these and in brownstones and renovated spaces, he said, are $600 to $1,000 a month for studios, $750 to $1,400 for one-bedrooms and $1,200 to $1,800 for two-bedrooms.
Luxury buildings went up during the 1980's. But more than half the owners in the Christodora House, an 85-unit condominium on Avenue B overlooking the park, have rented their spaces, waiting out the recession before selling, according to James Roman, sales manager for the Halstead Property Company, a brokerage, and Red Square, a high-rise rental at 250 East Houston built in the late 80's, "still has empty apartments and a steady turnover."
St. Mark's Real Estate, which handles rent-stabilized apartments, said studios fetch $600 to $700 and two-bedrooms, $1,000 to $1,100.
Tompkins Square Park, where there have been summer riots since 1988, was closed last June for renovation and is scheduled to reopen late in July. Its bandshell is being replaced by a portable stage.
"It was obsolete, an eyesore, a symbol for the anarchist-thugs," said Councilman Antonio Pagan, who also seeks limits to the area's social services burden, most recently, a proposed shelter on East Seventh Street for people with AIDS.
The Lower East Side has one-third of all such services citywide, many in the East Village, said Mr. Pagan, adding: "Such an over-concentration, in any neighborhood, is not healthy."
But Armando Perez, co-founder and chairman of Charas/El Bohio community cultural organization at 605 East Ninth Street, said that "we have a tremendous problem with drugs and AIDS here" and that "to just say 'No more social services' just doesn't make sense."
EIGHT of School District 1's 22 schools are in the East Village, several with new alternative programs. P.S. 19 has been designated a Chancellor's Model School Project, adding a new 7th and 8th grade, with new focus on math, science, technology and humanities. Last September, the Neighborhood School at P.S. 63 began pre-K to first-grade instruction, building towards six grades; its nontraditional, alternative program eschews textbooks for a child-centered curriculum designed by its director and teachers, with parental participation.
The Earth School at P.S. 64, will have an integrated curriculum with emphasis on ecology. Junior High 60 will expand to become the district's only high school, modeled after the Coalition of Essential Schools, a nationwide program using portfolios to assess student progress, a lower teacher-student ratio, with smaller groups built on themes of learning.
The district has been given Federal and corporate funds for programs, including $1.5 million in computer equipment from I.B.M. for P.S. 19's new 7th and 8th grades. The Parent Developmental Center at P.S. 63 provides training in school-based management (parent-staff collaboration on education decisions).
LaSalle Academy at 44 East Second Street and Notre Dame School, 104 St. Mark's Place, are, respectively, Roman Catholic boys' and girls' high schools, with competitive entrance exams. St. George's Academy, 215 East Sixth Street, has 200 students in its K-12 school, serving parish children of the adjacent St. George's Ukrainian Catholic Church.
There are also three Roman Catholic parochial elementary schools: St. Brigid's, at 185 East Seventh Street; Mary Help of Christians, 435 East 11th, and Immaculate Conception, 419 East 13th.
Almost 90 abandoned city-owned buildings east of Avenue A, long controversial among housing advocates, "have all been identified" for homesteading, cross-subsidy and rehabilitation programs, said Valerie Jo Bradley, an assistant commmissioner of the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development.
In addition there are several hundred squatters in about 20 other abandoned city-owned buildings for which there are no programs in sight.
"We live in fear of eviction," said Art Cabrera, an unemployed construction worker who with fellow squatters renovated a building on East 10th Street. "But we will defend our homes. We have nowhere else to go."

HEADLINE: How Columbia Weathers the Economic Storm

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Short of Money, Columbia Weighs How Best to Change" (front page, May 25) leaves mistaken impressions about the results of steps Columbia University is taking to meet the financial pressures it shares with many colleges and universities.
Columbia will not dip into endowment principal to cover the planned operating deficit for next year. Temporarily we will spend more of the return of the endowment to cover critical needs in the operating budget, while we plan for complete elimination of the deficit in 1994-95. The endowment will continue to grow. 
 The university will not have to trim $72 million more from its projected $1 billion expenditures to achieve its budget target for 1993-94. Half that amount will be realized by additional revenues and expense reductions next year that will carry forward. Our experience demonstrates that we can achieve the remainder of the saving needed without damage to academic programs. And even after these savings are realized, the budget will still grow each year.
The addition next fall of 110 students to an enrollment of 19,300 hardly qualifies as crowding. The maximum class size for the core curriculum courses in Columbia College will continue to be 22. The 60 new graduate students enrolling in master's degree programs will add 7 students on average to approximately 8 of the 27 departments in the Graduate School, which has a total enrollment of 3,200.
Students admitted to the college with financial aid this fall face no uncertainty about its continuation the following year, contrary to your assertion. They will receive the financial assistance required to complete their undergraduate degrees.
The size of the nearly 500-member arts and sciences faculty will be reduced by less than 2 percent next year, not 8.6 percent, as part of a planned reduction following earlier increased faculty hiring in anticipation of retirements now occurring.
The arts and sciences receive nearly $35 million annually in publicly sponsored project funds exceeded in the university only by the medical school. Also, $30.5 million supports research work at the university's Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory. You incorrectly assert that the arts and sciences receive few research grants.

HEADLINE: THE EARTH SUMMIT;
Battle in Rio: The Day After
Friends and Foes Agree On a Sharper Sentinel

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 14

 BODY:
The Earth Summit, which wound up with predictable fanfare today, has given the world its first real glimpse of the kind of global diplomacy that is becoming possible now that the the cold war is over. But the conference has also shown how difficult negotiating worldwide solutions to worldwide problems is likely to be.
For decades East-West tensions made it hard to take joint approaches to challenges affecting all the world's nations, including environmental problems like threats to the atmosphere, population growth, and international migration. 
 Yet over the last 10 days, the Earth Summit brought together the greatest number of world leaders that have ever assembled with a single aim -- in this case to seek a global agreement that shifts mankind's search for economic betterment onto a more environmentally sound plane by asking developing countries to industrialize in environmentally sustainable ways.
 
A Time of Promise
 They came together at a time of extraordinary promise in world affairs, after the demise of Communism, which has reordered priorities not only in the industrialized world but also in the developing world.
The summit agreement that was approved today has already been denounced by some groups as weak -- as "business as usual" and "a failure to set a new direction for life on earth," as Friends of the Earth called it today. And countries of the developing South have expressed disappointment that the industrialized North was not more generous.
But for many, the accord is important mainly as the start of a process that could eventually change the way the world approaches the challenge of fostering economic growth in the Southern Hemisphere, shifting the basis of all new aid and investment toward environmental responsibility.
 
A Watchdog Group
 Just as the world has set up international agencies to insure respect for human rights and to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, so the Earth Summit created a new Sustainable Development Commission to monitor the world's compliance with the promises it made at Rio.
"The Rio Conference does not end at Rio," the Brazilian President, Fernando Collor de Mello, said today.
The strength of public interest in the meeting -- 10,000 private environmentalists and 8,000 journalists attended -- suggests that governments will not be allowed to forget what they have begun.
But the Earth Summit also showed that tackling global challenges in today's world means forging agreement among some 180 countries that are no longer focused on the East-West divide, and who may regard the United States as no more than one player among many.
 
Re-examining the U.N.
 The Soviet Union's disintegration has allowed the United States to dominate the United Nations Security Council in recent years, using it to achieve its aims in many areas and arousing fears of a "unipolar" world under effective American domination.
But the Earth Summit was a reminder that outside the field of peace and security, the United Nations lacks other small, powerful bodies like the Security Council that the United States, as the remaining superpower, can work through to achieve its ends.
The United Nations also remains the only international framework that exists for approaching global challenges, however, and its machinery often requires what can be a slow, fumbling search for consensus among its nearly 200 members.
The agreement sought by the Earth Summit participants on the environment and development, as on any other global issue, was intended to be a bargain between North and South that both halves would find in their interests.
The developing countries hoped to pick up some of the economic gains they tried but failed to win in the 1970's when they called for a new world economic order. This time, they tried to persuade the North to eradicate poverty in return for cleaner growth in the South.
The Northern governments, it was hoped, would agree to this because of the strength of environmentalist groups back home and because their own efforts to fight pollution would come to little in the end if the Southern countries did not follow suit.
But the initial outcome fell short of Southern expectations largely because of the growing rifts within Northern and Southern camps.
Opposition of countries like Malaysia and India to any binding commitment on preserving the world's forests meant that the South could not offer the one concession that might have encouraged the Bush Administration to take the Earth Summit more seriously.
Similarly, the genuine fear among small island states that they will soon be flooded if temperatures rise left the developing world divided over the urgency of curbing "greenhouse" gas emissions. Ultimately it meant that the Southern countries could not hold the global-warming convention hostage to Northern concessions.
In a complete change of position since the first oil-price shock of the 1970's, when Saudi Arabia and other oil exporters told the industrialized countries that they would have to reduce consumption if they wanted prices to decline, major oil exporters are now fighting the world consensus in favor of saving energy.
 
Issues That Cross Divide
 Some concerns cut across the North-South divide. Efforts to promote family planning as the key to population control, higher living standards and reduced pressure on the environment ran into opposition from a curious coalition, including the Vatican, conservative Islamic nations and some feminists who argued that male-dominated governments should not interfere with women's lives.
At the conference, the United States made no attempt to exercise the kind of leadership it had shown at a world environment meeting 20 years earlier in Stockholm that brought environmental concerns into sharper focus on the diplomatic agenda.
Instead the Bush Administration appeared divided and paralyzed by ideology and political concerns, reinforcing the perception that in an election year it is incapable of facing up to new foreign policy challenges.
Among industrialized countries, Japan alone appeared ready to offer the South meaningful new aid, but it made no attempt to lead the Northern bloc. Indeed, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, citing a legislative debate at home about whether to commit troops to international peacekeepiung forces, did not even attend the Earth Summit.
As a result the United States, Britain and the Germany successfully resisted being drawn into any specific commitments on new aid, despite pressure from France and the Scandinavians to be more generous.
 
East Bloc's Argument
 Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union infuriated the South by asserting that their "transitional" status as countries on the road to capitalism justified special aid.
And Germany confirmed the Southern countries' worst fears by citing its commitment to helping the former Communist countries of Eastern Europe as a major reason that it could not do more for the South.
The collapse of Communism, widely seen as ushering in a new era of more constructive international diplomacy, has thus ended up by pushing North and South even further apart.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
With Independent Candidate, The Race Just Won't Let Up

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
The clear lesson so far about a three-way Presidential campaign is that there are no intermissions. So the ordinarily languid month of June, falling between the end of the primaries and the beginning of the conventions, has become a season of elbowing, risk-taking and struggling for position.
As recently as a few weeks ago, the campaigns of President Bush and Bill Clinton seemed utterly confounded by the dynamics of this race, paralyzed by a web of conflicting advice. Now, prodded by the continued strength of Ross Perot, they are making some decisions and taking some actions. 
 The Bush campaign, unable to reverse the President's slide in the polls, is trying at least to stabilize his political condition by making Mr. Perot seem a frightening, unacceptable alternative.
 
Giving Clinton an Edge
 The Clinton campaign, after weeks of drift, is trying to regain the public's attention by giving the Governor of Arkansas an edge and defining him as something more than just another politician: to wit, a Democratic nominee willing to go before the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition and chide it for racial insensitivity -- toward whites.
The Perot campaign, now leading in polls, is trying to let Perot be Perot, while fending off the follow-up questions that his advisers know he is not yet ready for, the questions that could break his can-do spell.
Those who doubt the intensity of this race, five months before Election Day, need only listen to the escalating series of attacks on Mr. Perot now coming from the President's surrogates.
 
Labels for Perot
 Rich Bond, the Republican Party's national chairman, pointed the way last week in a speech to a convention of bakers. "If you want a vague, mysterious and authoritarian figure," he said, with "the risk factor that will be involved in making that choice for this nation and this world over the next four years, then your man is Ross Perot."
The buzzwords, apparently emerging from campaign research on Mr. Perot's vulnerabilities, are "temperamental," "unknown," and determined to operate "outside the rules." Charles Black, a senior adviser to the campaign, described the effort simply, "Make him risky."
It is a method used against past Democratic nominees with considerable success, particularly Michael S. Dukakis in 1988. By the end of that campaign, the Massachusetts Governor had been cast as a shadowy liberal who was itching to dismantle America's defenses.
Moreover, this strategy dovetails with the belief of top Bush advisers, including the campaign chairman, Robert M. Teeter, that this election will still, in the end, come down to trust and leadership traits, which they argue gives even a damaged President an invaluable edge.
 
Staying Above It All
 While the surrogates are busy slashing and burning, Mr. Bush is trying to stay above it all. With a series of foreign policy events beginning with last week's trip to Panama and Rio de Janeiro, the Bush campaign hoped to highlight his image as a steady commander in chief. Last week's trip was less than triumphant, beginning with the near tear-gassing of Mr. Bush in Panama, but his aides have high hopes for his meeting here this week with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia.
By the end of the week, Mr. Bush will embark on a campaign trip to California and Texas, two states that were once anchors of Republican Presidential victories, but are now considered Perot territory. He will pay careful attention to the party's base, with a foray expected into Orange County, Calif.
Mr. Black has made it clear in recent days that the Bush campaign will try to chip away at Mr. Perot's coalition along ideological lines, through issues like his support for abortion rights and his opposition to the war in the Persian Gulf; Texas is considered ripe for that approach.
Bush aides say they believe they can solidify the Republican base this summer without paying a price for it among the swing voters in the center this fall. "What we're doing right now doesn't hurt us a whit," asserted one strategist.
 
Clinton Showing Independence
 But many Democrats argue that the Republicans may be painting themselves into a corner by highlighting their social agenda, like their opposition to legalized abortion.
There are voices in the Democratic Party urging Mr. Clinton to move left and focus similar attention on his party's base. The most prominent, perhaps, is the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who used his Rainbow Coalition meeting this weekend to make the case for the new arithmetic of a three-way race, which he said could make victory possible by galvanizing and turning out the Democratic core voter.
Mr. Clinton countered with a speech on the "remarkable commonality" between the group's goals and his own, like the need to reinvest in the nation's economy and its people. But he also sought to signal his independence, chiding the group for giving a platform to Sister Souljah, a rap performer who was quoted by The Washington Post as saying after the riot in Los Angeles, "If black people kill black people every day, why not have a week and kill white poeple?" Mr. Jackson was tight with anger after Mr. Clinton's remarks.
Ordinarily, a Democratic nominee would use his pre-convention period to mollify Mr. Jackson, not provoke him. But Mr. Clinton is in a different context. He is trying to reclaim the themes and the image he began with in this campaign, when he succeeded in casting himself as a new kind of Democrat, gutsy enough to break with the old orthodoxies, not beholden to conventional politics and willing to stand up to powerful constituents, like Mr. Jackson.
 
Emphasis on Economics
 This, of course, is the very position now held by the independent, Mr. Perot.
Allies said Mr. Clinton would also be refocusing his often meandering message with a single-minded emphasis on economics, which his strategists say will become the driving issue of this campaign. (Part of this refocusing is simply self-discipline on the part of a candidate who never met a policy question he didn't like.)
A new economic strategy will be announced sometime in the next several days, and it is expected to highlight Mr. Clinton's commitment to "investing in people" through measures like new college loans and national apprenticeship programs. It is also expected to have a strong populist tone.
Mr. Clinton also plans a remarkable siege of television appearances over the next 10 days, from two hours on the CBS News program "This Morning" on Monday to an hour on MTV on Tuesday and Larry King's call-in program on the Cable News Network on Thursday.
The Democrats, whose candidate is third in the polls, have not embarked on a campaign of attacking Mr. Perot with the intensity the Republicans have shown. Mr. Clinton himself occasionally criticizes Mr. Perot, although the Governor's campaign clearly prefers to let the Republicans handle that duty. There are strategic reasons for this: Mr. Clinton badly needs to improve his image, and going on the attack against a rival, immediately after a bitter primary season, is not the best way to do it. Moreover, the Clinton campaign clearly views much of Mr. Perot's support as an anti-Bush vote that could, eventually, come its way.
 
Advantage to Perot
 Mr. Perot, in many ways, has the easiest hand to play over the coming days. He will embark this week on a swing through California, Colorado and Massachusetts for a series of rallies with supporters in the drive to put him on the November ballot.
He continues to be the focus of investigative articles and persistent questions about just where he stands on issues.
A woman telephone caller named Roberta gave him a fairly tough grilling last week on the NBC News's "Today" program, highlighting the vast difference between the idea of wanting to reduce the Federal budget deficit and the unpleasant reality it would involve, like cuts in benefit programs for senior citizens.
Still, Mr. Perot has retained his appeal. "Clearly, he's making mistakes in terms of inconsistencies and the like, but he's still coming across as different and someone who will change things," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic poll-taker. "It's as if Perot is operating in one sphere and Bush and Clinton are operating in a completely different sphere."
James Squires, Mr. Perot's press secretary, assails Republican attacks on Mr. Perot as "deliberate calculations to raise the specter of fear." Whether there is an cumulative effect to the attacks, the unflattering news articles and the wiggling around issues on live television, is still unclear. For now, though, Mr. Perot keeps his rivals scrambling.

HEADLINE: Japan Takes On the Mob, and the Mob Fights Back

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 12

 BODY:
With hit movies like "Tampopo" and "A Taxing Woman," Juzo Itami has developed a knack for making this serious-minded nation laugh at its quirks. But when he decided to join a growing national debate with a new film about fending off the mob, satire gave way to a real drama.
On May 22, just a week after the new movie opened, three men attacked Mr. Itami in front of his house, slashing him repeatedly in the face, neck and left hand, leaving him alive but disfigured. Suddenly, the film director's bandaged face became a gruesome symbol of a kind of war the Japanese have been waging recently against the yakuza, or mob. 
 The problem is not the existence of the yakuza. For decades the gangsters have swaggered openly through Japanese society, movies and popular novels, street samurai with neck-to-knee tattoos and, often, sliced off little fingers, the result of a well-known punishment for violating the rules. The police admit the yakuza operated under an unspoken pact: as long as they conducted their illegal activities on the fringes of society, using a minimum of violence, they would be left alone. Occasionally they were used to suppress Communists and other radicals.
But the remarkable economic boom of the 1980's shattered the old understanding by giving the yakuza a great deal more wealth and audacity. As a growing series of scandals have shown, the yakuza have moved from smoky gambling dens to the stock market, from rackets on construction sites to the real estate development industry, from ties with the neighborhood police to influence over national politicians.
The Government has responded with an unparalleled attack on the yakuza. The police have been armed with tough new laws, staging a series of raids for weapons and encouraging citizens' groups to use the courts to throw gangsters out of their neighborhoods. The police have even set up a hot line in some areas to help yakuza defectors re-enter legitimate life.
The fight has increasingly become not just an issue of law and order, but of the Japanese self-image as an unusually harmonious people, free of the kind of violence that is most often identified with the United States.
And the yakuza have fought back -- with lawsuits, street protests and, when they felt it was necessary, violence. One gangster threatened that the yakuza would stop buying the Cadillacs and Mercedes Benzes they favor in an effort to bring foreign pressure on the Japanese Government. The confrontation has grown increasingly tense, and the stakes are now high for both sides.
Even though the gangs engage in illegal activities, from extortion and gambling to prostitution and drug dealing, it is not illegal to be a member of the yakuza or to do business with them.
One of the new law's most bitter opponents is Tokutaro Takayama, the imposing boss of the Aizu Kotetsu, a yakuza group based in Kyoto with more than 2,000 members. Mr. Takayama explained during an interview in a hospital room in Kyoto, where he was recovering from an auto accident, that his group had filed suit seeking the repeal of the law because it denied them the right to earn a living.
 
'Create a Police State'
 "You may think it sounds funny for an outlaw to claim a law is unconstitutional, but this law is different from any they've used in the past," he said, surrounded by more than a dozen of his gang's members, several of whom were shy a joint of their little fingers. "What people don't realize is that it will affect everyone. The intention of the police is to control everything and to create a police state."
Mr. Takayama said he had not seen Mr. Itami's new movie, "Minbo no Onna," which could be translated roughly as "Woman Mob Fighter." It is about a wisecracking lawyer who shows the staff of a luxury hotel how to fend off yakuza extortion schemes, including the ploy of surreptitiously slipping a huge bug into a plate of food, then complaining of contamination.
But he was short on sympathy for the attack on Mr. Itami and suggested that the public should pay heed.
"Nobody would put a cockroach in a restaurant's food like that," Mr. Takayama said. "Itami was just out to make money without any consideration of human rights. If he's really not just in it for the money, he should let people see the movie for free."
The police say there are 88,600 yakuza who belong to 3,300 different groups, with most affiliated in some fashion with one of the three major gangs. The police estimate their annual income at $10 billion, but admit the figure could easily be several times that. Increasingly, they run legitimate businesses, often in real estate, construction and golf course development.
One reason they have been able to expand so fast is because of their links with the police. These ties were a product, in part, of the chaos that followed Japan's defeat in World War II.
 
A Shadow Security Force
 The police realized they simply were not strong enough to control the forces unleashed by the country's devastation, particularly the once-violent Communist movement. The yakuza were used as a shadow police force to throttle leftists. In return, they were left alone, as long as they left ordinary Japanese alone.
"We haven't used our power only for doing bad things," insisted Mr. Takayama. "I myself personally wounded the head of the local Communist Party after the police asked us for help."
But the tacit agreement has meant that traditionally the yakuza are not nearly as violent as the Mafia and have a record of killing fewer people.
Today, Japan is concerned less with Communists than with economic growth. And so, too, the yakuza have evolved, slipping from the fringes to the mainstream of Japanese business and political life.
 
Ills, Social and Economic
 "At one time the gangsters represented a social disease," said Seiji Iishiba, a lawyer who once headed the organized-crime unit of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police, and the author of the book that was the basis for Mr. Itami's movie. "But now it's an economic disease. In the high-growth era, the gangs grew at the same pace as the economy by targeting not individuals, but businesses. They are part of civil society."
Hiroshi Ishizuki, director of the anti-mob division of the National Police Agency, said, "Looking at all the scandals we've had, people were becoming worried that if they allowed the yakuza to continue any further, the entire legitimate society would be swallowed up by them."
Some legal experts are calling for even tougher measures that would give the police the ability to confiscate the huge assets the yakuza have accumulated, a more important instrument of the gangsters' power these days than knives and guns. That, however, has raised the question of whether the Government really has the stomach to confront the depth of yakuza influence.
"A tougher law would touch the core of the Japanese economy," warned Setsuo Miyazawa, a professor of criminology at Kobe University.
In business, organized crime ties go to the top of some major corporations. Last year All Nippon Airways, Japan's second-largest airline, confirmed reports that its incoming and departing chairmen had accepted an invitation to an expensive dinner with what they knew to be a group of gangsters specializing in corporate extortion.
It has been disclosed that Sagawa Kyubin, one of Japan's largest trucking concerns, provided loans or loan guarantees totaling some $2.5 billion to Susumu Ishii, boss of a major yakuza group until he died last year. He reportedly used this hoard for a series of big investments. Nomura Securities and Nikko Securities lent Mr. Ishii more than $200 million and executed a major stock trading scheme for him.
Mr. Ishii is also reported to have used a series of front companies to make several millions of dollars in investments in the United States several years ago.
What most shocked people here is that his group apparently succeeded in hiring Prescott Bush, brother of President Bush, as a consultant. Mr. Bush has denied he was aware of the reputed yakuza connections of his Japanese business partners, and there has been no suggestion he violated any laws.
Under the new anti-mob law, which took effect in March, the police can officially designate yakuza as "boryokudan," or violent organized crime groups. Part of the criteria is the number of members with criminal records, with the percentage set at a little more than 4 percent.
Once a group is so designated, the police can inspect their offices without warrants and ban them from their club houses during gang wars.
Mr. Ishizuki of the police agency responded to criticisms of the potential scope of the law by saying it had been crafted with care so that it could only be used against boryokudan. But some legal experts say it could be abused and applied to other groups, like political organizations.
Some left-wing militants have criminal records because of their involvement in illegal demonstrations or violent resistance to Government policies. There is concern that if the police arrested and charged more of these political campaigners, their groups could then be designated boryokudan under the law and harassed.
 
Law Is Faulted
 Mr. Iishiba said the law's two crucial shortcomings are that it does not permit the police to confiscate ill-gotten gains from the gangs, and that it does not include a witness protection program. Yakuza intimidation of potential witnesses works, he said, because the police are so ineffective. For instance, the police had said they were providing Mr. Itami with special protection before his assault.
"The new law is aimed at the lower-level people," said Professor Miyazawa. "It doesn't affect the most senior people in the organizations, who have control over these huge amounts of money. That's a big weakness."

HEADLINE: NORTH KOREA PLAN ON FUELING A-BOMB MAY BE CONFIRMED

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
Administration officials say that the first experts to conduct a detailed survey of North Korea's nuclear installations have confirmed that the country has been building a large plutonium-reprocessing plant, but that the inspectors have so far found no evidence that enough nuclear material has been produced to make an atomic bomb.
The preliminary findings, expected to be announced in Vienna at a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency that begins on Monday, cast doubt on the Central Intelligence Agency's worst-case estimates that the hard-line Communist Government could become a nuclear power within a few months to a year. 
 But some United States military and intelligence officials, deeply suspicious of North Korea's sudden willingness to allow inspectors into its most secret installations, say there is circumstantial evidence to suggest that another "pilot plant" for extracting plutonium has been hidden underground or in the mountains.
 
Insists on Alternatives
 A detailed report circulated before the Vienna meeting by Hans Blix, the director general of the atomic energy agency, says senior North Korean officials told him they would abandon their reprocessing effort if Japan, South Korea or Western nations would assure a supply of nuclear fuel and technology that would allow North Korea to build civilian nuclear power plants.
The report, which had a limited distribution but is not classified, is based on Mr. Blix's trip to Pyongyang in May to make arrangements for the first visits by the expert inspectors.
United States officials say that North Korea's offer amounts to a virtual reversal of the nation's earlier vociferous contention that it is not building a major reprocessing plant, which would allow it to convert nuclear waste into bomb-grade material. Under an agreement with South Korea reached late last year, both countries agreed never to build reprocessing plants.
 
'The Pressure Is Working'
 "They are moving toward an admission that they have had a bomb project under way, but they are trying to save face," said a senior Defense Department official deeply involved in monitoring the North Korean effort. "It tells you that the pressure is working."
North Korea's nuclear program has been a source of growing concern to the United States. Especially worrisome is the nuclear complex at Yongbyon, about 60 miles north of Pyongyang. Suspicions that North Korea is trying to develop atomic weapons have centered on the vast installation, which includes several nuclear reactors and buildings that military experts say are part of a weapons program.
Although there is general agreement among United States experts that Yongbyon houses a reprocessing plant, an essential element for making bomb fuel, there is still considerable disagreement over North Korea's intentions and how far the project has come. Officials here say many more inspections are needed before the guesswork is removed from the analysis.
Given the extremely closed nature of North Korean society, United States officials say that apart from satellite images, until now very little intelligence has been available on the true scope of the North Korean nuclear effort. The experts' confirmation of the reprocessing project was based on inspection of the Yongbyon complex.
 
Alternative Supplies
 United States officials, trying to create incentives for President Kim Il Sung of North Korea to abandon the suspected bomb project, say they have not dismissed the reported offer to abandon the reprocessing project. But if North Korea received any technology for its nuclear-energy program, it would likely come either from Seoul or Tokyo, and only in exchange for regular inspections of all nuclear installations.
North Korea's surprise offer to halt its program is further evidence that Mr. Kim's Government, out of money and suddenly without help from its Chinese and Soviet allies, is beginning to abandon its philosophy of juche, or self-reliance.
Japan, South Korea and the United States have ruled out any large-scale trade or economic aid until North Korea's suspected bomb program is halted and Pyongyang agrees to extensive inspections.
"We don't want to play by the rules we did in Iraq before the gulf war," an intelligence official involved in assessing the North Korean program said this week, referring to how Iraqi officials kept their nuclear program out of view of inspectors. "The North Koreans have looked at what Iraq did, and I am sure they are convinced they can do it better."
 
Is There Fuel Enough?
 One of the mysteries surrounding the North Korean program is whether its nuclear power plants have created enough waste fuel for a weapons project. According to United States officials, North Korea turned over to the international agency this month detailed records of the plants.
After several months of study, the agency's experts will probably be able to estimate how much plutonium was in waste fuel created by the plants. If that does not accord with the waste they find in North Korea, it will be an indication that some of the spent fuel has been diverted.
The international agency's first full inspection of North Korea's installations ended last week, and the agency has said nothing publicly about its findings. But United States officials say the team visited only the sites that North Korea had declared part of its nuclear program.
The visit included Yongbyon, which Mr. Blix also briefly toured in May. Soon after the visit he said the site would be termed a reprocessing plant in the West "if it were in operation and complete."
Mr. Blix, however, is not a technical expert, so the United States was awaiting the report of the team that has just emerged from North Korea. The inspectors reportedly found the Yongbyon complex empty, save for equipment for some small experiments.
"It was even less complete than Blix had thought," said a United States official with close contacts to Mr. Blix's agency.
Some United States and Japanese officials believe that the installation, which North Korean officials call a "radiochemical" or "radiological" laboratory, was opened to inspection because the country's efforts to reprocess nuclear waste on a large scale have failed. According to that interpretation, Mr. Kim's Government has run out of money to make further attempts to fabricate bomb fuel, and has decided to use site inspections as a bargaining chip to get Western economic aid.
But officials in the Defense Department and the intelligence agencies, who have taken a considerably more alarmed view of the project, say the empty building is simply another piece of evidence that the nuclear effort has been moved elsewhere.
 
Going From Little to Big
 In his report, Mr. Blix himself raises that possibility, expressing doubt that North Korea would move directly from small-scale experiments to a huge, risky reprocessing installation to produce plutonium in volume.
"The timetable of the operations and the industrial logic seemed to suggest that a small pilot plant should have preceded the 'radiological laboratory,' " he wrote. "The jump from a modest radiochemistry experiment laboratory" to a full reprocessing plant, he added, "is hard to understand for anyone whose thinking is formed by international experience." But he added that "the existence of any such pilot plant was categorically denied" by North Korea.
Given North Korea's extensive experience at building deep tunnels -- many have been discovered underneath the heavily mined demilitarized zone between North and South Korea -- few doubt that such an installation could be easily hidden.
Although Washington has said explicitly that the North Koreans are well along the path toward nuclear weapons, Mr. Blix and his staff have been far more circumspect. In his report this week, Mr. Blix is expected to simply describe the installations the inspectors have seen and not draw any conclusion about North Korea's intentions.
According to United States officials, the inspectors, who left North Korea on June 6, placed seals on some nuclear supplies and installed surveillance equipment in an effort to insure that no materials they saw are diverted to other uses.

HEADLINE: TOWARD THE WASHINGTON SUMMIT;
Yeltsin, Due in U.S. Today, Is Still Complex and Elusive

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 14

 BODY:
It is a year now since Boris N. Yeltsin became the first elected President of Russia, and the reviews are as diverse as the extraordinary chain of events that transformed him from the maverick leader of a Soviet republic to the master of the Kremlin.
Though he travels widely and gives frequent interviews, the burly, 61-year-old President remains a complex and elusive figure. He is still enormously popular at home, but abroad his stiff and formal demeanor have denied him the celebrity status enjoyed by his archrival, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
 
In Wake of Gorbachev
 That contrast is certain to hang over Mr. Yeltsin's visit to the United States starting Monday, which comes in the wake of Mr. Gorbachev's successful voyage. The trip is Mr. Yeltsin's second to the United States as Russia's President and his first full-dress summit meeting, and he will have the rare honor of addressing a joint meeting of Congress. 
 His immediate intent will be to convince a skeptical Washington of the value of backing his reforms, and to reach an arms accord. But the greater goal Mr. Yeltsin has set himself is to establish that he and a sovereign Russia are the true successors to the mantle of a great power, and therefore to a special relationship with the United States.
However hard he tries, Americans are likely to remain divided over the man who has been cast by history to attempt the formidable task of guiding a battered and bankrupt nation to democracy and a free market.
His own compatriots are hardly of one mind about him. Political commentators speak of three identifiable Yeltsins: the Communist apparatchik from Sverdlovsk, the politician who became the gadfly of perestroika, and the radical reformer who has made it his goal to wrench Russia on the way to democracy and a free market.
All three are critical to Mr. Yeltsin's unusual appeal and force. It was the fact that he rose through the ranks that gave strength to his opposition stance and credibility to his calls for reform.
Much of Mr. Yeltsin's authority still derives from his path to power -- his fall from Communist grace in 1987, his defiant return through democratic elections and his open opposition to Mr. Gorbachev, his election as Russia's President and his triumphant resistance to the August putsch from atop a tank.
 
Democracy and the Economy
 But it is by their deeds, and not their legends, that politicians are ultimately judged, and for Mr. Yeltsin the immediate yardstick is his effort to guide Russia toward a market economy and democracy.
He is universally respected for showing the courage to begin the painful transition that had been promised from the outset of perestroika, but always postponed. But the program designed by his chief economist, First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, is assailed by the right for hurting the poor, by the left for falling short of the mark, and by the West for wavering.
 
Skeptics Cite Economic Failures
 Skeptics argue that the sum total of the reform so far has been to free prices and to withhold billions in salaries and internal transactions, and that the Government has failed to protect the needy, to begin any significant privatization or to free the price of oil, a step on which the International Monetary Fund places particular emphasis.
"Let's be fair," wrote Leonid Skoptsov in the newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta. "All the conclusions about how progressive and reformist the Gaidar team is are made on the exclusive basis of written and spoken declarations by members of the team about how progressive and reformist they are."
The International Monetary Fund, for its part, is delaying an agreement worth $24 billion to Mr. Yeltsin because of his reluctance to free the price of oil.
But his defenders point out that when Mr. Yeltsin was elected a year ago, Russia was still a part of the Soviet Union with an economy and foreign policy that were controlled largely by the Soviet Government. It was only last fall that his Government began shaping its own economic program, and it was only in January -- when the Soviet state and the economy lay in ruins -- that the reforms were started.
 
Sources of Resistance
 These, furthermore, have come up against resistance from threatened industries and from Parliament, which retains a strong contingent of Communists and has so far blocked moves toward private property.
In an interview last week, Mr. Yeltsin said of the reforms: "For seven years, there was only talk on this issue, but nobody could dare take unpopular measures because this was bound to be followed by a drop in the popularity rating of the President. We launched economic reforms Jan. 2 in conditions of deep economic crisis. Nonetheless we dared do this. Nobody promised that the reforms would give serious results as early as May or June; this is not serious."
The very fact that a nation reared under a paternalistic dictatorship has swallowed the huge price increases without major social disruption, as many had feared, is viewed by many as a success in itself.
 
Authoritarianism Is Criticized
 On the political front, Mr. Yeltsin has been praised for rejecting the repressive props of the Communist Government, the all-controlling party and the political police, and for introducing the first rudiments of lawful government. But he is criticized for adopting authoritarian methods and for allowing the malignancies of the past to fester on -- the corruption, the privileges, the bloated bureaucracy.
Most of the senior officials around Mr. Yeltsin are former members of the Communist Party, including some who were high-ranking officials. The huge government bureaucracy is still largely drawn from the former apparat, and Mr. Yeltsin's subordinates have shown little restraint in parceling out the country houses, resorts and cars of the old regime. Few if any of the liberal democrats who rallied behind Mr. Yeltsin have found their way onto his team.
There are those who argue -- as Mr. Yeltsin's former press secretary, Pavel Voshchanov, does in a bitter article in the current Komsomolskaya Pravda -- that nothing has really changed.
"Our yearning to present last August as a victory of democracy is, alas, only self-delusion," Mr. Voshchanov wrote, scanning the cast of former apparatchiks who have stayed in place. "For the greater part, Communists were defeated by the same Communists, only ones who cast off the external attributes of their party. The criminal party is gone, but the criminal state it created remains."
It is true that Mr. Yeltsin and his Government have not moved quickly to reduce the K.G.B. or the military, which remain formidable and threatening. Yet there is no evidence that Mr. Yeltsin has treated these structures as anything but an inherited burden, which will take time to dismantle.
And if former Communists prevail in the administration, that is because the overwhelming majority of managers, experts and officials in the past had no choice but to join the party, whatever their private tenets.
Answering some of the more frequent criticisms of Mr. Yeltsin, Vitaly Tretyakov, editor of the paper Nezavisimaya Gazeta, argued recently that Mr. Yeltsin was responsible neither for the collapse of the Soviet Union, nor for the fact that the structures, patterns and psychology formed over 70 years cannot be eradicated in one day. "One must take into account that for me, as for a majority of the residents of the former Soviet Union, 'U.S.S.R.' is not uniquely a dirty word," he said.
 
Fear Is Gone; Criticism Is Possible
 And however large or small the changes from the past, a critical difference is that the fear and the obsessive secrecy, the mandatory double-think and phony triumphalism are gone. The credit does not go to Mr. Yeltsin alone, but if he is the brunt of considerable criticism, one reason is simply that such criticism has become possible.
A year in command has inevitably eroded some of Mr. Yeltsin's luster. The liberal urban intelligentsia, never entirely at ease with the peasant's son from the Ural Mountains, has become more openly disdainful of his stiff demeanor and his alleged inclination for the occasional tipple. One-time allies like Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoi and the Speaker of Parliament, Ruslan Khasbulatov, have formed rival political camps.
Abroad, Mr. Yeltsin has won respect for his swift assumption of the Soviet Union's responsibilities, including its nuclear arsenal, and for pursuing Mr. Gorbachev's foreign policy of cooperation with the West. Yet he has never come close to Mr. Gorbachev's magic, and his missions abroad have remained stiff and formal.
That is especially strange given that at home the Russian President has achieved a popularity deeper than anything Mr. Gorbachev ever attracted.
The contrast is the subject of considerable discussion, especially in the context of the open rivalry between the two men. To a foreigner, Mr. Gorbachev may seem more polished and friendly. To a Russian, Mr. Yeltsin is terse and candid where Mr. Gorbachev was long-winded and pedantic; Mr. Yeltsin is independent where Mr. Gorbachev sought consensus.
 
His Popularity A Strong Force
 Whatever the reasons, public opinion polls have tracked popular support for Mr. Yeltsin even through the throes of political upheaval and soaring prices. He may never match the 91 percent approval he had after his resistance to the coup in August, but a full two-thirds of the Russians polled say they still want him to carry on, against 17 percent who want him out.
For good or for bad, Mr. Yeltsin's personal popularity has probably been the strongest single force behind the reforms of the last year. One fact rarely appreciated by the West is that there is no strong constituency for economic reform -- not workers or peasants, who became accustomed to earning little and working even less; not managers, who were taught to meet targets, not to compete; not entrepreneurs, who have gotten fat speculating on shortages; not the military or the bureaucracy, and not even the intelligentsia, which always thought itself above commercial considerations.
 
Favorable Assessments
 It is inevitable in this context that Mr. Yeltsin has made compromises and adjustments, that he has come under criticism and attack. But in the welter of commentaries marking Mr. Yeltsin's first year as President, the predominant conclusion was that he had done well, even surprisingly well.
"Politics is the art of the possible, and the achievement of Yeltsin is that he wants to carry out reforms precisely in this country, accepting Russia as she is: with a drunk and hungry proletariat, with bribe-taking bureaucrats, with the eternal habit of the whip, with an intelligentsia in opposition to the Lord Himself," Vadim Poegli wrote in the paper Moskovsky Komsomolets."

HEADLINE: TOWARD THE WASHINGTON SUMMIT;
Arms and Aid the Main Topics at Bush-Yeltsin Talks

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
When President Boris N. Yeltsin and President Bush meet on Tuesday, they will seek to cement Washington's budding friendship with the new Russian nation in two ways: through arms control and by bolstering Russia's economic reforms.
Both efforts are needed, Administration officials say, because if Russia's painful transition to a Western-style market economy fails, a fledgling democracy could be snuffed out and a hostile dictator could come to power. 
 Seeking foreign policy gains in a difficult election year, Mr. Bush hopes to sign a far-reaching agreement with Mr. Yeltsin that would make sharp cuts in the two nations' stocks of nuclear warheads.
For his part, Mr. Yeltsin hopes to use his first full-blown summit meeting with Mr. Bush to usher in a new era in relations between the two cold-war adversaries. Hungry for Western aid, the Russian President is seeking to establish regular, even warm, relations. But he is in a delicate position because he does not want to concede too much in the arms talks, lest Russian hard-liners skewer him for knuckling under to Washington.
 
Signs of Compromise
 American and Russian officials said Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev had showed some willingness in talks on Friday in London to retreat from long-held positions that have blocked an agreement.
The United States agreed, those officials said, to give up its demand to eliminate all of Russia's land-based, multiple-warhead missiles, which American officials contend would present the greatest threat in any nuclear confrontation. And the Russians, they said, agreed to large cuts in these missiles, including the SS-18, which has a range of about 7,000 miles.
While the Bush Administration is eager to engage Russia as a friend through the arms pact and through plans to cooperate in space, it had also hoped to deliver a multibillion-dollar aid package in time for Mr. Yeltsin's visit. Administration officials admit to a little embarrassment over their failure to push the package through Congress, which is reluctant to approve billions of dollars in foreign aid in an election year when funds are short for domestic programs.
 Mr. Yeltsin is not only meeting with President Bush, on Tuesday and Wednesday, but will also address a joint meeting of Congress. Administration officials say they hope Mr. Yeltsin's visit and the address on Wednesday will spur Congress to finally approve Washington's part of a $24 billion aid package that the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations pledged to Russia in April.
Like Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Bush has a difficult balance to strike in their meeting. If Mr. Bush pushes Mr. Yeltsin too hard on arms control or economic reform it could weaken the Russian President at home, undercutting their mutual goal of insuring that Russia's new democracy survives and remains friendly. Last week Mr. Yeltsin accused the United States of trying to take advantage of an economically weakened Russia in the arms talks.
Mr. Yeltsin and his delegation are expected to sign about a dozen accords, including agreements to establish an early warning center on ballistic missiles, to cooperate in the rescue of each other's astronauts and to create a Russian-American Business Council to promote investment in Russia. The two sides will also discuss how to use $400 million earmarked by Congress for dismantling Russian warheads.
Administration officials say the economic reforms that Mr. Yeltsin has undertaken since January, which have included removing most price controls, slashing the budget deficit, and laying the groundwork for large-scale privatization, are tough and courageous. But they worry that in recent weeks his Government has retreated somewhat from its plan for rapid change.
Plans to print more money, extend more credit to inefficient enterprises and delay the freeing of oil prices could slow down efforts to stabilize Russia's teetering economy, they say. They also worry that Mr. Yeltsin has added some conservatives from the military-industrial complex to his Cabinet.
 
Possible Delay in Aid
 Mr. Yeltsin's Government has long said it hopes to sign a pivotal agreement with the International Monetary Fund by July 1, a move that would unblock billions of dollars in planned aid for Russia. But several Administration and monetary fund officials said some snags in Russia's reform program could delay that agreement for a month or two.
"In terms of the basic course of reform, things continue to move favorably and very rapidly," said Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economics professor who is advising Russia on the reforms. "They started with a collapsing economy, huge budget deficit, pent-up inflationary pressures, and intense shortages, and while they have made a lot of progress, there are still some major issues that have to be resolved."
Russian officials say that signing an accord with the monetary fund is crucial because more than half of the $24 billion aid package will not begin flowing until such an agreement is in force. Although Russia has already received about $4 billion from the package, the accord would open the door to about $4 billion in loans from the I.M.F., World Bank and other institutions, a $6 billion fund to stabilize the ruble, and $2.5 billion in deferral of debt payments.
Mr. Yeltsin's economic reforms are aggravating the crisis that was bequeathed to him by seven decades of Communist rule. Industrial output is expected to plunge by 24 percent this year and farm output by 12 percent, while prices are expected to soar more than tenfold.
 
I.M.F. Seeks Assurances
 Officials on both sides of the negotiations said that fund officials want answers in several areas before reaching an agreement. Because the fund is planning a ruble stabilization fund, it wants Moscow to explain how it intends to coordinate monetary policy with the other former Soviet republics that plan to continue using the ruble.
 The fund wants Moscow to agree to bring its budget deficit down, and will ask the Russians how soon they will remove price controls on oil and how big a tax they will place on oil, which would also narrow the deficit.
 "We're very concerned that the fiscal deficit has been moving in the wrong direction, that monetary discipline has been insufficient and that the inflation rate continues to be way too high," a senior Administration official said. "The most important thing is to get a high-quality program in place. That's more important than the exact timing."

HEADLINE: Symbol of Cuba Sparking Battle In a Florida City

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KEY WEST, Fla., June 12

 BODY:
Amid the bars, T-shirt emporiums, souvenir stands and pornography shops that line Duval Street, the main downtown street of this cluttered resort town, the San Carlos Patriotic and Educational Institute easily stands apart. Dignified, elegant and glowing from a just-completed $3 million restoration, the building is a monument to Key West's past, one of the few still standing.
Founded in 1871 by Cuban tobacco workers in Key West's cigar factories who had helped establish the city, the San Carlos Institute is to Cubans what Independence Hall is to Americans. It was from the veranda of the institute 100 years ago that an exiled Jose Marti began the Cuban revolution that led to the end of Spanish rule and insured Key West a place of honor in the history textbooks read by generations of Cuban schoolchildren. Today it sponsors concerts, lectures and exhibitions of Cuban art that honor figures like Carlos Manuel de Cespedes, who led a revolt in 1868 that nearly brought independence from Spain. The institute is also planning to open a library and to offer classes in English, Spanish and history. 
 "To the Cuban people, this is the most sacred place outside Cuba, a place that triggers deep emotions because it is the cradle of Cuban independence," said Rafael A. Penalver Jr., a Miami lawyer who is president of the institute and led the eight-year effort to restore the building.
Barely six months after reopening, however, the institute finds itself fighting the city government as it fought the Spanish Government a century ago. The City of Key West, arguing that the San Carlos Institute is not a historical and cultural center but just another commercial enterprise, is demanding $35,194 in fees. It has threatened to close the institute if the bill is not paid after the city commission's vote on an appeal of the fee, which is scheduled for Tuesday.
 
Cubans See Power Struggle
 The city authorities say their decision is based on an ordinance that requires new buildings to pay a onetime fee to help provide the expanded sewer, electrical and water systems required by Key West's recent growth. But Mr. Penalver says he thinks the city's demand is a smoke screen.
"There are some power groups in Key West that would like the San Carlos to be a shopping center, a theater or anything else that would serve the economic interests of their hotels and businesses," he said. "It is a power structure that has excluded Cubans, and its members see the San Carlos as an important element in this city that they do not yet control."
Supporters of the institute say the $35,000 would be difficult to raise after having asked donors for the $3 million for the renovation, and they say the fee is discriminatory. Key West has provided fee exemptions to several other buildings of historical significance that are run by not-for-profit organizations.
"They've already exempted the old city hall, the lighthouse, the wrecker's museum and a church, so why not us?" asked Jose Garrido, the owner of a marine electronic business who is president of the local Rotary Club.
But three of Key West's five commissioners have expressed opposition to granting the institute such a waiver, complaining that the building is run by Mr. Penalver and other Cuban Americans from Miami, as well as citing the city's need for the fees.
 
Court Battle With City
 To Cuban-Americans here, the dispute brings back unpleasant memories of the mid-1980's, when the building lay in ruins and the Historic Key West Preservation Board, a government body, became its custodian and tried to lease it to a company that planned to convert it into a restaurant and theater. Local Cubans fought the action in the courts and, when a local judge ruled in favor of developers, headed off the project with a lobbying effort that won the support of the Governor and State Legislature.
The Mayor of Key West, Dennis Wardlow, said through his secretary that he would not comment on the dispute about the fees. But other city officials denied that they were acting on behalf of any commercial interests.
"There's no merit to that premise whatsoever," said the City Manager, Felix Cooper, arguing that the city merely wanted to assure that "a large facility built for public use and that charges money" paid its fair share. He did say that if the San Carlos did not pay it would be operating illegally, and there was "a possibility the city would levy a fine on the property" and even sell it at auction if the fine was not paid.
The city's refusal to recognize the San Carlos institute as a cultural center has irritated the Cubans here, who account for about 20 percent of Key West's permanent population of 25,000. Cuban-American leaders recall that the city refused to contribute to the restoration effort.
 
'Now It Is a Palace'
 "When the situation was chaotic, nobody wanted it and we could get no help," said Dr. Jose Bofill, a doctor who is a former president of the institute. "For years, it was a disaster, a place where birds roosted and drug addicts slept. Now it is a palace, a symbol of the Cuban people, and the same people who wouldn't help, the people to whom it meant nothing, want to take it away from us."
From its earliest days, the San Carlos Institute has been the focus of the intellectual and cultural life of the Cubans who helped found Key West. In the late 19th century, when segregation prevailed elsewhere in Florida, the institute was one of the only places where white, black and Hispanic children attended classes together, and that sense of egalitarianism led citizens of Key West to rebuild the center after it was destroyed by a fire in 1886 and a hurricane in 1919.
After Cuba became independent in 1902, the government in Havana supplied teachers and money to the institute, eventually becoming part owner of the building and putting a consulate and tourist office in it. The Cuban Government has never relinquished its claim to the institute and has fought efforts to seize the building as compensation for American holdings in Cuba that were nationalized when Fidel Castro came to power.
"Technically, it's still Cuban soil," Mr. Garrido said. "It's the only piece of Cuba that's free, which makes it even more of a shrine to us."

HEADLINE: Japan Businesses Lose Confidence in Economy

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 14

 BODY:
Business confidence in Japan has rapidly deteriorated in the last three months and has reached the lowest level in five years, the Bank of Japan reported Friday.
Economists said the report, reflecting a survey of business sentiment, indicated that a rebound of Japan's sagging economy, which optimists had expected to begin this summer, would be delayed until later this year or perhaps next year. 
 The survey results were worse than expected, said Robert Alan Feldman, director of economic research for Salomon Brothers in Tokyo. "I think it does indicate that recovery will be delayed," he said.
Officials of Japan's central bank said that they were not particularly uncomfortable with the new numbers and noted that the results had some hopeful signs. Companies in the survey, for instance, generally reported that they expected business to improve in the fall.
 
Sharper Trade Tensions Seen
 A deepening Japanese economic slump could further inflame trade tensions with the United States and Japan's other trading partners. With its economy weak, Japan's imports are slowing, causing its trade surplus to bulge. And if consumption remains weak in their home market, Japanese companies will be tempted to try to export more goods.
The report released by the Bank of Japan was the Tankan, a quarterly survey of businesses here.
The most closely watched number from the survey, an index reflecting the sentiment of leading manufacturers, dropped to minus 24 in May from minus 5 in February. The new figure means that the number of businesses saying that business conditions are unfavorable exceeded the number saying conditions are favorable by 24 percent.
 
More Public Spending Sought
 The drop in the business confidence index is one of the sharpest single- quarter drops ever experienced, reflecting how quickly the mood here has swung. And the new level is the lowest since minus 27 was recorded early in 1987, when Japanese businesses were trying to cope with a sharp rise in the yen.
Analysts said the survey results could make it more likely that the Japanese Government would try to stimulate the economy with more public spending, by approving a supplemental budget of several trillion yen for this fiscal year. The United States has been pushing for such supplemental public spending to spur the world economy and increase Japan's imports.
Some speculation also arose that the Bank of Japan would be moved to stimulate the economy by cutting the discount rate, now 3.75 percent. But analysts said the central bank was unlikely to consider such action until it sees the supplemental budget.
Some analysts, however, said the survey results showed that Japan's economy was still suffering from an excess of inventories, which will force manufacturers to reduce production rates for months to come. "The inventory adjustment problems are more difficult than the Japanese companies anticipated," said Noboru Kawai, the economist for Morgan Stanley Japan.
 
Consumers Aren't Spending
 Consumer spending is also weak, in part because overtime has been reduced and some workers have been laid off, said Yoshihisa Kitai, senior economist for the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan. He said the Bank of Japan's survey found a sharp drop in confidence among retailers.
"Maybe the Japanese economy has not reached its bottom," said Mr. Kitai, who thinks, however, that recovery will be delayed only until the fall.
Of course, Japan's slump is only by comparison with its past performance. Most analysts expect the economy to grow by 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent this fiscal year, about half of what Japan would consider sufficient but well above what other nations manage in a recession.
Moreover, the unemployment rate here is only about 2 percent. The latest survey does show, however, that fewer businesses than before now believe there is a labor shortage.
One result of the weak economy is a bulging trade surplus. The Finance Ministry reported on Thursday that Japan's trade surplus in May jumped 88.9 percent over the figure for May 1991, reaching $7.87 billion. The surplus with the United States shot up 51 percent to $2.9 billion.

HEADLINE: Congress Steps Up Work on Taxes

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
Congress and the Bush Administration are again dishing up a variety of proposals to change the tax laws, including some tax increases that have been on the back burner since the President vetoed a comprehensive tax bill in March.
Taking up the provisions a few at a time, as if they were so many tapas or dim sum, the Government is assembling a smorgasbord of revenues -- a menu without the kind of politically unpalatable main course, like a cut in capital gains taxes, or income tax breaks aimed at the middle class, that doomed the earlier bill. 
 In recent weeks, tax legislation has been picking up momentum, and experts predict that Congress will produce at least one bill, and probably more than one, that will raise money to pay for social programs even while continuing a handful of important tax breaks. Lawmakers are likely to try to pass such legislation before the Fourth of July recess.
"I intend to move as much as I can before the July 4 recess," said Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, chairman of the Finance Committee, which reviews all tax legislation. Both the House of Representatives and the Senate are actively writing tax bills, often with differing results.
Last week, for example, when the House voted to extend unemployment benefits, lawmakers proposed to pay the cost by putting a $1 million cap on the deduction a corporation can take for an executive's salary. When the Senate Finance Committee later approved its own version of the unemployment bill, it chose to raise the money with less controversial tax increases.
On Tuesday, the same Senate committee will consider legislation to extend a dozen existing tax breaks due to expire at the end of the month. That means the committee will have to propose offsetting tax increases to pay for those costly provisions, which the House has not yet acted on.
Meanwhile, the Administration has given Congress a list of tax measures that the White House said could pay for its proposed program of urban enterprise zones -- a program that relies heavily on tax breaks to draw investment into depressed cities.
Lawmakers are still arguing about where to find the revenue to pay for all these programs, differences that could be magnified by the hard feelings over the failed attempt to write a constitutional amendment calling for a balanced Federal budget. The proposed amendment, strongly favored by the Administration, narrowly failed to gain approval in the House.
Even when it does not balance the overall Federal budget, under the "pay as you go" budget rules enacted in 1990, Congress cannot establish spending programs or enact new tax breaks without adopting offsetting cuts in spending or increases in taxes.
The trick is to put together deals that compensate for the costs of new legislation without a wholesale revision of tax laws.
There are several reasons for Congress to move swiftly. Unemployment benefits will run out early in July if no new law is passed. Twelve tax breaks, each of intense interest to a constituency, are due to expire at the end of June. And by the Fourth of July recess, Congress and the Administration would like to show off an urban initiative that responds to the needs of cities like Los Angeles, charred by rioting in May.
With neither side seeking an all-out brawl over taxes, the debate is centering on provisions that are not merely uncontroversial, but positively soporific: how companies might be allowed to depreciate intangible assets like their customer lists, for example, or whether to require tax withholding on lump-sum pension payments that are not rolled over immediately into individual retirement accounts.
But there are also hot political potatoes to handle -- not only the tax treatment of executive salaries, but also proposed changes in the Social Security law that would allow retirees to earn more income while still collecting retirement benefits and would increase the amount of wages on which workers must pay Social Security taxes.
 
Amount of New Taxes Is Unclear
 Nobody can say yet how much money the new taxes must raise. It depends, for example, on whether the unemployment bill costs $5.8 billion, as the House voted, or about $2.4 billion, as the Administration prefers. And it depends how much is to be spent on enterprise zones and related urban aid.
On June 3, Assistant Treasury Secretary Fred T. Goldberg, who is in charge of the Administration's tax policies, outlined tax changes that he said would raise nearly $10 billion by 1997 -- enough, he said, to pay for the Administration's versions of the urban bill and the unemployment bill, perhaps with some left over to pay for repealing taxes on luxuries like pleasure boats, or for extending the expiring tax breaks.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, has been pushing for a single tax package that would wrap all these provisions together while excluding others from being added on.
Aside from the tax increases earmarked to pay for urban aid and unemployment, the most likely tax bill to be enacted is one that would extend 12 tax breaks that are due to expire. Congress typically extends these provisions only for short periods, to avoid having to provide long-term financing for their costs, which add up to an estimated $21.3 billion from 1992 to 1996.
Among the tax breaks that are facing expiration are a 20 percent corporate tax credit for research and experimentation; a tax credit for investments in low-income housing; a 25 percent deduction for the cost of health insurance premiums paid by self-employed people; an exclusion from taxable income of education benefits paid by employers, and a 10 percent business tax credit for investment in solar and geothermal energy.

HEADLINE: THE EARTH SUMMIT;
What Some Preach in Rio Is Not What They Practice at Home

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
Environmentalists from the global North and South, who may not agree on much else about how to save the world's environment, are united on one contention: When the Earth Summit is over and nations face the task of putting promises to work, the people most likely to make a success of saving the planet will not be found in large international bodies but in small grass-roots organizations caring for their own land.
Whether governments in many developing nations will allow them to assume this role is another matter. In some of the nations whose leaders were most strident in Rio in condemning the industrial world -- among them Malaysia, India and Indonesia -- environmental groups and individual campaigners have been harassed, assaulted and arrested. In Kenya, an environmentalist. Wangari Maathai, was nearly beaten to death by policemen this year. 
 "The third world cannot wrap itself in a green flag and lecture to everybody," said Michael Wright, senior vice president of the World Wildlife Fund, who ran its program linking local development to human needs. "It's a mixed record."
While good working relationships between governments and grass-roots organizations have developed in places as scattered as Zimbabwe, Costa Rica or Bangladesh, leaders of environmental and social-action groups in many other developing countries have drawn official ire by challenging government excuses for environmental failures. They rarely get an international hearing.
 
World Bank's Role Opposed
 These dissident environmentalists say, for example, that poverty is frequently not the main cause of the degradation of forests and waters, or the explanation for overpopulation. They doubt that more money in the hands of their governments will solve environmental problems as long as politicians are not held accountable by the people and corruption erodes enforcement of laws protecting nature. They oppose the global environmental policy role being assumed by the World Bank.
"There continues to be a significant gap between ecological priorities perceived by these environmental and social-action groups and the ecological priorities of governments and global organizations," said Smitu Kothari, who leads protests in India against the dislocations caused by a huge hydroelectric and irrigation project in the Narmada River valley. The project, supported by the World Bank, has drawn criticism from human rights and environmental groups in Japan, the United States and Europe as well as in India.
"The World Bank is one of the most unaccountable institutions on the planet," Mr. Kothari said in an interview. "It doesn't consult local people. Unless local communities really come into their own and are given control, you are not going to be able to save land and recover our ecosystems."
Government pressure on environmentalists has been most intense in the Malaysian state of Sarawak, in northern Borneo, where loggers with political connections are razing tropical rain forests and displacing thousands of indigenous people. Earth torn from hillsides once covered with jungle tumbles into Borneo's powerful rivers, which run brown as chocolate, discharging streams of mud into the turquoise waters of the South China Sea.
Two organizations, Friends of the Earth Malaysia and the World Rain Forest Movement, have been under official scrutiny and criticism for years. Another Malaysian group, the Environmental Protection Society, has been called "a thorn in the flesh of the nation" by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. In 1987, five environmentalists were imprisoned as "security risks" for opposing a proposed dump for radioactive waste.
Malaysia, now Japan's largest supplier of tropical timber from Southeast Asia, is among those nations most opposed to an international treaty that would monitor forest use.
Even in the Philippines, where President Corazon C. Aquino has encouraged the growth of environmental groups and given local organizations and clans the power to make decisions about the use of their natural resources, journalists who expose links between politicians and concessionaires doing illegal logging or mining get death threats, a Filipino reporter who received such a warning said in an interview from Manila.
In China, rapid desertification, the loss of lakes and rivers and the destruction of forests were catalogued by He Bochuan, a lecturer in philosophy at Sun Yat Sen University in Guangdong, in a book recently translated into English as "China on the Edge: The Crisis of Ecology and Development." He saw official policies at the root of most problems.
"False reporting, ineptitude and bad management are the main causes for the huge discrepancy between the impressive claims and the meager results of China's reforestation campaign," he wrote, explaining why China lags well behind most other nations in protecting or restoring forest cover.
 
A Natural Link
 The book was withdrawn from circulation in China after the suppression of the democracy movement in Tiananmen Square in 1989. The link between environmentalism and political change is a natural one, leaders of the movement say.
"In Eastern Europe it was the environmental groups that first acquired legitimacy as nongovernmental forces and became the focus of opposition," said Lester R. Brown, president of the Worldwatch Institute.
Mr. Wright of the World Wildlife Fund said that environmental action thrived best in a democratic, multiparty setting where popular participation in government is strong.
"It's hard to find an environmentally responsive dictatorship," he said.
Mr. Brown sees a lot of hope in the phenomenal growth over the last few years of nongovernmental organizations in the developing world and their increasing ability to communicate internationally with like-minded people. But he said that these groups needed to expand in size and membership to exert influence on recalcitrant governments.
Nongovernmental organizations "have to broaden their bases to include the stalwarts of the community, otherwise governments like Malaysia's and others' can continue to make life very difficult for environmentalists," he said.
 
Intellectual Leadership
 Mr. Brown said that environmental groups had provided the intellectual leadership worldwide on ecological issues.
"There is not a single national government with a global environmental research organization," he said. "At Rio, we could see the dependence on environment groups for information."
After Rio, said Mr. Wright, the world has to get down to building "intermediate organizations" to serve as links to local environmental groups.
"We've got to get something between the megadonors and the poor woman in the village trying to feed her family," he said.

HEADLINE: Housing Aid Goes Unspent By Poor Cities

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13

 BODY:
While Mayor David N. Dinkins and the City Council were reducing spending in New York City's recent budget crisis, hundreds of millions of dollars earmarked for the city was languishing unspent in Federal accounts.
At the beginning of this year, New York had accumulated more than $674.5 million in a program to modernize and rehabilitate public housing, according to a computer search by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The city had not even let contracts for $414 million, including $213 million appropriated three or more years ago. 
 The same pattern has developed in Hartford, Trenton, Newark and other financially troubled cities in the New York region and around the country. And the unspent money has become a symbolic centerpiece in the growing debate over the Federal Government's responsibilities toward America's troubled inner cities.
According to an informal H.U.D. review of two major housing and community development programs, there was $7.2 billion in unspent Federal funds through the end of last year, some of which was appropriated as much as 15 years ago. There were additional unspent billions in transportation and environmental protection programs, Federal officials said.
 
Conservative Defense Since Reagan
 Since the Federal Government began retreating from the urban-aid business at the start of the Reagan era, many conservatives have used the issue of unspent money as a defense against charges of abandoning the cities. In the wake of the Los Angeles riots, the argument has only intensified, with Bush Administration officials pointing to the money to defend their reluctance to provide any new infusion of aid, like a $35 billion anti-recession program proposed by a coalition of Mayor Dinkins, municipal leaders and their allies in Congress.
"It's the 'rattling of the tin cup' approach," said Alfred A. DelliBovi, deputy secretary of the Federal housing department. "You always hear that cities need more money. Before mayors call for new spending, they should look at their capacity to spend. There's always a surplus. The No. 1 job for cities is managing it."
While big-city officials and their legislative allies acknowledge the unspent funds, they say that because of recent increases in their rates of spending, the total is far less than claimed by H.U.D. They also draw a radically different lesson. They say the money has not been spent because of a guerrilla war by conservative ideologues in the Federal bureaucracy. The bureaucrats often attach so many burdensome conditions to Congressional appropriations that it becomes impossible to proceed quickly, if at all, city officials complain.
"They feel that if they can't kill a program on the floor of the House or Senate, they'll kill it by regulation," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat and a senior member of the Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee. "Anyone who thinks H.U.D. regulations are ideologically neutral is not living on this planet. Somebody who wants to stop a project has more power than 100 people who want to move ahead."
A result is often a deadlock in which cities lose appropriated money. In congratulating Cesar A. Perales on his appointment as Deputy Mayor in New York, Anna Kondratas, H.U.D.'s assistant secretary for Community Planning and Development, noted earlier this year that the department had withdrawn $5 million from homeless programs because of the city's inability to meet Federal regulatory requirements. And she warned that other planned programs were in danger of losing funds.
 
Local Labyrinths, Too
 New York officials acknowledge local problems that contributed to the accumulation of the unspent money. Even the least controversial projects are often confronted by neighborhood opposition, legal challenges, Byzantine labor rules and mountains of paperwork. They can combine to create a bureaucratic labyrinth and stymie the best-laid plans.
A typical example of how the Federal money goes unspent can be found at Park Place, a 156-unit building at Park Place and Howard Avenue in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn.
The Federal housing department received the city's plans to build the project on May 17, 1978. The schedule was approved on July 27, 1979, and almost $14 million was appropriated on Sept. 9, 1980. Construction was to start March 5, 1983.
But problems began almost immediately. The contractor defaulted, leading to foreclosure proceedings. Then there were problems moving 30 tenants. The project needed one extension after another. Seven years after construction was to have begun, the developer still needed more time to complete the drawings.
Construction finally began this spring.
But New York officials argue that the problem of unspent funds was less severe when Washington was not trying to sabotage urban programs.
Felice Michetti, Commissioner of the New York Department of Housing Preservation and Development, recently complained that the Federal agency's rules prevent New York from using $127 million it received this year under Home, the first program in years to provide funds to build low-income housing. In a letter to Mr. Schumer, she noted that Congress had reacted to the recession by waiving rules requiring cities to match Federal grants from the progam. In direct conflict with the intent of Congress, she said, the housing department responded by limiting the Federal grant for Home to 67 percent of the construction costs. In effect, the change required localities to make a 33 percent matching grant.
The Commissioner also complained that the housing agency was insisting on "a very narrow" interpretation of its rules by refusing to finance projects that call for spending more than $57,856 to build or renovate a two-bedroom unit. Since New York real-estate and construction costs are among the highest in the country, she called the Federal rules "too restrictive" to allow the construction of the most basic housing.
"The city blames the Feds, the Feds blame the city," Representative Schumer added. "Both are right."
 
Republican Districts Get More
 Urban officials contend that while officials in the Bush Administration criticize the cities -- with their large share of poor and minority residents -- for inefficiency in using Federal money, there is much less reluctance to finance projects to benefit traditional Republican districts in the suburbs and rural areas. While economic development grants used to be split evenly between urban and rural areas, rural areas received 87 percent of the funds in 1991, city leaders complain. And despite urban plight, the ratio last year improved only slightly, with cities getting about 20 percent and rural areas 80 percent.
While New York has been barraged by new social problems -- including AIDS, crack and homelessness -- Federal budget cuts during the 1980s have cost it a total of $33.7 billion, city officials calculate. That is more than New York's annual budget of $28 billion. Over all, the share of the city budget paid by the Federal Government has shrunk by almost half in the last decade, to 9.3 percent in the 1990 New York fiscal year from 17.9 a decade earlier.
Federal housing officials say their regulations are necessary to make cities cost-conscious, and they say private business is more efficient in using its investment capital. They say that the cities caused their own budget problems by overspending during the 1980's and failing to prepare for the predictable downturn.
The housing officials say their study of spending under the Community Improvement Assistance Program in eight cities found a total of $1.2 billion in accumulated funds. There was $732.7 million in unobligated money -- funds for which no contracts had been let -- including $305.5 million appropriated at least three years ago, a period they use as a standard for efficient management.
 
D'Amato Blames Cities
 In addition to New York, Trenton had $15.2 million in unspent money of which $14.3 million was unobligated; Newark $105.1 million of which $29.5 million was unobligated; Hartford $11.7 million of which $10.2 million was unobligated; Boston $65.9 million of which $25.9 million was unobligated; Philadelphia $255.4 million of which $160.3 million was unobligated, St. Louis $44.9 million of which $36.5 million was unobligated, and San Francisco $47.1 million which $42.0 million was unobligated.
"It's incredible," said Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the Long Island Republican who is making what he sees as expansive New York welfare programs and mismanagement of city resources into a mantra of his campaign for re-election to a third term. "It's unconscionable. It's inexcusable that billions of dollars that should be going into the economy are just sitting there."
New York has taken major steps in recent months to make better use of its Community Improvement money, Federal and city officials say. The city has set a $25 million-a-month spending target, hired more staff and tried to reduce delays by computerizing and contracting out architectural work, among other things. A result has been a rapid increase in the rate at which New York spends the money and, according to city officials, a 50 percent reduction, to $100 million, in the three-year backlog. Mayor Dinkins and other city officials say that New York now can handle, and desperately needs, extra Federal help.
But Federal officials remain unconvinced. They say delays and more delays remain the rule, and note that despite the recession, which has hit the construction trades particularly hard, it took the city more than four years to break ground for two new Federal office towers in Foley Square in lower Manhattan.
Mr. Schumer acknowledges that local problems cause delays in cities like New York. "But it was much quicker with a friendly administration in the White House," he contended. "There's a war mentality now."

LENIN ORDERS DEPORTATIONS
At the time he wrote this letter in 1922, Lenin was the unquestioned leader of the ruling Communist Party and Stalin was his right-hand man, serving as party Secretary General. The excerpt indicates Lenin's desire to rid the country of any potential political opponents.

 	 	 			July 17, 1922	
Comrade Stalin!
On the matter of deporting Mensheviks, National Socialists, Kadets, etc. from Russia, I would like to ask a few questions, since this operation, which was started before my leave, still has not been completed.
Has the decision been made to "eradicate" all the NS's? Peshekhonov, Myakotin, Gornfeld, Petrishchev, et al.?
As far as I'm concerned, deport them all. [They are] more harmful than any SR [Socialist Revolutionary] -- because [they are] more clever.
Also A. N. Potresov, Izgoyev and all the "Ekonomist" contributors (Ozerov and many, many others). The Mensheviks, Rozanov (a physician, cunning), Vigdorchik, (Migulov or something like that), Liubov Nikolayevna Radchenko and her young daughter (rumor has it they're the vilest enemies of Bolshevism), N. A. Rozhkov (he has to be deported; incorrigible); S. A. Frank (author of "Metodologiya"). The commission supervised by Mantsev, Messing, et al. should present lists and several hundred such ladies and gentlemen must be deported without mercy. Let's purge Russia for a long while!

 	 	 		. . .	 	This must be done at once. Before the end of the SRs' trial, no later. Arrest a few hundred and without a declaration of motives -- get out, ladies and gentlemen! . . .
With a communist greeting, -- LENIN
 
WARNING ABOUT FAMINE IN SIBERIA
A confidential report in April 1932 illustrated the devastating effects of farm collectivization in Siberia. At the time, the Soviet authorities went to great lengths to keep the widespread famine secret from the outside world. The following is from a physician's report sent to Grigory K. Ordzhonikidze, a confidant of Stalin.
Filipp Borodin has earned 650 work-days, has a wife and 5 children ranging from one and a half to nine years of age. The wife lies ill on the oven, 3 children sit on the oven; they are as pale as wax with swollen faces. . . . Filipp Borodin himself sits on a bench and continuously smokes cigarettes made of repulsively pungent tobacco, cries like a babe, asks death for his children.
In tears he asks Comrade Sukhanov: "Give us at least one kilo of potatoes, give us at least one liter of milk, after all, I worked all summer and even now I work unceasingly. . . . According to the statement by Comrade Sukhanov and the brigadier of the kolkhoz "Red Partisan," Borodin was a noncomplaining worker.
Borodin does not even have food substitutes for nourishment; two days ago he and his family ate two sickly piglets thrown out of the common farmyard. In the Borodin home there is unbelievable filth, dampness, and stench, mixed with the smell of tobacco. Borodin swears at the children: "The devils don't die. I wish I didn't have to look at you!" Having objectively investigated the condition of Borodin himself, I ascertain that he (Borodin) is starting to slip into psychosis due to starvation, which can lead to his eating his own children. . . .

BUKHARIN PROCLAIMS INNOCENCE
Nikolai V. Bukharin, a leading Bolshevik theorist and a friend as well as a frequent intellectual opponent of Lenin, led the so-called "right opposition" to Stalin in 1928-29 and was perhaps the most prominent victim of his purges. Here is his protestation of innocence in a February 1937 letter to Soviet leaders just before his arrest, and his plea for mercy after his conviction in a show trial on March 13, 1938, the presumed day of his execution.

 	 	 			February 20, 1937	
Dear Comrades!
I have sent to the Plenum of the Central Committee a two-part "Deposition" of nearly 100 pages, responding to the cloud of slander contained in the testimony. . . .
As a result of all this, I am a nervous wreck. The death of Sergo [Ordzhonikidze], whom I loved as deeply as a member of my family, was the final blow. The position in which this slander has put me, when I can neither rejoice together with my Party comrades, together with the whole country (Pushkin Days), nor grieve and mourn over the body of Sergo is an insufferable position and I cannot endure it any more.
I swear to you once again on the last breath of Ilich [Lenin], who died in my arms; on my deep love for Sergo, and on all that I hold sacred that associating me with all these acts of terrorism, sabotage, Trotskyite pacts, etc. is unheard-of base slander. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	In this most extraordinary situation, from tomorrow I will go on a full hunger strike until the charges of treason, sabotage and terrorism against me are removed. I will not live with these accusations. . . .
 
Farewell.
Be victorious.
Yours,
N. BUKHARIN
 
A Plea for Mercy
I beg the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. for mercy. I consider the verdict of the court to be just punishment for my most grave transgressions against the socialist motherland, its people, party, and government. There is not a single word of protest in my soul. I should be shot ten times for my crimes. . . .
If I allow myself to petition the highest government organ in our land, before which I appear on my knees, it is only because I believe that through a pardon I can be of value to my country; I do not say -- and I am not able to say -- that I can expiate my guilt; the crimes I committed are so monstrous, so enormous, that I cannot atone for the guilt -- no matter what I may do for the rest of my life. But I assure the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet that my stay of more than a year in prison has forced me to do a great deal of thinking and to reconsider much from my criminal past. . . .
Step by step, I have re-examined my past life. The former Bukharin has already died; he no longer lives on this earth. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	Let a new, second Bukharin grow -- let him even be [called] Petrov -- this new man will be the complete antithesis of the one who has died. He has already been born -- give him the opportunity of any kind of work at all. . . . I shall strive to prove to you, with every fiber of my being, that this gesture of proletarian generosity was justified.
 
Nikolai Bukharin.

ANDROPOV NAMES HIS ENEMIES
A memorandum written by the head of the K.G.B., Yuri V. Andropov, on Nov. 15, 1976, gives details on the activities of leading dissidents and steps taken against them. Mr. Andropov later succeeded Leonid I. Brezhnev as Soviet leader, holding power from 1982 until his death in February 1984. 
In recent years our adversary's special services and propaganda bureaus have attempted to give the impression that a so-called "internal opposition" exists in the U.S.S.R., rendering support to those who inspire antisocial and anti-Soviet activities and promote the banding together of participants in a variety of anti-Soviet activities.
Accordingly, in 1969 antisocial elements headed by Yakir and Krasin founded an "initiative group" in order to form an organization made up of participants of the so-called "movement for democratization."
In 1970, in order to activate the antisocial efforts of individuals with hostile leanings, Chalidze established the so-called "Committee for the Protection of Human Rights" which, in addition to himself, includes among its members Academician Sakharov and Shafarevich, a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R.
In 1973 the so-called "Russian Section" of Amnesty International, headed by Turchin and Tverdokhlebov, assumed organizational responsibilities for individuals with anti-Soviet leanings. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	As a result of measures taken by the Committee for State Security, the "initiative group" and the "Committee for the Protection of Human Rights" have been completely compromised and have virtually ceased to exist. The activities of the "Russian Section" have been curtailed.
Nevertheless, despite the failure to create an "internal opposition" in the U.S.S.R., our adversary has not abandoned this idea.
On May 12 of this year, on the initiative of Yuri F. Orlov, born in 1924, unemployed, corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the Armenian S.S.R., the antisocial elements announced the formation of a "Group for Implementation of the Helsinki Accords in the U.S.S.R."
This "group" includes the following individuals: Ginzburg, A. I., has on numerous occasions been brought to criminal accountability, born 1936, Jew, unemployed; Grigorenko, P. G., born 1907, Ukrainian, retiree; the professional criminal Marchenko, A. T., born 1938, Russian, in exile in Irkutsk Oblast; [also] the Jewish extremists: Rubin, V. A., born 1913, Jew, emigrated to Israel; Shcharansky, A. D., born 1948, Jew, unemployed; and Slepak, V. S., born 1927, Jew, unemployed; [also] participants in various hostile activities: Sakharov's wife Bonner, Ye. G., born 1922, Jew, retiree; Bernshtam, M. S., born 1949, Jew, emigrated to Israel; Landa, M. N., born 1918, Jew, retiree, unemployed; Alekseyeva, L. M., born 1927, Russian, unemployed, and Korchak, A. A., born 1922, Ukrainian, fellow at the Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism, Ionosphere and Radio Wave Transmission, Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The Committee for State Security is taking measures to compromise and put an end to the "group's" hostile activities.

K.G.B. WARNING ON CHERNOBYL
More than seven years before the Cherno byl nuclear disaster, the K.G.B., led by An dropov, had reported to the Central Committee of the Soviet Union that there were serious design and construction problems at the power station.

 	 	 			February 21, 1979	According to data in the possession of the K.G.B. of the U.S.S.R., design deviations and violations of construction and assembly technology are occurring at various places in the construction of the second generating unit of the Chernobyl A.E.S. and these could lead to mishaps and accidents.
The structural pillars of the generator room were erected with a deviation of up to 100 mm. from the reference axes, and horizontal connections between the pillars are absent in places.
Wall panels have been installed with a deviation of up to 150 mm. from the axes. The placement of roof plates does not conform to the designer's specifications. Crane tracks and stopways have vertical drops of up to 100 mm. and in places a slope of up to 8<0>.
Deputy head of the Construction Directorate, Comrade V. T. Gora, gave instructions for backfilling the foundation in many places where vertical waterproofing was damaged. Similar violations were permitted in other sections with the knowledge of Comrade V. T. Gora and the head of the construction group, Comrade Yu. L. Matveyev. Damage to the waterproofing can lead to ground water seepage into the station and radioactive contamination of the environment.
The leadership of the Directorate is not devoting proper attention to the foundation, on which the quality of the construction largely depends.

HEADLINE: 3 Men Killed and 2 Wounded In Shooting After Clash at Party

BYLINE: By J. PEDER ZANE

 BODY:
Three men were killed and two others were wounded outside of a Brooklyn party yesterday when an argument over a woman led to a drive-by shooting, witnesses and the police said.
Without saying a word, two men in a red sports car sprayed a group of about 15 people mingling outside during a party at 279 Buffalo Avenue in Crown Heights, the police said. The police provided this list of victims: 
 Kevin Augustus, 22 years old, of 41 Convent Avenue in Harlem, who died at the scene from a gunshot wound.
Anthony Zayala, 22, of 1415 Curtis Street in Los Angeles, who died at the scene of stomach and back wounds.
Linden Arnold, 24, of Belize City, who was taken to St. Mary's Hospital, where he died of a gunshot wound to the leg. Mr. Arnold was in New York on vacation, family members said.
Two other men, Erwin Franklin and Norman Budd, were treated at area hospitals for gunshot wounds to their legs and released yesterday. The police would not provide their addresses because they are witnesses in a continuing investigation.
The police said they have made no arrests in the shooting, which took place at 3 A.M. yesterday.
The owner of the house at 279 Buffalo Avenue, who insisted that his name not be used for fear of retribution from the gunmen, said that he had not seen any of the victims among the 50 people dancing inside at the party but that he had noticed them in a group drinking beer and smoking marijuana nearby. "I came out to tell them to leave, but they were arguing very strongly about a girl, so I went back inside," he said.
Moments later, he said, two men ran into the basement, saying they had been shot. "Then two other guys came into the basement and one of them was carrying two guns," he said. "I pleaded with them to leave, and they did. Then I locked the door and called the police."
One local resident, Fred Campbell, an unemployed 28-year-old, said: "It's like Dodge City out there. Every night there's shootings going on."
In the Bronx, a dozen members of Linden Arnold's family gathered in his parents' apartment. His mother, Valerie Linden, said that her son had run a dry-cleaning business in Belize City and that he had come to New York with his family last Tuesday.
"A friend called us and told us the awful news," she said as Mr. Linden's 2-year-old son cried at her side. "He was supposed to go home tomorrow."

HEADLINE: Dinkins's Europe Trip Polishes City's Image

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, June 14

 BODY:
What people say about you behind your back is typically more telling that what they say to your face.
By that measure, the delegation led by Mayor David N. Dinkins that just made a whirlwind tour of Britain, France and Germany to promote New York as an indispensable place for foreign companies to do business was successful. 
 Maybe not a smash success. Judging from interviews with a handful of British executives wooed by the delegation of city and state officials and business leaders, the tour probably will not result in an immediate deluge of investment. But it certainly persuaded some executives to think more kindly of New York. While they wished the delegation had come prepared to discuss financial incentives, they said the visit provided them with contacts that could lead to deals.
"Those contacts couldn't but be helpful," said Charles Herbert, chairman of the Tussaud's Group, a division of Pearson P.L.C., whose exhibition centers include Madame Tussaud's wax museum here. At the moment, New York is vying with at least Berlin and Tokyo as the site for a $30 million to $40 million wax museum Pearson wants to build in the 1990's.
 
Meeting of Minds
 But judging from Mr. Herbert's tone, the 45 minutes of courting by the delegation -- lacking Mr. Dinkins -- helped New York's cause. "We were talking to some high-powered business people -- people speaking our own language," Mr. Herbert said, mentioning Preston R. Tisch, president of Loews Corporation, and David A. Olsen, chairman of Johnson & Higgins, the insurance broker.
He was also happy to meet Barry F. Sullivan, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development. "Certainly, if we're to go into New York, we would be approaching people in his office to see what kind of financial deals there would be for people like us."
Executives at Ladbroke Group, a British conglomerate with betting shops, hotels and home-improvement stores, struck a similar note. "It was useful to have an exchange of views and make personal contact," they said in a statement.
The Ladbroke executives intend to pursue the possibility of buying the Offtrack Betting Corporation, which was the subject of their talks with the delegation. They said they are "seriously interested" in buying or managing the agency. State Comptroller Edward V. Regan has urged the city to consider selling OTB's 95 branches to private interests.
Long before the New York delegation arrived here, Tussaud's had been exploring sites in Manhattan, including the theater district around 42d Street and the South Street Seaport area. Rebecca Robertson, president of the 42d Street Development Project, the state-financed redevelopment group, had been courting them.
If the wax museum goes into the theater district, one of its main themes will be the entertainment industry. But comments by some New York executives appear to have reduced the theater district's chances. "One or two said that area of redevelopment was going to take a long time to come to pass," Mr. Herbert said.
 
Pluses and Minuses
 Given New York's depressed economy, Mr. Herbert said it would take "tremendous incentives to get us to go there in the next year or 18 months." On the other hand, the Germans and Japanese have not been exactly deluging him with offers. "Berlin is also a city down on its luck at the moment," he said. And Tokyo is one of the few places whose real estate prices make New York's look like a bargain.
Tussaud's plans to choose the lucky city within a year or two.
It will also be quite a while, if ever, before New York has its own Virgin Megastore, selling music, computer games and the like.
The delegates pushed Times Square as a potential site for one of the huge stores in their talks with Richard Branson, the British entrepreneur whose empire includes the Virgin Retail Group and Virgin Atlantic Airways.
But Los Angeles has been chosen for the first Megastore in the United States, because it does not have any similar stores of comparable size -- more than 20,000 square feet -- William Whitehorn, a spokesman for Mr. Branson, said. It is scheduled to open by the end of the year.
British executives complained that the New Yorkers bore no tangible gifts, which they interpreted to mean that the Dinkins administration was new at wooing foreign investment.
Roger J. Saul, owner and chairman of the Mulberry Company of London, an apparel, accessories and home-furnishings manufacturer and retailer, said the Japanese are offering favorable loan terms and tax breaks to encourage investment.
Mr. Saul plans to open retail stores in the United States and is trying to decide whether to begin with a flagship store of 3,000 to 4,000 square feet in a major city or with a smaller store in a wealthy suburb or smaller city. The big cities he is considering include New York, Chicago, Boston and Dallas, and he is also thinking about a store for Beverly Hills.
 
'New York Is Serious'
 "It seemed to be a quite a high-powered, charismatic delegation, and I was pleasantly surprised by the tone," Mr. Saul said. "It means New York is serious about trying to further business relationships outside their four walls." He said that what would matter even more than the initial trip was whether there would be a follow-up.
The British executives stress that if they do invest, it will be for the long-term. And they have faith that New York's current dismal economy will rebound.
"Americans and New Yorkers are quite resilient people. They're get-up-and-goers," said Mr. Herbert of Tussaud's.
Mr. Saul agreed. "We believe now is the right time to go in," he said. "Real estate opportunities are tremendous." He just wants a little help from his new-found friends.

HEADLINE: Civil Rights Leader Retires Angry

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ATLANTA, June 14

 BODY:
The Rev. Joseph Lowery, one of the founding ministers of the civil rights movement, retired from the pulpit Sunday with an angry sermon attributing the country's social woes to Government indifference.
"It is not our economy we need to be worried about," said Mr. Lowery, who at 70 years old has reached the mandatory retirement age for United Methodist ministers. "What's imperiled today in America is her soul. 
 "We can deal with the economy. If we lose our souls, what, then, is there for us? There is no sanctuary for the soul from the sorrow of the society in which we live."
About 1,500 people packed Cascade United Methodist Church, where Mr. Lowery had been pastor for six years. Mr. Lowery said he would remain as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which he has headed since 1977.
Mr. Lowery and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. were among the ministers who founded the Leadership Conference in 1957.
Mr. Lowery accused the Bush Administration of inattention to domestic concerns, citing its failure to encourage industry to create jobs in America, rather than overseas, and its reluctance to extend jobless benefits.
He then moved to Vice President Dan Quayle's touting of "family values" and said, "If you're concerned about the family, Mr. Quayle, why don't you extend the unemployment benefits so children can eat?"
"You would send women, children -- families in homemade boats -- to certain death on the shores of Haiti. And you talk about family values," said Mr. Lowery, who waved his arms and spat out words rapid-fire.
After the service, several in the congregation wept.
"You have graduated from Cascade, but your ministry to the world is just beginning," Marilyn Arrington, a parishioner, told Mr. Lowery.

HEADLINE: Travel Industry Plans For Life After Castro

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Convinced that Fidel Castro's rule is nearing its end, executives in the American travel industry are laying plans for a surge of American visitors to Cuba.
While most of the executives play down any talk of an immediate bonanza from Cuban tourism, they note that the estimated one million Cuban-Americans represent a large pool of potential travelers along with other Americans who want to visit a nearby tropical island that has been largely off limits for more than three decades. 
 "Top management here has been talking about plans for the Cuban market, and I have no doubt that top management at most other cruise lines has talked about it, too," said Doug Falk, executive vice president of Kloster Cruise Ltd., which owns the Norwegian Cruise Line.
 
Interest Among Airlines
 Airline executives also talk about Cuba after Mr. Castro. United Airlines recently received tentative approval from the Transportation Department for Havana flights if the State Department allows them, which is unlikely as long as Mr. Castro remains.
Executives of the Radisson Hotel chain, who were invited to Cuba in 1989 to discuss managing a proposed new hotel, say they still plan to operate a hotel outside Havana if Washington gives its approval.
And the Port of Miami recently proposed building a downtown port annex to accommodate cruise lines and Miami-Havana ferry service. Before Mr. Castro took over, ocean liners and ferries sailed to Havana from New York, New Orleans, Miami and Key West, Fla.
Long a playground for American visitors, with its beaches, casinos and night life, Cuba was placed off limits for United States citizens when relations between Washington and Havana deteriorated soon after Mr. Castro came to power in 1959. While American citizens are not prohibited from traveling to Cuba, United States law forbids most Americans to spend money there. It also prohibits American investment.
Still, Cuban leaders are trying to attract investors as the country deals with the worst economic crisis of the Castro years. Last week, 125 foreign business executives, most of them Americans, were greeted by Mr. Castro and other top officials during a day of briefings in Havana on investment opportunities that remain largely off limits.
 
A Year-Round Spot
 Mr. Falk said the island could serve as a year-round destination itself or as a port-of-call for ships stopping at other Caribbean ports. During their stay in port, the ships could double as hotels for their passengers; Cuba has a shortage of first-class hotels.
Jay J. Lewis, president of Market Scope Inc., a marketing research firm in Miami, estimated that 500,000 cruise passengers would visit Havana in each of the first three years after Mr. Castro departed, rising to 1.8 million cruise passengers and 600,000 ferry visitors by the 10th year.
"It will be a long, long time before Cuba's infrastructure is anywhere near what will be required to handle more American tourists," Mr. Lewis said. He estimated that only 2,000 cruise passengers visited Cuba in 1988, the latest year for which data are available. In contrast, 1.2 million cruise passengers visited Nassau, the Bahamas, in 1990.
The number of Cuban visitors is unlikely to increase much while Mr. Castro is still around; two months ago President Bush, in an apparent concession to the anti-Castro Cuban American National Foundation, signed legislation restricting ships that visit Cuba from calling at American ports.
Scheduled air service between the United States and Cuba ended soon after Mr. Castro came to power. But even though United States airlines are barred from flying to Cuba, their interest in that country dates from at least October 1927, when Pan Am began flying from Key West to Havana -- the first permanent air service from the United States to a foreign country. Pan Am acquired a second certificate to fly to Cuba when it purchased National Airlines for $400 million in 1980.
Pan Am's deteriorating financial condition forced it to sell its Latin American routes, including the Miami-Havana and Key West-Havana routes, to United last year, shortly before Pan Am went out of business.
"United is closely watching the situation with Cuba and would be very anxious to commence service at the earliest possible date," said Lawrence M. Nagin, the carrier's executive vice president and general counsel. American Airlines also hopes to be granted routes to Cuba.
Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, which subsidized Cuba at about $4 billion a year, the Cuban economy has steadily deteriorated. Mr. Castro has turned to tourism to generate foreign exchange.
To attract Canadians, Germans and other foreign visitors, Havana has formed joint ventures with hotel developers from Europe and the Caribbean, giving the foreign companies majority ownership of new construction and discretion over management practices.
Cuba continues to seek foreign investment and management expertise, which is why its officials had invited the Radisson executives to the island.
"We didn't meet Castro, but we met other high Cuban officials," said Curtis L. Carlson, whose Carlson Companies owns the worldwide Radisson chain. He was accompanied by Juergen Bartels, president of the Carlson Hospitality Group and an official of the Banco Nacional de Mexico. The talks in Havana were conducted with the head of Cubanacan, one of several state tourism agencies.
Mr. Carlson said the group was shown five potential hotel sites outside Havana and plans for modern hotels for each site. They agreed to manage one of the five properties, and the Cubans accepted.
"When they asked when we could start, we had to tell them not until Washington gives us the go-ahead," Mr. Carlson said. While nothing exists in writing, he added, Radisson considers its oral agreement with the Cuban Government to be in effect.

Dan Quayle, Malcolm X and American Values

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
BLACKS realize increasingly that physically, politically, economically, and even to some degree socially, the aroused black man can create a turmoil in white America's vitals -- not to mention America's international image.
Spike Lee was dismissive. Betty Shabazz was hopeful. Robert Little was skeptical. All three -- the film-maker, who is completing his production of "X," and Malcolm X's widow and brother -- were incredulous at Vice President Dan Quayle's revelation last week that he was mining the slain black nationalist's autobiography for clues to racial conflict and to its mitigation, reported in The Wall Street Journal. 
 Four months ago, Mr. Quayle addressed the Economic Club in Manhattan, where he bashed the city's bureaucracy and laid the groundwork for his critique of New York as the welfare state incarnate. Today, Mr. Quayle is due back to preach American values to another thoughtful choir, the Manhattan Institute, and, according to his spokesman, David Beckwith, "more of what's wrong with New York." Which might suggest that, if today's speech is inspired by Malcolm's views, such as those quoted here, a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing.
Human rights! Respect as human beings! That's what America's black masses want.
"It's a joke," Mr. Lee said last week of the Vice President's move. "Every time Malcolm X talked about 'blue-eyed devils' Quayle should think he's talking about him. How does he see himself having a role in reversing racial conflict? He doesn't have any blacks or Hispanics or Asian-Americans among his senior staff."
Mr. Lee added, "He says teach a person how to fish rather than give a person a fish, but the people who've got the fish, they're all white males."
Why was it that when Negroes did start revolting across America, virtually all of white America was caught up in surprise and even shock? I would hate to be general of an army as badly informed as the American white man has been about the Negro in this country.
"He talks about traditional values," said Dr. Shabazz, an official at Medgar Evers College of the City University of New York. "Is he saying that only certain people have values and other people don't?
"What I think is very sad is some people feel that white people should have as their agenda only Caucasians. And that if black people don't have white people as their agenda they're considered hatemongers."
And, she said, "If New York is the welfare state, it is because we have helped everyone else but ourselves."
One thing the white man never can give the black man is self-respect!. . . The black man in America has to lift up his own sense of values.
"I don't know what would make the Vice President more sensitive, given the ideology he espouses," said Mr. Little, who heads New York City's Child Welfare Administration.
"States, unfortunately, are having to make up for Federal disinvestment," he said. "Are poor people receiving enough dollars to adequately survive? No. Being on welfare in and of itself limits your income to a substandard level."
It takes no one to stir up the sociological dynamite that stems from the unemployment, bad housing, and inferior education already in the ghettos. This explosively criminal condition has existed for so long; it fuses itself; it spontaneously combusts from within itself.
Mr. Quayle was referred to Malcolm's autobiography by Digger Phelps, the former Notre Dame basketball coach since recruited to the Government's anti-drug crusade. Five years ago, Mr. Phelps presciently sensed the national mood when, asked about mandatory drug testing of players, he replied: "Somebody's got to do something. I'm going to give up some Constitutional rights."
If Mr. Quayle is reading the autobiography nearly 30 years after it was first published, he deserves two points for his own belated cultural outreach and his embrace of Muslim self-discipline as one vehicle for instilling them. (After all, Malcolm was a convert, too.) Beyond suspending alternate-side parking rules on Moslem holidays, though, it's uncertain how Mr. Quayle would have government promote the religion's agenda.
Whenever something white men disliked happened in the black community, typically white public attention was directed not at the cause, but at a selected scapegoat.
Listening to Dr. Shabazz and to Mr. Little would provide another dimension to Mr. Quayle's postgraduate education. An unforgiving Mr. Lee says, though, that he would not even invite the Vice President to a screening of his new film next fall. "He should pay $7.50 like everyone else."
Billboards are already promoting the film. Beneath a huge "X" is the word November, which is when the film opens and when Americans vote. The X is for Malcolm. But it also means the unknown -- whether the rest of America is persuaded that New York epitomizes the failed welfare state and that Mr. Quayle would do a better job of helping the poor help themselves.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Housing Data May Give Signals on the Economy

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Struggling to make sense out of economic statistics that are mixed at best, credit market participants are questioning whether the sluggish recovery that seems to be developing could falter.
One reason for such doubts is the way the housing industry, an important source of growth in the first quarter, seems to be sputtering. 
 After surging during an exceptionally balmy winter, housing activity tailed off in March and April, in part because of unseasonably cool weather and in part because of rising mortgage interest rates.
 
Awaiting the Housing Data
 Housing numbers for May, scheduled to be released on Tuesday, may provide a better picture of just how healthy housing is.
In advance of the report, most analysts are forecasting that housing starts are running at an annual rate of just over 1.1 million units, relatively unchanged from April. A sampling of builders across the country found most to be mildly upbeat. But some questioned if in the current climate low mortgage rates would be enough to fuel demand.
"Housing is a question mark," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank. "If housing starts to flatten out at current levels of around 1.1 million units at an annual rate, the economy can continue to grow, but at an even more sluggish pace than I think. It will be a concern to the Fed."
Despite recent sluggishness, there are some reasons to be optimistic about the housing market.
 
Movement in Mortgage Rates
 At around 8.5 percent, rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages are higher than they were in January, but nearly half a point below where they were in March. And employment has been rising, albeit glacially, in recent months. Moreover, the abnormally frantic pace of building that went on during January and February tends to exaggerate the recent weakness.
"The last couple of months wouldn't have looked so bad if the first couple of months hadn't looked so good," said Michael Carliner, an economist at the National Association of Home Builders in Washington. "Some of the activity that went on this winter was borrowed from the spring."
Mr. Carliner expects housing activity, after stabilizing in the second quarter at an annual rate of around 1.2 million units, to accelerate modestly through the second half of the year, assuming mortgage rates stay at close to current levels and employment and income levels show further improvement.
In addition to weak employment and income growth, analysts point out that demographic trends, including the shrinking number of first-time buyers, are working against housing.
 
Not 'Terribly Strong'
 The volume of potential home buyers "has not been terribly strong," since March, said William J. Gillilan, president of the Centex Corporation, a Dallas-based company that is one of the nation's largest home builders. "On the other hand, our sales rate as a percentage of those who are looking has been as good as at any time in our recent history."
Robert J. Buchert, president of the American Heritage Construction and Development Corporation in Cincinnati, said that after a sluggish March and April, activity picked up slightly in May.
"I can't say that conditions are good,' he said. "I'm more optimistic about 1992 than I was at this time last year, but my optimism is dampened from what it was in January and February."
J. Roger Glunt, president of the Glunt Building Company in Turtle Creek, Pa., near Pittsburgh, said business was worse than it was a year earlier. Voicing an opinion shared by a number of builders, he said potential home buyers lacked the confidence necessary to buy.
"A year ago, people felt a lot better, even though the economy was not good," he said. "That is not the case right now."
 
Decline in Consumer Credit
 Even though mortgage rates are low, consumers are extremely reluctant to take on new debt, no matter how cheaply they can borrow the money.
The urge to pare debt levels was vividly illustrated in April consumer credit numbers reported last week. The monthly decline was the steepest since the credit crunch in the spring of 1980.
The decline in mortgage rates in the last month or so has thus far not prompted a rise in a weekly home purchasing index compiled by the Mortgage Bankers Association.
"The index is running well below February levels," Christopher Flanagan, a mortgage-backed-securities analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company wrote in a weekly report to clients, "and suggests that this summer's home-buying season will be relatively depressed, despite low mortgage rates."
He added, "Economic uncertainty is forcing borrowers into behavior that is radically different from their behavior in similar interest rate environments of the past."
Lyle E. Gramley, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, said his group was expecting a gradual improvement in housing for the rest of the year, one that would be sufficient to stimulate the economy. He added, however, that the risks of stagnation were greater than risks that demand might explode.

HEADLINE: Foreign Investors Pouring Into China

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, June 14

 BODY:
Gunfire ringing in their ears, foreign executives fled China in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square crackdown three years ago, and many people doubted that foreign investors and tourists would return as long as the hard-line Communists remained in power.
So much for conventional wisdom: these days the Chinese economy is booming, and foreign investment and tourism are setting records. Despite the risks of United States trade sanctions over China's human rights record, executives once more are enthralled by the business potential of the most populous nation on earth. 
 "We want to be ready here when this market takes off, and everything we see indicates that will come about," said Richard W. Younts, a senior vice president of Motorola Inc. "All in all, we're very excited. We're looking forward to making further investments here, maybe later this year."
 
$125 Million Motorola Factory
 Mr. Younts was in China for the groundbreaking last week at a $125 million Motorola factory complex in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin. The plant will initially make semiconductors and pagers, and later cellular telephones and auto ignitions.
In the first three months of this year, foreign companies contracted to invest $6.5 billion in 3,837 enterprises -- an average of 42 new foreign financed ventures in China each day. New investment is running at more than twice the pace of last year and four times that of previous years.
"The investment climate is probably the best it's ever been," said Ronald J. Gilchrist, executive vice president in Hong Kong of the General Motors Overseas Corporation. "It's a high-growth area, and the vehicle market is very strong."
General Motors last month began a $100 million joint venture in northeast China with the Gold Cup Automotive Company, manufacturing and assembling pickup trucks and other vehicles. The joint venture will produce 30,000 trucks this year, mostly an improved version of a vehicle that China has already been producing.
Later this year, the joint venture will begin to assemble General Motors pickup trucks from kits imported from the United States. The Chinese proportion of the labor and parts will gradually increase, and by 1998 the factory is scheduled to produce 50,000 of these pickups each year.
Foreign investors are not as starry eyed as they were a decade ago when China was first opening up. Most companies now expect maddening bureaucratic delays to snarl their investments periodically. There are also grave doubts about what may happen in China after the death of Deng Xiaoping, the 87-year-old senior leader. But many Western companies seem to worry less about the Chinese Government than about the American Congress.
"The question is always asked: what is the political risk," said Maureen Flanagan, director of international trade policy at the Digital Equipment Corporation, which in the last few years has opened a factory and a software development center in southern China. "But the political risk is really not within China, but within the U.S. The danger is that M.F.N. will not be renewed, not so much this year as in 1993."
M.F.N., or most-favored-nation trade status, provides China and most other exporters with low-tariff access to the American market. Some members of Congress try each year to attach human rights conditions to the renewal of these trade benefits, and some American companies fear that they would be battered in any trade fight.
Many American companies involved in China are extremely wary of publicity, for fear that they will be portrayed as profiting from Chinese repression. So while many businesses are thriving and local executives have much to be proud of, they react to a telephone call from a reporter with all the enthusiasm they might show to a tax auditor. They almost always refuse to be quoted by name.
Despite such worries, foreign companies find China attractive for two broad reasons.
First, there is an enormous supply of literate and healthy laborers who are willing to work for $50 a month or less, making China a low-cost production base for goods to be sold in other countries. Many companies in Taiwan and Hong Kong, faced with rising costs for production of shoes, toys and other exports, have moved entire assembly lines into southern China.
 
Means of Cutting Labor Costs
 "These companies have been squeezed on the world market, and to compete they must relocate to China to reduce labor costs and other expenses," said Peter J. Y. Yuan, the China coordinator for the Electrolux Group. Electrolux has recently begun joint ventures in China to manufacture car safety belts and refrigerator compressors.
The second lure is the domestic Chinese market itself, with its population of 1.1 billion, huge private savings, rising incomes and a strong preference for foreign brand names.
The Procter & Gamble Company is enjoying enormous success selling Head and Shoulders shampoo and other products in southern China. Late last year it began a joint venture that could eventually produce up to 150 million Whisper sanitary napkins annually.
McDonald's recently opened three restaurants in China -- each setting a record for the highest opening-day sales of any McDonald's in the world -- and plans to spend $50 million in the next few years opening more outlets in major Chinese cities.
The old problem of selling in China was that the currency could not be converted into Western currencies. But in the last few years the Government has set up nearly 100 swap centers where authorized companies can trade their money for dollars at a free-market rate, and so it is now possible to take profits out of China.
"China is turning into the kind of market we always cautioned people not to expect for many years," said Jerome A. Cohen, a New York lawyer who has worked in China trade for more than three decades.
 
Former Unrealistic Expectations
 In the past, Mr. Cohen said, foreign companies often had unrealistic expectations about the potential of the Chinese market. But now, particularly in prosperous parts of southern China, some executives think those dreams may finally be beginning to come true.
Alluding to Napoleon's comment -- "China? There lies a sleeping giant. Let him sleep! For when he wakes he will move the world" -- Mr. Cohen said, "Maybe Napoleon was right."
To be sure, the giant may simply roll over and go back to sleep again. But the current burst of enthusiasm at least reflects an important change in sentiment among foreign executives. That shift is also apparent in the rush by Western investors to buy Chinese stocks.
One of the few bleak spots in the foreign investment scene is the hotel industry, which in many cities is overbuilt. But even hoteliers take some comfort in the rising numbers of tourists. More than 12 million overseas tourists visited China in the first four months of this year, a 12 percent increase over last year, and trips to scenic destinations like the Yangtze River Gorges are again fully booked.
Americans are joining in the investment and tourism boom, but not as much as citizens of other countries. The United States used to rank third as a source of tourists, after Hong Kong and Japan, but now it has dropped to fifth, behind France and Germany.
 
Hong Kong the Largest Investor
 Hong Kong has always been the largest foreign investor in China, accounting for about 57 percent of new contracted investment, but until 1990 the United States ranked second, with about a 10 percent share. Last year, the United States dropped to fifth, with less than a 5 percent share of foreign investment in China, behind Hong Kong, Germany, Taiwan and Japan.
Although there are no reliable figures, some of what is officially counted as foreign investment is actually Chinese money that is funneled abroad. For example, a local government or company in southern China may decide to build a new factory with money that it first channels through Hong Kong. Then the investment will count as foreign financed and get tax breaks and other benefits.
Regardless of where the money comes from, the underlying reason for the investment boom is China's rapid economic growth. After a slowdown in the wake of the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown, in which troops killed hundreds of pro-democracy protesters, the economy is again performing about as well as any in the world.
During the first four months of this year, industrial production soared 18 percent above the level of the comparable months a year earlier.
"What's driving investment is China's continued strong economic growth," said John Frisbie, director of China operations for the United States-China Business Council, an industry group. "That consistently good economic performance has gotten people's attention."

A Baryshnikov Debut at Age 44, In Balanchine's 'Duo Concertant'

BYLINE: By ANNA KISSELGOFF

 BODY:
At the age of 44 and with several knee operations behind him, Mikhail Baryshnikov cannot be expected to be the dancer he once was. Yet his stage presence remains as potent as his reputation and George Balanchine's "Duo Concertant," which balances stillness with movement, was the perfect vehicle for the superstar's appearance with the New York City Ballet on Saturday night. Box office appeal raised its not-so-subtle head at this first of six guest performances by Mr. Baryshnikov this month at the New York State Theater with the City Ballet. Ticket sales have slipped, as they have for American Ballet Theater this spring. But as this occasion proved, higher-than-ever prices in a recession are no deterrent when the public is offered what it perceives as something outside the everyday dance event.
The City Ballet, even under Balanchine, has never been rigid about a policy that supposedly excludes guests. Mr. Baryshnikov left the City Ballet in 1979 after dancing with it for 15 months. A few years later, although he was then artistic director of Ballet Theater, he returned for a handful of appearances in Balanchine's "Steadfast Tin Soldier." 
 In this case he is obviously giving the City Ballet a boost (the house was packed). In return he is surely deriving some artistic satisfaction from a debut in a Balanchine ballet, albeit an atypical one.
Mr. Baryshnikov himself has made no bones about the fact that his classical virtuoso days are over; he could conceivably still execute the bravura feats that thrilled his initial audience but this would be at great physical cost. In recent years he has turned to modern dance. Last October he was a guest with Martha Graham's company at the City Center and three weeks ago he performed a Mark Morris solo for the "Friends in Deed" benefit at the Joyce Theater.
For the most part, he has been touring with his own modern-dance troupe, the White Oak Dance Project, which has yet to appear in New York. In one of his interviews, which publicized the group's European tour, Mr. Baryshnikov suggested that he could not now meet the technical demands of William Forsythe, whose latest work for the City Ballet was also on this program.
"Duo Concertant," created by Balanchine for the City Ballet's 1972 Stravinsky Festival, makes demands of a very different sort. The entire ballet is a poetic conceit: Two dancers pretend to listen to an onstage pianist and violinist and then start dancing as if the music impels them to do so.
The idea that music is the springboard for dancing (as is not necessarily true for some other choreographers) is a given in Balanchine's world. But here the choreographer turns his credo into a mini-allegory. In the last of the five sections, the woman seemingly represents a muse. She and the man cannot find each other at first but finally she remains rooted to the spot as he kneels at her feet: the lover before his feminine ideal, the cavalier before the ballerina, Balanchine's artistic ideal.
Mr. Baryshnikov, when not required to stand still, plunged into the choreography with the same fierce attack he originally showed in other Stravinsky-Balanchine ballets like "Apollo" and "Rubies." His emphasis again was on accents and staccato phrasing. If he eventually toned down this approach under Balanchine's guidance, in this instance it created a dramatic relationship with Yvonne Borree, his young partner, that was not out of place.
Some of the stage images were even reinforced through this boldness and the moment when both dancers suddenly begin dancing, their mimicry of the musicians, which often goes unnoticed, stood out in witty clarity. Miss Borree mimed violin playing and Mr. Baryshnikov attacked an invisible keyboard.
The very real musicians were the violinist Guillermo Figueroa and Jerry Zimmerman who played the grand piano behind which the dancers were first seen. It was up to Mr. Figueroa to carry the burden of expressing the lyricism that was Stravinsky's concern here and he did so admirably.
Although other casts have danced this chamber ballet to chamber music since Peter Martins and Kay Mazzo originated the roles, the model has been the nobility of that first cast. Miss Borree, a corps member already cast prominently in the City Ballet repertory, and Mr. Baryshnikov made for a livelier, more realistic duo.
They stood and listened obediently by the piano in the opening Cantilena section and sprang into action for the next two Eclogues. The dancing looked more compact and snappier than usual, but its swoons, elongated with swanlike beauty by Miss Borree, presaged the final section. The Gigue contrasted Mr. Baryshnikov's bouncy phrasing against Miss Bourree's sleekness, although both blurred the small crossing steps.
The ballet's affected moments -- professional dancers holding hands like children -- become affecting at the end. In this Dithyramb the two dancers seek each other in the darkness. Mr. Baryshnikov threw himself down before his confident young ballerina with wonderfully blunt romantic ardor.
He was warmly received by the audience as were the casts in the other ballets, including Mr. Forsythe's "Herman Schmerman." In Balanchine's "Prodigal Son," Robert La Fosse reversed the Tom Sawyerish innocence of his duet with Helene Alexopoulos's wittly danced Siren with the heart-wrenching drama of his final scene. Peter Boal repeated his fine questing solo in Balanchine's "Square Dance," in which Nichol Hlinka gave every step more than full value through her exceptionally articulate dancing and musicality.

HEADLINE: U.S. Orchestras Face Up to Trouble And the Bottom Line

BYLINE: By BERNARD HOLLAND, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
The American Symphony Orchestra League gave itself some bad news this week and then set in motion a task force to deal with it. Most of the 2,000 delegates to this national service organization's annual convention arrived knowing their institutions were collectively in trouble, but a new report by the Wolf Organization, a consulting and research company in Cambridge, Mass., translates cloudy financial malaise into numbers and graphs; they tell a vivid, occasionally promising but mostly distressing story.
The study leaves solutions to musicians, managers and trustees but suggests, almost demands, fundamental changes in the way American orchestras do business with their communities, sources of funds and subscribers. High on the list of targets is the idea of growth as an unquestioned goal. Does health, indeed survival, lie in more listeners, more money and wider recognition through tours and recordings, or will it ultimately depend on staying at home, thinking small and tending to one's own increasingly reluctant constituents? Larger cities especially are offering a complicated mosaic of musical cultures not necessarily dominated by European art music. 
 Here is one item picked from many in this study: In 1971 it cost an average of $5 to nurture a single ticket buyer; it now costs $26. Audience building has become so expensive a job that a point of diminishing returns approaches. In the last five years, while overall expenses are up by 42 percent, the cost of fund-raising and marketing have gone up by 52 and 57 percent, respectively.
 
'Too Much Product'
 While the problems appear to be financial, the answers are only partly so. The Wolf report suggests that orchestras are suffering from "too much product" and that these large numbers of concerts stem not from audience demand but from labor agreements with musicians, in other words from year-round contracts involving year-round concerts. These necessitate more events, more tickets to sell, more money to raise. Among America's 19 largest orchestras, the average number of performances annually has increased in the last 25 years to 195 from 146, or by 34 percent. (Although there are about 1,600 American orchestras -- amateur, professional and in between -- the Wolf report deals with the industry's 254 heaviest hitters.)
Musicians' salaries, the major item in every orchestra budget, are often blamed for rampant deficits, but the report shows that in the top 20 orchestras player salaries in the last 20 years have kept 6 percent ahead of inflation and that in smaller orchestras musicians have lost ground to it. "Artistic personnel" expenses are said to be rising at just about the same rate as every other kind.
During Thursday afternoon's open discussion of the Wolf report at the Washington Hilton and Towers, Deborah Borda, the managing director of the New York Philharmonic, urged an end to the confrontational stance between musicians and management and asked for a restructuring of management that would place players at the highest decision-making levels. Interestingly, there were few musicians at the convention.
Ms. Borda also spoke positively of the Philharmonic's projected attendance rate of 96 percent and its new range of programs. Although the same problems afflict every orchestra, the handful of major ones including New York, Chicago, Boston, Cleveland and Philadelphia will continue to operate on the relatively grand scale to which they are accustomed. Midlevel orchestras -- Albany, San Antonio or New Orleans, for example -- continue to be the most vulnerable.
 
Audiences Are Up
 Not all the news was bad. Orchestras are regularly playing to 1,500 people per performance rather than the 1,200 of 10 years ago. And while every other performing arts discipline lost ground in the percentage of its earned income between 1985 and 1990 (as opposed to donated income), orchestras increased theirs. Endowments, helped by a roaring stock market, are up almost 38 percent; the figure would be higher were it not for the increasing practice among smaller orchestras of plundering their endowments for operating expenses.
Yet orchestras' share of the philanthropic arts dollar has dropped by one third in 20 years. Other art forms have improved their sales techniques and are formidable competition. The Wolf report also warns that the failure of orchestras to train minority musicians, work for minority audiences and shed an elitist image ("white, rich and almost dead" as one panel member characterized his subscribers) is trying the patience of generous people with money.
Dreams of talking various Federal, state and municipal agencies into supplying 25 percent of orchestra budgets have long since been dashed. Public sector giving is down 4.3 percent in the last five years and, given the climate at the National Endowment for the Arts these days, Government support for orchestras may end up below the 8 percent currently forecast for the year 2000.
 
Reaching Out
 The Wolf report also questions the wisdom of relying on a single urban concert hall and urges orchestras to take music to surrounding areas rather than wait for listeners to come to them. Also foreseen is a trend away from 100-person, fully contracted, year-round orchestras and a tendency toward ensembles with a small core of contract players augmented by part-timers.
The report notes with some asperity that in the 1940's, experts recommended orchestras earn more income. They did. In the next two decades, bigger endowments were pushed. They grew. In the 1970's, pursuit of government help was advised. It failed. In 1992, American orchestras as a whole -- despite their considerable musical achievements -- are financially worse off than ever.

Letting Fundamentalists Tell Their Own Stories

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
Everyone knows that religious fundamentalism is on the upsurge around the globe, but exactly what the term signifies is less clear. It is applied to movements that are distinguished as much by their differences as by their similarities. So welcome to "The Glory and the Power: Fundamentalisms Observed," an enlightening three-part PBS series on aspects of fundamentalism in the United States, Israel and Egypt.
The first part, "Fighting Back," tonight at 9 on Channels 13 and 49, concentrates on Bob Jones University in South Carolina, which has been called the West Point of fundamentalism. This family enterprise -- run by Dr. Bob Jones Jr. and Dr. Bob Jones 3d, son and grandson of the founder -- holds fast to values that have lately become a subject of impassioned contention in national politics and some amusement on late-night television. 
 Bill Jersey, the executive producer of the series and the producer of this part, sensibly avoids comment and allows the school's staff and students to show and tell. There is a home economics class where young women learn that the Bible sets fashions for female dress that do not give young men the wrong idea. A similar teaching can be found in Islam, too.
Theology classes learn that women are inferior to men ("That is the way God made it," says Bob Jones 3d), but with big responsibilities of their own. The female students interviewed seem satisfied. One says admiringly that there is "so much order here." In an unsettled and unsettling world replete with moral ambiguities, faith evidently provides security for those who can embrace it without too many questions. The school, which was denied tax-exempt status by the Federal Government a few years ago because of its racial discrimination, has black students but does not permit interracial dating, presumably another biblical injunction.
Although all fundamentalist movements are marked by faith and fervor, the differences among them run deep. At Bob Jones University, with its separatist approach to religion, Billy Graham is considered too inclusive and Jerry Falwell too political. The Bob Jones students who go out as evangelists ("The blood is on you if you don't evangelize," a teacher warns) preach a personal salvation that is quite different from the anti-abortion calls of Randall Terry, the head of Operation Rescue, who is seen in action.
An exploratory spirit also imbues next week's program, "This Is Our Land," an absorbing close-up of Israel's small but politically potent Gush Emunim movement. To its members, settlement of the West Bank is godly work. And the third program, "Remaking the World," tells of some upper-class Egyptians who are making a political case for a return to Islamic values. In Egypt as in Israel, the narration makes plain, these fundamentalists so far represent a minority of orthodox believers.
From tonight through Thursday, at 6:30 P.M., National Public Radio will broadcast four half-hour documentaries on fundamentalism in the United States, Guatemala, the Middle East and India. Next week it will have a two-hour discussion of the themes in the radio and television programs. "The Glory and the Power" makes the sort of contribution to its audience's understanding of a significant phenomenon that justifies public broadcasting's franchise.
 
Nightline
ABC
Tonight at 11:30
The name Joel Barr is likely to ring a bell only for buffs of the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed 39 years ago this Friday for conspiring to pass atomic secrets to the Soviet Union. Mr. Barr, a close friend of Julius Rosenberg and a fellow Communist, worked on American military projects in World War II. He went to Eastern Europe in 1948, shortly before the F.B.I. began its Rosenberg-ring investigation.
Tonight, at 11:30 on ABC, "Nightline" tells how Mr. Barr and Alfred Sarant, another engineer close to the Rosenbergs, wound up in Leningrad as high-level scientists working on Soviet military projects, with many perks and the special blessing of Nikita S. Khrushchev. Home photographs show Mr. Barr and Mr. Sarant, who died in 1979, disporting with their new families and marching in some sort of parade. Their story makes a curious sidebar to the history of the cold war.
In an interview with a skeptical Ted Koppel, Mr. Barr denies doing any spying but seems a bit abashed at having worked for the Soviet military all these years. "Politically, I think you're a dunce," Mr. Koppel informs him. The tale of intrigue turns into comedy when Mr. Barr, who has been allowed back into the United States, is seen waving his Communist Party card at a student Trotskyist at Columbia University. The humor mounts as he reports he is now collecting Social Security and looking for investors in a Russian computer-chip company. The final punch line: he says he voted for Edmund G. Brown Jr. in the New York Democratic primary.

HEADLINE: The Road From Rio

 BODY:
It's tempting to deride the just-completed Earth Summit as a noisy, irrelevant circus. Tempting, but wrong, and a disservice to the environmental challenges ahead.
True, some developing countries seemed more interested in an abstract "right to development" than in concrete problems like explosive population growth. Some developed countries proved readier to preach clean development than to change perverse incentives that make environmental degradation the path of least resistance. 
 And the Bush Administration went out of its way to appear obstructionist, even when its underlying positions were reasonable.
Yet most delegations sought realistic compromises, with host Brazil working hard to broker differences. The failure to reach precise treaty commitments reflects the difficulty of reconciling national sovereignty with global citizenship.
The summit did manage to focus world attention on carbon emissions, biodiversity and forest preservation. As President Bush emphasized in his address Friday, all participants now have an obligation to follow through with concrete actions.
The richer countries also have an obligation to follow through with the financial resources needed to make clean development a realistic option for poor societies. Even before the summit, the U.S. contributed less than its fair share to global development. But the chances for any significant increase, at least this year, are nil.
Still, a lot can be done by shifting resources from obsolete cold war aid programs and by encouraging greater environmental sensitivity from multilateral institutions like the World Bank.
The Overseas Development Council, which analyzes changing aid priorities, identifies several programs that could be phased out of America's international affairs budget. These include payments related to military bases in NATO countries, arms sales subsidies and broadcasting ventures like Radio Free Europe.
Such changes could free as much as $5 billion a year. Other programs could be given a new environmental focus, and administered through the proposed Sustainable Development Commission.
Export credits could also be creatively used. And U.S. companies could follow the path of their European and Japanese competitors, many of whom see profit-making possibilities in developing and marketing clean technology.
This week, Senators Al Gore and Pete Domenici plan to propose legislation that would involve America's national laboratories in adapting environmentally friendly technology to the needs of poorer countries. Recipient nations would be asked to pay a share of the costs.
Aid channeled through the World Bank can shape development patterns. This includes not only the bank's new Global Environmental Facility, but also its low-interest International Development Association and conventional project lending. Major contributors like the U.S. need to pressure the bank to make environmental impact a decisive lending test.
The road from Rio will undoubtedly prove to be as contentious and frustrating as the conference. But now, after the Earth Summit, there's a road.

HEADLINE: How Columbia Weathers the Economic Storm;
Meanwhile, at Yale

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Benno Schmidt Jr., departing as president of Yale University to lead the new Edison Project (front page, May 26), leaves behind a campus that has become a national symbol for the financial problems plaguing higher education in this country.
Mr. Schmidt's two surprisingly different ventures -- leading an established Ivy League institution and forming a revolutionary private school system -- have in common his approach to education. At Yale, he stressed fiscal order through fund raising and budgetary restructuring. At Whittle Communications, he seeks strengthened secondary education through competition and choice. 
 For Mr. Schmidt, the economic principles of running a business have become the dominant metaphor for running an academic institution. That philosophy may explain why his accomplished six-year tenure remained steeped in controversy to the end.
If Mr. Schmidt ran Yale as a business, he did not always preside over
business as usual. The financial turmoil capping his presidency has overshadowed the "commuter president" resentment he built up visiting his wife in New York during his early years. That turmoil has sparked two years of fierce, often bitter campus debate. It has prompted the resignations of two high-ranking officials, the provost and college dean. And it has spurred news media reports describing Yale as a financially beleaguered campus.
Despite the uproar, Yale's fiscal prognosis seems relatively healthy. Yale has, along with its competitors, been forced to grapple with decreasing Federal research financing, flattening income streams and soaring operating expenses. In addition, Yale must make up for decades of neglect to its buildings.
But Mr. Schmidt has limited Yale's first budget deficit in a decade to $15 million, far outstripped by the more than $40 million shortfalls at Harvard, Stanford and Columbia. He stands among the few presidents to protect unequivocally funds for need-blind admissions and competitive faculty salaries. He has filled fund-raising coffers with $600 million. If anything, Yale should be a model of a common disease, not a unique malaise.
At Yale, there is a chasm between perception and reality that rivals the budget gap. In the effort to impose financial stability on academic undertakings, Yale's management has lost the collegiality fundamental to its functioning. For Mr. Schmidt, the mistake did not lie in doing the right thing. It was a matter of doing it the right way. The problem, critics said, was not principally the decisions. It was the process.
Take the elimination of academic departments. Provost Frank Turner led a yearlong evaluation, which produced recommendations for slashing 10.7 percent of Yale's faculty positions. The restructuring was assailed as secretive, elite and off target. Three months and much acrimony later, the university will likely compromise on a 7 percent reduction. Similar lack of consultation in the creation of a new Western civilization program and the closing of a popular student dining hall have alienated both faculty members and students.
In the next academic year, Yale's mostly new administrators will complete plans to eliminate academic programs and shift long-term budget priorities. In the years ahead, reductions such as Yale's will become the rule, rather than the exception. Prominent universities from California to New York have projected budget cuts on a similar or larger scale.
Institutions of higher learning are much more than expensive corporations. Consequently, they must engage in an evaluation including the perspectives of all constituents with a role in the educational mission at stake.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Magazines Rebuild Advertising Ties

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
Still reeling from more than two years of declining advertising, the magazine industry is rethinking how it does business. The buzzword these days is "relationship marketing."
Nowhere was that more apparent than at a two-day publishing management conference at the Macklowe Conference Center in New York last week attended by virtually all of the industry leaders. The same themes reverberated through every session: 
 *Short-term promotional deals are out; long-term marketing is in.
*Long-term relationships with advertisers are being cultivated even if there is no immediate profit.
*Advertisers are more interested in fewer loyal readers who have a long-term bond with a magazine than in larger numbers who subscribe because of a promotional gimmick.
"Relationship marketing is a much bigger concept that holds much bigger potential for all of us," said Reginald K. Brack Jr. chairman and chief executive of Time Inc. "In fact, it is so big it may hold the answer to many of the challenges facing magazines in this decade."
 
A Change From the 1980's
 At conferences like this during the advertising-rich 1980's, magazines were simply referred to as "products" and the emphasis was on how much circulation they could deliver to advertisers. Now there is a new appreciation of the intrinsic value of the magazines themselves.
"We at DDB Needham are now evaluating magazine audiences strictly on the basis of what we call core readers: people who really look forward to each issue," said Michael White, executive vice president and director of media development at the ad agency DDB Needham Worldwide.
"They keep coming back because the magazine's editors have established a relationship with those readers to the point where those readers need the magazine," he said. "It provides a clear benefit not available elsewhere."
 
Popularity of Data Bases
 One new trend arising directly from the desire of publishers to strengthen the bond with advertisers is the increased use of data bases, a practice that has become one of the most important undercurrents in the magazine business. More than 50 magazines now use these data bases with their vast stockpile of information about readers' habits and preferences to provide services that advertisers want.
Marjorie M. Scardino, president of the Economist Newspaper Group Inc., which publishes The Economist and other financial and telecommunications magazines, said the company's data base enabled it to produce about 300 very focused publications, including newsletters, special reports and data services.
"The principal service we supply our readers is our editorial content and the credibility of the brand it bears," she said. "If you're thinking of doing business in Eastern Europe, we can give you a general interpretive overview on what the Serbs and Croats are doing in what's left of Yugoslavia or we can give you a proprietary research report on how to organize to sell light bulbs in Belgrade."
Custom publishing -- or printing special booklets for customers -- is also becoming an increasingly big business as publishers develop new ways to provide services to advertisers. Sometimes, these booklets or brochures may not make big profits, but they strengthen the bond between magazine and advertiser.
The Reader's Digest Association was one of the first companies to make such use of its data base, which now includes 50 million subscribers. For example, from 1976 to 1982, the company produced 30 eight-page "Shell Answer Booklets" for Shell Oil, which ran in The Reader's Digest and covered many issues that average consumers would have in taking care of their cars, said Gregory G. Coleman, vice president and publisher of the magazine.
"So many car owners had questions about cars that regular car ads were just not cutting it," he said.
"We took the relationship that we have with our 50 million readers and presented a somewhat complex story and made Shell the real authority. Shell spent $10 million with us, and they went from the No. 3 oil company in America to the No. 1."
The project was turned into a total marketing program, which expanded to the "Shell Answer Man" commercials on television. The Reader's Digest is now looking to develop similar programs for advertisers and produce them globally.
 
Meredith's Plans
 William T. Kerr, executive vice president of the Meredith Corporation and president of its magazine group, predicted that custom publishing would become an increasingly important business.
"We are going to see slower growth in advertising with continued pressure on advertising margins; we saw 9 percent growth in the 1980's versus 4 to 5 percent growth in the 1990's," he said. "I see a continued move to customized publishing."
As companies focus more on the "core franchises" or strong identity of each of their magazines, they continue to seek ways to spin off special publications that will reinforce that identity. The pre-eminent franchise for Meredith, for instance, is in the home and family markets with its magazines, which include Better Homes & Gardens, Midwest Living and Country Home and Country America.
"We are really going to continue to focus on these markets and stick to our knitting," Mr. Kerr said.

Gucci's Current Campaign: Recovering Its Elite Image

BYLINE: By Geraldine Fabrikant

 BODY:
HOW do you get Palm Beach patricians and Hollywood tycoons back into Gucci loafers after their secretaries start carrying Gucci handbags? That was the challenge facing Dawn Mello, the former president of Bergdorf Goodman who was given the mandate to revamp the Gucci image in 1990.
It has not been easy. In the early 1980's, Gucci went mass market, distributing its products not only in its 36 United States stores but through 600 retail outlets as well. That strategy ultimately tarnished Gucci's image and sales of its costlier items. 
 Then in 1989 Maurizio Gucci decided to close the 600 outlets, which cut the company's sales in half, to about $200 million, industry experts estimate. His goal: to focus on a line of costlier products developed by Ms. Mello at a time when consumers were being hurt by a recession and spending in general had slowed.
After joining Gucci as executive vice president, Ms. Mello immediately changed its $10 million international advertising campaign. In the late 1980's, the print campaign had been handled by McCann Erickson, but Ms. Mello hired Maria Scottsa, who had been with McCann in Milan, to work directly for the company.
The older print ads featured models dressed in Gucci clothes, posed in elegant locations. The focus, in Ms. Mello's view, was too much on atmosphere and too little on product.
In the new campaign, Gucci did not even use models. "We had no image, so we could not use people to represent it," Ms. Mello said in a telephone interview from Milan. "We wanted a clean, uncluttered format. At first we stayed with that look. We were still settling on our image. We did not use any models until the 1991 season. And even now, there are no props. It is strictly a feeling of warmth or cold. In the winter we shot in Brittany and in the springtime in the California desert. The background becomes a frame. The fall campaign is shot with snow. It has a blue cast."
Gucci's goal is to reach the shopper between ages 16 and 60, which means buying space in publications including Vogue, Architectural Digest, Conde Nast Traveler, The New York Times Magazine, Vanity Fair and GQ. While Gucci's $10 million budget makes it "a player," as one retailing executive put it, it cannot compete with larger rivals like Louis Vuitton, another manufacturer of costly leather goods, which spends an estimated $30 million on print advertising worldwide.
Ms. Mello said Gucci had bought space in all the major life-style and travel magazines. She said she had learned from her days at Bergdorf Goodman that "it takes three years before you feel the effect of an advertising campaign."
"The third season is when you feel it," she said. "That is why you should not change media midstream. I remembered that and took it into consideration."
Is the new marketing approach working? Many industry experts say Ms. Mello's products and her advertising campaign have given the company a new look. But an executive at a rival leather goods retailer said: "I don't know of a premium brand that has traded down and been successful at repositioning. They have gone outside the original core of what made their business in the first place. Can they bring back the exclusive nature and character of their trademark after selling to everyone, their neighbor and the maid?"
Because Gucci is now owned by Investcorp, a Bahrain-based partnership of Arab investors that does not make its results public, there is no certain way to evaluate its performance.
Edwin Rice, executive director of Landor Associates, consultants who specialize in building brand identities, said he thought Gucci was having difficulty because high-end fashion labels were less in vogue than they had been.
"People are putting their Rolex watches in the closet," he said. "High-end fashion does not seem to be in step with the 1990's."
Some retailers say that while a handful of products are selling nicely, including the loafers and the traditional Gucci handbag, over all there is no rush to buy the Gucci status symbols that once filled closets from Southampton to Bel Air.

HEADLINE: Senior Classes Seeking Jobs, Not Themselves

SERIES: Into Uncertainty: The Class of '92 -- First of three articles

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LINDEN, N.J., June 15

 BODY:
At 18, Eva Pitera has her future all figured out.
After she graduates from Linden High School on Friday, she starts a job as a nurse's assistant at a nearby hospital. . In the fall, she begins a nursing program at Bloomfield College. She expects that to enable her to become a registered nurse at the same hospital. 
 Thomas A. Donoghue, a varsity football player, dreams of becoming a Navy Seal. But first he'll complete an apprenticeship as a steelworker "as a back-up."
Tamara Waye, accepted to both Howard University and Spelman College, waits to see which one offers her the most financial aid.
So it goes at Linden High. The Class of 1992 has plans. And for most of its 275 members, the plans are as carefully drawn as the rows of rhododendrons that line the city's compact front lawns. There just aren't many June graduates thinking of spending the summer criss-crossing the country or backpacking through Europe, finding themselves. They want jobs. Or as Faisal Khan, an honors student who opted for Rutgers University over an out-of-state college "for practical, financial reasons," puts it: "We know what we want -- and what we can do."
At a time when "lingering recession" is the national mantra and last year's college graduates are still waiting on tables, the sense of caution here seems only natural. Students here live in a state that has lost 300,000 jobs since they entered high school. Its unemployment rate is at its highest level in a decade. That mood of uncertainty, mixed in varying parts with the unextinguishable optimism characteristic of those poised between childhood and adulthood, is echoed in members of the Class of 1992 in other high schools around the region.
At Horace Greeley High School in the affluent Westchester County suburb of Chappaqua, lavish graduation parties are accompanied by an insistent discomfort that this year's graduates may never match their parents' wealth. Seniors at Boys and Girls High School in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, face more immediate concerns: drug dealers on the corner, gunfire outside housing projects and a 33 percent unemployment rate for 16-to-19-year-olds in the neighborhood.
Linden High School's principal, Alvin Coplan, says he believes his level-headed senior class is actually less a reflection of the times than of its place. "Our students have always been sensible," he said. "I think it's the economics of Linden. It's a very stable community of people from hard-working backgrounds who care about their neighborhoods. The students mirror that."
A little more than half of Linden High's graduating seniors, 40 to 50 of whom are enrolled in advanced-placement classes, will go on to two-year and four-year colleges. The rest will sign up for military service -- the R.O.T.C. chapter has about 100 members -- try to find work or ply a trade. More than 300 students are enrolled in vocational and technical programs, taught across the street from the main campus in a modern building with a pond and tennis courts out back. School administrators say programs in subjects from auto mechanics to nursing keep expanding to meet demand.
"Many of our students are anxious to get out into the world, be able to buy a house and settle down," Mr. Coplan said.
Linden, with 37,000 residents, has long been defined by its working class. Immigrants came for the jobs. And even with the recession, the plants of American Cyanamid, Exxon and General Motors, belching smoke across the Arthur Kill, remain its largest employers.
 
Unions and Homeowners
 When shifts change, the streets swell. Blue collars dominate the morning rush-hour crowds dropping by diners for coffee to go. People here belong to unions and vote, usually for Democrats. Almost everyone owns a house, and children grow up knowing what it takes to keep one.
Trishette Hall, an honors student who joined the school's Reserve Officer Training Corps because it was an alternative to gym class, said she and her friends had heard stories about harsh times from their parents and grandparents. "My family on my mother's side is from Alabama," she said. "Their stockings at Christmas, when they could afford it, were nylons. They were filled with apples and oranges -- food. That was considered a treat."
Like the city itself, Linden's only high school is a modest place, best known in the state for its solid varsity teams and award-winning choir, the Madrigals.
Its 1,300 students are a cheerfully diverse mix rarely seen except on television shows. The city is about 80 percent white, but just over 50 percent of the students are white -- most from Polish, German, Italian, Slovak and Irish backgrounds -- and about 35 percent are black, including new Haitian immigrants. The rest are Hispanic, East Asian or Asian, said Jane Goode, a vice-principal.
 
'A Family Feeling Here'
 Students say there are some divisions between groups, but no real trouble. "We're all from Linden, which isn't big," said Tamara Waye, a peer leader who counsels freshman students. "The school isn't that big. So there is kind of a family feeling here."
When students are late or truant, their parents are promptly called. "Every kid who is late has to ring the front bell and pass my office," said Mrs. Goode, after making a call to the mother of a girl who had showed up at 10:45.
"The mother is Polish, and she doesn't speak much English," Mrs. Goode added. "But she understands the language a lot better after a year of these conversations."
Many teachers taught or went to school with the parents of the teen-agers who sit in their classes today. Wayne Mehalick, who teaches biology and coaches girls' track, is a member of the Linden High School class of '66. He returned as a faculty member in '72. "You know, the kids don't change," he said. "They talk about boys, they talk about girls. When I was in high school, the school had dress codes. But it hasn't changed very much."
 
Rules Annoying, but Accepted
 Several seniors pointed to the rules of conduct for an all-night party planned for after their graduation on Friday as proof that the school did not take them as seriously as they would be taken in the working world. No one will be allowed to drive to the party, which is sponsored by the Mayor's office with broad community support. Students must ride school buses, and no one will be allowed to leave unless signed out in person by a parent. Needless to say, no alcohol will be served.
"On the one hand, they say we're adults," said Timothy Lynch. "We're 18, we vote, we drive. On the other hand, they imposed all these rules that treat us as children." (Nevertheless, almost the entire senior class had signed up by today, said Mrs. Goode.)
Compared with the schools of the inner city, Linden High is practically carefree. Conflicts are still fought with words or the occasional push-and-shove match. Students were disturbed by the verdict in the Rodney G. King beating case, but they backed away from a planned walkout.
Still, Linden is an urban school with urban problems. The students are not naive; they have seen classmates grow pregnant, use drugs and drop out. In all, about 30 students will drop out this year. But that figure includes transfers who are awaiting the necessary paperwork before beginning classes elsewhere and several students who have been referred to a remedial learning center, Mrs. Goode said.
But ask Linden's students to describe their city, and they will say merely that it is bor-ring. Not dangerous or troubled. Not even polluted, a charge that motorists on the New Jersey Turnpike are likely to make when passing Linden's oil refineries while rolling up their windows.
The students, most of whom seem to join at least one club, say the only thing to do in Linden is drive around. But an anti-cruising ordinance passed this year by the City Council imposes fines for driving back and forth, and several students say it has changed their habits. Now they drive to nearby towns or over the Goethals Bridge to Staten Island.
The seniors of Linden High may have clear, common-sense views of their futures, but that, they insist, doesn't mean that they are conformist. They say they are more directed and individualistic than their impressionable 1960's counterparts, more community-minded than the materialistic young people who defined the 80's.
"We have our goals and dreams," said Faisal. But in Linden, he said, where everyone knows that money is tight and worries about the fate of General Motors, economics is a big consideration.
"One of my best friends' father just got laid off from G.M.," Faisal said. His own father, who supports four children, works as a baggage department supervisor at Kennedy International Airport. "Choices come down to a lot of factors," he said.
"Yeah," said Courtney D. Swinger, who plans to attend the Philadelphia Art Insitute and study interior design. "It's, like, what's most practical?"

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN WASHINGTON;
Yeltsin, Leaving for U.S., Issues Decrees to Reinforce His Reforms

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 15

 BODY:
As he left today for a state visit to Washington, President Boris N. Yeltsin issued a series of decrees to underscore his commitment to economic reform and dispel skepticism in the West about his commitment to change.
The decrees, which were reported by the Itar-Tass news agency and are to take effect on July 1, included provisions for failing state enterprises to go bankrupt and for private companies to buy land, clearing away major obstacles to large-scale privatization of property. 
 Another measure would change the rules under which Russian companies sell their hard-currency earnings back to the Government, with the aim of easing the way for the introduction of a single conversion rate for the ruble.
 
Need for I.M.F. Accord
 But ruble convertibility still depends on the conclusion of an agreement with the International Monetary Fund. Growing doubts about Mr. Yeltsin's steadfastness in seeking free-market reforms recently led some economists to predict that the I.M.F. would delay approving a crucial $24 billion package of assistance for Russia -- including $6 billion for a fund to help stabilize the ruble and make it freely convertible.
The timing of the decrees left little doubt that they were intended to put such doubts to rest.
[Arriving in Washington, Mr. Yeltsin sought to strike a friendly note as negotiators for Russia and the United States raced to reach an agreement to slash nuclear arms. Page A12.]
The decrees signed today were apparently the "surprise" that Mr. Yeltsin promised to bring to the United States to show he is not deviating from the path to a market economy.
A stable, freely convertible ruble and, more broadly, the endorsement that an agreement with the monetary fund implies would help restore faith in the Russian economy and is considered vital to attracting Western investors. Mr. Yeltsin's decrees were evidently also intended to show that he is prepared to carry on with reforms with or without the Western assistance.
The Russian President said in an interview last week that he would not let the I.M.F. dictate the terms of his reforms, but he also talked of the importance that such an agreement would have to potential investors.
 
Firm on Oil Price Control
 There was no indication, however, that he had changed his mind against freeing oil prices, a measure on which the fund has placed considerable emphasis. Although Mr. Yeltsin has allowed significant increases in oil prices, enough to anger consumers, he has argued that letting prices soar to world levels now would make it impossible for state farms to complete the harvest because of the added costs for tractor fuel.
Two pivotal decrees were a detour around stubborn opposition in Parliament to important components of privatization.
One declares that companies that can not pay their debts within three months will be declared bankrupt and put up for sale in an auction that will also be open to foreign investors.
The decree opens the way for what Communists and other adherents of the old order have most feared, the actual closing or sell-off of the many decrepit state industries that have survived only on state subsidies. Among the most alarming consequences is a rapid rise in unemployment.
The Government has argued that the measure is crucial to economic recovery. Officials have given no indication of how many companies they expect to go bankrupt, or what level of unemployment will result.
Another decree establishes procedures for private companies to buy the land in which they operate. Under the measure, 80 percent of the fee would go to the local municipality, and the other 20 percent would be split by the regional and national governments.
Mr. Yeltsin also issued a decree affirming that Yegor T. Gaidar, the First Deputy Prime Minister most closely identified with a full-scale push to a market economy, remained the top man under him in the Government.
 
Headed to Premier's Post
 The decree in effect made Mr. Gaidar, who is 37 years old, the acting prime minister. The President himself still holds the title of Prime Minister, but the Interfax news agency reported tonight that he intended to nominate Mr. Gaidar to the post as soon as a pending Law on Government is passed.
Mr. Gaidar's standing came into question after Mr. Yeltsin appointed a former industrial manager, Vladimir Shumeiko, as another First Deputy Prime Minister, and two other former managers as Deputy Prime Ministers. The high-level introduction of men associated with state-controlled industry stirred speculation that Mr. Gaidar's hand had been weakened.
Mr. Yeltsin, however, has repeatedly insisted that three appointees with solid credentials as innovators and economic liberals would harness the expertise of industrial managers in the crucial new phase of privatization. The first phase of Russia's economic reforms, which began in January, dealt almost exclusively with freeing prices and tightening monetary policy. Today Mr. Yeltsin also tightened regulations on import tariffs and hard-currency earnings to increase Government revenues before the planned transition to a single ruble rate in July.
The ruble is currently traded at several widely varying rates, depending on whether the trade is among state enterprises, in special stores, between enterprises and the state, in banks or on the street. The tourist rate, which most closely follows the market, is now about 112 rubles to the dollar.
The Government has announced plans to introduce a single conversion rate for all transactions, with a target rate of 80 rubles to the dollar.
The measure would be an important step to full convertibility of the ruble, although various restrictions on the sale of the Russian currency would stay in place until the I.M.F. stabilization fund and other prerequisites were in place.
A decree issued by Mr. Yeltsin on changes "in the procedure for the mandatory sale of a portion of hard-currency earnings and collection of export tariffs" seems aimed in part at lowering resistance to turning hard currency over to the Government.
Enterprises are now required to sell 40 percent of their earnings to the Government, but at a fixed rate of 55 rubles to the dollar -- about half the market rate. The decree would retain the 40 percent requirement, but the sale would be at the market rate.

HEADLINE: Utilities Say '81 New York Law Is Proving Costly

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
New York State consumers will pay $4.5 billion or more in extra costs in the 1990's, according to the state's utilities, because of a law passed in Albany at the tail end of the last energy crisis.
The law was intended to nurture competition in electricity generation and improve efficiency by offering a minimum price to independent producers. Now those prices look extremely generous because of an unexpected drop in utilities' own costs. 
 The Cuomo administration is seeking a repeal of the law. But the industry that the law helped to create, independent power production, is lobbying hard to keep its provisions, at least for the time being.
 
Changing Conditions
 The conflict illustrates the pitfalls of long-term energy policy, with a law enacted at a time of high fuel prices and perceived shortages creating unexpected problems a decade later, after the energy market took an unexpected turn toward cheaper, more abundant supplies.
The law was meant to incubate small projects that use "renewable" fuels or that use oil and gas efficiently. It promised entrepreneurs who built generating stations that they could sell to utilities for a minimum price of 6 cents a kilowatt-hour. The utilities would then resell the electricity to their own customers.
The Consolidated Edison Company, which won its first rate increase in a decade in April, said one reason it needed to charge more was the expense of buying power from independent generators, even though its peak demand for power was falling.
The recession and an unexpected dip in fuel costs have left New York with a surplus of electricity and produced a crash in the wholesale price. Consequently, the utilities now say that they are required to pay 6 cents for power from the independents that they could make themselves for 3.
"We're being locked into contracts well above market levels," said Richard M. Flynn, the chairman of the New York Power Authority, who has been lobbying for a repeal. "The law was enacted back in 1981, and it was a different world in those days. We projected then that electricity prices would continue to rise."
Carol E. Murphy, the executive director of the Independent Power Producers of New York, a lobbying group in Albany, acknowledged that future projects should not be guaranteed 6 cents. But if existing contracts were abrogated, she said, no one would ever build another independent plant in New York. And the new plants are cleaner than the cheaper older ones owned by utilities, she said.
Still, the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, which serves a huge area of upstate New York, says that its deals with the independents will cost its customers an extra $3 billion. Customers of Con Edison, which serves New York City and most of Westchester, may pay $1 billion more and customers of the Long Island Lighting Company may pay $500 million, by those companies' estimates.
About 1,900 megawatts of independent power production is now on line, with another 4,700 megawatts under contract, according to Ms. Murphy, at a cost of about $10.6 billion. The total capacity of these plants is roughly 10 times the size of the abandoned Shoreham nuclear plant.
 
Demand Is Down
 One reason for the utilities' saying that the cost is excessive is that the demand for power is stable or shrinking because of the recession and because of aggressive promotion of conservation by utilities.
If demand was rising, then the choice would be between new capacity built by the utilities or by the independent producers. But the utilities say that currently if it were not for distortions of the energy market caused by public policy, no new capacity would have to be built at all. Ms. Murphy, speaking for the independent producers, said "what we have here is a very temporary energy glut." She added, "If you assume that some part of the utility system is going to have to be shut down or retired, the best guess of everyone is that we're going to need more power by the end of the century."
Ms. Murphy's position is that the cost of complying with the Federal Clean Air Act amendments of 1990 will sharply raise the utilities' cost estimate of 3 cents a kilowatt-hour. She added that the public would probably be willing to pay a premium for cleaner power. "If you ask people if they'd rather spend 6 cents for hydropower or 5 cents for a coal burner or a foreign-oil burner, most people would probably pick 6 cents," she said.
Nearly 500 megawatts of the 8,500 megawatts of existing and planned capacity is hydroelectric. Most of the rest is fired by natural gas, often generating steam for industrial use along with electricity, raising total efficiency. Under a Federal law, the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act of 1978, such co-generators and generators using clean sources have a guaranteed market for their power with the utilities.
Not everyone is convinced that the state contracts are such a bad deal for consumers. Another analyst, Christopher O. Ward, the assistant commissioner of energy policy and programs in New York City's Department of Telecommunications and Energy, said that the independent projects had another advantage, providing diversity of fuel in the electric system. He added that in utility planning, because of continuously changing circumstances, "you can't not take a risk."
 
Proposing Changes
 Mr. Flynn, however, said he would like a reorganized system for signing contracts, with the price not being set until late in the process, and a requirement that construction start soon after the contract is signed, to reduce the risk posed by changing conditions.
For her part, Ms. Murphy said that without a firm price in hand, financing such a project would be impossible. The utilities, she said, have never liked independent generators, and Mr. Flynn, she added, wanted to scuttle the contracts in retaliation for the demise of his agency's contract to buy power from Hydro-Quebec.
That contract was canceled as uneconomic earlier this year, an action the independent producers had lobbied for. Mr. Flynn said that just as the Hydro-Quebec contract had been canceled as uneconomic, other such contracts should be terminated.

HEADLINE: A Summer of Decisions for New York City's Newspapers

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
The summer of 1992 promises to be a watershed for New York City's major daily newspapers, with changes possible that could resolve major uncertainties about the futures of The Daily News and The New York Times and thereby affect the futures The New York Post and New York Newsday as well.
For a decade, New York City has been a roller coaster ride for its newspapers, with crisis after crisis in which either The News or The Post seemed poised for oblivion, only to be saved by concessions from unions, which seemed to help only for the moment. In the meantime, New York Newsday gathered strength and the economy declined. Robert Maxwell was hailed as a savior when he acquired The News last year after a violent five-month strike, but 10 months later, when his death highlighted the unraveling of his media empire, The News was again on the edge of an abyss, where it remains. 
 Though The New York Times has prospered, its long-term strength -- like that of all newspapers -- has required efficiencies that the city's powerful newspaper unions have been loath to address.
For The News and The Times, the critical issue centers on labor negotiations which, if successful, could usher in a new era at both papers.
"It could mean the end of all pushing and pulling and tugging around," said George E. McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades Council, the umbrella group for newspaper unions.
For The News, the stakes are life and death, and life for The News could well mean death for The Post and enduring headaches for New York Newsday. By Labor Day, the bankrupt Daily News could have a new lease on life or, in the extreme, may have ceased publication. On Thursday, formal -- and undoubtedly tough -- negotiations began between the unions and representatives of Conrad Black, the Canadian newspaper magnate who has made a proposal to buy The News and build a new printing plant if the unions are willing to make deep manpower cuts and other concessions.
By midsummer, The New York Times hopes to complete negotiations with six unions on long-term contracts that would significantly reduce labor costs and remove the last obstacle to opening a high-technology color printing plant in Edison, N.J. The Edison contracts would be the most important since 1974 when the paper signed a contract with the International Typographical Union that traded lifetime job security to existing employees for the right to take advantage of labor-saving computer technology. In effect, the Edison contracts would complete the process started nearly 20 years ago.
Peter S. Kalikow, the owner of The New York Post, said he was trying to forge a deal that would extricate his real-estate empire from bankruptcy and allow him to buy The News, which he says he would operate along with The Post. That may be the best -- perhaps, only -- way to assure The Post's long-term survival.
Should The News survive, it could be a formidable force, and New York Newsday is preparing to do battle. Last month, New York Newsday began to supplement its paid circulation in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Queens with free weekly advertising publications that go to 700,000 homes. Robert M. Johnson, the publisher, said the objective was to persuade advertisers to use New York Newsday exclusively, rather than buying space in several papers to saturate target audiences in the three boroughs.
After more than a decade of worry about its long-term survival, finding a rich new owner could make The News an odds-on favorite to survive if, as is widely believed by newspaper analysts, New York cannot support four major dailies. With the $450 million Edison plant in operation, The Times would be poised to move toward the 21st century with significantly reduced labor costs, a sophisticated distribution system, and the marketing advantages offered by color, all essential to the paper's continuing financial health.
And for union members, the objective is jobs that will not disappear.
For The Daily News, the start of face-to-face negotiations yesterday between eight unions and Mr. Black's representatives raises the curtain on the final stage of an effort to find a buyer for The News, which filed for bankruptcy in December after Mr. Maxwell's death.
 
Other Possible Buyers
 In addition to Mr. Black, who is the chairman of the Hollinger newspaper chain, Mortimer B. Zuckerman, a real estate developer and owner of U.S. News & World Report and The Atlantic, said he was preparing a proposal to acquire The News.
Pierre Peladeau, chief executive officer of Quebecor Inc., a Quebec-based newspaper company that publishes tabloids in Canada, said Friday that he thought it was likely that his company would submit a proposal to acquire The News, "after letting the others go through."
Another option -- in which the unions would effectively buy the paper with outside financial help -- is also being prepared as a last resort, as well as a bargaining strategy to wring the best terms from Mr. Black and Mr. Zuckerman. Richard Ravitch, one of three outside members of The News's board, is thought to be organizing the financing of union or management purchase. Mr. Ravitch, who is the president of the player relations committee of Major League Baseball, did not return phone calls.
There has been persistent speculation that should all else fail, Rupert Murdoch might acquire The News, which would require an exemption from Federal Communications Commission rules barring ownership of both a newspaper and a television station in the same market. In 1988, Mr. Murdoch was forced to sell The New York Post because his company, the News Corporation, also owns WNYW-TV, Channel 5.
But even with such an apparent wealth of alternatives, striking a deal for The News could prove very difficult because the prospective buyers of The News will be seeking cost cuts to put the chronically unprofitable paper into the black, and by far the biggest single expense is labor.
 
Cutting Labor Costs
 Martin E. Maleska, an investment banker at Veronis Suhler & Associates who is acting as spokesman for Mr. Black's negotiating team, said that wages account for about half of The News's total costs and that Mr. Black's initial proposal to the paper's unions called for reducing wage expenses by about one-third, which could mean the loss of 600 of the roughly 1,850 union jobs.
Mr. Black has also proposed language that would give him even greater control over the workplace than Mr. Maxwell achieved when he bought the paper from the Tribune Company after a bruising strike that resulted in a reduction of the work force by about a third.
Union leaders, who agreed to speak only on condition of anonymity, said that an agreement might be reached on staffing and work rules, but only if Mr. Black binds himself to investing in a new printing plant, which the unions regard as essential to The News's survival. In the mid-1980's, the unions made concessions to the Tribune Company in exchange for what they thought was a guarantee to build a printing plant, and became enraged when the company later denied making such a pledge.
Should Mr. Black acquire The News, he "is committed to building a plant," which could cost $300 million, Mr. Maleska said.
But Mr. Maleska said Mr. Black could not justify making such an investment unless The News generated an operating cash flow of roughly 25 percent of annual revenues, which would be a vast change for the chronically unprofitable paper. Cash flow refers to the cash available from a business, and includes operating profit, plus depreciation and amortization of investment in new equipment.
The News's annual revenue is roughly $250 million, and meeting Mr. Black's standard would mean generating about $60 million a year in cash flow, with about $35 million of that coming from operating profit. The News had an operating loss of about $6 million in the first five months of this year.
The other critical constituency in the situation is the group of creditors, who are owed about $43 million by The News. People familiar with Mr. Black's proposal who spoke on condition of anonymity said that he has indicated that between $10 million and $20 million would be available to settle creditor claims, which would probably be acceptable to the creditors.
Another potential complication is the prospect that the administrators of Mr. Maxwell's interests may try to recover some of the money that Mr. Maxwell may have illegally funneled through The News from pension funds of some of his other businesses. In an article in The News last week, the paper said its position was that the funds were not used for News business and therefore no repayment is required.
Though separate, the negotiations at The News are related to negotiations at The Times. The hard-fought agreement last month between The New York Times and the union representing its truck drivers suggests the city's newspaper unions are prepared to make major concessions in exchange for long-term job security.
Also, The Times has said that when it begins operations at the new plant in Edison, it plans to abandon its plant in Carlstadt, N.J. Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., the publisher of The Times, said representatives of both Mr. Black and Mr. Zuckerman had inquired about the availability of the Carlstadt plant for The News, but he said the plant would not be available unless The Times resolved its own outstanding union negotiations and obtained a site for a second new plant, which might be built later in the decade.
Mr. Sulzberger expressed optimism that the negotiations on the Edison plant would be resolved. Informal and formal meetings are already under way with six production unions.

A GRADUATING CLASS MULLS ITS FUTURE
The Class of 1992 at Linden High in Linden, N.J., has plans, and for most of its 275 members, the plans are as carefully drawn as the rows of rhododendrons that line the city's compact front lawns. But at a time when "lingering recession" is the national mantra, there is a sense of caution within the class that seems only natural. That mood of uncertainty, mixed in varying parts with the unextinguishable optimism characteristic of those poised between childhood and adulthood, is echoed in members of the Class of 1992 in other high schools around the region.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN WASHINGTON;
Russians Say I.M.F. Demands May Nullify Benefits of Loans

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
Officials negotiating Russia's aid package with the International Monetary Fund asserted today that the fund was seeking to impose demands so burdensome that they could weaken the nation's teetering economy and nullify many of the benefits of a $24 billion aid package for Russia.
In high-stakes public posturing aimed at winning American support, these negotiators sought to pressure the I.M.F. not to be so tough on Russia just hours before President Boris N. Yeltsin arrived here for a summit meeting at which economic aid will be high on the agenda. 
 The negotiators said that in seeking to work out a reform agreement, the monetary fund was calling for such stringent restrictions on the use of a planned $6 billion fund to stabilize the ruble that the fund would be rendered almost meaningless. The talks resume in Moscow this week.
Moscow's negotiators also said the I.M.F. was squeezing Russia by asserting that much of the $3 billion in loans intended for the country should be used to build up hard currency reserves, rather than to finance imports of spare parts and raw materials desperately needed by Russian industry.
Speaking at a conference in Washington, Petr Aven, Russia's Minister for Foreign Economic Relations, also said the I.M.F. was delaying an accord by paying too much attention to small details when the important thing was that Russia was embracing sweeping reforms to create a market economy.
"It is urgent to get this aid moving, given the crisis in Russian industry," said Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economics professor who is helping Russia negotiate with the I.M.F. He said delays in signing an agreement were unfortunate because Moscow broadly agrees with the I.M.F on the need for swift and comprehensive reform.
At the same conference, Michel Camdessus, the I.M.F.'s managing director, said the fund was seeking a strong agreement that would help lock Russia into its reform. Russia has to sign a monetary fund reform agreement to unblock much of the $24 billion aid package that the Group of Seven industrial nations promised last April.
 
Baker Urges No Delay
 With the I.M.F.-Russia dispute heating up, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Treasury Under Secretary David C. Mulford stepped into the fray to mediate. Mr. Baker said the Russians needed to continue their reforms, but added that the I.M.F. should not delay a pact because of "the crossing of each and every 't' and the dotting of each and every 'i'."
Professor Sachs said another problem was that if the other former Soviet republics do not pay this year's debt service of roughly $6 billion, the I.M.F. says Russia should pay it from the $24 billion in Western aid. He said this would greatly decrease the beneifts of the aid package and should not be counted as part of the package. I.M.F. officials note that Russia has agreed to be jointly responsible for the debts of other republics.
Monetary fund officials criticized the public campaign by the Russians to pressure on them. They said Mr. Sachs was wrong to object to the strict conditions the I.M.F. sought to place on the stabilization fund. "If we gave the Russians the fund under the terms they want, the money would would disappear into a black hole in two days," one monetary fund official said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House;
Quayle Attacks New York as Home of Liberal Failure

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
A month before the Democratic Party arrives in New York for its national convention, Vice President Dan Quayle returned here yesterday to lambaste the party's liberal leaders, warning, "We must not let them do to the rest of America what they have done to the people of New York City."
Attacking policies ranging from condom distribution in schools to high local taxes to rent control, and politicians like Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, whom he dismissed as "liberalism's sensitive philosopher-king," the Vice President used a speech to the Manhattan Institute, a conservative policy research group, to paint New York anew as the epitome of liberalism's failures. 
 It was the latest in a series of attention-getting election-year speeches in which the Vice President has struck out at issues, policies or personalities that conservatives see as embodying liberal excesses. It echoed sentiments that Mr. Quayle had made in a speech to the Economic Club of New York in February.
 
Counterattack Was Ready
 But this time, local politicians were forearmed by days of news reports heralding Mr. Quayle's trip, which also included a private 55-minute meeting with John Cardinal O'Connor to discuss abortion and other issues. Even before Mr. Quayle's midday speech, Mayor David N. Dinkins had issued a three-page statement condemning it, and Mr. Cuomo had dispatched Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine to the steps of City Hall to complain that Mr. Quayle was simply recycling an old Republican strategy of attacking the disorders of urban America to play to his President's conservative base.
In fact, Mr. Quayle injected himself into issues -- like rent control and condom distribution -- that not only divide New Yorkers themselves, but that Republicans have also long insisted should be left strictly in the hands of local governments and school boards. His prescriptions for change rested on broad exhortations to hold down taxes, turn over some city services to the private sector and teach "basic values" in public schools -- all issues over which the Federal government has little control and with which New York City and State have been grappling for months.
"Here is what's right with New York: the decent, hard-working people who live here," Mr. Quayle said in his 20-minute speech at the Waldorf-Astoria. "Here's what's wrong with New York: the entrenched government establishment and its liberal ideology that have failed them.
"In so many ways the liberal Democrats chose the perfect site for their convention -- almost as if they feel a strange compulsion to return to the scene of the crime," Mr. Quayle said. "And as we watch this spectacle on our televisions, I suspect many Americans from around the country will be left with this conviction: We must not let them do to the rest of America what they have done to the people of New York City."
 
An Easy Target
 Mr. Quayle is far from alone in sounding the theme of New York as a failed metropolis. Last summer, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, now the Democrats' presumed nominee, was quoted as saying that holding the convention in New York was "a risk," because it could make the Democrats seem to be supporting "status-quo programs and interests that don't work."
Mr. Clinton later said his remarks had been distorted, but he has approached urban problems warily, preferring to characterize them as national problems and declining to embrace a large Federal aid package backed by the United States Conference of Mayors.
Still, the Vice President's analysis failed to discourage Mr. Dinkins and other local officials who hope to use the convention as a showcase for the city's strengths. They often complain that under the Reagan and Bush Administrations, the share of the city's budget financed by Federal funds has shrunk from nearly 20 percent a decade ago to just over 10 percent now, depriving it of perhaps $30 billion in total aid.
"I think it is rather sad that this person, who is a heartbeat away from the Presidency, who could, like that, become the leader of the free world, would occupy himself in such a fashion," the Mayor said late yesterday. "Would that he would spend that same energy to try to find a resolution to some of the problems that beset our cities and our country, and we've got a lot of them."
 
Values, Not Condoms
 In his speech, Mr. Quayle again promoted the "family values" he has been touting for days, saying at one point that "our schools are in a crisis because they have, in many ways, lost their moral bearings.
"When eighth-graders are squandering the gift of youthful innocence in premarital sex, the solution is not to give them a condom," he said. "The solution is to give them a value-based education, to teach them what is right and wrong, to teach them that they and they alone are responsible for their actions."
Later, he added, "My friends, there is only one school of life's true values and that is the family, especially the traditional family."
But he had a harder time with a question from a member of his audience who asked what the Administration had done to support family values. He answered by saying that for one thing, he was talking about them, and that the Federal Government spent billions of dollars a year on education. He even cited a Great Society social idea, the Head Start early education program.
 
'Let's Play Ball'
 For his part, Mr. Cuomo, a frequent target of the Vice President's barbs, could not resist a taunt of his own, challenging Mr. Quayle in a live interview on the WNWY-TV program "Good Day New York" to a game of one-on-one basketball.
"If you really want to come and make a fool of yourself, bring your jock and a pair of sneakers and let's play ball," the Governor said.
Mr. Quayle later told reporters: "You better tell Mario before he takes me on in basketball he'd better have his scouts out there, because this is serious business for this Hoosier."

HEADLINE: U.S. Reports a Stronger Saddam Hussein

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
Despite stringent economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq is stronger now than he was a year ago, according to a classified intelligence report that will be presented to President Bush and his chief aides.
The interagency report, known as a National Intelligence Estimate, concludes that Mr. Hussein has begun to rebuild some of his country's infrastructure by importing goods from Jordan in violation of the United Nations-mandated sanctions and by tapping into hidden Iraqi reserves, said Administration officials familiar with the report. It also states that he is trying to reconstitute his military and is strengthening his political base by imposing more repressive measures on his population. 
 On the other hand, the report says that as long as the sanctions are in place, living conditions for most people in Iraq will continue to worsen and pressures on Mr. Hussein will increase.
The conclusions of the report reflect a change in nuance rather than a radical departure from previous intelligence analyses about Mr. Hussein's position. Soon after the Iraqi leader suppressed rebellions by Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south, the Central Intelligence Agency concluded that he could remain in power for years. At the time, some senior White House, Pentagon and State Department officials were portraying Mr. Hussein as getting weaker by the day.
 
'We Expect Him to Stay'
 "This is not a flip-flop in our thinking, but more a question of degree," an Administration official said in describing the report. "The main point is that Saddam is still there and we expect him to stay. It used to be that people were saying that the sanctions were making him weaker. They're not saying that anymore. He is clearly stronger than he was a year ago."
When asked at a press breakfast last week about Mr. Hussein's ability to survive, James R. Lilley, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, said, "As long as he's able to get his hands on enough stuff to buy off his cronies, the Republican Guard, his chances of staying in power are pretty good."
The report, which reflects the thinking of the Central Intelligence Agency and the other intelligence agencies, was formally approved on Thursday and is scheduled to be distributed to Mr. Bush and senior officials this week.
Its timing is particularly embarrassing for Mr. Bush, who has had to defend his Administration's conciliatory policies toward Iraq before its invasion of Kuwait against both Democratic critics in Congress and Ross Perot, who have accused him of appeasing Mr. Hussein and leading the United States into a war that might have been avoided.
One factor that has enhanced Mr. Hussein's position is the widespread smuggling of construction materials, industrial, electrical and communications equipment, spare parts and luxury goods to Iraq from Jordan in violation of economic sanctions imposed soon after the August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Intelligence officials also suspect illegal shipments of military-related equipment.
 
Rules for Jordan Trade
 Under rules set up by the Security Council, Jordan sends large amounts of food and medicine to Iraq through its port at Aqaba and overland across its 100-mile border with Iraq.
But Iraq has been allowed to set up a number of exporting offices in Amman, and satellite photos show virtually no truck traffic at the border, indicating that Jordan is doing little or nothing to stanch the flow of goods across the border, American intelligence officials said. A senior Administration official estimated that about 30 percent of all trade from Jordan to Iraq was illegal.
Iraq is believed to have drawn on reserves from secret foreign bank accounts and sales of gold reserves to pay for the embargoed goods, senior United Nations officials say.
Mr. Bush is said to be particularly distressed at the scale of the smuggling, particularly because he received a pledge from King Hussein during his visit to the White House last March to abide by the international sanctions.

HEADLINE: Republicans Seek to Sell New Jersey Nonprofit TV

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 15

 BODY:
Republican legislative leaders unveiled a plan today to allow the transfer of the New Jersey Network public television system to an outside noncommercial television operator, most likely Channel 13/WNET in New York.
The Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco, and the Assembly Speaker, Garabed Haytaian, who lead overwhelming Republican majorities that dominate the State Legislature, said the plan to transfer the system, which the state owns and operates, would cut costs and mean "more independent" programming. 
 George L. Miles Jr., executive vice president and chief operating officer of WNET-TV, who joined the two legislative leaders at a news conference announcing the plan this morning, said his station was "committed" to negotiating with the state regarding the network's operations.
But William F. Baker, the president of WNET, said in a telephone interview today that the plan was fraught with difficulties and by no means certain. "It's not a fait accompli," he said. "It's only a beginning."
 
New Jersey Must Stay
 Among the difficulties is a requirement that WNET continue most of a heavy schedule of New Jersey programming now provided by the New Jersey Network.
"We would have to provide it all on our outlet," he said, adding that the rule could create difficulties in a market that would include New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Just how much New Jersey programming viewers in other states would tolerate remains a question, Mr. Baker said.
He said that he was nonetheless intrigued by the idea of taking on a larger audience. "We are both poor entities, and combining us would give us some clear benefits, but the risk is in taking on other liabilities," he said.
In proposing to divest the state of the network, Mr. Haytaian and Mr. DiFrancesco cited the high costs as the chief reason.
 
A Potential Windfall
 Mr. DiFrancesco also cited a potential windfall that he said could result from the state's selling three North Jersey stations that are now part of the network. "We could try to convert NJN's UHF stations in North Jersey -- channels 50, 52 and 58 -- to commercial outlets and sell them to private operators for as much as $150 million," he said. The stations are WNJM, Channel 50, in Montclair; WNJT, Channel 52, in Trenton, and WNJB, Channel 58, in New Brunswick.
But a spokesman for the Federal Communications Commission in Washington quickly threw cold water on the sale idea. Beyond the optimistic assessment of how much the stations might be worth, the transfer of their noncommercial broadcast licenses to a commercial operator would be illegal, said Stephen Sewell, a spokesman for the commission.
"As the rules now stand," Mr. Sewell said, "they cannot be used for commercial operation. We would not approve a transfer."
But the two Republican leaders seemed determined to press the plan as part of a broad program of privatization they envision.
 
State Aid Cut in Half
 They said the state's new budget, to be announced later this month, would appropriate only $4 million for the New Jersey Network, a reduction of 50 percent from last year's $8 million.
"We expect that this will take the station through the first six months of this year, until negotiations are finalized," Mr. Haytaian said.
Mr. Haytaian said it was too early to speculate on future appropriations for noncommercial television, adding that New Jersey pays about 60 percent of the cost of operating its network, compared to an average of 25 percent for other states that support some noncommercial television.
As outlined, the transfer of NJN would be accomplished by abolishing the New Jersey Public Broadcasting Authority, the state agency that now oversees the network, and transferring its functions and employees to the Department of Commerce, Energy and Economic Development.
 
Cut Cord, Keep Plug
 Mr. DiFrancesco insisted that he and Mr. Haytaian have "no intention of pulling the plug on public television in New Jersey." Instead, he said, the bill introduced today would "allow public television in our state to retain its own unique identity while cutting the umbilical cord between public television and state government."
In a letter to Mr. DiFrancesco on June 10, released today, Mr. Miles said that WNET was "enthusiastic" about beginning discussions for a takeover, and he pledged to "establish a major presence" in Trenton and "maintain a news bureau in South Jersey."

HEADLINE: Basketball Title Brings Chicago Night of Looting

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 15

 BODY:
When the sun rose over the city's West Side today, Frank Ingram tiptoed through the shards of glass on the floor of his looted pawn shop, his dreams shattered during a night of celebration turned ugly.
A few hours earlier, the shop was overrun by looters when hundreds of people spilled into the streets throughout the city following the Chicago Bulls' defeat of the Portland Trailblazers to win their second straight National Basketball Association championship. 
 Before the night was over, 100 people were injured, 95 of them police officers. More than 1,000 people were arrested; 61 police vehicles damaged, including 4 by gunfire, and several fires set. Officials this evening had no count of the number of stores looted and no financial estimate of the damage.
 
Cars Turned Over
 Looters ravaged stores on the West and South Sides, and hundreds of revelers streamed down fashionable North Michigan Avenue at 1 A.M., shattering a string of windows.
In the Rush Street area, Chicago's Near North Side night club district, hundreds of people poured into the street when the game ended shortly after 9 P.M. They surrounded two taxicabs and turned them over like children's toys. Dozens of men then began jumping on the cars, diving head first into the growing crowd.
One cab started burning, and the other was pushed through the plate glass window of an ice cream shop.
"Some people got cut with glass but they just kept jumping," said Frank Rosales, the manager of the Five Faces ice cream shop on Division Street. "We were scared. At one point, gasoline started leaking from one of the cabs and people started throwing matches and lit cigarettes into the gas."
 
Trapped in Burning Store
 In apparently the worst incident of violence, a store employee and his friend suffered burns when looters set a South Side liquor and grocery store afire. The employee, Khalid Hasan Ali-Rifagee, 23 years old, was listed in serious condition today, and his friend, Cindy Schanstra, 23, was listed in fair condition.
The couple were in the store when looters rammed their car through a security gate to break in. The two hid in a crawl space as the looters rampaged through the store and then set it on fire, said John Easton, a spokesman at the University of Chicago Hospitals, where Mr. Ali-Rifagee and Miss Schanstra were taken.
"They were afraid to leave because they could hear gunshots outside," Mr. Easton said. "But when the smoke got too bad, they left."
From the hospital today, Miss Schanstra said that she and Mr. Ali-Rifagee had called the police four times as the looters banged on the door. "The cops still didn't show up," she said. "We're kind of disappointed in the police. If they had shown up, it wouldn't have gone on as long as it did and I wouldn't be sitting here in this hospital now."
She said the store owner finally arrived and helped them to safety.
The other three reported civilian injuries involved shootings, two people shot by store owners and one 23-year-old man who shot by a police officer on the West Side after he threatened the officer with a gun, the authorities said.
Up and down one block of Madison Street on the West Side, about two miles from the Chicago Stadium where the basketball game was played, stores owned by black, white, Korean and Middle Eastern merchants were looted and in at least one case, burned.
Firefighters, protected by the police, continued to wet down a charred department store still smoldering hours after it was set ablaze.
"They were not discriminating in the devastation," said the area's alderman, Ed Smith. "They hit them all. They even hit the post office and the phone company."
The superintendent of police, Matt Rodriguez, said at a City Hall news conference today that the warm weather, the tight economy and the tense environment in the aftermath of the Los Angeles riots contributed to the trouble after the game.
 
How Americans Celebrate
 Mayor Richard M. Daley said the violence was the work of a handful of opportunists and an example of an ugly modern-day method of celebrating sports victories.
"When you celebrate something in America, you break a window and grab something," Mr. Daley said. "When people have an excuse to loot, they loot, when they have an excuse to shoot, they shoot."
The Mayor defended the city's response to the trouble and said 1,300 additional police officers had been dispatched Sunday but had a difficult time because trouble erupted in several spots across the city.
But several merchants whose places of business were destroyed, including Park Jung, said today that the police did not respond quickly enough to the violence.
The 32-year-old Mr. Park said that when he arrived at his men's clothing store on the West Side shortly after 9 P.M., more than 100 people were in front of his business and breaking in.
He said that when he asked several police officers for help, one of them told him to "take care of your life and leave." That's what he did.
"So I left," Mr. Park said today. "What else could I do? I hate America. I'm going back to Korea."
Mayor Daley said additional police officers would be assigned to patrol the most troubled areas tonight as the city prepared for a final victory celebration on Tuesday at Grant Park on the downtown lake front.
One million people are expected to flood the area for a rally as they did a year ago. Last year, the Bulls' first championship season, there was little serious trouble during the rally but there was some isolated looting the night of the final game.
 
Being Black Is No Help
 Back on Madison Street, Mr. Ingram, the owner of the looted pawn shop, said he had operated his business there for 20 years. Before that he worked on the street for someone else.
"It's more than a business," he said. "I'm here because I have a strong feeling for the West Side and my people.
"My theory about what happened is that the Bulls winning didn't have anything to do with this," he said, looking over the shattered and empty display cases. "The economy is what caused this. There are so many people out of work with no means of support. The Bulls' winning was just an excuse for people to express their anger."
Mr. Ingram said that when he first arrived at the store, the police chased at least a dozen looters away. But he added that they returned every time the officers left.
At one point, with the looters banging on his door, Mr. Ingram pleaded with them to leave his store alone because he was black.
"Prove it," he said a looter shouted.
"I had to open the door and show my face," Mr. Ingram said. "Then a man said 'Leave him alone, he's black.' But then another man said, 'I don't care, kill him.' "
Mr. Ingram said he was not sure whether he would remain on the West Side. "Unless people start getting some jobs this is going to keep on happening," he said. "I'm very angry and very disappointed but I understand what's happening. People are desperate, people are hungry, people are scared."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
On TV, Clinton Finds an Audience That Listens

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL

 BODY:
Listen to Bill Clinton on the morning talk shows. No saxophone. No sunglasses. He is serious, concise and eager to repeat his claim of outsider status in an election year suddenly gone screwy.
As an elected Democrat in a year when voters want almost nothing to do with politicians, the winner of the Democratic primary race spent yesterday morning pursuing his new mission: trying to persuade voters to keep an open mind about his chances of becoming President. 
 In one vital respect, Mr. Clinton's appearance on the CBS News program "This Morning" was a breakthrough of sorts: Only one questioner aside from the co-host, Paula Zahn, mentioned Ross Perot, and no one mentioned President Bush except to criticize current Administration policies.
Instead, the studio audience of 81 friendly people recruited by CBS employees from interest groups and acquaintances, and other voters connected by satellite links from five cities, allowed Mr. Clinton to expound upon his favorite topics.
 
Finding the Right Word
 A saleswoman in the New York audience asked about restoring confidence. "One word," Mr. Clinton said, "investment. Change the tax system so there is more incentive for people to invest, corporation and individual. Spend more of the tax dollars you give the Government investing instead of just squandering. Invest to create jobs, generate wealth. That's the best way to build consumer confidence."
Mr. Clinton returned to this theme repeatedly, following the advice of campaign strategists who say he needs to drive home a few select points.
Mr. Clinton said for the first time that he would not rule out imposing an import fee on oil, a measure supported by the domestic petroleum industry but opposed in the areas of the country where residents are dependent on oil.
He also said he would recommend "significantly modifying" the 1986 revision of the tax code because it focused too little attention on investment tax credits and other provisions that he said would help the economy.
 
A New Kind of 'Badge'
 At the same time, the Arkansas Governor used his status as leader of a small, poor state, a status he once described as a liability in national politics, as a badge of honor.
"I've been on the outside of this," Mr. Clinton said. "I've been in Little Rock, Ark., balancing my budget, developing a partnership with business, creating manufacturing jobs, educating, doing the things that we as Presidents should do. And I understand the frustration people have."
Mr. Clinton has scheduled taped or live appearances on the Cable News Network, ABC, NBC and MTV within the next week.
Yesterday, the Governor told almost everyone what they wanted to hear. He advocated tax relief as well as new tax incentives. He said he favored expanding education programs but pledged to streamline government bureaucracy. He promised that he would maintain a strong defense while reducing military spending. And he told a representative of B'nai B'rith that he opposed the creation of a Palestinian state.
 
A Need for Discipline
 He said the initiatives he has proposed could be paid for out of a combination of budget cuts and new investment. "The economic investments would logically be paid for by being very disciplined about what you do with defense cuts," he said.
But the Governor also said that he was not yet ready to call for a repeal of the luxury tax unless it was tied to increased tax rates on corporations and the wealthy, and that he was not "prepared to embrace" a plan to help the domestic automobile industry by reinstituting Federal tax deductions for interest on consumer loans.
Most of the two-hour program was warm and appeared to be dominated by representatives of interest groups or questioners who were familiar with and friendly toward Mr. Clinton.
He received applause twice: when he said that he favored a woman's right to choose abortion and when he said that he would lift Federal regulations that prohibit federally financed clinics from dispensing abortion advice.
Mr. Clinton and his aides said they were happy that the candidate had begun answering real questions from real people who care little about issues that have preoccupied the press.
"It's different," Mr. Clinton said as he was leaving the West 57th Street studio. "They asked questions which to you are old news, but to them are new. The American people are still just, a lot of them, digesting this election."
By using his televised forums to focus on what he plans to do to revive the economy, Mr. Clinton hopes to demonstrate that he has the ideas he says Mr. Perot lacks, and the ability to take action that he says President Bush has not shown.

HEADLINE: New York's Senior Representative to Retire

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
In the third blow in a week to New York State's influence in Congress, Representative Frank Horton, the dean of the state's Congressional delegation who faced a tough re-election battle because of redistricting, announced today that he was retiring.
The 72-year-old Congressman -- whose 30 years in the House spanned seven Presidents, five Speakers and four minority leaders -- said he had pondered retirement for "some time" but made the decision on Sunday after discussing it with his wife. 
 Mr. Horton, a Rockefeller Republican who voted with liberal Democrats more often than with the Bush or Reagan Administrations, said he did not want to run against a longtime friend, Representative Louise M. Slaughter, a Democrat, his likely opponent under a redistricting plan adopted by the State Legislature. The two currently represent districts that include parts of Rochester.
 
'That's Enough'
 "If I'd had the same district, I wouldn't even have thought about it, I would have run willy-nilly," Mr. Horton said in an interview after announcing his decision to retire in a nearly empty House chamber. "None of the things I've been doing are finished. But with redistricting, you have to think about it. There comes a time when you have to do something for yourself. After 30 years, that's enough."
The ranking Republican on the Government Operations Committee, Mr. Horton had an important, though unpublicized, influence on the operation of the Federal Government. He was instrumental in placing inspectors general -- financial watchdogs -- in Federal departments and in passing the 1989 Whistleblower Protection Act, which guards Federal employees who expose waste, fraud and abuse from reprisals.
"What was most extraordinary about Frank is his style: Frank prefers accomplishments that will help people rather than insider partisan squabbling that leads nowhere," said John Conyers Jr., the Michigan Democrat who is the chairman of the Government Operations Committee and who would often spend time with his colleague debating jazz and baseball. "He is a coalition builder, a problem solver and a team strategist."
Known as one of the least partisan representatives, Mr. Horton was an expert in maneuvering New York representatives onto important Congressional committees, and he often boasted he was the only minority member ever to serve as chairman of a state Congressional delegation.
 
Voter Dissatisfaction
 Mr. Horton's decision adds to the upheaval reverberating through the House in the wake of mushrooming voter dissatisfaction and the checking scandal. So far, 71 Representatives have announced their retirement or have been defeated in primaries, insuring the greatest turnover in the House since World War II.
The wholesale turnover is likely to be particularly difficult for New York State and for the New York metropolitan area, which by most measurements receives less Federal money per capita than almost any other region. National population shifts have cost the state three seats, the most in the country. In addition, New Jersey is to lose one. That means an 8.3 percent drop in the size of the two states' delegation.
"The impact for New York is that California is going to eat our lunch," said Representative Slaughter, who now appears to have a clear path to re-election. "We're not only losing people, we're losing seniority." California is gaining seven seats under redistricting for a total of 52.
Mr. Horton is the third member of the state delegation to announce his retirement in the last week. He follows Representative David O'B. Martin of Canton, a veteran Republican who has used his seat on the Armed Services Committee to win Federal money for his economically distressed, upstate district, and Representative Raymond J. McGrath of Valley Stream, L.I., a practical-minded moderate who focused on local concerns and the seventh-ranking Republican on the Ways and Means Committee.

Excerpts From Clinton's Remarks in Appearance on a CBS Program

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from remarks by Gov. Bill Clinton on the CBS News program "This Morning" in a question-and-answer session with an audience. 
 ROSS PEROT
I think the Perot phenomenon -- I don't know about Perot because he hasn't told us what he would do or what he believes on so many issues -- but the phenomenon happened because the American people were disappointed and frustrated and angry that nothing gets done in Washington. And they think both parties are to blame, and I think they're right about that. Although I think if you want to be President, if you want to be the lead dog in the hunt -- the Republicans have craved the White House successfully all these last two and a half decades -- you have to take primary responsibility for the country.
So I don't want to get into that. My campaign was long before Ross Perot and was started when George Bush was at 70 percent, because I didn't think we had responsible leadership and because I wanted to change the direction of my party and the Republican President.
STUDENT FINANCIAL AID
I would scrap the existing student loan program. The student loan program we have today costs you $3 billion in defaulted loans. So what I would do is to set up a new loan program that would take the best of two great American ideas: the G.I. Bill and the Peace Corps. I would set up a national service trust fund and let any American borrow the money they need to go to college, any American, because it's very important people go and stay.
Then after college they would pay it back in one of two ways, either as a small percentage of income at tax time every year, so if you wanted to be a teacher, you wouldn't be discouraged from being a teacher because you had a big student loan, because your payback would be a percentage of your income; or by giving two years of service to our country here at home. Go back to your hometown and work at a reduced rate, just like a Peace Corps volunteer would, except rebuild America. Be a teacher. Be a police officer. Work in a drug program. Keep kids out of gangs. Do things that need to be done in your community.
If you do that for two years at a reduced salary, then you don't owe any money any more. We could educate a whole generation of Americans and solve a lot of our social problems.
AIDS
First I'm going to put one person in charge. We need to treat this problem as a major national health problem for all Americans. It is very rapidly growing. It is going into the entire country, into all the populations. We are still denying the dimensions of the problem.
Second thing I will do is to fund the Ryan White Act. The third thing I want to do is to implement the recommendations which have already been made from the AIDS commission. They filed two good reports.
The fourth thing we've got to do is to broaden the research and development efforts, especially to include more women and minorities, where the AIDS rates are growing at a very rapid rate.
And finally I think we've got to redouble our efforts at education and prevention.
SEX DISCRIMINATION
I'm going to make it clear that we will not tolerate sexual harassment in the Federal workplace. And I'm going to appoint people to positions in Government, both women and men, who will speak out against gender bias and sexual discrimination and will work against it and will live and act against it. I think it is a big, big problem still in this country.
MILITARY BUDGET CUTS
First we need to define the defense we need. What will it take for us to be the strongest country in the world still? And we need to pay for that. We know we don't need as many troops in Europe. We know the Germans and the Japanese should pay more of their own way. We know we may not need 12 carrier groups. We may not need all the weapon systems. What do we need?
Second thing we've got to do is take every dollar by which we reduce defense and invest it in converting from a defense to a domestic economy so that the factory workers and the scientists and the technicians have jobs in this economy.

Vehicle Sales Rose 4.2% in Early June

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 15

 BODY:
Sales of cars and light trucks made in North America increased 4.2 percent in early June, picking up momentum as consumers seemed to grow more confident about the economy.
Light-truck sales jumped 11.4 percent in the June 1-10 period, which offset a drop of two-tenths of 1 percent in car sales. It was the third consecutive 10-day period in which vehicle sales exceeded levels of a year earlier. 
 "It really signifies that the recovery is for real and there is some substance to it," said John Kirnan, an auto industry analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York. "I have a very difficult time seeing how this recovery can be short-circuited, short of external factors such as an oil crisis."
 
Old Cars on the Road
 He credited the increased demand to the aging of cars on the road, increased consumer confidence and lower personal debt. The average age of cars and trucks on American roads is at an all-time high, about eight years for cars and eight and a half years for trucks, Mr. Kirnan said.
The domestic auto makers sold cars and trucks at a daily rate of 34,664, compared with 33,277 for the June 1-10 period last year. There were nine selling days in the period this year and eight last year.
Car and truck sales by the Big Three rose 2.7 percent, while sales of Japanese vehicles made in North America soared 19.4 percent.
For the year, total vehicle sales are up 6.3 percent from the rate a year earlier. Sales of the Ford Motor Company, the General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation rose a combined 6.7 percent. Sales of the Japanese "transplants" were up 3.9 percent.
For the 10-day period, Ford's sales rose 8.6 percent. The company's car sales were up 6.3 percent and its truck sales increased 11.7 percent.
G.M.'s sales were down 1.7 percent, with car sales falling 3.9 percent and truck sales rising 2.7 percent.
Ward's Automotive Reports estimated that Chrysler's sales rose 5 percent, with an 11.7 percent increase in light-truck sales offsetting an 18.8 percent decline for cars; Chrysler reports its sales once a month.
 
 
Junky Trade-Ins
 Dealers say they were seeing more optimistic shoppers in early June.
"The first 10 days of June were phenomenal," said James Basil, general manager of Basil Chevrolet in Depew, N.Y., outside Buffalo. "The people coming in were in a much better frame of mind and more confident about the economy."
His sales increase was caused in part by a three-day promotion with nearby dealers. Mr. Basil said many buyers offered junky old cars as trade-ins.
"A lot of the cars we took in were older cars -- '85-'86 and older," he said. "There weren't many we could resell. Some people were buying new cars out of necessity."
Chrysler's jump in truck sales was spurred by a rebate of up to $2,100 on the popular Plymouth Voyager mini-van. The rebate expires on Monday.
"It's been like Christmas," said Alan Helfman, general manager of River Oaks Chrysler-Plymouth in Houston. "I have a smile on my face every day I come to work."
Mr. Helfman said the hot sales had nearly depleted his supply of Voyagers. "I don't even need this rebate, I'm doing so well," he said.
Among Japanese auto makers, Toyota's early-June sales were up 52.7 percent. Isuzu's sales rose 9.4 percent, while Mazda's increased 43.7 percent; Mitsubishi's gained 85 percent and Nissan's rose 16 percent. Honda's sales fell 4.9 percent, and Subaru's were down 3.8 percent.

HEADLINE: Most Stocks Decline, but Dow Is Up 0.54

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks edged higher yesterday, but declining shares outnumbered gainers in the broad market amid fears about the health of the United States economy and weakness in overseas stocks.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed with a gain of 0.54 point at 3,354.90. Declining shares outpaced advances 932 to 742 on moderate New York Stock Exchange volume of 164.1 million shares, compared with 181.9 million shares Friday. 
 "The recovery is laboring," said Hersh Cohen, president of Shearson Asset Management. "There's justifiable concern about its durability and vigor."
He said that while stable interest rates are a plus for the market, many investors think stock prices are too high. With no consistent trend to the equity market, "it's very difficult to get terrifically excited about one group or stock," he said.
Lingering concern about corporate earnings -- revived by a disappointing second-quarter forecast by the Monsanto Company -- also diluted buying interest.
A sharp 2.5 percent drop in Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei index had little impact on Wall Street despite fears of a spillover, analysts said.
Light bargain-hunting helped blue chips late in the session, analysts said.
Tom Callahan, an executive vice president at Yamaichi International, said, "There is an element of confusion out there." He added that some investors were hesitant about buying depressed growth stocks but unwilling to commit more money to cyclicals.
"The concern is that the consumer sector is not coming back, and the consumer is a big part of the economic recovery," he said.
Bob Walberg, an analyst at MMS International, said the mixed performance might suggest the market was trying to consolidate.
But he added, "There are very few reasons to get excited about the market." He expects stocks may sell off again this week.
Telefonos de Mexico fell 1 7/8, to 50, on worries about the union's plans for its stake in the company and concern about Ross Perot's negative position on free trade with Mexico.
Monsanto slumped 5, to 54. It said that second-quarter profits would be below analysts' estimates and that it would be taking a charge of 21 cents a share to cover a settlement on a Superfund cleanup site.
 
Inquiry Into Tobacco Concerns
 Philip Morris Companies dropped 1 1/4, to 73; American Brands lost 3/8, to 47, and RJR Nabisco eased 1/4, to 9 3/8. after reports of a criminal investigation into possible misleading research by several tobacco companies.
The Penn Central Corporation rose 1 3/4, to 21 3/4. Salomon Brothers initiated coverage with a buy rating.
A County NatWest analyst repeated an underperform rating on Whirlpool Corporation, which fell 1 1/2, to 35.
After tumbling sharply Friday, Ross Cosmetics rebounded 2 1/4, to 7 1/4. The company said its accounting practices, which United States regulators are investigating, are sound.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 0.53, to 410.29, but stocks of mostly smaller companies represented by the Nasdaq composite shed 0.51 point, to 569.01.
The American Stock Exchange index fell 2.54, to 388.78.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index of all listed common stocks rose 0.11 point, to 225.62. The average share gained 2 cents.

HEADLINE: Thrift Is Under Siege in Japan As Use of Credit Cards Soars

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 12

 BODY:
For years the Japanese have been unwavering in their devotion to thrift, regarding personal savings as a measure of national strength. Then they met credit cards.
Now the world's most fervent savers have discovered not just the joys of shopping with plastic but, in soaring numbers, the burdens of indebtedness. 
 Credit card use is still modest by Western standards. About 200 million cards are in use here, where the population is 124 million, compared with more than a billion of all types in the United States, where the population is twice the size. But the number of cards being issued, the amount of debt card holders are carrying and the number of individual bankruptcies are rising at a pace far greater than in the United States, doubling in the last year.
 
A Lure for the Young
 Credit cards are particularly popular among the young. Newspapers and magazines have been reporting that newlyweds and first-time job holders sometimes get more than a dozen cards from companies eager to lengthen their membership lists. The press recently told the tale of a university student who began to buy textbooks and clothes with his first cards, and swiftly found himself with 21 cards and nearly $40,000 in debt.
The Japan Credit Counseling Association, which advises people unable to manage their debt, says about 53 percent of the people seeking help are age 20 to 29, up from 31 percent five years ago.
Yet the problems are not threatening the financial health of credit card companies. In fact, the default rate on card payments is said to total only about 1 percent, less than half the level in the United States. But public fretting has begun over what some people see as a decline in the discipline that they believe made Japan strong.
"Young people today are excessively protected by their parents," said Kichizo Sakamoto, executive director of the counseling association, which was founded with Government help six years ago. "People of my generation, in their 50's and 60's, went through the war. We experienced hard times. But young people don't have that experience and so they have different attitudes."
Many young people acknowledge this generational shift, which they say is a sign of how Japan's affluence is altering society's standards.
"The saving ethic has changed," said Toshihiro Ikeda, assistant manager of corporate planning at the JCB Company, the country's largest credit card issuer. "In the postwar years the slogan was always: savings is a virtue. Spending is a virtue: that's the new moral."
To get a sense of how shocking some older Japanese find the trend, one needs only to recall the contempt with which Government officials have referred in the past to what they see as one of America's gravest weaknesses, an overreliance on credit.
In the trade negotiations that were known as the Structural Impediments Initiative, Japan suggested that the United States could begin to rebuild its economy in part by limiting the number of credit cards consumers would be permitted to hold.
"Japanese consider bankruptcy very seriously, something that might force people to sneak out of town in the dead of night or consider family suicide," Michio Watanabe, who is now the Foreign Minister, told members of the governing Liberal Democratic Party in 1988, when he was a senior party official. He added, in a statement that spoke volumes about Japanese attitudes about the United States, "Among those guys over there, where credit card use is rampant, there are so many blacks and so on who think nonchalantly, 'We're bankrupt, so from tomorrow on we just don't have to pay anything back.' "
Last year, 23,491 Japanese filed for personal bankruptcy, more than double the level just a year earlier. Officials say the figure is likely to rise another 50 percent this year.
Meanwhile, the amount of cash borrowed on credit cards -- at interest rates of about 30 percent a year -- doubled from 1986 to 1990, the latest year for which figures are available, to 39.5 trillion yen ($311 billion).
To be sure, Japan's savings rate remains extremely high by international standards, at about 13.5 percent. But that is down significantly from 18 percent in 1981. By contrast, Americans in recent months have been saving about 5 percent of their disposable income.
Many Japanese business executives, while noting the enthusiasm with which the Japanese are embracing consumption, say the policies of the credit card companies themselves are a big part of the problem. Seeking to build market share, they have been flooding the country with plastic; some department stores and finance companies issue cards the day the application is received.
Commonly, 500,000 yen ($4,000) is the minimum credit extended, even to young people. And with an interest rate of 30 percent on unpaid balances, the sums owed can rise swiftly.
"Some of the problem lies in the screening that we do when people apply for card membership," said Mr. Ikeda of JCB. "Not enough information is collected."
 
Credit Reporting Is Poor
 Indeed, by American standards the credit card companies are operating blindly. In the United States, the companies have access to data bases that provide a full credit history of card applicants, including their level of borrowings from other sources, the number of credit cards they hold and records of repayment. In Japan, the card companies do not share information and generally have access only to the names of those who have filed for bankruptcy or have defaulted on large debts.
Nobuaki Terasaka, the director of the commercial and consumer credit office at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said the Government had belatedly recognized how primitive the information systems were and was working with companies to give them better data to screen out problem card holders.
"The flip side of the coin is that not only is there not a well-developed credit information network but there is not a good credit collection system either," said Stephen B. Friedman, president of the Asia Pacific region for American Express International. "It isn't easier to make collections here than anywhere else, and it's probably more difficult."
 
How to Avoid Paying Debts
 Card holders use a variety of strategies to avoid repayment and, at times, dig themselves deeper into debt, industry officials say. Some people simply shift the debt from card to card, borrowing from one to pay off the other. Many industry officials say that when confronted, a relatively large number of debtors simply refuse to pay, declaring the bills are wrong or that a friend made the charges.
Changes in personal habits and society aside, the nation's economic slump, which many economists call a recession, has been a factor. The collapse of stock and real estate prices after the boom of the 1980's has put many consumers on the defensive by wiping out their investments.
But many experts regard the immature state of the credit card industry as simply a reflection of the generally underdeveloped state of most consumer services in Japan, particularly when compared with the technology available to manufacturers.
In spite of all the talk in recent years of giving the long-suffering consumer more attention, the Japanese still pay among the highest prices in the world when they go shopping.
"Very early after I arrived here what I learned is that you cannot say the consumer is the low person on the totem pole," said Mr. Friedman of American Express. "He isn't even on the totem pole."
Mr. Terasaka of the trade ministry said the Government had begun a campaign involving consumer education and better controls at the credit card companies to remedy the situation and ease the public anxieties about Japan's moral fiber.
"Many people want to blame just those with debts, but we don't feel that way," he said. "The credit card companies are responsible for helping them understand how to use credit cards wisely."

HEADLINE: Court Backs Old Standard On State Tax

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
In an important corporate tax case, the Supreme Court today reaffirmed its longstanding approach to state taxation of the income of companies that are based outside a state but that conduct some business within the state's borders.
The case had been closely watched because the Court had indicated that it might abandon this approach, known as the unitary business principle, and give states much more latitude to reach a portion of a multistate company's income that was not related to the company's in-state operations. 
 But the Court unanimously refused to rewrite the rules, and then, by a 5-to-4 vote, declared that New Jersey had transgressed those limits by taxing a portion of the capital gains the Bendix Corporation earned from its 1981 sale of a 20 percent stake in Asarco Inc.
The decision overturned a ruling by the New Jersey Supreme Court, which upheld the $1.8 million tax bill last year. The state court ruled that the stock sale, part of an aggressive investment strategy that Bendix carried out under its chief executive, William M. Agee, was integrally related to the overall operations of the company, part of its "unitary business" although not directly connected to any of its New Jersey operations.
Writing for the majority today, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said that the New Jersey Supreme Court had misinterpreted the unitary business principle. It was not enough to identify the company's investment strategy, he said. To tax a portion of an out-of-state company's investment income, Justice Kennedy said, a state would have to show that the transaction served "an operational rather than an investment function," which was not the case with the Bendix stake in Asarco.
The two companies did not integrate their managements, he noted, and conducted unrelated businesses. "The mere fact that an intangible asset was acquired pursuant to a long-term corporate strategy of acquisitions and dispositions does not convert an otherwise passive investment into an integral operational one," Justice Kennedy said.
 
Takeover Battle
 The Bendix strategy, in fact, failed. Mr. Agee tried to use the $212 million capital gain from the Asarco sale to acquire the Martin Marietta Company, but his plan was thwarted when Martin Marietta and Allied-Signal Inc. bought up Bendix stock. Bendix is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Allied-Signal, which filed the appeal of the New Jersey ruling. The case was Allied-Signal v. Director, New Jersey Division of Taxation, No. 91-615.
The case, which was initially argued March 4, was viewed as fairly routine until a week later, when the Court unexpectedly ordered a new argument and expanded its inquiry from the facts of the case to the underlying principles at stake. The Justices posed a series of questions for the new argument, which was held April 22, including "what constitutional principles should govern state taxation of corporations doing business in several states?" and whether a new rule, if adopted, should apply retroactively.
In response to this invitation, New Jersey contended that the Court should abandon the unitary business principle and replace it with a rule permitting a state to tax a portion of all income from whatever source of a corporation that does any business in the state.
The Court's retreat from its open invitation was swift. "New Jersey's sweeping theory cannot be reconciled with the concept that the Constitution places limits on a state's power to tax value earned outside of its borders," Justice Kennedy said.
He added that the Court's doctrine of adherence to its own precedents was particularly strong on an issue such as this one, because both states and taxpayers in their planning had relied on what seemed to be a well-settled rule of law. "New Jersey's proposal would disrupt settled expectations in an area of the law in which the demands of the national economy require stability," Justice Kennedy said.
In reaffirming its traditional approach, however, the Court today did not necessarily inject much clarity into what has been a confusing and contentious area of tax law.
The 5-to-4 split on the Court over how to apply the general principles to the specific facts of the Bendix dispute was an indication that many cases such as this will come down to factual disputes, to be resolved at the highest administrative or judicial level to which a taxpayer is willing to take its case.
 
Taking Sides
 In ruling for Allied-Signal, Justice Kennedy was joined by Justices Byron R. White, John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia and David H. Souter.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote a dissenting opinion that was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Harry A. Blackmun and Clarence Thomas. They said that Allied-Signal had not proved that the Bendix capital gains from the Asarco sale were not "operationally related" to the business Bendix conducted in New Jersey.
Phil Tatarowicz, a state tax expert in the Chicago office of Ernst & Young, said the decision today insured that such cases would remain "fact driven" and that both states and companies would face "tremendous burdens" in developing their sides of tax disputes.

HEADLINE: Robert William Haack, 75, Dies; Led Stock Exchange During Crises

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
Robert William Haack, who led the New York Stock Exchange during a period of crisis and change and later became the chairman of the Lockheed Corporation, died on Sunday at his home in Potomac, Md. He was 75 years old.
Mr. Haack died of complications from kidney failure, his family said. 
 A tall, amiable Midwesterner with a talent for public speaking, Mr. Haack in 1967 left the presidency of the National Association of Securities Dealers, where he had served for three years, to take the top full-time post at the New York Stock Exchange. A longtime stockbroker, Mr. Haack was viewed on Wall Street as the perfect choice to lead the nation's largest stock exchange after more than a decade of growth.
In his early years as the new spokesman for Wall Street, Mr. Haack was faced with enormous upheaval. The boom years were beginning to wear on Wall Street, with average daily volume on the exchange having grown from 1.7 million shares traded to more than 10 million shares. Unable to handle the flood of paperwork churned out by the steady growth, the exchange was forced to begin closing one and a half hours earlier.
 
Emphasis on Automation
 He put a high priority on development of several automation programs, including one intended to reduce the physical movement of securities from one brokerage house to another.
That push toward automation has had long-term repercussions on Wall Street and still wins Mr. Haack praise today. "Among his many accomplishments was to bring technology to the back office, a bold initiative that laid the foundation for today's high-tech securities industry," William H. Donaldson, the current chairman and chief executive of the Big Board, said yesterday.
As the 1960's drew to a close, Wall Street began to experience its greatest crisis since the Depression. Between 1968 and 1970, as the boom in stocks gave weight to a bear market, dozens of brokerage firms, including nationally known names such as Hayden, Stone, Inc. and F. I. du Pont, collapsed or were forced into mergers. With public confidence in the brokerage industry shaken, Mr. Haack worked with Congress to develop the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, or S.I.P.C.
The new corporation provided much-needed security to investors who had begun to fear they would lose their savings if their brokerage concerns collapsed.
 
Issue of Commission Rates
 Mr. Haack's aggressive work on behalf of the industry, as well as his deep roots on Wall Street, did not slow the criticism he generated on Wall Street for attacking some of the industry's sacred cows. In a controversial speech before the Economic Club of New York on Nov. 17, 1970, Mr. Haack, saying that the exchange was no longer "the only game in town," publicly called for reform of the New York Stock Exchange itself, proposing that the management of the Big Board be reorganized to open up an institution that until then had been something of a private club.
The speech, which split the leadership of the securities industry and led to some calls for Mr. Haack's dismissal, also attacked fixed commission rates, which were then the lifeblood of Wall Street. Commission rates were the prices paid by the public to brokerage houses for buying or selling stocks. Under the system in effect at the time, the New York Stock Exchange effectively set the minimum rates for the entire industry, blocking competition for lower-cost producers.
While the speech alienated some members of the Board of Governors, it proved to be prophetic. Fixed commission rates were abandoned in May 1975, in what is widely regarded as one of the most significant changes in the industry's history. The change has allowed greater competition among brokers.
Mr. Haack was born on Feb. 15, 1917, in Milwaukee. He graduated from Hope College in Holland, Mich., in 1938 and from Harvard Business School in 1940. That year he began his career in the securities industry as a stockbroker with Robert W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee.
In 1976, in the wake of the international bribery scandals involving Lockheed and other American corporations, Mr. Haack was named chairman of the financially troubled company, a post he held for 20 months. During that time, he worked to restore confidence in the company and revised its finances based around a Federal loan guarantee.
Mr. Haack is survived by his wife, the former Ann Thornett Miller; a son, Thomas, of Darien, Conn.; three daughters, Barbara Sexton of Greenwich, Conn., and Elizabeth Barr and Linda Brooks, both of Potomac, and six grandchildren.

Dollar Ends the Day Mixed; Gold Flat to Slightly Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished mixed against leading currencies yesterday and reached a five-month low against the Swiss franc as dealers grew cautious about the future of European unity.
Gold prices were unchanged to marginally higher. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $343.10 per troy ounce, up 20 cents from Friday. The Republic National Bank said gold held steady at a late bid price of $342.50 an ounce. 
 Switzerland's lack of membership in the European Community is apparently helping the Swiss franc as traders grow hesitant ahead of Ireland's referendum Thursday on the Maastricht treaty. The Irish vote is the treaty's first test since Danish voters rejected the blueprint for European political and economic union. Among other changes, the accord calls for a single currency by 1999.
The dollar was quoted at 1.4150 Swiss francs late in New York, down from late Friday's 1.4265. The dollar reached an intraday low of 1.4085 Swiss francs, the lowest level since an intraday low of 1.4015 francs Jan. 24.
The dollar rose around midday against the German mark as short- sellers, those who had sold borrowed dollars for marks hoping for a weaker dollar, bought the United States currency to cover their positions, traders said. By early afternoon the dollar fell again on profit taking by investors who were betting the dollar would strengthen.
The dollar finished at 1.5710 German marks, down from Friday's late rate of 1.5760.
Despite the activity with the mark and the Swiss franc, trading was largely quiet, dealers said. With little significant United States economic news due this week, the market should remain quiet until Thursday's vote, said Brian Welch, a foreign exchange trader at Barclays Bank in New York.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 126.72 yen, up 0.05 yen from Friday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 126.80 yen. In late trading in New York, the dollar fetched 126.80 yen, up from 126.60 late Friday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.8560, from $1.8550 late Friday. In New York it cost $1.8565 to buy one pound, more expensive than Friday's $1.8510.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Are Mostly Flat

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices were mostly unchanged yesterday in uneventful trading.
The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond was unchanged and its yield was 7.85 percent, the same as late Friday. 
 The market had little reaction to a report of slightly stronger-than-expected sales of domestic cars and trucks in early June.
 
May Housing Report
 Instead, the market was awaiting the Government's report today on housing construction in May, which should provide some important clues on the economy's performance. Economists generally expect the data to show an increase but not a significant rise after a sharp decline in April.
An increase may solidify the belief of many traders that the Federal Reserve does not plan to lower interest rates soon, said Ray Stone, managing director of Stone & McCarthy Research Associates Inc. in Princeton, N.J.
At the Treasury's weekly auction, interest rates on short-term securities fell to the lowest level in four weeks.
The Treasury Department sold $11.7 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 3.66 percent and yield of 3.74 percent. Another $11.7 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 3.75 percent, with a yield of 3.88 percent.
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term maturities were unchanged to up 1/32 point, intermediate maturities rose 1/16 point and long-term issues were unchanged, Telerate Inc., the financial information service, reported.
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.33, to 1,231.55.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 3.70 percent, as the discount slipped three basis points, to 3.63 percent. Yields on six-month bills slipped to 3.86 percent, as the discount held at 3.75 percent. Yields on one-year bills held at 4.11 percent, as the discount gained one basis point, to 3.95 percent.
 
Federal Funds Rate Rises
 A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity.
The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 3 7/8 percent, up from 311/16 percent late Friday.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 9611/32 , up 1/32 point. The average yield to maturity was 6.59 percent, down from 6.60 percent late Friday.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	99.075	98.104	Discounted Rate	3.66%	3.75%	Coupon Yield	3.74%	3.88%	High Price	99.077	98.114	Discounted Rate	3.65%	3.73%	Coupon Yield	3.74%	3.86%	Low Price	99.072	98.099	Discounted Rate	3.67%	3.76%	Coupon Yield	3.76%	3.89%	Accepted at low price	01%	13%	Total applied for	$44,261,740	$39,209 700	Accepted	$11,470,995	$11,667,885	N.Y. applied for	$40,564,045	$35,109,155	N.Y. accepted	$10,306,870	$10,639,920	Noncompetitive	$1,220,670	$901,140	

Both these issues are dated June 18, 1992. The three-month bills mature on Sept. 17, 1992 and the six-month bills on Dec. 17, 1992.

Scrabble's Word Nerds Live for the Perfect Mix

BYLINE: By Andrew H. Malcolm

DATELINE: WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP, N.J.

 BODY:
THIS is a column about Scrabble and the raczy pleope who play it.
That engrossing word game, invented by an unemployed Poughkeepsie archteict, initially manufactured by a Connecticut ocuepl and now promoted by a Long Island mna, has just moved into its seventh decade of sccuess.
All right, the first two decades weren't so sccuessluf. But after the mid-50's Scrabble sales took off. Today, the National Scrabble Association says, 33 million North Americans play the game. Atlanta, practicing for the Olympics, gets the national Scrabble championship this August. We're talking gib money -- $10,000 for first place. 
 Playing or watching Scrabble is addictive because everyone -- not just newspaper editors -- loves to spot scrambled letters and try to unscramble a word. Scrabble harnesses the relentless human urge to kibitz to a board with 225 squares and 100 letter tiles, including 12 E's, 9 A's and one J, K, Q, X and Z. (Scrabble doesn't harm the profits of the Milton Bradley Company either.)
Unless you just arrived from the planet Pluto, you know that each Scrabble letter (to start, you draw seven from a bag) is worth from one point for an R or E up to 10 for Z or Q. Scores are multiplied if a word falls on a double or triple letter or word square. And using all seven letters on one turn earns 50 bonus points, causing some players to think better of themselves for days.
We all know fitness fetishists and gardening gurus who offer animated insights into their avocations, even without being asked. (By the way, "gurus" would earn 15 points on a triple-word square, but then you wouldn't have your U's to use with the Q. See, there are only nine Q words that don't need a U. But you probably knew that already.)
Chess gets all the brainy parlor-game PR. Scrabble's word nerds are a forgotten minority, a quiet contemplative bunch that can cackle with self-congratulation and read dictionaries for fun. Scrabble players are obviously intelligent, educated, insensitive people, the kind of competitors who quietly lay down "xu," then sit back so smug in their opponent's annihilation.
"That's a good play," says the opponent, meaning no such thing. ("Xu" is Vietnamese money. More importantly, it's 17 points across a double-letter square.)
Violence is rare at Scrabble games, although feelings are running a little warm in some chairs over an official dictionary's accidental omission of "hooty" (11 points standing by itself). No high-fives in Scrabble (too awkward at card tables).
And Scrabble players do not reek of false team modesty either. Has Jackie Millstein stopped beating her husband? "No," she says with admirable honesty. "I win most games. I started playing at 8 with my mother. She played for blood." Mrs. Millstein seems particularly eager to play Allan Millstein in the spring, when Mr. Millstein, a C.P.A., arrives home exhausted. "That," she says ruthlessly, "is not my fault" (24 points on a triple-word square).
Mrs. Millstein heads a cell of Thursday-night Scrabble sharks recently uncovered here at the Bergen County YM-YWHA. People like Len and Carole Koch, Larry Lutzker, Miriam Schrager and Matthew Pasher (who got 84 points on his first word, "voyeurs") gather each week to match word wits. "I'm really into it," said Mr. Lutzker. "I enjoy making words and friends and being social. And I can concentrate while relaxing." (He was even more relaxed after beating Mr. Koch, 274 to 210.)
The group plays two games before the janitor arrives at 10:02, tapping his foot (only seven points by itself but better than passing, which Mrs. Millstein never does as a point of honor). Mrs. Millstein could run Scrabble schemes on riverboats. She can scan the letters eatoge, upside down, and spot a beard worth seven points.
Mrs. Millstein's highest score is 425. According to John Williams, executive director of the scrabble association in Greenport, L.I., that's not a bad amateur score. The official record score in the United States is 719 (Chris Reslock, 1982). The world record score is 725 (but he was Australian). Mr. Williams volunteered that his highest score was 515 and that he once got 149 on one play with "embossed."
Such records appear regularly in the association's newsletter, along with vocabulary-building exercises, hypothetical games and late-breaking Scrabble tournament news. Another growing phenomenon: pairs Scrabble. Pairs helps combat that dread affliction, Scrabble blindness, which causes players to look at "wnneri" and see nothing. Poor pathetic slsuo!
Mr. Williams estimates that members average 15 games a week, although, sadly, not him. His family will no longer play him, charging pedantry. "I've got to go," he says. "I'm in the middle of a game with the computer."
How's he doing? Pause.
"I'm getting killed" (38 with a double-letter, triple-word).

HEADLINE: Bridge

BYLINE: By Alan Truscott

 BODY:
A women's team match played in Corpus Christi, Tex., a week ago in the Pan-American Championships had a meaning on two levels, one of which escaped the attention of the officials, the press and the players most concerned.
In a match that ended at 2 A.M., but was not scored, for technical reasons, until 4 A.M., a team consisting of Gail Greenberg, Dorothy Truscott, Judy Tucker, Lisa Berkowitz, Randi Montin and Pam Wittes eked out a win by 7 imps. This team then went on to win the Pan-American title. 
 The losing team, which had qualified a month earlier to represent the United States in the 1992 world championship to be played in Italy in August, included Jacqui Mitchell, who has been vying with Truscott for many years, in a friendly New York City rivalry between ex-teammates, for the title of world's top-ranked woman player.
Mitchell had a small lead in world master points from 1986 to 1987, and it went unnoticed that the players were exactly tied between 1987 and 1990. Mitchell then gained 2 points for placing 65th in a world championship in Geneva, an example of the inflation that affects bridge players as well as consumers around the world. Truscott's victory in Corpus Christi gave her 8 points and a 6-point lead, putting her back in the top spot that she held from 1978 to 1986. But Mitchell is likely to strike back in August, for her team will be among the favorites in Italy. (The World Bridge Federation has recently complicated matters by deciding to multiply all master points by a factor of 10).
In the diagramed deal, played a year ago in a major team event, Truscott demonstrated a playing maneuver that is often overlooked. She reached four spades as shown, after West had made a weak jump in clubs, and the club ace was led.
A shift to diamonds, allowing the defense to take two quick tricks in that suit, would no doubt have defeated the contract, and did in the replay: South had no reason to know that the heart queen was in the West hand, and took a normal finesse in that suit.
Against Truscott, however, West persevered with a second club in the hope that East could ruff. After winning with the king, South drew trumps by leading to the ace and cashed the ace and king of hearts. This was a safe way to guard against the possibility of a doubleton queen in the West hand.
As it happened this play provided two overtricks, for both dummy's diamonds were discarded on heart winners. But the contract would have been safe whenever East held the heart queen, for South would have crossed to dummy with a trump and led a heart. West would have had no chance to lead a diamond, and the heart jack would have provided a discard for a diamond loser in the dummy.

Figuring Profits The Russian Way

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
CALL on a store or a factory in Russia today and no matter how rundown it looks or how desperate its circumstances, the manager will probably declare that the enterprise is very profitable. By all the rules of Russian accounting, that is the truth. But that is largely because those rules encourage managers to spend their profits on housing, food, day care, holiday retreats and numerous other amenities for workers.
When an American company spends its money like that, the outlays are listed as costs. Those costs cause profits to shrink, owners to suffer and chief executives sometimes to be dismissed. But in a land where every state enterprise belonged in theory to the people, spending on benefits was -- in the logic of Russian accounting -- a distribution of profits to the worker-owners. This accounting standard persists, even as Russia makes the transition to private enterprise. 
 "You find that many companies have distributed more money than they have taken in, and they still declare a profit," said Richard Lewis, the Russian-speaking chief of accounting at Ernst & Young's Moscow office. "I don't know how many managers are honest with themselves about this."
Thus, a shoe factory with 100 million rubles in annual revenue might spend 60 million on leather, nails, packing boxes and other production expenses, and 50 million rubles on worker benefits. Those benefits also include most of the wages paid to the workers, which means that wages are counted as distributed profits.
Westerners faced with the shoe factory's balance sheet would declare a 10 million ruble loss. But here the management, with the approval of the company's accountants, proudly declares a 40 percent profit margin -- and quietly scrambles to cover its cash shortfall. Few state companies have yet become privately owned, so the managers, not being owners, lack incentive to cut costs or buck the accounting rules.
"They are not answerable to shareholders, and since they can't keep the profits for themselves, they have no reason not to spend the money on the workers," Mr. Lewis said.
But reasons are beginning to appear. Until the Soviet Union disintegrated, the central Government ran the economy, covering the shoe factory's shortfall with what was in effect a direct subsidy. Now the subsidies are gone. Instead, the shoe factory must borrow, mainly from a newly formed commercial banking system. For a while, this borrowing was at giveaway interest rates. But lately President Boris N. Yeltsin's Government has forced up rates, in part to weed out companies that spend more than they take in.
And predictably, Russian accounting standards are beginning to change. The high cost of credit is one source of the pressure for change. Perhaps more important, companies are looking for ways to escape a 32 percent corporate profits tax enacted this year by the Yeltsin Government, now that corporate revenue no longer arrives automatically in fulfillment of quotas.
One new rule allows a company to write off part of the cost of building a hospital or some other building or plant, if it is turned over to a municipal government, rather than kept by the company. But municipal officials must approve the percentage of the hospital's total cost that the company can write off. The rest must still appear on the books as distribution of profits.
Another new rule -- buried in a recently issued 300-page Government accounting manual -- allows companies to quickly write off administrative costs. In the West, items like rental costs for headquarters or executive expense accounts appear as costs when they occur. In Russia, these costs have hung in limbo until the products were sold. The shoe company, for example, might make 200,000 rubles worth of shoes in May, incurring 50,000 rubles in administrative costs. But the costs do not become deductible from profits until the shoes are sold, perhaps in December.
"That has made profits and costs fluctuate so much that it has been difficult to work out a company's rate of return," Mr. Lewis said. "The new rule permits the Western standard of immediate write-off."
Perhaps most important, companies are learning how to beat taxes. Executives might take customers to lunch in the shoe company's cafeteria, where employees eat free. That allows the accounting department to carry some of the cafeteria's expenses not as distribution of profits, but as a cost of selling shoes.
"If you can just get these outlays into costs, you pay less taxes," said Boris A. Nikiforov, director of a metallurgy institute in Magnitogorsk, a Urals Mountain town dominated by a steelworks that underwrites a huge range of services, including the town's trolley system. "But taxes or not, one way or another, Russian companies still have to provide these benefits."

HEADLINE: Rich Nations Are Criticized

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: GENEVA, June 15

 BODY:
An international banking report published today said that industrialized nations were likely to ease out of recession but their self-centered trade policies threatened to thwart needed changes in developing countries.
The Bank for International Settlements said the economic performance of the former Communist bloc was "dismal and disappointing." It urged Eastern European nations to make changes more quickly and said there was a crucial need to prevent a breakdown of trade among former Soviet republics. 
 The president of the bank, Bengt Dennis, told its annual meeting that the fight against inflation continued to be a top priority. He said inflation in industrial economies had fallen to just below 4 percent annually in the last 12 months compared with 5.75 percent at the end of 1990.
The bank is a clearinghouse for national banks and a forum for policy coordination. Its report, which covers the 12 months to the end of May, cited growing evidence that the United States was moving out of recession and that other countries would follow.
The sharpest criticism in the report was directed at the trade policies of wealthy nations. It said that a new generation of trade barriers had appeared and that traditional restrictions on goods from the third world like farm products and textiles remained in place.
By contrast, it said that 51 developing countries had announced measures to liberalize trade in the last five years and had made often-painful changes.

HEADLINE: Open Markets, Seoul Urged

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, June 15

 BODY:
American businesses urged today that South Korea accelerate deregulation of its financial markets.
In opening remarks to the fifth South Korea-U.S. Business Conference, David Roderick, head of the 100-member United States delegation, said, "We both need to dedicate ourselves to prompt opening of these markets and not having the Government bureaucrats control our financial future." 
 Mr. Roderick, former chairman of the USX Corporation, cited South Korea's centrally controlled financial system, the central Government's allocation of capital, the perpetuation of high interest rates and resistance to outside financial sources.
United States financial companies have complained for years about strict Government regulations on their activities in South Korea, saying these sharply undermine their profitability.
Under American pressure, the Korean Government has recently taken a number of measures to open its markets, including permission for direct foreign investment in local stocks and the easing of regulations on interest rates.

HEADLINE: Old, Deadly Business With Russia

 BODY:
When George Bush, elected President of the United States, sits down today with Boris Yeltsin, elected President of Russia, they'll have historic new business to do -- like nurturing democracy in Russia and getting International Monetary Fund backing for its economic reforms.
But the measure of a truly successful summit conference lies in how well they can complete their countries' old business, namely cutting deeply into their enduring nuclear arsenals. 
 The new relationship between Washington and Moscow makes such cuts possible. It also makes achieving them urgent. With Soviet disunion, the danger of nuclear war has receded, to be replaced by the risk of loose nukes. The surest way to reduce that risk is to lower the number of nuclear arms to be kept under control.
What is a practical number for both sides to strive for? For the summit meeting to be judged a success in arms control terms, Mr. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin would agree to limit warheads on each side to 3,200. A much higher number would mean they had dissipated a rare moment.
Mr. Bush has been slow to act on the nuclear implications of the new realities in Russia. In the cold war's hair-trigger hypervigilance, both sides were deeply preoccupied with multiple warheads, or MIRV's, mounted on vulnerable land-based missiles. In a crisis, MIRV's and vulnerability could be a combustible mixture, tempting either side to shoot first in hopes of catching the other side's multi-warhead missiles on the ground. Arms controllers have a sound answer to that: Eliminate MIRV'ed land-based missiles.
The trouble is that this approach affects the two sides unequally. Moscow's deterrent force centers on 154 10-warhead SS-18's, all land-based. Even if the U.S. cut heavily into its land-based forces, its sea-based strength would remain. To insist on such a one-sided advantage would risk infuriating uneasy Russian military leaders.
There's another, preferable approach. Relations between the two countries have already moved from hostile to wary to cooperative. Mr. Bush took pains yesterday to say of his visitor, "I am dealing with a man who has my full support." That means getting rid of MIRV's is less urgent than reducing the risk that loose nuclear weapons find their way into the wrong hands. And that, in turn, makes a low limit on total warheads more desirable than banning SS-18's.
Last year's strategic arms reduction treaty reduced the ceiling on warheads to roughly 8,500 for the U.S. and 6,500 for Russia. Mr. Yeltsin has proposed reducing the overall ceiling for each side to 4,000 warheads, 1,750 of them on submarines. He would cut his SS-18 force to 80 missiles. And he's prepared to get rid of all of them by 2005, leaving Russia with 3,200 warheads.
Mr. Bush would be wise to accept this offer. Deep cuts would make it easier to control loose nukes. And given the dramatic changes wrought by the end of the cold war, all MIRV'ed land-based missiles would be eliminated soon enough.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Congress, Yeltsin and Prisoners

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Boris Yeltsin and the American Congress have an opportunity, immediate and glorious, to turn his visit to the United States into a richness far beyond ceremony and speeches.
They have the opportunity to help the heroes of the Soviet anti-Communist revolution, the men and women who endured years of imprisonment for Russia's freedom and so made this visit possible. Thousands of them, and their children, are now adrift, or in great want. 
 Every day of every year, from Lenin's time through much of Gorbachev's, Soviet citizens were arrested, tried in mock courts and sentenced to the vileness of the gulag for political crimes. These crimes were: speaking or writing thoughts distasteful to the Government, teaching religion, trying to leave the country without official permission, or even planning to do that.
The archives of terror are being opened in Moscow, slowly, partially and fearfully. They document what the world knows -- that throughout its seven decades of power Soviet Communism used murder and imprisonment as the basic instruments of Soviet rule. All officialdom -- bureaucracy, police, press, laws -- functioned to help.
The latest batch of papers detail some of the particular viciousness of Yuri Andropov. This fellow lived only briefly after becoming top man in Moscow in 1982. But he had long years of murder behind him, as head of the K.G.B. When I read excerpts from the Andropov file, I thought of the lickspittle stories that once appeared in the American press about how he was a pretty good guy who liked reading novels and drinking Scotch.
Mikhail Gorbachev, a protege of Andropov, failed in his efforts to rescue Communism through reform. But in the process the political prisoners were released. Some had stayed in cells all the years of his own reign.
But even after his own strange three-day house detention, which he said was so racking for him and his wife, he never expressed gratitude, regret or understanding to those whom the regimes he had served had imprisoned not for days but years.
The political prisoners were released into a society where survival was a day-to-day struggle. For many, the essential tools of survival in freedom had been destroyed during the prison years.
Families were shattered by death or divorce. Old friends had nothing to share. Jobs, apartments, skills -- all lost, irreplaceably.
All Russia suffers -- one more heritage of Communism. The prisoners are among the Russians who suffer most.
They were the poets of the revolution. With their words, their thoughts, with their imprisoned bodies, they wrote the truth about the vast political penitentiary that was the Soviet Union. Thus they prepared the way for the Yeltsins and the Gorbachevs.
Last year, legislation was passed in Moscow to give them a bit of assistance. But in Russia there is neither the money nor the organization to carry through.
In the West, the International Rescue Committee helps with medicine and supplies. It has raised $74,000 for the former prisoners.
Mr. Gorbachev is asking for millions for his own foundation. Wouldn't it be lovely if Americans thinking of contributing to this personal comeback fund would instead send the checks to the I.R.C.: 386 Park Avenue South, New York, N.Y. 10016.
Now, the opportunity for Congress and Mr. Yeltsin. To start, Congress can ask him about the 127,000 "economic" prisoners arrested during the Gorbachev and Yeltsin eras, under Soviet anti-capitalist laws. Most of the offenses of entrepreneurship would not be crimes at all in the free-market economy that is supposed to be Russia's goal.
There is talk of amnesty. When, please?
And then, Congress can legislate that a tiny portion of the funds that will eventually go to help Russia be used for political prisoners living in want. The funds should be dispensed through a joint Russian-American committee, including former prisoners of the gulag.
Mr. Yeltsin and Congress would be sending a message to all other fighters for freedom, wherever they lie in prison cells.
The message will be that when freedom comes for their nations, the prisoners of today will not be the forgotten of tomorrow, left to suffer in liberty after suffering in enchainment. It would be a gift to the past and the future.

HEADLINE: U.N. Agencies Would Find a Welcome Just Across East River;
Costs in New Rochelle

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "New York Rediscovers the U.N." (editorial, June 2), the figure you give as the annual rent Unicef would pay for a headquarters facility in New Rochelle is the monthly rent and does not include operating expenses or electrical charges.
We calculate the comparable occupancy-cost figure for New Rochelle at $8 million to $9 million. This means a cost differential between New York and New Rochelle many times smaller than you suggest. 
 Finally, you suggest a counter-campaign to insure the long-term viability of the United Nations in New York City. We agree wholeheartedly and the Dinkins administration has been working for months to retain Unicef and the other United Nations agencies that are being wooed by Bonn.

HEADLINE: 33 Win MacArthur Awards, Including 17 Women

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
On the same day that Janet Benshoof opened a center to defend the right of women to obtain safe and legal abortions, she was named a recipient of a fellowship from the MacArthur Foundation of Chicago.
 Ms. Benshoof, a New York lawyer who is an expert on women's reproductive rights, was one of 33 people named yesterday to receive the annual awards. 
She is receiving the award in a milestone year: for the first time since the fellowships were created in 1981, female recipients outnumber men, 17 to 16.
 Also yesterday Ms. Benshoof inaugurated the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy in Manhattan, which was formed by separating the Reproductive Freedom Project from the American Civil Liberties Union.
 Two other recipients received the awards on their birthdays. Amy Clampitt, a poet and essayist, turned 72 yesterday, and Wes Jackson, a botanist and geneticist, was 56.
 The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation created the fellowships in 1981, saying it wanted to free "exceptionally gifted individuals" from economic constraints so they could develop their potential. The awards, which have gone to 299 men and 84 women, including this year's winners, amount to $150,000 to $375,000 over five years, with the youngest receiving smaller awards. They can spend the money as they choose.

HEADLINE: 33 Win MacArthur Awards, Including 17 Women

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
On the same day that Janet Benshoof opened a center to defend the right of women to obtain safe and legal abortions, she was named a recipient of a fellowship from the MacArthur Foundation of Chicago.
 Ms. Benshoof, a New York lawyer who is an expert on women's reproductive rights, was one of 33 people named yesterday to receive the annual awards. 
She is receiving the award in a milestone year: for the first time since the fellowships were created in 1981, female recipients outnumber men, 17 to 16.
 Also yesterday Ms. Benshoof inaugurated the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy in Manhattan, which was formed by separating the Reproductive Freedom Project from the American Civil Liberties Union.
 Two other recipients received the awards on their birthdays. Amy Clampitt, a poet and essayist, turned 72 yesterday, and Wes Jackson, a botanist and geneticist, was 56.
 The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation created the fellowships in 1981, saying it wanted to free "exceptionally gifted individuals" from economic constraints so they could develop their potential. The awards, which have gone to 299 men and 84 women, including this year's winners, amount to $150,000 to $375,000 over five years, with the youngest receiving smaller awards. They can spend the money as they choose.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Bill to Simplify Voter Registration Clears House and Pressures Bush

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16

 BODY:
Seeking higher voter turnout among the poor, elderly and disabled, the Democratic-controlled House today overwhelmingly approved a measure that would enable all citizens to register to vote as they renew their driver's licenses and apply for social services at government agencies.
White House officials said they would advise President Bush to veto the measure, which was approved by the Senate in May. But it could be politically uncomfortable for the President to reject a proposal that has the goal of encouraging more people to vote. 
 Democrats have threatened to make an election issue out of what they call Republican attempts to restrict voting. Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington said today that for the President to veto the legislation while "we're selling democracy around the world" would make voters more cynical and ultimately hurt the Republican Party.
"The President will have a heavy burden of blame and explanation if he vetoes this legislation," Mr. Foley added.
 
Vulnerable to a Veto
 The bill passed by 268 to 153, short of the two-thirds needed to override a veto, with 239 Democrats joined by 28 Republicans and 1 Independent in favor of the bill. Only 18 Democrats voted with 135 Republicans in opposition. Assuming that all 435 House members were present on a vote to challenge a veto, 290 votes would be needed to override.
The Senate approval of the measure on May 20 was six votes short of being veto-proof.
The measure, known on Capitol Hill as the "motor voter bill," would replace the potpourri of registration procedures that exists among the states. Thirty states, including New York and New Jersey, as well as the District of Columbia, already have enacted registration rules that include some or all of the bill's provisions. The Connecticut legislature passed a "motor-voter" law last month. It was signed by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. last week.
The bill passed today would require all states to allow eligible citizens to register at the same time they obtain or renew their driver's, marriage, hunting or fishing licenses. States would also have to offer voter registration by mail and at the offices of state agencies like welfare and unemployment-compensation offices.
The bill would also prohibit removal of a registered voter's name from the rolls for failure to vote, and it would encourage registration on Election Day.
These measures would almost certainly help Democrats by adding welfare clients, the working poor and the disabled to the voter rolls. Thus, the passage of the bill presents a political challenge for Republicans, who wanted to defeat it without appearing hostile to participatory democracy.
Currently, more than a third of those eligible are not registered to vote, and only about half of those registered generally cast a vote in Presidential elections. In 1988, Mr. Bush was elected by about one-quarter of the eligible voters. The turnout for off-year Congressional and local elections as well as Presidential primaries is even lower.
In the floor debate today, Republicans said the bill would open the door to more fraud and needlessly add to state expenses. They unsuccessfully offered an alternative they said would encourage voting by giving states $25 million to support registration.
Representative David Dreier, Republican of California, called the bill "the National Voter Fraud Act," adding: "There is no mandatory address-verification program and other safeguards against fraud. American citizen or not, virtually anyone who has a driver's license can register to vote with little fear of getting caught."
Democrats said that concern was overblown. They cited several enforcement mechanisms and said there are substantial criminal penalties for intimidation or coercion against citizens to register or vote a particular way.
The Republican bill, offered by Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the minority leader, would have stuck out provisions encouraging mail registration, registration on Election Day and registration at welfare agencies. The Michel proposal was defeated by a vote of 290 to 133, mostly along party lines.
The White House said today that President Bush's advisers have already recommended that he veto the Senate bill unless it is altered to correct what a spokeswoman called "serious flaws."
The Administration argued that the current legislation substantially raised the risk of voter fraud without raising penalties, and said that it would impose "expensive procedural requirements and significant related costs" on the states without any clear justification.
Sharon Holman, a spokeswoman for the Perot Petition Committee, said she believed that Ross Perot would support the bill. Although the likely independent candidate had not issued a statement directly regarding the measure, Ms. Holman said that as an "educated guess I would assume he is for it."
"He is certainly in favor of anything that would help people get out and vote and has been very vocal in his support of this in the past," Ms. Holman said. She noted that Mr. Perot had in previous interviews advocated changing election days to Saturdays and Sundays rather than Tuesdays to make it easier for voters to get to the polls.
 
Another Voice in Support
 And Gracia Hillman, executive director of the League of Women Voters, heralded the House action, predicting that it would "enfranchise the 70 million Americans who consistently cannot vote because they are not registered. This bill will strengthen democracy."
Representative William M. Thomas, Republican of California, said low voter turnout was attributable not to registration rules, but to disgust with the gridlock in Washington and what he called the rigging of Congressional rules and procedures by the Democratic majority."
Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, countered, "In the wake of the recent Los Angeles crisis, it is our duty to address the frustration of powerlessless that is erupting in all our cities." He added that the same arguments raised against the bill "were raised against the Voting Rights Act in 1965."
"Opponents, then and now, claim that the bill is too costly, that it is an invasion of states' rights," Mr. Conyers said. "Clearly those arguments were fallacious then and they are now."
Today's vote came nearly a month after the Senate passed the same bill, but by a margin six votes short of that needed to override a veto. The bill, if enacted, would become effective Jan. 1, 1994. It would not apply to the handful of states that simply do not require voter registration, or that permit registration on Election Day.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN WASHINGTON: And Now, the Political Plowshares;
Boost for Bush Campaign, but Will It Last?

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16

 BODY:
On the face of it, the sweeping arms agreement announced today by President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia seems precisely the kind of political medicine Mr. Bush needs.
It displays Mr. Bush in his preferred role of accomplished international negotiator and peacemaker, which since the Persian Gulf war has been gradually eclipsed, in terms of public opinion, by concerns about health care, jobs, education, the environment and the credibility of politicians. Nuclear disarmament is obviously an easier sell than sluggish economic growth. 
 The historical record shows, furthermore, that Presidents who make major strides toward peace or who confront major world crises get political credit for doing so. A study last year by the Gallup Organization identified 42 "rally events," in which Presidents played such roles, in administrations stretching back to that of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and found an average jump of 8 percentage points, lasting an average of 10 weeks, in Presidential approval.
Sometime the increase has been bigger. When the American hostages were seized in Iran in November 1979, Jimmy Carter's ratings jumped 19 points; when the Vietnam peace agreements were reached in January 1973, Richard M. Nixon gained 16 points. Mr. Bush's approval figure reached 89 percent, a record, after jumping 18 percent at the onset of the air war in the gulf.
 
Stressing the Negative
 But the Democrats will do all they can to re-emphasize George Bush's weak suit, domestic affairs. The Speaker of the House, Representative Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington, said this evening that he doubted the House would approve further aid for Russia because of political instability there; he did not say, but other Democrats did, that their political interest clearly lies in spending money at home, not abroad.
The political fallout of the Yeltsin visit is also complicated by the possibility that Americans taken prisoner in Vietnam might have been shipped to Russia and imprisoned, and that some might still be in labor camps.
A whole series of other caveats must be applied to any suggestion that today's agreement could represent a turning point in what has been a dismal campaign for the President.
First and most obviously, the election is in November, not June, and other events at home and abroad will arise to capture the electorate's attention. Only rarely is a foreign-policy event so riveting that it swings large numbers of votes months later, as the war for the Falkland Islands in 1982 apparently did in the British general election of 1983, when Margaret Thatcher won a decisive victory.
 
A Short-Term Gain
 "The President has had very little good news to talk about for the last three months," said Peter Hart, a Democratic poll-taker, strategist and analyst, "and this will certainly help him in the short term by pulling the spotlight back onto foreign affairs, the one subject voters think he is best qualified to deal with.
"But this is not like a war in the intensity of its impact, and people are going to come back to the domestic issues by the fall. It will still be an election about whether the government works and solves our problems."
In addition, a potential paradox lurks in the agreement to cut the two countries' nuclear warheads by two-thirds: if it takes effect, the possibility of nuclear confrontation between the two would be further reduced and, it could be argued, so would the importance of having an experienced hand on the nuclear trigger. Ross Perot and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas lack foreign-policy experience, but would that matter so much to voters when the risk of major conflagration appears slight?
Mr. Clinton, in particular, might also be able to argue that the further reductions in weaponry should make available more money for the domestic programs that he has advocated without always being able to describe precisely how he would pay for them.
Whether the arms agreement will help the President persuade a hitherto reluctant Congress to approve his aid package for Russia is also open to question, especially given the sensitivities on Capitol Hill to the prisoner-of-war issue. Until Mr. Yeltsin's disclosure that some Americans may still be held in Russian camps has been investigated, said Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, there will be no approval for aid to Russia.
Asked about the arms-control agreement, Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, chairman of the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, commented, "I think it should help. I think the majority in the Senate are predisposed to help. It would be a shame if because of the prisoner-of-war aspect defeat was snatched from the jaws of victory."
 
Foreign-Affairs Appeal

Mr. Bush has been trying to play the foreign-policy card, without conspicuous success, since he began his re-election campaign in January.
He used television commercials in New Hampshire that extolled his role in the gulf victory and attacked his Republican rival, Patrick J. Buchanan, as a reluctant warrior. Only Monday, in an appearance on CNN before the arms-control agreement was reached, the President all but begged voters to reward him for his foreign policy.
"I hope they know I stand for world peace," he said. "I hope every mother and dad out there says, 'Hey, we ought to give this President a little credit for the fact that our little kids don't worry quite as much about nuclear war.' Isn't that important? Isn't it important that because of Ronald Reagan and me, to a large extent -- and a lot of support in Congress -- we've seen a crumbling of our monolithic opponents, the Communists?"
Voters do credit Mr. Bush with foreign-policy expertise; in the most recent New York Times/CBS News poll, taken in early May, he had a 47 percent favorable, 42 percent unfavorable rating in that field. But his rating in handling the economy was so dreadful -- 18 percent favorable, 73 percent unfavorable -- that it dragged his overall standing into negative ground.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN WASHINGTON: And Now, the Political Plowshares;
Russians Greet Accord With Joy and Remorse

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 16

 BODY:
Like so many of the drastic changes taking place in Russia, the agreement to sharply reduce the strategic arsenals of Russia and the United States is likely to be welcomed for the new era it heralds and resented for the collapse of empire it confirms.
The agreement announced by Presidents Bush and Boris N. Yeltsin on the first full day of the Russian leader's visit to Washington seemed to come as a major surprise. None of the newspapers here had predicted it, and none of the evening news programs had any advance notice. 
 Mr. Yeltsin seemed to relish the surprise in his comments in the Rose Garden, and it was evident that he hoped to find political benefits in nuclear reductions that went far beyond anything the old Soviet Union had ever achieved, and far more quickly.
 
Welcome News
 Mr. Yeltsin has made much in interviews and speeches of the claim that he is leading Russia into the fold of civilized nations, and that he is capable of matching and exceeding the rapport that Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, developed with the West.
For those Russians reared on the fear of a nuclear clash of the superpowers, and for those who have understood that Russia can no longer afford the sort of military expenditures that ultimately bankrupted the Soviet Union, the news was bound to be welcome.
But the treaty was equally certain to meet with grumbling and disaffection from that sizable portion of the populace, especially in the older generations, who chafe at the collapse of Soviet and Russian power and influence.
At the tip of the iceberg were several hundred Russian ultra-nationalists and Communist die-hards who gathered tonight around the television transmitting tower at Ostankino, a frequent site for protests near Moscow, denouncing Mr. Yeltsin as a Judas for "selling out" Russia.
The decision was also likely to go down badly with the military. The agreement reached in Washington appeared to give the United States exactly the advantage that Mr. Yeltsin had told the military last week he opposed.
As described by the two Presidents, the agreement called for the elimination of multiple-warhead land-based intercontinental missiles, which are the backbone of the old Soviet nuclear arsenal, but allowed the survival of multiple-warhead sea-launched intercontinental missiles, which are the United States' major nuclear strength.
 
Assailed Similar Proposal
 But precisely such a deal was assailed by Mr. Yeltsin only last Wednesday in remarks at the Russian Defense Ministry, where he supported continued nuclear parity and accused the United States of seeking "a more advantageous position."
His remarks were not reported in detail in the press here. But unless Mr. Yeltsin could convince military officers that he had found other means of securing parity, he was likely to come under criticism for unilaterally surrendering one of Moscow's major strengths.
The obvious counter to such arguments -- that the survivors of a disintegrated and bankrupt Soviet Union have no logical claim to demand parity with the major Western power -- is not heard in a nation that has not yet become accustomed to the loss of might.
A great many Russians, even those who normally regard themselves as liberal, democratic and enlightened, have had difficulties shedding the identification with power and empire. Many residents of the former Soviet Union, and especially those living in Russia, derived their sense of identity from the scope and significance of their nation, not their nationality.
 
No ICBM's and Butter
 Even today many Russians take for granted that Russia has a say in the Middle East or in Yugoslavia. Mr. Yeltsin himself argued in an interview last week that Russia was a great power if only by virtue of its history.
Thus even those Russians who recognize the wisdom and advantage of the arms deal are likely to feel a tinge of remorse if they perceive that Russia is surrendering its power. Such feelings were likely to be exacerbated by Mr. Yeltsin's comment that with half of Russia living below the poverty line it could simply not afford a large arsenal.
Men like Georgy Arbatov, the head of the Moscow Government's U.S.A. Institute, have become increasingly bitter in public over the perception that Russia is destroying itself by aping Western ways. Mr. Arbatov and like-minded Russians have focused much of their irritation at the International Monetary Fund, which is perceived by many Russians to be making demands that would plunge Russia even further into poverty.
Mr. Yeltsin is obviously aware of such criticism, and he has declared that he would not allow the I.M.F. to "dictate" to Russia, just as he declared last week that he would not allow the United States an "advantage" in arms talks.
Ultimately, the success or failure of Mr. Yeltsin's first major presidential foray to the United States will be determined by the success or failure of his reforms.
If the perception forms that the reforms are bearing fruit, and especially if the West does come through with the mooted multi-billion assistance package, the summit and the arms agreements will come to be seen as major milestones in the forging of normal East-West relations.
If things go badly, Mr. Yeltsin's political opponents from the "national-patriotic" camp are likely to focus on the summit as an example of the President's kowtowing to the West at the expense of his people.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN WASHINGTON;
BUSH AND YELTSIN AGREE TO CUT LONG-RANGE ATOMIC WARHEADS; SCRAP KEY LAND-BASED MISSILES

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16

 BODY:
President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin announced an agreement today that not only sharply reduces their stocks of long-range-missile warheads, but also eliminates all multiple-warhead missiles based on land, the core of the old Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal.
The accord was announced by the leaders in the White House Rose Garden just hours after Mr. Yeltsin began the first state visit to Washington by a Russian President. It must still be translated into a formal treaty, which United States officials said could be done within three months, then approved by the United States Senate and the Russian Parliament. 
 "With this agreement," Mr. Bush told reporters, "the nuclear nightmare recedes more and more for ourselves, for our children and for our grandchildren." [Excerpts from Mr. Bush's and Mr. Yeltsin's remarks, page A10.]
 
The Target Date is 2003
 The accord requires each nation to reduce its nuclear force to between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads in two phases by no later than 2003, and by 2000 if the United States helps Russia to destroy its arms system.
The two nations together currently control about 22,500 warheads. Under a treaty that Mr. Bush and the former Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, negotiated in 1991 but which is only now being implemented, the United States arsenal was to be reduced to 8,500 warheads and Russia's to about 6,900. [Page A11.]
Mr. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin also agreed to pursue indications in newly examined Soviet records that some American prisoners from the Vietnam War may have been transfered to the Soviet Union, and could still be held in Russia. But Mr. Yeltsin stressed that the prospect was merely "possible," and Mr. Bush said the United States had no independent proof that Mr. Yeltsin's assessment was valid or that any Americans were alive. [Page A11.]
 
Following Up P.O.W. Report
 The President said that he would immediately dispatch Malcolm Toon, a former United States Ambassador to Moscow, to Russia to pursue the reports. Mr. Toon and an adviser to Mr. Yeltsin, Dmitri Volkogonov, head a joint committee seeking to locate both Russian and American service personnel missing in conflicts that involved the two superpowers.
While the planned cuts in nuclear warheads are dramatic, arms-control analysts said that the mix of weapons remaining under the agreement is equally significant.
The accord would effectively wipe out the centerpiece of the Russian arsenal, its land-based missile force, while preserving much of the sea-based force that United States military strategists consider this nation's great strength.
The United States would cut the number of its submarine-launched missile warheads to 1,750, from 3,840; while this is a 50 percent reduction, it still allows the United States a potentially devastating force at sea.
The Russian concessions on land-based missiles, which Mr. Yeltsin said last week would give the United States an unacceptable advantage, appeared to be driven by his urgent need to secure economic aid to help prop up the faltering Russian economy and to cut his own military expenditures.
Mr. Yeltsin called the accord "an unparalleled and probably unexpected thing for you and the whole world," and indeed, as early as this morning, officials in Washington said they were not sure when an accord would be reached.
The suddenness of today's announcement triggered speculation that Mr. Bush had lured Mr. Yeltsin into a nuclear accord with promises of further or quicker economic aid. "I honestly don't believe that that was any part of his calculation," a senior official said today of Mr. Bush.
 
Bush Seeking More Aid
 The President has pledged billions in loan guarantees and hundreds of millions more in humanitarian aid to the former Soviet nations as part of a $24 billion aid package being prepared by the Western democracies. But Congress has balked at approving aid in an election year dominated by domestic concerns, and the President has been forced to lobby increasingly hard merely to persuade lawmakers to consider his request.
Mr. Bush made another pitch in his welcoming remarks to Mr. Yeltsin this morning, calling the economic aid "an investment in a new century of peace with Russia."
"History offers us a rare chance, a chance to achieve what twice before this century has escaped our grasp," he said. "It is the vision that perished twice in the battlefields of Europe, the vision that gave us hope through the long cold war, the dream of a new world of freedom."
United States officials had been hinting for days that the arms talks with the Russians were going slowly. That raised the question of whether an agreement had suddenly fallen into place or Administration officials had been deliberately minimizing their progress.
If progress was played down, it might have been to set the stage for a public-relations coup at a two-day meeting that had promised to generate less news and electricity than the meetings between Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Bush, and before him President Ronald Reagan.
In trappings and public interest, this Moscow-Washington meeting has not approached the spectacle of past summits, despite the White House's best efforts.
At welcoming ceremonies on the South Lawn of the White House this morning, red, white and blue bunting ran riot, troops massed in uniforms ranging from Navy whites to revolutionary tricorners and greatcoats and the landscape was bedecked not just with the flags of the two nations, but those of all 50 states as well.
 
Not Much Cheering
 But unlike Mr. Gorbachev, who was mobbed with traffic-stopping crowds wherever he went in Washington, Mr. Yeltsin was greeted outside Blair House on his way to the ceremony by a scattering of about 200 tourists and other onlookers and only a brief, stifled cheer as his motorcade sped away.
The Russian leader stood stiffly erect and smiling through much of the morning ceremony, in which he and Mr. Bush exchanged florid praise suited more to lifelong allies than to erstwhile enemies. But his handshake with Mr. Bush at the morning's end was strong, and later he predicted, to the surprise of reporters, that he and Mr. Bush would reach agreement to cut their nuclear stockpiles.
"When the presidents take charge of something, you can be sure it will be handled in the most efficient way," he said before entering a working lunch with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. "That means we will reach an agreement."
 
A Boost for Bush
 The arms agreement allowed Mr. Bush to regain the international spotlight and the political offensive after a discouraging week in which he first was caught on the edge of a tear-gas attack in Panama, then held up to global criticism in Brazil for his contrary views at a United Nations environmental summit meeting.
And it permitted Mr. Yeltsin to return home later this week with the burnish of international leadership and, perhaps, some greater assurance that Mr. Bush would deliver on his promise to contribute to the international rescue of Russia's economy.
Mr. Yeltsin described the accord as tangible evidence of the "partnership and friendship" between Washington and Moscow.
"We know one thing," he said. "We shall not fight against each other."
Asked how the two leaders had achieved an accord that seemed unlikely only hours before, a United States official replied: "Hard work. Would you believe it? And a strong sense on both sides that it was a real chance, an historic opportunity, and that a maximum effort should be made on both sides."
Mr. Yeltsin described the accord as tangible evidence of the "partnership and friendship" between Washington and Moscow.
"We know one thing," he said. "We shall not fight against each other."
 
Bush Optimistic on Aid
 At briefings for reporters, Administration officials said that Mr. Bush expressed optimism that assistance for Russia would move quickly through the Senate, perhaps this week, but that he also told Mr. Yeltsin that election-year realities made the final prospects for passage less certain.
Mr. Yeltsin was said to have responded that he understood political realities, and that back home in Moscow, his own were "brutal."
Today, however, all that was swept into the background by an arms agreement that appeared, at least on paper, to dwarf its ancestors.
The agreement was ironed out in horse-trading this afternoon between President Bush and President Yeltsin, when the Russian leader finally agreed to destroy his multiple-warhead missiles by 2003, as Washington had proposed, after President Bush assured him that the United States will help pay for the destruction.
 
The Path to an Accord
 The chronology of the negotiations, as outlined today by a senior Administration official, went something like this:
Last September President Bush proposed deep cuts in nuclear missiles, to 4,700 warheads each, provided that Moscow agreed to give up all of its land-based, multiple-warhead ballistic missiles. The Kremlin countered with a proposal that the two sides cut to 2,500 warheads each, and that both nations give up their land-based and sea-launched multiple-warhead missiles.
When Secretary of State Baker and Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev met in Brussels on March 11, Mr. Baker tried to persuade Mr. Kozyrev that given their new friendship, it was not necessary to maintain parity, with both sides giving up their multiple-warheaded missiles. The Russians were not persuaded.
When Mr. Baker and Mr. Kozyrev met again in Lisbon in the middle of May, the Russians for the first time signaled a general willingness to accept Washington's number of 4,700 warheads and to allow the United States to keep some submarine-based multiple-warhead missiles; this would be done in two stages by 2005. But Moscow wanted to retain almost all of its ICBM's until the second stage.
From then on, talks between Mr. Baker and Mr. Kozyrev focused on how to implement this understanding. The Americans wanted an earlier target date, and eventually they compromised on 2003. The Russians wanted lower total warhead numbers, and the two sides eventually agreed on the range of 3,000 to 3,500.
The last minute wrangling was over how to pay for such rapid destruction of nuclear weapons, how to count the number of weapons that bombers would be allowed to carry and how to actually go about taking warheads off missiles -- all of which were resolved in talks last night and this morning.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN WASHINGTON;
U.S. to Press Yeltsin to Reduce Budget Deficit

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16

 BODY:
Administration officials said today that they would press President Boris N. Yeltsin to bring Russia's budget deficit under control to help enable Moscow to sign an economic reform agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
If Russia controls its deficit, reins in its money supply and moves to make the ruble convertible, then the Administration will press the I.M.F. not to delay an agreement because of concerns about details, the officials added. 
 "If those three key issues can be resolved, then we're willing to work with Russia to see that superfluous issues don't get in the way," said a senior Administration official.
With their battered economy deteriorating day by day, Russian officials are eager to sign an agreement with the fund as soon as possible because an accord will unblock most of the $24 billion in aid the Group of Seven industrial nations promised last April.
During Mr. Yeltsin's visit to Washington, Russian officials have waged a public campaign to urge more flexibility from the fund, arguing that if the I.M.F. is too stern it could push Russia's economy to the breaking point.
Fund officials are pushing Russia to reduce its budget deficit to zero, while Russian officials are talking of a deficit target of around 4 percent of the gross national product as compared with more than 20 percent last year.
The fund also wants Russia to explain how it will coordinate monetary policy with other former Soviet republics that plan to continue to use the ruble, because such coordination is deemed essential for reducing inflation and stabilizing the currency.
"We couldn't support a program that would be regarded as less than adequate," said Michel Camdessus, the I.M.F.'s managing director.
The I.M.F. is also pushing Russia to remove price controls on oil, but Mr. Yeltsin said this would make it hard for farmers to harvest.
"Russia needs to concentrate on the key elements fundamental to reform," said Treasury Under Secretary David C. Mulford. "The fund needs to remember what is politically possible."
In meetings today with President Bush, Mr. Yeltsin explained the sweeping reforms he announced Monday about privatization, bankruptcy, ownership of land and foreign exchange.
"They clearly gave us the impression that they're fully committed to continuing with their reform effort, that they're going to stay the course," said an Administration official who sat in on the meetings.
Members of Congress said an American aid package for Russia could be further delayed by Mr. Yeltsin's statement that Russia might be holding some American prisoners of war who have survived since the Vietnam War.
"If it's determined definitively there are Americans being held as prisoners of war in Russia, there's no way that the Congress is going to pass aid while they're being held," said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont.
The House and Senate foreign relations committees have both approved the package, but no floor vote has been scheduled.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN WASHINGTON;
Reducing the Russian Arms Threat

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16

 BODY:
The latest Russian-American arms control agreement not only reduces their total nuclear arsenals from about 22,500 warheads to 7,000, but also does so in a way that eliminates the most threatening Russian nuclear weapons while allowing the United States to maintain its most advanced missiles, American officials and arms control experts said today.
"We are talking about a very good deal," said Jack Mendelsohn, deputy director of the Arms Control Association. "On paper, it looks like the two forces will be reduced equally, but in fact the Russians will be giving up the backbone of their arsenal -- land-based multiple warheaded missiles -- while we will be retaining the area of our greatest strength, sea-based ballistic missiles." 
 American officials and experts said that the agreement reached by President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin will fundamentally reshape the nuclear standoff that has existed between the United States and the former Soviet Union since the beginning of the cold war.
 
Reducing Chances of War
 They said that the proposed treaty would eliminate those nuclear weapons that both sides would most likely have used in a pre-emptive first strike and to leave them each with those nuclear weapons that they would only likely use in a retaliatory strike. In other words, the proposed treaty should radically reduce the possibility of a nuclear war -- no matter who is in power in the Kremlin or Washington.
Beyond that, the sheer number of warheads both sides will possess is going to be cut drastically, far below the levels just agreed to in the recently signed strategic arms reduction treaty. At a time of great instability inside Russia, the sooner the number of warheads there is reduced the better, the analysts agreed.
Russia and the United States now have about 22,500 warheads altogether. After the Start treaty, they would have gone down to about 15,000 warheads altogether. Under the new accord, they would be reducing to about 7,000 warheads, or roughly 3,500 each.
But the mix of warheads is as important as the total. Russia's most potent and sophisticated missiles -- the 10-warheaded SS-18's and SS-24's -- are based in fixed silos on land. Many traditional arms control experts considered these the most dangerous and destabilizing weapons. Because these missiles could carry so many powerful warheads, the United States would always be tempted to strike first in order to knock them out before they could be launched, and the Russians would always be tempted to launch them first in any crisis, to avoid having them destroyed.
 
Reductions by 2003
 Under the new agreement, Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Bush have decided to give up all of their land-based multiple-warhead missiles in two phases by no later than the year 2003. For Mr. Yeltsin that means his SS-18's and SS-24's, the pride of his arsenal, while for Mr. Bush it means giving up 50 10-warheaded MX missiles and stripping America's 500 Minuteman III missiles from three warheads each down to one warhead each.
But the United States' most advanced multiple-warhead nuclear weapons are the Trident missiles based on submarines, each missile with eight warheads. Under the proposed treaty, the United States and Russia would also have to reduce the number of these warheads to a ceiling of 1,750 each, a 50 percent cut of the American arsenal of sea-launched warheads. But the United States Navy will not have to give up any submarines or sea-launched missiles. It could just reduce the number of warheads on each of its Tridents.
In other words, while the Russians will be relinquishing their most powerful missiles, the United States will merely be thinning out their most sophisticated missiles.
As a result of this proposed treaty the American nuclear triad of land-based missiles, sea-launched missiles and bombers will be radically restructured. Instead of having American nuclear weapons based equally on the three legs of that triad, the United States would have a lot of nuclear weapons on its submarines, a lot on its bombers, and relatively few on land-based missiles.
 
Submarine-Based Missiles
 "What this treaty does is remove the weapons that are most dangerous, the ones most likely to lead to a pre-emptive strike -- their SS-18's and our MX's," said James T. Bush, associate director of the Center for Defense Information, an arms control monitoring group.
"Both sides will be left primarily with submarine-based missiles, which are not accurate enough to provide a first-strike capability, and bombers, which are so slow and easy to detect that you don't have a first-strike capability with them either," Mr. Bush said. "What you are left with essentially are retaliatory forces on both sides, and this greatly reduces the hair-trigger environment that we lived in for so long."
While the proposed deal would seem to favor the United States, President Bush also agreed to cut much deeper than he was originally willing -- both the total number of warheads and sea-based warheads in particular. The original Bush proposal last September, when the United States opened discussions on further nuclear cuts with the Soviet Government of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, was to go no lower than 4,700 warheads for each side, and to cut the American sea-based forces by only one-third. Moscow originally wanted to go down to 2,500 warheads each.
Now Mr. Bush has agreed to cut to between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads for each side, and to cut the American arsenal at sea by about 50 percent instead of one-third. In return, though, he got the long-standing goal of a total ban on Russia's most dangerous multiple-warhead land-based missiles.
 
Praised by Biden
 "I commend the President for his decision to trade cuts in U.S. strategic arms at sea for a ban on Russia's most dangerous weapons on land," said Senator Joseph R. Biden, the Delaware Democrat whose subcommittee oversees many arms control issues. "By focusing on eliminating as many nuclear weapons as possible in the former Soviet Union, and as fast as possible, the President has struck what may be the best deal in the history of arms control. The next step is to call on the British, the French and the Chinese to freeze their arsenals at a few hundred weapons each in exchange for a further cut by Washington and Moscow down to a ceiling not higher than 1,000 warheads each."
In his remarks today, Mr. Yeltsin alluded to two principal attractions of the deal from the Russian perspective. One was his desire to give, as he put it, tangible "expression of the fundamental change in the political and economic relations between the United States of America and Russia." Without such an expression he seemed unlikely to get the economic aid he wants from the United States Congress.
But equally important was the fact that Russia simply could no longer afford an arms race with the United States, which hardly could afford one either.
Mr. Yeltsin said: "We are departing from the ominous parity where each country was exerting every effort to stay in line, which has led Russia, for instance, having half of its population living below the poverty line. We cannot afford it, and therefore we must have minimum security level to deal with any possible eventuality which might arise anywhere in the world and threaten our security."

Boston Bank Ratings Up

 BODY:
The Bank of Boston Corporation, rebounding from its problems with delinquent commercial real estate loans and the recession in the New England economy, was rewarded yesterday with higher debt ratings by Moody's Investors Service.
Moody's raised the banking company's rating for long-term senior debt to the investment grade category of Baa-3 from the junk bond category of Ba-2. It raised the short-term commercial paper rating to Prime-3 from Not Prime. 
 The higher ratings are important because many investors, like pension funds and mutual funds, have policies that forbid them to buy junk bonds or commercial paper that lacks a prime rating.
At Baa-3 and Prime-3, the ratings of Bank of Boston remain at the bottom of the investment grade categories, and low relative to other banks its size.
Moody's noted that the banking company continued to be troubled by a high level of troubled loans.

HEADLINE: A Mayor And Town Rise Jointly

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN

 BODY:
Mayor Unita Blackwell runs the Mississippi hamlet of Mayersville from a one-room City Hall that was once a Baptist church. The community, about 80 percent black, is made up mainly of old people and children. Unemployment is high, especially in the months when there is no farm work.
This week, the Mayor became one of 33 recipients of a five-year grant from the MacArthur Foundation, which gives the awards to free "exceptionally gifted individuals" from economic constraints so they can develop their potential. After completing her current four-year term in 1993, Ms. Blackwell said, she might use the $350,000 grant to support herself while writing a book about reviving rural communities. 
 It is a subject the 59-year-old Mayor knows quite a bit about. While rural Issaquena County, of which Mayersville (pronounced MY-ers-ville) is the seat, lost 25 percent of its population during the 1980's, Mayersville grew a bit, to a little more than 500 people.
Ms. Blackwell said in an interview in Mayersville last week that she had achieved some of her goals since becoming Mayor 26 years ago but not the most vital: luring an industry that will hire people.
But while she waits for the jobs that may never come, she has kept her community intact. And residents tick off her achievements, which include incorporation of the city, a water system that reaches every home, a sewer system that reaches most homes and paving of all the dozen or so streets.
 
Success in Public Housing
 Public housing was a tougher challenge. In the 1970's the Federal Government agreed to finance a housing development and sent the money for it. But the cost of the land rose above the amount the Government had agreed to pay. Ms. Blackwell returned the grant with the exception of $50,000, which she used to buy a fire truck that had been part of the project. The Government complained, but she kept the truck.
It was not until 1987 that the Mayor was able to open the housing development, 20 federally financed units for elderly and disabled people. Since then, two more subsidized complexes of 16 units each have opened, one for the elderly, one for families.
Ms. Blackwell is convinced that her tiny town about 50 miles north of Vicksburg is a national resource.
"If I could help these small places to develop, we can become a model of what can happen," she said. "What's missing in the cities is the closeness you find here. You can walk the streets. You don't see fear in people's eyes.
"We can have 100 children going to the cities. Then you have 100 problems. You take someone from the land and stick them on concrete, you've got a psychological mishap. These people in Los Angeles. Where did they come from? They came from a lack of jobs, a lack of housing, a lack of their needs being met. They don't feel trapped here. They like it here. They just need a job. That's the reason I see we have to keep these small nothing towns."
 
Wide Orbit of Service
 Ms. Blackwell, who is divorced and has a 34-year-old son, first got involved in politics as a civil rights worker in the 1960's and has since traveled in lofty circles. She has been on 16 diplomatic missions to China. She has twice been president of the National Conference of Black Mayors. She was a member of the Democratic National Committee, was co-chairman of the Mississippi Democratic Party and is a co-founder of Mississippi Action for Community Education, a community-development organization in Greenville.
"You do where you're at," Ms. Blackwell said, explaining why she has stayed in Mayersville, where there is little to do beyond watching the cotton plants fill out and ducking the occasional drenching rains.
"A Chinese man said to me. 'Unita, you are like a phantom that nests in a place but flies out all over the world.'
"What I got out of that was, why not Mayersville? Mayersville has developed. It's a small piece, but it has developed. It showed people you can do it. I don't think I could have done any more in terms of a model for myself or for people."
Anna Mae Dolley, 67, and Grace Reynolds, 80, sat in the mid-afternoon sun outside their apartments in the housing project, where Mrs. Dolley's rent is $61 a month and Mrs. Reynolds's is $50. Each woman receives about $440 a month in Social Security payments.
When the Mayor came by, leading 20 Egyptian journalists on a tour of Mayersville and to eat lunch in the housing project's dining room, the two women joined in extolling the changes Ms. Blackwell has made.
Mrs. Dolley: She helped get all these houses in. I thought, I got to get me one. Me and her, we were the first here. She moved here in the morning time, and I moved here in the evening time.
Mrs. Reynolds: She have a car up there, and she got a van.
Mrs. Dolley: Carry us to the doctor. Carry us to shopping.
Mrs. Reynolds: She looks out for us every way she can.
Mrs. Dolley: This was a dirt road. She brought that new road in.
 
Working in the Fields
 Mayersville is the picture of a rural subsistence economy. Teen-agers and a few older people still work in the cotton fields. From now until mid-July or so, when the bolls form, they get jobs chopping weeds in the cotton. The pay is about $4.00 an hour.
"Generally, when they get to be 13 or 14 in this area, we put them to work," Ms. Blackwell said. "They get paid just as much as anybody. A lot of families, that's how they get their children's clothes."
The town buys food in bulk with other communities in Mississippi and Arkansas, and once a month it sells big boxes of the food -- chicken, sausage, vegetables and fruit -- for $14 a box. On those days, the Mayor said, 200 to 300 people come to City Hall to buy it.
Large families buy five or six boxes. Anyone can buy, but a person is supposed to put in two hours of community service per box. They can work in the food distribution line, baby sit or visit elderly people who live alone.
"I have a list of everyone who gets a box," Ms. Blackwell said. "Then I can ask, 'What did you do?' It's an honor system. In a small community you can't get away with telling a whole lot of lies."
The Mayor's budget is $30,000 a year. She has one regular employee, a clerk, Helen Reed, who is also the tax collector. Ms. Blackwell is only paid $6,000 a year, and since she is also rearing her 13-year-old grandson, Jermaine, she could qualify for the same public assistance that most of her constituents receive. But she said she has never applied.
 
Cotton Fields to College
 Born to sharecroppers in Lula, Miss., Ms. Blackwell went to high school in Arkansas and after graduation went to work in the cotton fields. In 1982-83 she went to the University of Massachusetts on a fellowship and received a master's degree in regional planning, even though she had no previous degree.
She settled in Mayersville 30 years ago in the house that belonged to her ex-husband. She has since built a brick ranch-style house on the adjoining lot, but the old place, an unpainted, unplumbed, unelectrified, two-and-a-half-room shack, still stands.
In the 1960's Ms. Blackwell made the shack a regional cell of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee. As a result of her civil rights work, like voter registration drives, she was jailed several times.
She said racism still lingers in Mayersville, though largely below the surface. In responding to common needs like food, she said, she is making headway in eliminating it. For example, when she started her food distribution project several months ago, only blacks participated. But then more and more whites joined, and now blacks and whites work together in the line.
Whites and blacks also live in adjoining houses, but whites say they still draw the line at intermarriage, and some blacks agree. Some whites send their children to the integrated public school, 12 miles away, but more use an all-white private academy in an adjoining county.
Still, Deputy Sheriff Richard Jones said, "this is probably the most together city in the United States."

HEADLINE: One Study's Riches, Another's Rags

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Just how hard was it for somebody to climb from the bottom of the economic ladder to the top in the 1980's?
Two teams of researchers asking the same politically sensitive question -- both tracking individual households over the decade -- have reached quite different conclusions. 
 A Treasury study released earlier this month said it was relatively routine for someone who started out poor to end up affluent.
But a study by the middle-of-the-road Urban Institute concludes that such Horatio Alger stories were, in fact, rare.
 
Confirming What Was Known
 What both the Treasury and the Urban Institute studies show -- and what has never been in serious dispute -- is that the United States is not a caste society in which the circumstances of one's birth arbitrarily determine one's fortune.
Both also confirm one of the best-known facts of modern economics: for rich and poor alike, earnings rise from the time individuals enter the work force through middle age -- roughly doubling, on average -- and fall after retirement.
Nonetheless, many economists believe that poverty remained stubbornly high during the economic boom of the 1980's and that the upward mobility of less educated and less skilled workers deteriorated sharply. Improving those prospects, they agree, will be a crucial challenge for whoever ends up in the White House.
"The similarity is that we both find substantial amounts of mobility," said Isabel Sawhill, the senior author of the Urban Institute study. "But the Treasury finds a lot more movement from the bottom to top than we do."
Leading labor and tax economists said that the Treasury study did not shed much light on the matter of how much social mobility there is in America. Many of the people included in the bottom 20 percent were, in fact, middle- or high-income individuals, like recent college graduates from higher-income families or business people who had a bad year and were temporarily "poor." The Treasury's sample of households, in fact, was more affluent and upwardly mobile than taxpayers in general.
"This isn't your classic income mobility," said Kevin Murphy, a labor economist at the University of Chicago. "This is the guy who works in the college bookstore and has a real job by his early 30's."
The conflicting studies have appeared in the midst of a bareknuckled election-year debate over who won -- and who lost -- from Reaganomics. In a period of slow economic growth, income distribution has elbowed its way into the political arena.
 The Treasury study -- ordered up by the savviest champion of supply-side economics in Congress, Representative Richard D. Armey of Texas -- is the latest Republican counterattack.
The most striking finding of the study: Of Americans who started the decade at the bottom in income distribution, a greater number rose to the top than stayed put. The study tracked tax returns of 14,000 households between 1979 and 1988.
"In the decade of the 1980's, low-income working people had a very good shot at moving up," said R. Glenn Hubbard, director of the Treasury's Office of Tax Analysis. "Mobility is such that the poor grew much richer and the rich only a little richer."
 
9 of 10 Did Better
 Mr. Hubbard's study found that nearly 9 in 10 people who started out at the bottom climbed by at least by one quintile, or 20 percent, implying that few Americans are stuck with low incomes for as long as a decade.
Mr. Armey wrote recently, "The degree of income mobility in American society renders the comparison of quintile income levels over time virtually meaningless."
But the Urban Institute researchers, whose study of some 5,000 households from 1977 to 1986 was released within days of the Treasury report, drew very different conclusions.
"While the poor can 'make it' in America and the wealthy can 'fall from grace,' these events are neither very common nor more likely to occur today than in the 1970's," wrote Ms. Sawhill and another Urban Institute researcher, Mark Condon.
The Urban Institute study found that while rich and poor alike earn more as they go from youth to middle age, the odds of moving from the bottom 20 percent in income distribution to the top 40 percent are a fraction of the odds reported by the Treasury: 1 in 10, compared with 4 in 10.
As a group, the Urban Institute study found, the poor in 1988 were worse off than the poor in 1979. And the study found that averaged over 10 years, people's incomes became markedly more unequal in the late 1970's and 1980's. The income of the top fifth rose to five times that of the bottom fifth, compared with four times as much in the late 1960's and early 1970's.
"There is a lot of mobility, but even when you take it into account incomes are still getting more unequal," Mr. Condon said in an interview. "That's because there are more bad jobs that are paying less and people can't move out of them any more easily than they used to."
 
Third Study to Come
 A third study, by a former Treasury economist, Donald Fullerton, comes to conclusions more like those of the Urban Institute than of the Treasury. The study will be published this fall.
Mr. Fullerton, director of the Office of Tax Analysis during the Reagan Administration and now a visiting professor of economics at the Carnegie Mellon Institute, reports that the overwhelming majority of those who start out in the bottom fifth of earnings remain in the bottom half over a lifetime.
"Almost everybody's earnings are higher at age 49 than at age 20," Mr. Fullerton said. "But of those who start out at age 20 in the bottom 20 percent, three-quarters are still in the bottom quintile 30 years later at age 49 -- and virtually none move to the top."
 Part of the reason that the Treasury study shows so much upward mobility, most experts said, is that the sample is not representative of all American households, nor even of all taxpayers. "Anything based on tax returns is going to leave out people too poor to file tax returns," said Joel Slemrod, a tax economist at the University of Michigan.
James Nunns, a Treasury economist who worked on the study, said about 80 percent of households filed tax returns in any year. And Mr. Nunns said that roughly 40 percent of the households that did file in 1979 were excluded from the sample because they did not file returns in each of the 10 years covered by the study.
 
'Clearly Biased'
 Lawrence Katz, a labor economist at Harvard University, said the sample was "clearly biased toward people who are doing well and whose incomes are stable." He further called it a "misleading and biased sample."
Professor Katz added: "At the end of the period, the Treasury report shows, the income of the panel is 70 percent higher than the income of all tax filers. It's also higher at the beginning."
Another labor economist, Finis Welch, at Texas A & M University, said: "It's just incredible. They are taking a group of people who are moving up in age and summing two incomes when they marry."
Another problem, several experts said, is the yardstick used to measure individuals' progress. The households in the sample were not compared with one another as they moved through the decade, but with the entire population of taxpayers.
"What's striking is, by the end of the period very few people are in the bottom one-fifth," said Mr. Slemrod at the University of Michigan. "Usually I think of the bottom quintile as being the bottom 20 percent."
 
'Moves the Results'
 "Doing it this way moves the results pretty strongly," said Professor Murphy at the University of Chicago. "The way to do it, using this data, is to track everybody and compare them to others in their own age groups. Take 30-year-olds and see where they stand relative to each other when they are 40 years old."
 He and other economists said that the type of income mobility the Treasury found was not the social mobility that most Americans have in mind when they think about rich and poor.
"It's true that my income at 33 is higher than at 27 or 23, but that's not what people are worrying about," said Professor Katz at Harvard. "They are worried about how the 33-year-old looks compared to other 33-year-olds. If I'm less educated, I'll do worse throughout my lifetime than other people my age with more education, and the gap is getting bigger."
The clash of conflicting statistics is sure to continue through the election campaign. The Treasury's Office of Tax Analysis, for example, has been laboriously constructing large data bases that track the same taxpaying households through time to answer all sorts of questions about the effects of changes in tax rules.
Next on the income-distribution agenda, Mr. Hubbard said, is a look at how much of the gains from economic growth in the 1980's went to Americans in the top 1 percent at both the beginning and end of the decade.
"Talking about the top 1 percent as if these are the same people year-in and year-out is just false," he said.
Ms. Sawhill said: "We need to get beyond the politics of this. The issue is what's really happening to the American people."

HEADLINE: Traveling More on Business, Women Seek More of Hotels

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
When Connie Cone Walters checks into a hotel, she carries a doorstop and makes sure the room has a dead bolt. Like many other women, Ms. Walters, a Northwest Airlines flight attendant, will not stay in a room on the ground floor. And when her room-service order arrives, before opening the door she asks that the receipt be slid under it.
"It's not enough to open the door just because you see a man in a white coat outside the door," she said. 
 Almost 40 percent of all business travelers now are women, according to the nonprofit United States Travel Data Center. And while conditions have improved for unaccompanied female travelers in recent years, concerns about safety and security remain, as well as those about providing services that women want.
Melissa Widerkehr, a conference and meeting planner in Washington who began traveling on business in 1977, said "The change has been startling."In those days, she said, the business-class hotels she stayed in were so indifferent to female guests that they did not even have hangers to keep skirts from slipping to the floor.
Now most such hotels provide the hangers, but Ms. Widerkehr said she still refuses to check into a room unless escorted by a porter. "You never know who or what may be there," she said.
Northwest's female flight attendants are routinely accompanied to their rooms by male flight crew members, who check inside the closets, under the beds and behind the shower curtains.
While hotel officials say such "security sweeps" are increasingly common, Northwest flight crews are especially sensitive to safety issues because of the killing last year of Nancy Ludwig, a Northwest flight attendant and stepmother of six daughters. She was bound, gagged and raped before her throat was cut.
The killer was apparently lurking in a stairway and followed her into her room at the Airport Hilton in Romulus, Mich. Northwest and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters have offered an $80,000 reward for the killer.
 
Attack at a Texas Motel
 Many women have not forgotten an article in The Wall Street Journal last summer about the high crime rate at some inexpensive hotels and the concerns about whether the locks, lights, security guards and key-control systems at these establishments were effective.
The article focused on accusations of security lapses at the Motel 6 chain and on the $10 million settlement of a negligence suit last June brought by a professional photographer who was repeatedly raped by two ex-convicts at a Motel 6 in Fort Worth. The men had forced their way into the woman's room.
Since then, Motel 6 and other budget hotels have taken steps to bolster security, said Ray Ellis, the security specialist for the American Hotel and Motel Association.
"All our doors now have three locks, including a dead bolt and security chain," said Marc Michaelson, a Motel 6 spokesman. "We have window locks and bright lights in parking lots. We've increased security people, some from security companies and some off-duty police officers. We've given police carte blanche to come onto our property in pursuit of an investigation. Motel 6 cares about security."
But many female travelers think that more remains to be done, and not just at economy hotels.
"There should be more security personnel in the halls to ask to see your room key or to make sure you're registered there," said Ms. Walters of Northwest Airlines. "I'd also like to see more security at outside entrances, and not just after 10 o'clock at night."
Cynthia Kelly is the chief executive of NannyCare USA, a company in Oakland, Calif., that provides baby sitters for the growing number of parents, mostly women, who bring their children to meetings and conventions. "A woman traveling alone on business better be sure to look out for the same potential dangers she would look out for in any big city," she said. "Where security is concerned, you cannot ever drop your guard."
 
'Startling' Changes
 But in many respects, traveling is easier today for women.
Now most hotels like these offer electronic room keys individualized for each guest and improved lighting in hallways and parking areas. At Loews L'Enfant Plaza in Washington, for example -- a hotel across from the National Air and Space Museum -- unaccompanied female guests are escorted to the hotel's parking garage.
At 150 Radisson Hotels, where the proportion of female guests has soared to 44 percent today from less than 30 percent eight years ago, rooms and cocktail lounges were given a brighter decor to do away with the traditional dark "men's club" atmosphere and make them more inviting to women.
At the 800 Comfort Inns, where women traveling on business make up about 28 percent of all guests, furnishings, color schemes, full-length mirrors and bedspreads are chosen primarily to appeal to women.
Amenities intended to appeal to women at Homewood Suites, a chain of 22 hotels based in Memphis, include hair dryers, increased vanity space and large, well-lighted mirrors.
At the Loews Annapolis Hotel in Maryland, a telephone at the front desk is connected to a personal shopper at a nearby Macy's department store. The shopper takes a guest's order and gathers the purchases, and a hotel van picks them up. While men do avail themselves of the amenity, "It's a feature that's absolutely provided with women in mind," said Debra Kelman, a Loews spokeswoman.
In varying degrees, airports, restaurants and even airplanes are also trying to help women who travel.
Airplanes usually offer few extra amenities beyond those that come with a first-class or business-class ticket. But lavatories on all 75 Northwest Airlines wide-body jets will be revamped beginning this summer to include bassinets, which will make it easier for parents to change their babies' diapers.
A growing number of airports, including those in Pittsburgh, Boston and Denver, have areas where children can play and parents can change infants during delays or layovers. Fathers also use the kidports, as they are known, but airport managers say mothers far outnumber fathers there.
Airport gift shops and cocktail lounges have also changed in response to female travelers.
"Our gift shops sell many more personal items, including nylons and blouses," said Thomas Canjemi, the president of Dobbs Houses, a Memphis company that operates more than 450 airport shops and restaurants around the country. "And we've redesigned and changed most of our cocktail lounges, which used to be pretty cheerless places where people would just belly up to the bar."
Those lounges now feature an array of food and snacks, including lighter fare, and their beverage lists include wine by the glass as well as sparkling water and juices.

HEADLINE: 17-Year-Old Is Charged In Hotel Fires In Manhattan

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
A homeless teen-ager from Philadelphia was arrested yesterday and charged with setting five of a series of fires at hotels in midtown Manhattan over the last 10 days.
Last week, the teen-ager, Raymond Charles Dunford, 17 years old, pleaded guilty in connection with another fire set at a midtown hotel, the authorities said. But as the pattern of fires emerged, investigators had trouble finding him for questioning because the records in the juvenile case were sealed, they said. 
 The string of a dozen small fires, in unoccupied rooms and storage closets, had worried guests, unnerved hotel managers and raised concerns about the Democratic National Convention, to be held in July. Mr. Dunford has not been linked to the rest of the fires, though the police would not rule out the possibility that he might be charged in connection with those later.
 
No Motive Established
 Mr. Dunford was taken into custody Monday night at the scene of the latest fire, at the Marriott East Side, at 49th Street and Lexington Avenue, after a homeless man pointed him out to officials arriving at the scene. At a news conference at City Hall last night, Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown said that Mr. Dunford was homeless and unemployed, and that he had been living on the streets of New York for about six months, at one point staying in Pennsylvania Station.
Fire and police officials said they had no motive for the fires. But the city's Chief Fire Marshal, John J. Stickevers, said of Mr. Dunford, "He fits the profile of a pyromaniac." Chief Stickevers did not elaborate.
Mr. Brown said he could not confirm reports that Mr. Dunford had an older accomplice who was angry at being thrown out of several hotels. Deputy Fire Commissioner Tom Kelly said that another man was questioned and released yesterday, but that he did not know who the man was.
As of Monday evening, police and fire officials had listed 11 fires set at midtown hotels since June 6. But with Mr. Dunford's arrest, the officials added a 12th incident -- the fire last week, on June 9 in a men's room at the Ramada Hotel, at Seventh Avenue and 33d Street.
Mr. Dunford was charged with arson in connection with that fire the next day, after he returned to the hotel and was spotted in the same area by security guards. He was held overnight and released on Thursday after pleading guilty to a lesser charge.
As they searched for suspects in the other fires, investigators had trouble learning more about Mr. Dunford and his arrest because even the police do not have access to juvenile records unless they get a court order to unseal them, the police said.
At the scene of the Marriott East Sidefire on Monday, a homeless man pointed out Mr. Dunford to a plainclothes police officer, telling him that the suspect had made remarks indicating that he may have been involved, said Joseph R. Borrelli, the Police Department's chief of detectives.
"The homeless guy had the impression that he may have known about the fire before the fire trucks got there," Chief Borrelli said. When Mr. Dunford tried to leave the scene, the chief said, he was arrested.
Besides the fire for which he was initially arrested, Mr. Dunford has been charged in five fires. They include another fire at the Ramada, on June 6; one at the Edison Hotel, on West 47th Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue, on Saturday; one at the Parker Meridien, on West 56th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, on Sunday; one at the Sheraton Manhattan, at Seventh Avenue and 51st Street, also on Sunday, and the one Monday night at the Marriott East Side. The police would not say whether Mr. Dunford admitted setting the fires, nor would they disclose anything else he may have told investigators.
Chief Borrelli said the police were talking to other people, whom he would not identify, in connection with both the remaining fires and possible links to Mr. Dunford. Two of those fires occurred last Wednesday night, the night Mr. Dunford was in custody. No one else was in custody last night, officials said.
 
Access to Rooms
 Asked how the suspect may have gotten into the unoccupied rooms where most of the fires were set, the chief said, "We feel he may have some ability to pick locks and he may have gotten some kind of one of those access cards." Many hotels issue keys that look like credit cards.
Commissioner Brown said officials were not certain whether Mr. Dunford was the man who called 911 on Saturday after the fire at the Hotel Edison, claiming responsibility and saying he was going to start another one that night. The third fire at the Ramada started within two hours of the call.
On Monday Mayor Dinkins announced the formation of a task force to investigate the fires. In creating the task force, the Mayor sought to reassure tourists and the thousands of delegates coming to the Democratic National Convention next month.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Less Marijuana, More Alcohol?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
WHAT do teen-agers do when they are priced out of the market for marijuana? Some, presumably, take oboe lessons or join the 4-H Club. But others look for solace in less wholesome pursuits. And, surprisingly, economists may have more to say on the subject than toilers in the fields of psychology or criminology.
Drug policy is grounded on the premise that illicit drugs are birds of a feather -- that reducing the availability of one decreases the consumption of others. But economists who measure the demand for illicit substances the way, say, Exxon analyzes the demand for grades of gasoline, challenge this conventional wisdom. Their identification of a strong substitution effect between marijuana and alcohol suggests that the full court press against the weed is partly responsible for stubbornly high levels of binge drinking by teen-agers. 
 According to the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research, the proportion of high school seniors regularly using marijuana fell to 14 percent last year, barely one-third the rate reported in 1978. Their use of alcohol has been on the wane, too, slipping by a fourth since the late 1970's.
This might seem proof that alcohol and marijuana drugs are complements -- more like bread and jam than cake and pie. But simple correlation cannot account for the slew of factors that influence drug consumption over time and place.
That is where a yet-to-be-published study by John DiNardo of the University of California at Irvine and Thomas Lemieux of Princeton fits in. Their work, supported by the Rand Corporation and the National Institute of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse, focuses on the mid-1980's, when the threat of losing Federal highway aid forced states to adopt a uniform minimum drinking age. In 1980, half the states had minimum drinking ages ranging from 18 to 20. Eight years later, all states were up to age 21.
The two economists estimated demand curves for marijuana and alcohol, using a variety of data that might influence consumption -- everything from parents' education to unemployment rates -- to isolate the effect of drinking sanctions. The good news is that the higher "price" for alcohol -- that is, the greater difficulty of obtaining it -- reduced drinking. The bad news: Other factors being equal, raising the drinking age from 18 to 21 increased the proportion of high school seniors who smoked marijuana by an estimated 10 percent.
To Peter Reuter, an economist at Rand, this conclusion is most interesting for what it implies about marijuana policy in the 1980's. If marijuana is a substitute for alcohol, he notes, alcohol is, by definition, a substitute for marijuana. Thus tough marijuana enforcement must increase drinking. And, indeed, another new study for the National Bureau of Economic Research by Karen Model suggests Mr. Reuter is on the mark.
Ms. Model, a Ph.D. candidate at Harvard, examined the impact of marijuana decriminalization on hospital emergency room admissions for drug abuse reported to the Federal Drug Abuse Warning Network in the mid-1970's. And as the substitution hypothesis would suggest, Ms. Model found that emergency room episodes related to drugs other than marijuana were 12 percent lower in the states that had decriminalized the weed. Lowering the effective "price" of marijuana, she concluded, reduced the abuse of other substances.
The data did not allow Ms. Model to isolate alcohol emergencies from those caused by the use of heroin, cocaine or prescription chemicals. But Ms. Model believes alcohol is far and away the most likely drug replaced by marijuana. Both alcohol and marijuana were widely seen by users as "soft" recreational drugs, in contrast to, say, cocaine, heroin or LSD.
Marijuana and alcohol use are both down; why, then, worry? Because the level of teen-age alcohol abuse remains remarkably high.
In 1991, some 30 percent of high school seniors reported having had five or more drinks in a row sometime in the previous two weeks. The comparable figure for college students (almost all of whom had to break the law to obtain alcohol) is 43 percent -- and there is no downward trend.
To those who focus on the risk of accidental injury and other medical crises, heavy drinking seems a more serious worry than marijuana. Ms. Model found that other factors equal, states decriminalizing marijuana reported lower overall rates of drug- and alcohol-related emergencies.
And while both substances have been implicated in auto accidents, Frank Chaloupka, an economist at the Chicago campus of the University of Illinois, believes that substitution toward marijuana is, on balance, a life saver. In a statistical analysis that parallels Ms. Model's, he found that states without criminal sanctions against marijuana possession suffered fewer auto fatalities.
"If the choice is more marijuana use or more dead teen-agers," Mr. Reuter concludes, "the choice is easy."

HEADLINE: YUGOSLAVS OFFER POST TO AMERICAN

BYLINE: By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, June 16

 BODY:
The ruling Socialist Party formally proposed today that the post of Prime Minister of Yugoslavia be given to a Serbian-born naturalized American pharmaceuticals magnate.
At a time when Yugoslavia is reeling under United Nations economic sanctions intended to punish the Belgrade Government for its support of ethnic fighting in Bosnia, the party said that Milan Panic, a millionaire industrialist from California, offers the best hope of leading the country from its crisis. 
 "With Mr. Panic's selection as Prime Minister, our country would come out of this economic and social crisis much quicker," said Borislav Jovic, the chairman of the Socialist Party of Serbia, as quoted by the official Tanyug press agency.
 
Is the Candidate Willing?
 But it could not be learned if Mr. Panic was willing to take the job. The public affairs office at the Costa Mesa, Calif., headquarters of Mr. Panic's company, ICN Pharmaceuticals, said today that Mr. Panic was sticking by a statement he issued on Sunday listing a number of conditions for accepting the Yugoslav premiership.
In his statement, Mr. Panic (whose name is pronounced PAHN-itch) said that while "it would be a great honor for me to have the opportunity to help the people of my native country," he would consider taking the post only if he gets the backing of all political parties as well as of businessmen and intellectuals. Those conditions have not yet been met.
There appeared to be other potential obstacles to his candidacy. Should he accept the premiership, he would presumably lose his United States citizenship under American laws that prohibit citizens from taking posts in foreign governments. He might also face prosecution under a June 5 executive order by President Bush imposing sanctions against Serbia. The order prohibits Americans from assisting the authorities in Belgrade.
 
An Interest in Ending Sanctions
 One of ICN's most profitable holdings, the ICN-Galenika pharmaceutical company in Belgrade, would be helped by the lifting of the international sanctions.
At a shareholders' meeting last April, Mr. Panic said that ICN had increased first-quarter earnings by 30 percent, mainly on the strength of Galenika's performance. But two-thirds of the raw materials used by Galenika in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals have come from the United States.
Galenika's American vice chairman, John Scanlon, formerly United States Ambassador to Belgrade, is in Washington this week seeking rulings from the Treasury Department on Galenika's operations in light of the sanctions. Mr. Scanlon said he had pointed out that Galenika supplies a major portion of the needs for penicillin to Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Officials at Galenika said today that Mr. Panic was expected here on Thursday.
Mr. Panic has been a large contributor to the campaigns of many American politicians, including the Presidential effort this year of Edmund G. Brown Jr., the former Governor of California. Mr. Brown served four years on the board of directors of ICN Pharmaceuticals, and interceded on the company's behalf in a conflict with a Federal regulatory agency.
 
Domestic Opposition Grows
 In turning to the American millionaire, the Serbs who dominate the Belgrade Government appeared to be trying to deflect and mute mounting anti-Government protests by students, churchmen and proponents of peace and greater democracy. The demonstrations, all of which emphasize the Government's Communist past and totalitarian habits, have focused around demands for the resignation of Slobodan Milosevic, who dominates Yugoslav politics as the President of Serbia.
On Monday the Socialists went outside their party to choose Dobrica Cosic, a widely respected and popular writer, as President of the Yugoslav federation, now composed only of Serbia and Montenegro. Mr. Cosic is a passionate Serbian nationalist, and in this area his views may be expected to parallel those of Mr. Milosevic. But Mr. Cosic was expelled from the Communist Party in 1968, while Mr. Milosevic was the party chief in Serbia until 1989, and it was unclear whether the new federal President will try to undermine the old guard in control of Serbia.
Whatever Mr. Cosic's intentions, he would seem to have far less political power than Mr. Milosevic. But several Western diplomats said today that the moral authority he brought to the post gave him greater prerogatives than did the Constitution. Were he to urge new elections, Mr. Milosevic would almost have to comply, they said.
The nomination of Mr. Panic was also replete with Balkan complexities, beyond the the obvious clash of having men who until very recently upheld Communism choosing someone who is probably the world's richest and most capitalistic Serb.
The selection is certain to strain relations between Serbia and its only remaining ally, Montenegro. The leaders of Montenegro had been promised that the Presidency would go to one of their people. When that pledge was broken with the selection of Mr. Cosic, the Montenegrins then felt that they would at least get to fill the post of Prime Minister, particularly since the new Constitution recommends that the two positions not be held by people from the same republic. Mr. Panic was born in Serbia.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN WASHINGTON;
Excerpts From Bush-Yeltsin Conference: Working Toward a Safer World

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from statements and a brief news conference by President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, who spoke through an interpreter:
 
BUSH STATEMENT
 Mr. President, let me just say that I'm pleased to announce that President Yeltsin and I have just reached an extraordinary agreement on two areas of vital importance to our countries and to the world. First, we have agreed on far-reaching new strategic arms reductions. Building on the agreement reached with Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus, our two countries are now agreeing to even further dramatic strategic arms reductions substantially below the levels determined by Start. 
 We have agreed to eliminate the world's most dangerous weapons, heavy ICBM's, and all other multiple warhead ICBM's, and dramatically reduce our total strategic nuclear weapons.
Those dramatic reductions will take place in two phases. They will be completed no later than the year 2003 and may be completed as early as the year 2000, if the United States can assist Russia in the required destruction of ballistic missile systems.
With this agreement the nuclear nightmare recedes more and more for ourselves, for our children and for our grandchildren.
Just a few years ago, the United States was planning a strategic nuclear stockpile of about 13,000 warheads. Now President Yeltsin and I have agreed that both sides will go down to 3,000 to 3,500 warheads with each nation determining its own force structure within that range.
 
 
'The New Relationship'
 And I'd like to point out that this fundamental agreement which in earlier years could not have been completed even in a decade has been completed in only five months. Our ability to reach this agreement so quickly is a tribute to the new relationship between the United States and Russia and to the personal leadership of our guest, Boris Yeltsin.
In the near future, the United States and Russia will record our agreement in a brief treaty document that President Yeltsin and I will sign and submit for ratification in our country. President Yeltsin and I have also agreed to work together, along with the allies and other interested states, to develop a concept for a global protection system against limited ballistic missile attack.
And we will explore a senior group -- or we will establish a senior group to explore practical steps toward that end, including the sharing of early warning and cooperation in developing ballistic missile defense capabilities and technologies.
This group will also explore the development of a legal basis for cooperation, including new treaties and agreements, and possible changes to existing treaties and agreements necessary to implement the global protection system.
That group is headed by Dennis Ross for the United States, and will first meet in Moscow within the next 30 days.
In conclusion, these are remarkable steps for our two countries, a departure from the tensions and the suspicions of the past, and a tangible important expression of our new relationship. They also hold major promise for a future world protected against the danger of limited ballistic missile attack.
 
YELTSIN STATEMENT
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to add a few words to what President Bush has just announced here.
What we have achieved is an unparalleled and probably an unexpected thing for you, and for the whole world. You are the first to hear about this historic decision which has been reached today after just five months of negotiations. We are in fact meeting a sharp dramatic reduction in the total number for the two sides of the number of the amount of nuclear warheads. . . .
Indeed, we have been able to cut over those five months of negotiations the total number of nuclear warheads to one-third, while it took 15 years under the Start treaty to make some reductions.
This is an expression of the fundamental change in the political and economic relations between the United States of America and Russia.
It is also an expression and a proof of the personal trust and confidence that has been established between the Presidents of these countries, President Bush of the United States of America and President of Russia, and these things have been achieved without deception, without anybody wishing to gain unilateral advantages.
 
'Balance of Security'
 This is a result of the trust entertained by the President of the democratic Russia toward America and by the President of the United States toward the new Russia.
This is the result of a carefully measured balance of security. We were not going in for numbers, for just one, two, three thousands of pieces. Rather we have established a record for each country to elect the number, the figure that it will consider appropriate for its own defense and security.
The total number will go down from 21,000 to 6,000 for two sides. Under the first phase, the reductions for the two sides will be down to 3,800 to 4,250, including ICBM's, 1,250, and heavy missiles, 650; SLBM's, 2,250. Under the second phase we shall go down to, respectively, 3,000 and 3,500, including total reduction and destruction of heavy missiles. Land-based MIRV's will be reduced as well. SLBM's will go down to 1,750. Each country will elect the figure that it will consider appropriate to ensure its defense and security.
Thus we are departing from the ominous parity where each country was exerting every effort to stay in line, which has led Russia, for instance, having half of its population living below the poverty line. We cannot afford it, and therefore we must have minimum security level to deal with any possible eventuality which might arise anywhere in the world and threaten our security.
But we know one thing: we shall not fight against each other. This is a solemn undertaking that we are taking today, and it will be reflected as a matter of partnership and friendship in the charter that we are going to sign.
Our proposal is to cut the process of destruction from the proposed 13 years down to 9 years. So the things that I have been mentioning before will be materialized by the year 2000. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	I want to add that these figures have been agreed with and ratified by the secretary for defense, Mr. Cheney, and the Defense Minister, Pavel Grachev, of the Russian Federation.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Why Nuclear Warheads?
 Q: Would you explain for people who might not understand why friends who trust each other and who do not plan to attack would still need 7,000 nuclear warheads?
PRESIDENT BUSH: What I'm saying is, we've moved dramatically down from 13,000. It's going to be a -- this will be seen as an enormous move forward toward the relaxation of tension and toward the friendship that we feel for each other. The elimination of these, the most destabilizing of weapons, is extraordinarily positive. And the fact that each country at this juncture in history retains some nuclear weapons speaks for itself.
Who knows what lies out there ahead? But certainly I agree with what President Yeltsin said, that there is no animosity. The cold war days are over and he came here in a spirit of forward movement on these arms control agreements and that speaks for itself.
PRESIDENT YELTSIN: I would like to amplify on that. I would say that in response to your question that the technical and financial resources that are required in order to destroy, dismantle and reduce the total number of warheads and missiles from 21,000 to six or seven thousand is enormous and this is the only thing that conditions this figure.
 
The Missing G.I.'s
 PRESIDENT BUSH: With your permission, Mr. President, I would like to take the last question, which relates to the P.O.W.-M.I.A. discussions that we have had. President Yeltsin and I discussed this morning the issue that is of the highest priority for our Administration, and I know for every American, the fate of American P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s from World War II, Korea, the cold-war period and Vietnam.
President Yeltsin informed me for the first time that Russia may have information about the fate of some of our servicemen from Vietnam. And he said the Russian Government is pursuing this information vigorously, just as we speak. And with us today are President Yeltsin's adviser, Dmitri Volkogonov over here and our able former Ambassador to the U.S.S.R., Ambassador Malcolm Toon. . . .
President Yeltsin and I have instructed both of these gentlemen to begin immediately a joint U.S.-Russian pursuit of the latest information; it was given to me today. I have asked Ambassador Toon to return immediately to Moscow to work on this issue, and I want to assure all Americans, and particularly those families of the American P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s that we will spare no effort in working with our Russian colleagues to investigate all information in the Russia archives concerning our servicemen.
And while we do not have any specific information to make public today, I pledge to keep the American people informed of developments on this issue as we find out more about these latest leads.
And let me just point out that the forthcoming comments by President Yeltsin is just one more sign of this improved new relationship between Russia and the United States of America. For him to go back and dig into these records, without fear of embarrassment, is of enormous consequence to the people of the United States of America. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q: Do you agree it's possible that some of those Americans may still be alive?
PRESIDENT BUSH: I would simply say that this -- I have no evidence of that, but the cooperation that is, has been extended, and again is being extended by the President of Russia will guarantee to the American people that if anyone's alive, that person, those people would be found. And equally as important to the loved ones is the accounting for any possible M.I.A.
And so we have no evidence of anyone being alive, but I would simply say again that this, this is the best way to get to the bottom of it, and this new approach by the President of Russia to go into these archives and to try to find missing records will be the best assurance that I can give the American people that the truth will, will be revealed, finally.

HEADLINE: Teodoro Moscoso, a Former Envoy And Economic Aide, Is Dead at 81

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
Teodoro Moscoso, a former United States Ambassador to Venezuela and a leader of the Alliance for Progress in the 1960's, died Monday at his apartment in San Juan, P.R. He was 81 years old.
He died of cancer of the liver, said Scott F. Runkle, a Washington-based consultant to the Government of Puerto Rico, who was a longtime friend. Mr. Moscoso played a key role in the economic development of the island. 
 He was named Ambassador to Venezuela by President John F. Kennedy in 1961.
In 1962 Mr. Kennedy named him United States Coordinator of the Alliance for Progress, a vast economic development program for Latin America, which he held until 1964.
 
A Historic Role
 "Moscoso was unexcelled in communicating the political and social idealism of the Alliance -- to the Latin Americans, who had great faith in him, to Congress, where he was well respected, and to his own staff," the Kennedy aide and historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. wrote in his 1965 book "A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House"
But Mr. Schlesinger observed that although Mr. Moscoso committed a "billion dollars each year in program and project loans," the program was impeded by "the stipulations and rigidities" in United States aid legislation, "and the Latins themselves were often slow to produce good projects and effective development programs."
In the 1940's Mr. Moscoso began playing a historic role, which went on for years, in the development of Puerto Rico. Alfredo Salazar, the administrator of the Puerto Rico Economic Development Administration, said, in a statement issued in San Juan yesterday: "Moscoso's vision and dedication have been the guiding force behind our transformation. Thanks to him in just two generations Puerto Rico has become a world-class site for manufacturing and the Caribbean's hub for finance, transportation and industry."
Average per capita income in Puerto Rico was $120 per year in 1940 and is today more than $6,500 -- the highest in Latin America. There are about 2,000 industrial plants on the island.
 
Headed Operation Bootstrap
 Mr. Moscoso helped to set up the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company in 1942. From then until 1950 he was president and general manager of the company, which strove to get investors from the mainland and from foreign countries to set up manufacturing plants there.
From 1950 to 1960 he was the first administrator of the Economic Development Administration, known in Spanish as Fomento. For years he oversaw Operation Bootstrap, an economic plan that reflected his conviction that tax incentives would reinforce efforts to bring outside private investment to the island. He encouraged, among other projects, the building of the Caribe Hilton Hotel and similar enterprises that proved to be cornerstones of the island's tourism industry.
After his service in the Kennedy Administration, he returned to Puerto Rico.
Mr. Moscoso was born in Barcelona, the son of Teodoro Moscoso and the former Alejandrina Mora. The family moved from Spain to Puerto Rico when he was a child. He studied at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science in 1928 and earned a B.S. degree from the University of Michigan in 1932. He worked in business in Puerto Rico before entering government there.
His survivors include his wife, the former Gloria Sanchez Vilella, to whom he was married in 1937; a daughter, Margarita Moscoso of San Juan; a son, Jose Teodoro Moscoso, of Manhattan; and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Senate Unit Kills Luxury Tax on Items

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16

 BODY:
The Senate Finance Committee voted today to kill the luxury tax on expensive yachts, planes, furs and jewels, and to extend a dozen special tax breaks 18 months.
Renewal of the tax reductions would be financed by selected tax increases on corporations. The tax breaks are popular, and passage of the extensions is generally expected. Those allowed to take advantage of the breaks include the self-employed, workers who receive education assistance from their employers and investors in low-income housing. 
 The panel agreed to retain the luxury tax on high-priced cars, and said owners of diesel-powered recreational boats should bear most of the bill for ending the other taxes. Although exempt now, they would have to pay the 20.1-cent-a-gallon diesel-fuel tax.
 
'A Total Disaster'
 "This luxury tax has been a total disaster in every respect," Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, said in urging repeal.
The tax has been under attack since it was enacted in 1990 to get more money from upper-income Americans without raising income-tax rates. Opponents say the soak-the-rich idea backfired by cutting demand for luxury items.
The luxury tax had been predicted to raise $25 million in 1991 -- it actually brought in $98.4 million -- and $1.5 billion over five years. Nearly 90 percent of the money has come from sales of cars costing over $30,000.
Under the committee's bill, the tax on cars would remain, but the $30,000 threshold would be raised each year to adjust for inflation.
The remainder of the 10 percent tax would be eliminated retroactively to Jan. 1. It applies to the portion of the sales price above $250,000 for private planes, $100,000 for yachts and $10,000 for jewels and furs.
Repeal of most of the tax and extension of the tax cuts were included in a bill that Congress passed in March that would have raised income taxes for the richest 1 percent of taxpayers. It was vetoed by President Bush.
But the new bill has nothing very controversial, and it generally has the support of the Bush Administration. During Senate debate, it may be made even more to the President's liking; an effort probably will be made to attach to it some of the provisions Mr. Bush proposed in the wake of the riots in Los Angeles.
The bill extends through Dec. 31, 1993, a dozen provisions that otherwise would expire June 30. Renewal is expected to cost $6 billion.
Among the provisions are those allowing workers up to $5,250 of employer-provided education aid a year with no tax liability; permitting the self-employed to deduct 25 percent of their health-insurance costs; giving businesses a credit for more research spending, and giving investors incentives for building or rehabilitating rental homes for low-income people.
The provisions would be financed by:
* Allowing businesses this year to make 75 percent settlements of old disputes with the Internal Revenue Service over the value of deductions claimed for good will, customer lists and other intangible assets acquired in taking over another company.
* Making permanent a requirement that large corporations pay in advance at least 95 percent of current-year taxes or 100 percent of last year's liability.
* Requiring that a person who claims a mortgage-interest deduction from any seller-provided financing include on his or her tax return the Social Security number of the seller.

HEADLINE: 2 Israelis Debate; Focus Is on Security

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEVE ILAN, Israel, June 16

 BODY:
Israel's two main rivals for Prime Minister pummeled each other's policies today in an election debate that dwelt heavily on who would better protect Israel's interests and national security in peace talks with Palestinians and neighboring Arab countries.
In one of the harsher exchanges, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the Likud Party challenged the opposition's loyalty, accusing the Labor Party of engaging in "conspiracies with the Arabs" in 1990 to pull apart a Likud-Labor coalition that had existed for six years. 
 In turn, the Labor leader, Yitzhak Rabin, attacked Likud for "mistaken national priorities" that he said have produced a weakened economy, a crisis in relations with the United States and a deadlock in talks with the Arabs.
But for all the verbal pyrotechnics, both men avoided personal attacks and essentially stuck to familiar scripts, apparently in tacit recognition that after Israel's election next Tuesday they may once again have to live with each other in coalition.
Opinion polls continue to show Labor ahead. But barring an electoral miracle, Labor is certain to fall well short of a parliamentary majority. And there are serious doubts about whether it will be able to find enough like-minded coalition partners among Israel's many small parties to form a new government without Likud's help. If the polls are to be believed, Likud is stuck in a similar situation.
 
'Unity Government' Predicted
 As a result, many commentators are convinced that once the post-election dust settles, the two big camps will find themselves where they were from 1984 to 1990, in an unwelcome marriage of convenience that goes under the inapt rubric of "national unity government."
Neither Mr. Shamir nor Mr. Rabin ruled out such a coalition when the subject arose in the debate, which was videotaped at a television studio here 10 miles west of Jerusalem and broadcast nationwide tonight. But the Prime Minister was especially unenthusiastic about the idea, accusing Labor of breaking agreements to tear apart the last such Government and saying that for now he considers its revival "simply not realistic."
In attacking Labor for working "behind our backs" the last time, Mr. Shamir said it had resorted to "conspiracies with the Arabs," a charge that he refused to elaborate on except to say at a brief post-debate news conference that Labor had "not been loyal to the Government." Whatever he meant, the mere reference to Arabs and plots was equivalent to raising specters of the bogeyman for security-conscious Israelis -- and to raising doubts about Labor's ability to protect them.
It was impossible to say how many voters were swayed by the campaign's sole face-to-face debate, but each side was quick to claim victory. The encounter lasted half an hour, minus several seconds that were lost when a thunderstorm caused the power to fail during Mr. Rabin's closing remarks. An ensuing discussion over what to do about the missing seconds -- ultimately they were ignored -- took longer than the debate itself.
From their statements, it was clear that both men were pursuing the same segment of the electorate: center-right Israelis who normally fall to Likud but who are thinking of shifting leftward to Labor this time because it is now led by Mr. Rabin, a security-minded, tough-talking former Prime Minister, Defense Minister and general.
 
A Straightforward Position
 In a sense, Mr. Shamir's task was simpler, for his position is a straightforward one of no territorial compromise for peace, not now, now ever.
"I think that in this small country there is no possibility of reaching peace with territorial concessions," he said. "There is nothing to concede. If we're talking about a Palestinian state, what, will there be two states here? In this tiny country? It's not possible."
Mr. Rabin, who is ready to give up land for a peace treaty, seemed to go out of his way to emphasize the more hawkish features of his position, recalling, for instance, his "iron fist" policy toward Palestinians after they began their uprising in December 1987.
Challenged by Mr. Shamir on whether his willingness to compromise meant that he was also ready to accept a Palestinian state, the opposition leader sternly said no. But he added that he also wanted some form of self-rule for Palestinians to keep them from ever becoming citizens of Israel.
"I have three principles: No to 2 million Palestinian citizens, no to a Palestinian state, no to a withdrawal to '67," he said, meaning Israel's borders before the 1967 Middle East War.

HEADLINE: Port Authority Plans Review Of Spending

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
Admitting that it had not maintained sufficient control over its billion-dollar annual construction budget, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is proposing to bring in outside experts to review its capital spending plans and to open most of its highest-level meetings to the public.
Authority executives described the proposals yesterday as part of a significantchange in an agency that has long operated in a shroud of confidentiality, earning a reputation as one of the country's richest and most politically unassailable municipal master builders. The changes are intended to prevent the kind of unproductive spending that was involved in an aborted plan to rebuild Kennedy International Airport. 
 "This is an admission that we're evolving in the direction of other public agencies," said Richard C. Leone, chairman of the authority's board, in an interview yesterday.
 
Outside Monitors
 The proposed changes were submitted on Monday to Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, who have final control over the authority. The changes include bringing in outside engineers and auditors to review projects, opening up planning sessions to the public, creating a new committee to review the risks involved in long-term projects and expanding the oversight of the Governors of New York and New Jersey.
"I believe that we have not," Mr. Leone said, "because of the record of successes as much as anything, tended to produce all the apparatus that goes with checking and double-checking and forcing things to be debated that exists in other agencies, where there is more political or financial pressure."
Since World War II, the Port Authority has been known as much for the way its unelected commissioners could alter the skyline of the city with bridges, tunnels, airports and docks as it has been for its gold-plated way of doing business, its art collection and private fleet of aircraft.
Peter Goldmark, president of the Rockefeller Foundation and the executive director of the authority in the early 1980's, questioned the significance of the proposals for change. He said the authority has long used outside engineers and accountants to review plans and analyze failures. He warned against making the Port Authority too sensitive to the political winds.
 
Defining the Authority's Role
 "Do the elected leaders want the Port Authority to be a development agency which is entrepreneurial and invests money and takes risks?" he asked. "Or do they want it to be a run-of-the- mill, bean-counting, normal, slightly souped-up department of motor vehicles handing out three million license plates a year?"
The proposed changes were signed by Mr. Leone; Vincent Tese, the vice chairman of the authority and Mr. Cuomo's commissioner of economic development, and Stanley Brezenoff, the authority's executive director. The board will not adopt the changes until both governors have had a chance to comment on them.
Governor Florio issued a statement endorsing the proposals, saying that opening the agency to public scrutiny was "long overdue." Mr. Cuomo was in Washington yesterday and did not comment on the proposals.
The changes would create outside engineering panels "to challenge basic assumptions underlying capital projects" and expand the annual financial audit to include a review of capital spending. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the subways and commuter lines, has submitted its construction plans to outside engineers since 1987, when the New York State Legislature insisted that it do so.
Though the governors of New Jersey and New York hold veto power over the authority's activities, neither state's Legislature exercises oversight.
Under the proposed changes, the Port Authority's office of inspector general, which is responsible for ferreting out waste, fraud or abuse by employees and contractors, would be taken out of the audit department and made independent, reporting directly to the board and executive director.
All board committee meetings would be opened to the public, along with the policy review meetings of the board, which have been closed. Meetings dealing with labor negotiations, legal matters and the like would remain private. A new risk committee, made up of board members, would be established to review project financing, particularly when outsiders would pay part of the costs.
The agency was criticized for proceeding with the airport plan without first getting a crucial agreement from the airlines to share the expense.
The proposals would also expand the governors' oversight functions by giving them a more detailed look at the authority's plans. The state reviews now "usually focus on broad policy matters rather than on implementation issues," the proposal said.
Increasing statehouse oversight would make it harder, said one Port Authority official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, for a governor to adopt the tone of surprise and outrage that Mr. Cuomo expressed when accounts of the waste at Kennedy surfaced this spring.
Mr. Cuomo's reaction peeved some current and former board members, who pointed out that the statehouses each receive $200,000 from the authority annually to staff an office responsible for reviewing the authority's plans.

HEADLINE: A New Uncertainty About Life After High School;
Students at Horace Greeley Wonder if the Best Years of Their Lives Are Ahead or Behind

SERIES: Into Uncertainty: The Class of '92 -- Second of three articles.

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHAPPAQUA, N.Y.

 BODY:
Jennifer Hitchcock, a star athlete at Horace Greeley High School here who drives a sporty red Jeep, worries that these are the best days of her life.
"You always dream of making more money than your parents, but I don't think that will happen," said Miss Hitchcock, whose Jeep was a sweet-16 gift from her father, a vice president of Revlon cosmetics, and her mother, a real-estate agent. "I feel like I'm living the best time of my life so I'm trying to take advantage of the money now." 
 The final days before graduation have brought a senior slump, skipped classes and lavish parties at the high school in this wealthy Westchester County hamlet. They have also brought a degree of insistent and growing discomfort among the 215 seniors that they may not get to replicate their parents' wealth.
 
Measures of Success
 Like other members of the class of 1992 throughout the New York region, the seniors at Horace Greeley seem poised between confidence and uncertainty, between childhood and adulthood, as they prepare to leave their high-school days behind. But for them, the measures of success and failure are different than the ones used by their counterparts in inner-city and working-class neighborhoods around the region. Chappaqua's children grew up in a world of sure things. Now, they feel that world is in peril.
No one is suggesting that hard times have fallen on Chappaqua, a community of 15,000 residents where the average price of a home is about a half-million dollars and the schools are a major selling point for real-estate agents. The high school sends 96 percent of its graduates to college and more than half of Horace Greeley's 850 students take one or more college-level courses.
At least 75 percent are involved in the school's broad array of extracurricular activities. Such devotion, many students say, is driven in part to avoid appearing "uni-dimensional" on college applications.
A closer look reveals some cracks in the school's image of privilege and detachment. At a recent seminar on life after high school, the best-attended session was a workshop on stress reduction, where seniors meditated flat on their backs in a darkened classroom. Students talk of family turmoil over decisions to attend state schools instead of the Ivy League colleges. Requests for financial aid from a $500,000 fund at Horace Greeley, set up in the 1950's by community leaders to help graduates attend the college of their choice, have tripled in the last three years.
"Many of the students mirror their parents; they are very, very busy," said David Warde, the senior guidance counselor. He added: "I don't think they'll ever be able to match their parents' wealth, and I think, way down inside, that's what they realize. As a result, the kids work harder."
Even in the midst of a recession, the outlook remains one of measured optimism for many seniors who will graduate on June 21.
"Security is not really a problem because I feel like I'll always have my parents to back me up," said Miss Hitchcock, who will attend Auburn University. "I'm worried about happiness. Money is a big thing."
While students use grown-up phrases like "politically correct," as well as teen-age slang like "awesome," the social turmoil of the day seems remote from the realities of their lives.
The Los Angeles riots "would never happen here" said 18-year-old Amanda Garda, as schoolmates nodded in agreement. "What would be the reason? In Chappaqua, nothing bad happens. Everybody here's like a normal person. War and money aren't really a concern to us because our parents can take care of it."
In the high school's cafeteria, a brightly lighted room littered with backpacks, seniors are preoccupied with summer plans and the fortunes of the girls' lacrosse team, which is winning this year after a long losing streak. Many seniors are also keeping a close tally on the number of classes they cut to avoid the danger of failing a course.
Ross Leitner, the student council president, did cut class too often but said he was able to talk his way out of trouble. Like many members of the class of 1992, he exudes confidence about his intellectual preparedness for the world.
"I know I will get a job because Greeley has prepared me," he said. "All I worry about is which job."
He does concede that he still has a lot to learn about life. He has never ridden on a subway in New York City and will not ride the Metro-North trains because his parents consider public transportation too dangerous.
Safety concerns also played a role in deciding where he would go to college. His father, president of the Chock Full o'Nuts coffee company, and his mother, a college speech professor, ruled out Yale University and Columbia University, two schools whose campuses are surrounded by gritty urban neighborhoods; instead he will go to Brown University, situated atop a hill in one of the wealthiest neighborhoods of Providence, R.I.
"I'm worried about society in general, but not for myself," he said. "I know I will be happy and able to live."
 
The Good Life
 The good life was the subject of "Spring Finale," a student play presented last month. The satire, based loosely on the television show, "Beverly Hills 90210," poked fun at society's rich kids. The skits for "Chappaqua 10514," included student actors picketing for Evian water in school water fountains and movie-star handsome teen-agers crooning about "looking cool" and driving Saabs.
Glancing at his classmates in the lunchroom, Ben Wells, one of the play's directors, said that the acting did not require much of a stretch.
"When you're driving B.M.W.'s and you have everything you need and everybody is having a good time, why wouldn't you want it to continue," said Mr. Wells, 18, who, unlike many of his classmates, says he is uneasy with the cushioned life of Chappaqua.
For most Horace Greeley students, the recession means abandoning plans to vacation in the Bahamas, said Mr. Wells, who adds that his family is far from going broke. When his father decided to leave his job as vice president of a national retail outlet recently, he opted to attend graduate school at Harvard University rather than plunge into a weak job market. The teen-ager said a trust fund will cover his expenses at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Me.
 
'A Sense of Entitlement'
 In the view of Larry Breen, the school's assistant principal for seniors, "There's a sense of entitlement that I find scary."
Mr. Breen, who has worked at Horace Greeley for 28 years, said many students did not recognize that they were born with special advantages.
"They assume that anybody's hardship is the individual's responsibility, that somehow, the people have done something to cause it," he said. "They don't recognize the forces outside of people's control that put people in difficult situations."
Desiree Braithwaite, a vice president of the student council and one of 11 black students at Horace Greeley, is regarded as the embodiment of school spirit. But classmates' reaction to the Rodney G. King verdict and the riots that followed left her dispirited.
Miss Braithwaite said she had voiced surprise at the verdict and was dismayed that some students groped for reasons to defend it, including the assertion that Mr. King was using drugs.
"It was irritating because, like any other big issue that comes to this school, I thought people were forming opinions without any facts at all," she said.
She has tried to do her part to make people aware of one big issue, cultural diversity, by organizing a series of assemblies on the subject. Horace Greeely has a student body that is 1 percent black, 1 percent Hispanic and 12 percent Asian.
"I didn't expect people to embrace it completely," said Miss Braithwaite, struggling to defend her classmates' apparent lack of enthusiasm for her effort. "There's an ignorance rather than an apathetic approach. If you don't know something, how can you care about it if you don't know it exists?"
Miss Braithwaite, whose father is a bank vice president and whose mother is a hospital dietitian, will attend the University of Wisconsin this fall.
Another senior, Leslie Yahia, described Horace Greeley as "a school of subtleties," where some of the most important subjects come up only in the most private conversations. Miss Yahia said the subtleties were often reflected in students' perceptions of people who were not like themselves.
She said she was upset recently when schoolmates launched into thick Spanish accents as they mimicked what they considered a fictional maid. Miss Yahia, whose Argentine mother speaks English with a Spanish accent, said she was so troubled by the stereotypical assumptions that she only got two hours of sleep that night.
Miss Yahia said she feels her life has been spent in "a bubble" at Horace Greeley, and the bubble burst this year because her parents are in a financial pinch. Her father, a psychiatrist, is working three jobs to put three daughters through college. Her family will likely stop driving a third car to save money on insurance.
She said three of her friends have told her that their parents were selling their homes because of hard times, but she added that such details were not widely shared.
"The things that are not talked about are things that disturb the image," she said.

HEADLINE: Housing And Output Post Gains

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16

 BODY:
Allaying fears that the slow economic recovery might be starting to falter, the Government reported today that home building and industrial production made sizable advances in May.
Builders broke ground on new homes at an annual pace of 1.23 million, an 11 percent gain that substantially offset a 17.3 percent April plunge. Production from the nation's factories, mines and utilities climbed six-tenths of 1 percent, the biggest of four straight monthly gains. 
 Despite this fresh evidence that the recovery continues to plod ahead, which is good news for the Bush Administration, the bond market drove interest rates lower. Usually, signs of improvement in the economy push interest rates up, but bond traders yesterday were apparently more influenced by optimistic comments on inflation from the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan.
 
Statement From the Chairman
 "The U.S. economy has made considerable progress toward price stability over the past decade, trimming the core rate of inflation to below 4 percent, and it appears poised to make further advances," Mr. Greenspan told a House subcommittee at the beginning of testimony on a proposal to index Treasury bonds for inflation. At the end, he declared: "The Federal Reserve retains responsibility for long-run price stability and fully intends to guard against reigniting inflation."
Later in the day, bond prices were lifted further when subscribers to the Johnson Redbook Service learned that retail sales edged up just one-tenth of 1 percent during the second week of June. This seemingly poor result, however, can be explained by Fathers Day's being a week later than it was last year, said Edward Johnson of the Redbook service, which is a division of Lynch, Jones & Ryan, a New York brokerage firm.
The housing and output figures, while somewhat better than most analysts expected, were widely regarded as only confirming a recovery and not pointing to any significant economic acceleration.
 
Weak Upturn Is Expected
 "There is a very definite recovery in place," said Elliott Platt of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. But while there is "not much danger of it faltering," the recovery, he added, would be limited. Prospects in housing, for example, are dimmed by poor demographics, high vacancy rates for rental units and the fact that permits for future home construction fell for the third straight month in May.
Analysts also noted that much of the strength in industrial production was in the automotive sector where sales have been rising but will need to rise further to keep pace with assemblies.
"The surge in output of consumer durables raises the issue of whether or not these goods will be able to be sold," commented Gordon Richards, economist for the National Association of Manufacturers.
The Administration, not surprisingly, was thoroughly upbeat in a statement issued by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. "Today's impressive increases in housing starts and industrial production are more evidence that the economy continues its steady expansion," Mr. Brady said.
Rising output, Mr. Brady added, should lead to new hiring and income gains while the rebound in housing "demonstrates continued strength" in that important sector.
 
Housing Gains Were Widespread
 The 11 percent jump in housing starts, the biggest gain since February 1991, was spread across all types of housing and all geographic regions, the Commerce Department's report showed.
Starts of single-family homes climbed 9.8 percent to a pace of 1,045,000, while construction of two-to-four-unit structures rose to 39,000, and buildings with five or more units rose to 146,000.
The Midwest posted a 35 percent gain, slightly offsetting a steep April loss, with gains for the other regions ranging from 1.6 percent in the Northeast to 6.5 percent in the West. Despite the May advance, housing starts nationwide remain under the peak March pace by 8 percent, or 110,000 units.
The decline in permits was less than 1 percent, entirely in apartment houses. Modest increases in the Northeast and Midwest were more than offset by declines in the South and West.
Shipments of mobile homes, a category in which the data lag a month, edged up to a rate of 199,000 in April from 197,000 in March, the report also showed.
 
Industrial Output Rises
 The Federal Reserve's production data, covering about one-third of the economy, found manufacturing up seven-tenths of 1 percent in May with durable goods up 1.2 percent and nondurables up one-tenth of 1 percent. Output from mines and oil wells, however, declined three-tenths of 1 percent and utility output declined four-tenths of 1 percent for the second straight month.
The Fed noted that while the rise in durable consumer goods was largely concentrated in automobiles and light trucks, the May gain included other areas like appliances and furniture. Business equipment other than vehicles rose 1 percent last month, while production of construction supplies grew for the fifth straight month. Among nondurables, gains for textiles and chemicals were offset by declines for paper.
Even without cars and trucks, assembled at a 10.2 million pace, industrial production would have expanded five-tenths of 1 percent, the Fed reported.
Capacity utilization, the rate at which the nation's industry operated, rose to 79 percent from 78.7 percent in April, with factory utilization rising four-tenths of a point, to 78.1 percent.

HEADLINE: Energy Bill Is Cleared By Senate Committee

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16

 BODY:
A Senate panel approved and sent to the Senate floor today an energy bill that would encourage the development of electric cars and ease Federal regulations on the nuclear power industry. But it does not raise gasoline taxes, which many economists regard as critical to curbing oil imports and automotive-generated pollution.
The measure is likely to win the full Senate's endorsement within the next several weeks. The Administration strongly backed a similar bill passed by the House on May 27, suggesting that a compromise measure may be approved by both houses and receive President Bush's signature within the next several months. 
 Both bills would toughen building codes to foster conservation and would ease regulation of the electric power industry. Neither would allow oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge -- such permission is the centerpiece of the Administration's energy strategy -- or impose a tax on oil imports or gasoline consumption, which most economists regard as the most effective way to curb pollution and oil imports.
But the Senate Finance Committee added several provisions today that differed from or did not appear in the House bill and would have to be resolved by a conference committee of the two chambers.
One of these, introduced by Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, would provide an income-tax deduction up to $1,200 for buyers of automobiles that use other than gasoline.
At the request of Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas and chairman of the committee, the senators voted to allow independent oil and gas producers to reduce their tax liability by an additional $1.1 billion through expanded deductions for oil and gas drilling costs.
 
Bradley Rebuffed
 Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, tried unsuccessfully to delete the provision, contending that the Federal Government should keep the money and use it for social programs. "I'd rather spend it for child care than for the oil and gas industry," he said.
Senator Bentsen responded that other tax breaks for the oil and gas industry were being allowed to expire.
The Senate approved an energy bill, 94 to 4, on Feb. 19, but it was then referred to the Finance Committee so tax changes could be added.
In a series of close votes today that often divided along regional as well as party lines, the senators adopted amendments that would reduce taxes on gasoline mixed with grain alcohol, impose a coal production tax to help unionized, retired mine workers and provide tax deductions for buyers of new cars that can use alternative fuels.
The bill includes a major shift in Federal transportation policy toward mass transit systems and away from automobiles by taxing workers whose employers provide free parking and encouraging employers to hand out more valuable mass-transit passes.
 
Parking-Benefit Tax
 The House bill already included a provision that would require individuals to pay taxes for employer-provided parking if the benefit cost the employer more than $160 a month. The cost of the land and any buildings would be included in employers' calculations.
The Senate version would reduce the parking-cost figure, but the exact amount was unclear, because under an amendment introduced by Senator Thomas A. Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, that change would be a trade-off for cutting taxes on gasoline mixed with alcohol. Congressional aides guessed that the cap could fall to $145 a month.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, strenuously objected to the measure as an unfair burden on cities, where parking costs are high. Lowering the tax on gasoline mixed with alcohol, would increase demand for alcohol and help farmers in mostly rural areas.
Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th successfully added the provision helping retired, unionized coal miners when two Republican Senators voted "present" even though the Bush Administration strongly opposes the measure. Mr. Rockefeller said in an interview after the vote that he had sought and received as a personal favor the support of Senator Dave Durenberger, a Minnesota Republican who has worked closely with him on health-care legislation.

HEADLINE: Dow Drops 25.41, Ending At 3,329.49

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stock prices fell yesterday, as blue-chip issues dropped sharply in the late afternoon from futures-related selling and mounting worries about the economy.
The Dow Jones industrial average finished 25.41 points lower, to 3,329.49, with losing issues overtaking gaining ones, 952 to 775, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Big Board volume totaled 194.4 million shares, up from 164.1 million on Monday, as the exchange's composite index fell 0.90 point, to 224.72.
 
Broader Market Lower
 Broader gauges also declined. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 1.97, to 408.32, and the American Stock Exchange composite index declined 2.66, to 386.12. In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index finished 4.94 lower at 564.07.
Although the Government reported a sharp rebound in housing starts and a fourth straight rise in industrial production last month, investors are nervous that the slow pace of recovery will dilute corporate earnings.
"The stock market is viewed as the best investment vehicle at this time," said Edward Shopkorn, the managing director at the Mabon Securities Corporation. "But fundamentals are not so great. It's basically a market without a whole lot of conviction and a lot of concern."
 
Greenspan's Remarks
 Comments from the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, that the central bank would guard against reigniting inflation dashed hopes for any additional immediate cuts in interest rates. But in a note of encouragement, he said inflation was coming under control.
"The U.S. economy has made considerable progress toward price stability over the past decade," Mr. Greenspan said, "and it appears poised to make further advances."
Although low short-term yields in the credit markets have caused many investors to move money from certificates of deposit and money market funds and into the stock market, long-term rates remain high enough to cause anxiety about the health of the recovery.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 7/32 point, or $2.19 per $1,000 of face amount, sending the yield to 7.83 percent, from 7.85 percent on Monday.
"It's been a very difficult market from a trading standpoint," Mr. Shopkorn said. "You need to be in the right groups."
Gene Jay Seagle, an analyst at Gruntal & Company, said that although activity had been tepid, "I think we're getting close to the end of a trading range."
Mr. Tincher said he was focusing on some technology companies because of the recent decline in the sector. But he is shying away from drug stocks despite the recent battering in those issues.
Among technology issues, Compaq Computer, which introduced new lower-priced computers on Monday, lost 2 1/2, to 25. Alex. Brown & Sons cut its rating to "source of funds" from "hold" and lowered the company's earnings estimates.
Goldman, Sachs & Company removed Hewlett-Packard, another computer maker, from its recommended list. The stock fell 2, to 68 1/2.
Time Warner rose 2 1/8, to 109. Prudential Securities Inc. began its coverage with a "buy" rating.

HEADLINE: C.D.'s and Bank Funds Off

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit drifted lower in the week ended today, according to The Bank Rate Monitor.
Analysts at The Monitor noted that the yields were apparently not moved by economic indicators that suggested conditions were getting better. They said yields should coast into July, barring any abrupt action by the Federal Reserve. 
 Once again, the average decline was a little stronger among New York-area banks, marking a three-week trend.
At the auction on Monday of new three- and six-month Treasury bills, which many consider a good barometer of what banks will eventually pay their depositors, average discount rates were down to their lowest levels since May 18. The average rate on a three-month bill was 3.66 percent, down 5 basis points from the previous auction, while the six-month bill was down 8 basis points, to 3.75 percent. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
At New York-area banks, the average money market account was off a basis point, to 3.38 percent, and short-term certificates of deposit were off 2 basis points, to 3.5 percent for a three-month C.D. and 3.67 percent for a six-month.
Commercial banks, which make up one part of the New York-area average, were a little more aggressive this week than were the savings banks. Commercial banks lowered the average money market account a basis point, to 3.16 percent, and the average yield on C.D.'s by 2 basis points, to 3.35 percent on a three-month certificate and 3.44 percent on a six-month.
The move widened the difference between commercial banks and the higher-paying savings bank, which left money market accounts unchanged at 3.6 percent, while lowering a three-month C.D. 2 basis points, to 3.66 percent, and a six-month a basis point, to 3.9 percent.
The sharpest yield changes were reported at the Fleet Bank, which lowered its average money market account by 15 basis points, to 3.15 percent, and at the Republic National Bank, which cut its three-month C.D. by 15 basis points, to 3.41 percent, and its six-month certificate by 21 basis points, to 3.46 percent.
For 20 large banks outside the New York market, yields were unchanged for the average bank money market account, at 3.26 percent, and only down a basis point, to 3.61 percent, for a six-month certificate.

HEADLINE: The Less-Traveled Road to Medical School

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STONY BROOK, L.I., June 12

 BODY:
Mary Gratch spent 10 years trying to become an actress, but once she reached her goal she decided it was not enough. So now she is trying to become a doctor.
As she begins her fourth year at the School of Medicine at the State University of New York campus here, Ms. Gratch represents a future direction in medical education. In the New York region and throughout the country, educators and administrators say, medical schools have been making an effort to recruit a more diverse type of student.
 
Seeking Sensitivity
 Part of the reason for this push is the theory that applicants who know about more than physics and organic chemistry will bring a more sensitive touch to the practice of medicine. But there is also a less idealistic drive at work: as medical school applications declined sharply during the last decade, students like Ms. Gratch were one way to fill the gap. 
 Recently however, speculation has begun within the medical community about how long this trend will continue. Applications to medical school have increased during each of the last two years, a trend that admissions officers attribute to the recession, since medicine is perceived as offering job security. The increase raises questions of what chance former actors, artists, bankers, bakers, teachers and other professionals will have in the future.
"I really feel lucky I did this when I did," Ms. Gratch said. "I'm afraid that in a year or two schools will lose interest in people like me."
Although medical school administrators say they do not keep separate tallies of how many so-called nontraditional students are being admitted, most agree that the number has been increasing.
"There has been a move afoot for some time now to deliberately diversify the population of medical students," said Richard Green, a spokesman for the Association of American Medical Colleges, which last year added an essay section to the medical college admission test (MCAT). "They are trying to give people who may not consider themselves typical medical students a chance to compete. And they are trying to send a message to the typical science geeks and say you will have to know more than organic chemistry, you'll have to know how to think and write."
How well the nontraditional students do in medical school remains unclear because schools do not keep particular track of them and their grades. It is also too soon to tell how they perform as doctors since most of them have only recently graduated.
Medical schools interested in this type of student are sending their message with varying degrees of formality. At Stony Brook, for instance, which has a reputation for attracting nontraditional students, the message is spread by word of mouth. "We have let it be known that we are hospitable to people with unusual training," said Dr. Pierce Gardner, associate dean for academic affairs, "and they come find us."
 
Looking for Students
 At Mount Sinai School of Medicine, in contrast, recruiters go out and look for students. Since 1987, nearly one-quarter of the 115 spaces in each medical school class has been reserved for students with liberal arts backgrounds. Each year Kenneth D. Smith, director of the Humanities and Medicine Program at Mount Sinai, has been making regular visits to Amherst College, Williams College, Brandeis University, Wesleyan University and Princeton University to persuade liberal arts majors to try medical school.
The nontraditional students are a varied group. Some, like David Landis, knew all through college that they wanted to go to medical school but decided to take time off before they began. Mr. Landis, who is now in his fourth year at Stony Brook, graduated from the University of Chicago in 1987 and spent a year running his own bread-baking business.
Others, like Ms. Gratch, never thought about medicine until they were long out of college. After graduating from Catholic University in Washington in 1977, she spent more than 10 years working as a waitress and an actress, finally landing the job that had been her goal: a full-time position in a classical repertory company. "Once I got where I wanted to be, I realized it wasn't enough," she said. "It wasn't challenging enough mentally or emotionally. Art is a kind of a luxury and health care is a necessity. It's more important somehow."
 
A Sudden Rescue
 Lisa Sanders reached a very similar conclusion. Ms. Sanders, who has been accepted at several medical schools, spent more than 10 years as a television researcher and producer. One afternoon about four years ago, she was accompanying the CBS reporter Robert B. Arnot, who is also a medical doctor, on a story near a lake. While reciting his lines for the camera the reporter noticed a woman floating face down in the water. Still wearing his microphone Dr. Arnot jumped into the lake, dragged the woman to shore and saved her life with cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
"I watched him change from a journalist who watches things to a doctor who does things," she said. "It made me realize I'm not a person who wants to just sit around and watch."
Ms. Sanders and Ms. Gratch did what many nontraditional applicants are required to do: they returned to school to take the science classes they did not take in college. Across the country, catch-up courses are being developed to prepare these students. Before 1986 there were only 10 post-baccalaureate programs in the United States, according to Christine Yash. Ms. Yash is coordinator of such a program at Ohio State University and has compiled a directory of similar offerings at other schools. The current directory, she says, has 33 listings.
In many ways, late-medical-comers say, becoming a doctor later in life is harder than taking the more traditional route. "The students who come direct from college have advantages in the classroom," said Dr. Marianne C. Soufas, who spent 10 years as a graphic artist before entering medical school and who graduated from Stony Brook last month. "They're familiar with test-taking, they know how to memorize endless numbers of facts and pack in the kind of knowledge that you need."
 
The Advantage of Distance
 But in other ways, older students say, some distance from college is an advantage.
"I've seen the real world," said Amanda Weintraub Ratliff, who has worked as a private school teacher, a social worker and is currently a llama rancher on an island off Washington State. She will enter medical school in August. "I've gotten all that out of my system and I'm ready to focus," she said.
There is evidence that during the last decade, when the number of nontraditional students increased, the requirements for medical school admission decreased.
Schools traditionally refuse to release statistics about the admission qualifications of specific groups of students, but many administrators who run programs that provide catch-up science courses for those wishing to go to medical school say there was such a drop and it may now be turning around.
Susan Joerling, coordinator of preprofessional programs for the School of General Studies at Columbia University, which provides catch-up science courses, said the rule of thumb at her program used to be that a grade-point average of 2.8 was sufficient for acceptance to the least competitive level of medical school while applications were falling. Now that application rates have increased, she said, a 3.0 is considered necessary.
But older students and many medical school administrators argue that grades alone do not a doctor make. Nontraditional students, they say, bring qualities that modern medicine needs.
 
Not Lured by Wealth
 In general, they say, these students are not as likely to be lured by wealth. One 40-year-old banker at Chase Manhattan who will enter medical school this summer at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons in August estimates that the money he will spend for tuition combined with the income he will forgo during seven years of medical school and residency "is not far short of $1 million."
"I will never recoup that," said the banker, who asked that his name not be used because he has not yet told his employer of his plans. "Money is not the issue. I shall be disappointed if this turns out to be only another money-grubbing game."
Doctors who are not pursuing wealth are more likely to shun more lucrative medical specialties and choose primary care such as pediatrics, obstetrics-gynecology and internal medicine instead. Those are the areas in which doctors are most needed nationwide. Of the nearly two dozen nontraditional medical students and recent graduates interviewed for this article, every one planned a career in primary care.
Many said that because this was their second career they did not want to spend the additional three to five years required to specialize further. But others added that primary care was more consistent with the reason they chose to enter medicine in the first place.
Dr. David G. Lukcso was a professional ballet dancer for eight years before he entered medical school. At first he planned to be an orthopedic surgeon but is instead in the middle of his internal-medicine residency at New York Hospital. "I decided I would be of more benefit to people if I treated the whole person," he said. "Medicine is becoming too narrow and I wanted to do something more broad-based."
This different perspective is what some fear will be lost if competition for medical school continues to increase once again. Dr. Smith, at Mount Sinai, said that school is committed to maintaining up to 25 positions in each class for nontraditional students. Other admissions officers gave similar assurances.
But Ms. Joerling said she has already begun to see a change in the type of student who enrolls in Columbia's post-baccalaureate program.
"For five years we were seeing the career changer," she said. "Now we're seeing people who did the traditional science route in college but who don't think their grades are quite good enough to get into the medical school of their choice. That return to competitiveness is discouraging the less traditional student."
Ms. Sanders, who has a 3.5 grade-point average at the Columbia program, was placed on the waiting list at Yale Medical School and is deciding between Columbia and Tulane, said: "They took me because they didn't have enough 4.0 orgo grinds. If the 4.0 orgo grinds are back, they aren't going to want me."

HEADLINE: Greenspan Sees Benefits In Tying Bonds to Inflation

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said today that if the Treasury issued bonds with the yield indexed to inflation, it would help the Fed formulate monetary policy by giving it more information on inflation expectations.
He said that by studying the difference in the yield between indexed bonds and nonindexed bonds, the Fed would get useful information about real interest rates and investors' expectations for inflation. 
 Despite his praise for indexed bonds, Mr. Greenspan said that creating them might not be worthwhile because their benefits in setting monetary policy might be outweighed by additional costs to the Government to finance Treasury debt. He said the decision to issue such bonds should rest with the Treasury.
 
Weighing Benefits and Costs
 "Changing the composition of Federal debt issuance is not a matter to be taken lightly," he said. "Any proposal that has an impact on Treasury financing costs must clearly demonstrate that benefits exceed costs by a comfortable margin."
Testifying before the Subcommittee on Commerce, Consumer and Monetary Affairs of the House Committee on Government Operations, Mr. Greenspan said issuing such bonds presented several problems, including figuring out appropriate tax treatment and insuring that there would be sufficient investor interest.
Mr. Greenspan also made sanguine comments about inflation, saying, "The U.S. economy has made considerable progress toward price stability over the past decade, trimming the core rate of inflation to below 4 percent, and it appears poised to make further advances,"
Citing Britain's success with indexed bonds, Doug Barnard Jr., the Georgia Democrat who is chairman of the subcommittee, urged the Treasury to create such bonds, arguing that they could save the Government billions of dollars. The Treasury has repeatedly refused to issue such bonds.
 
Estimate of Savings
 Testifying after the Fed chairman, William Poole, a Brown University economics professor who served on President Ronald Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, estimated that if the Treasury had used modest amounts of indexed bonds in the 1980's, the national debt would be $50 to $100 billion lower than it is now. He said the double-digit interest rates still being paid on bonds issued in the early 1980's were pushing up the interest payments the Federal Government has to make each year.
Some economists say a decision to issue indexed bonds might indicate to the nation that the Treasury is willing to accommodate inflation, while others have the opposite interpretation: if the Treasury issues an obligation indexed to inflation, that would give it incentives to hold down inflation.
Mr. Greenspan said the large stakes involved, given the Government's huge need for money, meant that any experiment with indexed debt must be modest. Yet, he said, the size of the bond issue must be large enough to attract adequate trading interest to insure an active secondary market for indexed debt. He said such an issue should be at least several hundred million dollars.
"The prices of indexed debt trading in a thin market would not necessarily convey a significant amount of useful information about the economy as a whole," he said.
"An accurate reading on inflation expectations could considerably aid in economic forecasting by" shedding light on wage and cost pressures and on inflationary expectations, he said.

SmithKline to Market 5-in-1 Children's Vaccine

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
SmithKline Beecham, the big British-American drug maker, said yesterday that it had acquired the American rights to make and sell four vaccines, which it plans to include in a one-shot mega-vaccine against common children's diseases.
The vaccine would combine the current diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus shot with a flu immunization and a vaccine, which SmithKline already makes, against hepatitis B. 
 Analysts said the deals would push SmithKline into the front line of the $1.5 billion world vaccine market.
"The growing emphasis on preventive medicine, for both health and economic reasons, is giving vaccines an increasingly important role," said Jan Leschly, chairman of SmithKline's pharmaceuticals unit.
SmithKline, based in London and Philadelphia, said it had agreed in principle with Connaught Laboratories Inc., the American unit of Pasteur Institut Merieux of Lyons, France, to sell a Merieux flu vaccine, Haemophilus influenza type b (PRP-T), which is currently awaiting Federal regulatory approval. The agreement must be approved by the boards of the two companies.
 
Deal With Michigan
 In a separate deal, SmithKline said it would work with the Michigan Health Department to distribute vaccines developed by the state that protect against diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough) and tetanus. SmithKline will sell the Michigan vaccines, including a rabies shot, in the 49 other states.
The company did not disclose what it was paying for the vaccines.
"A lot of companies are working on developing mega-vaccine combinations," said Rita Freedman, an analyst with the PNC Financial Corporation in Philadelphia. Among them are Merck & Company, the Lederle Laboratories unit of American Cyanamid and the Wyeth-Ayerst unit of American Home Products.
Institut Merieux is also working with Merck to develop a combination pediatric vaccine using a Merck flu vaccine, which would compete with the SmithKline project.
Samuel D. Isaly of Mehta & Isaly Worldwide Pharmaceutical Research projects that world sales of pediatric vaccines will be more than $1 billion by the late 1990's, up from about $750 million now.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Broad Declines As Traders Remain Uneasy

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed lower yesterday against major currencies as traders remained uneasy about the pace of the United States economic recovery.
Gold prices also fell. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $342.20 a troy ounce, down 90 cents from Monday. In late trading, the Republic National Bank said gold fell 50 cents, to $342 an ounce. 
 Currency traders said the market initially reacted favorably to Government reports showing that United States housing starts and industrial production had accelerated in May. But the housing report also showed that housing starts had fallen 17.3 percent in April, steeper than the 17 percent drop initially reported last month.
"The market continues to be disappointed with U.S. economic growth," said Karen Kluge, a currency trader with Credit Suisse in New York. In addition, she said, higher interest rates in Europe make European currencies more attractive than the United States currency.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 127 yen, up 0.28 yen from Monday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 126.60 yen. In New York, the dollar fell to 126.50 yen, from 126.80 yen late Monday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.8605, from $1.8560 late Monday. In New York, one pound cost $1.8645, more expensive than Monday's $1.8565.
In Europe, one dollar bought 1.5665 German marks, down from 1.5715 late Monday. In New York, the dollar traded at 1.5635 marks, down from 1.5710 marks Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday, were: 5.2650 French francs, down from 5.2905; 1,183.25 Italian lire, down from 1,189.25; 1.4045 Swiss francs, down from 1.4150, and 1.19625 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1926.

Data Signaling Recovery Ignored

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday despite economic news that pointed toward a recovery.
The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond gained 7/32 point, or $2.19 per $1,000 of face amount. Its yield declined to 7.83 percent, from 7.85 percent late Monday. Trading was light. 
 The Government released reports showing strength in the housing and manufacturing sectors. Good economic news usually pushes down bond prices because it reduces the prospects for lower interest rates.
The Commerce Department said housing starts rose 11 percent in May, partly recovering from a huge 17.3 percent decline a month earlier. The gain was the largest in more than a year.
In another report suggesting a rebound, the Federal Reserve said industrial production jumped six-tenths of 1 percent in May. The increase was the fourth in a row and the biggest since last July.
 
'Shrugging Off' Reports
 The numbers initially sent bond prices lower, but the market rebounded.
"Right now the market seems to be shrugging off" the reports of economic strength, which would normally be considered bad news for bonds, said Steven A. Wood, economist at BankAmerica Capital Markets Inc. in San Francisco.
Most investors, he said, are "not convinced the recovery is here to stay."
The market received news more to its liking in a report by Johnson Redbook indicating that June retail sales were down from May. Part of the drop was attributed to the fact that Father's Day is late this year, but the market nonetheless took the report as a sign that consumers remained reluctant to spend.
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term maturities rose 3/32 point to 7/32 point, intermediate maturities gained 3/16 point to 9/32 point and long-term issues rose as much as 13/32 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported.
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures price movements on all Treasury issues outstanding with maturities of a year or longer, closed at 1,233.83, up 2.28.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills issued at auction Monday fell to 3.72 percent as the discount dropped 2 basis points, to 3.64 percent. Yields on six-month bills auctioned Monday fell to 3.84 percent as the discount fell 2 basis points, to 3.73 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 4.07 percent as the discount was off 4 basis points, to 3.91 percent.
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity.
The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 3 5/8 percent, down from 3 7/8 percent late Monday.

HEADLINE: 13 Named To Panel On Tonys

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
The administrators of the Tony Awards, who voted last week to drop 9 of the 12 members of the Tony nominating committee and to increase the committee's size, revealed the names of the new members yesterday.
They are the actors Jane Alexander, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Gretchen Cryer and Eileen Heckart; the playwright Arthur Kopit; the costume designer Donald Brooks; the set designer Oliver Smith; the choreographer and director Marge Champion; Jay Harnick, the artistic director of Theaterworks/USA, a children's theater group; Betty L. Corwin, an archivist at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts; the producers Robert Kamlot and Elizabeth I. McCann, and Sister Francesca Thompson, an associate professor of communications at Fordham University. 
 Three members of the previous nominating committee are to stay on: Ted Chapin, the executive director of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization; Fran Kumin, the director of artistic programs at Theater Communications Group, and Suzanne Sato, an arts administrator with the Rockefeller Foundation.
The reason for removing the nine nominators, the Tony administrators said last week, was to insure that more panel members would be working theater professionals, rather than academics, writers and arts executives. Mr. Chapin, Ms. Kumin and Ms. Sato are all arts executives.
Last Wednesday, the 24-member Tony Administration Committee also voted to limit the consecutive service of nominators to three years. Future nominators will serve for only one year and may be reappointed only twice. Previously there was no limit; some nominators served a decade or more.
 
Some Said No
 Several people who were asked to serve on the new panel declined. Robert Marx, the executive director of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, said he wanted "to maintain neutrality." The composer John Kander was also on the nominating-panel list but asked to be removed because he could have a conflict this season, when his show "Kiss of the Spider Woman" may come to Broadway. Also believed to have declined was the playwright Ira Levin, who could not be reached for comment.
A number of those who were dropped from the nominating committee last week expressed surprise over the administrators' action, which had been characterized by some in the theater industry as a "bloodbath."
"I felt they were impugning my credentials as a director," said Carole Rothman, a co-artistic director of Second Stage in Manhattan, who was nominated for a Tony Award for her 1987 direction of "Coastal Disturbances." "It's hard to understand what their definition of theater professional is if they kicked me off."
Ms. Rothman said she was proud of her committee's choices, which, she said, were "based on excellence." They included nine nominations for "Two Shakespearean Actors" and "Four Baboons Adoring the Sun," both of which had closed by the time nominations were made on May 4. (The Tony Awards were presented on May 31 by the League of American Theaters and Producers and the American Theater Wing.) These nominations were known to displease producers of shows that were still running, since a Tony designation generally helps at the box office. "On that day, I announced to the entire committee that we're going to be kicked off," said Ms. Rothman, referring to May 4.
Of the administration committee's attitude toward the nominators, Ms. Rothman said, "I felt it was not high on the list of requirements that the group show any integrity." Of the Tony Awards, she added, "I think that it's a commercial venture and the Tony administration committee views it that way."
 
'A New Concept'
 Isabelle Stevenson, the president of the American Theater Wing and a member of the administration committee, said it "was not trying to impugn Carole's credentials, or those of anyone on the committee." She added: "We didn't consider it personally. We were just trying to dissolve the whole board. Innocently enough, we never thought they would feel offended or hurt. We thought they would understand that we needed to change the committee."
That change was made, she said, "to start with a new concept in mind," the concept being to increase the number of nominators who were working theater professionals.
"There was no implication that the current panel was not doing a good job," she said.
Mrs. Stevenson denied that the administration committee had objected to the choices of "Four Baboons Adoring the Sun" and "Two Shakespearean Actors." "All through the years, panels have nominated shows that have closed," she said. She also denied that the panel had been pressured in any way.
About Ms. Rothman's charge of commercialism, Mrs. Stevenson said: "That is absolutely not true. There is no shred of evidence about that." Of the Tony Awards, she said: "Admittedly, they have become economically important. But the Tonys were founded to award excellence in the craft of theater, and that's what the Tonys are all about: excellence."
But Stuart W. Little, the director of communications at the Theater Development Fund, who was dropped from the nominating panel after one year, said, "Replacing 9 of the 12 was, I think, a criticism of our committee."

Margaret Sanger, Warrior for Women's Rights

 BODY:

Woman of Valor
Margaret Sanger and the Birth Control Movement in America
By Ellen Chesler
Illustrated. 639 pages. Simon & Schuster. $27.50. 
 If he makes time to read 600-plus page books, Vice President J. Danforth Quayle could find plenty of ammunition in Ellen Chesler's "Woman of Valor" for his marching orders to New Yorkers and other American miscreants who aren't paying attention to his lectures about family values. Ms. Chesler's biography of Margaret Sanger, whose personal life was not exactly circumspect and who pioneered the rights of birth control for women from the United States to Japan, shows that the same censorious forces that exist today against feminism, contraception and abortion were at work, even more aggressively, in the first third of this century.
Among the harshest critics of Sanger's writings about sexuality and reproduction was none other than Anthony Comstock, the leader of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, whose bluenosed indignation against moral pollution and pornography led to vaguely defined Federal and state obscenity statutes. In outspoken newspaper columns intended to educate women, Sanger challenged Comstock and the Comstock laws. Ms. Chesler, a historian with experience in municipal government, writes that by insisting on exercising her First Amendment rights about the open discussion of sexuality and contraception, Sanger changed "the social discourse of her times and of our own."
Margaret Higgins's first marriage, in 1902 to William Sanger, an architect, introduced her to a world of cultural and radical ferment. The generation that had come of age in the new century felt an obligation to redefine themselves and the country. She had studied to become a nurse; later, she combined her knowledge of health care with the Socialist movement. The Sangers joined Socialist Party Local 5 in New York City in 1911, and William ran for alderman. They were active during the movement's heyday under the leadership of Eugene V. Debs.
"The attractive young couple," Ms. Chesler writes, "became favored comrades, and to their uptown parlor flocked the leading young rebels and scoffers of the day, distinctions among them counting far less for the moment than their common vision of a better world for all."
Among the powerful visitors to the Sanger home were journalists, anarchists, Wobblies, trade unionists, including John Reed, Walter Lippmann, Big Bill Haywood and Emma Goldman, "whose brash manners Margaret never forgave, even as she absorbed her forceful doctrines of radicalism and feminism."
The Socialist Party embraced the cause of women's suffrage as an organizing tool. Margaret Sanger was hired to promote the vote for women, but she viewed this effort as a low priority in the larger struggle of women for economic and social justice. Working part time with Lillian Wald's Visiting Nurses Association on the Lower East Side, she was exposed to the ignorance about birth control and the social pathos of poverty.
In 1916, Sanger opened the first birth-control clinic in the United States, behind the curtained windows of a storefront tenement on Amboy Street in Brownsville, Brooklyn. Handbills were distributed to promote the benefits of contraception over abortion. She had seen women die after self-induced abortions without open and legal medical assistance. After several weeks, the police raided the clinic, Sanger was jailed and the clinic was closed. In this carefully documented book, Ms. Chesler reports that the clinic had served 464 recorded clients.
Sanger continued her efforts in lectures, writings and conferences held in the United States, Great Britain, India and Japan. In 1921, she organized the first American Birth-Control Conference at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, with a list of sponsors that included Winston Churchill and Theodore Dreiser. That conference established her as the country's leading spokeswoman for birth control. Prominent women and women's organizations joined her campaigns. Before her husband was nominated to be President, Eleanor Roosevelt served on the board of the American Birth-Control League. Members of the Rockefeller family became major supporters of Margaret Sanger's Birth-Control Clinical Research Bureau.
At the same time Sanger devoted her professional life to birth control, her personal life took a different course. Before and after her first marriage unraveled, she followed her own advice about a fulfilled sex life for women. She had many lovers, including H. G. Wells and Havelock Ellis. The affairs are described from a feminist viewpoint that would not shock the newsstand readers of cover lines in Cosmopolitan magazine. She didn't stop her relationships after a second marriage, to Noah Slee, a millionaire.
Sanger, who died in 1966 at the age of 87, had the comfort of knowing that the United States Supreme Court had made its historic 1965 decision in Griswold v. Connecticut, which gave Constitutional protection to the private use of contraceptives. "Since her death the rebirth of a vigorous feminist movement has given new resonance to her original claim that women have a fundamental right to control their own bodies," Ms. Chesler writes.
"Woman of Valor" is especially timely during this bizarre Presidential election season when abortion rights and Murphy Brown's motherhood are flag-waving issues. Ms. Chesler delivers a scholarly, though heavy, contribution to the debate in her biography of a strong-willed woman who challenged the moral police and the mores of her time.

HEADLINE: Enterprise Zones Are Tested, and They Work

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"No EZ Answer for Cities" (editorial, June 4) calls enterprise zones -- in which Government encourages job-creating investments in ghettos by offering investors tax breaks and regulatory relief -- "flawed in theory and also in practice." You are incorrect on both counts: enterprise zones are tested, and they do work.
The economic problems in America's inner cities have been building for 30 years. Manufacturing and industry have largely disappeared from our inner cities. With the loss of manufacturing went (in this order) good jobs, wholesale trade, retail businesses and a large source of local tax revenues. At the same time we saw a rise in poverty, crime, drug use, homelessness and illiteracy. 
 With a shrinking corporate tax base, cities needed to provide more services with less revenue. As a result, cities were forced to raise revenue from other sources, such as residential property taxes, adding to the outward migration of many middle-class residents and homeowners. Finally, infrastructure continued to decay, and crime rates rose, making cities even less attractive to businesses and residents.
Certainly, we must address education, training, day care and health care. Also, affordable housing, crime and drug abuse. But any urban response that does not include a mechanism to attract jobs and business back into our inner cities is simply destined for failure.
Enterprise zones must be part of that response. They have been established in 37 states since 1982 and have created more than 250,000 jobs and attracted more than $28 billion in capital investments. This has all happened without Federal incentives, which would make enterprise zones more attractive than ever to investors and entrepreneurs.
Enterprise zones have been endorsed by the National Governors Association, the National Council of State Legislators, the Council of Black State Legislators, the Conference of Mayors and the Conference of Black Mayors, among many others.
Properly designed Federal enterprise zones can persuade businesses to build and grow in poor neighborhoods. They will give people incentives to invest in such businesses.
Targeted incentives can encourage employers in enterprise zones to hire and train unemployed and economically disadvantaged individuals who live within the zone. Enterprise zones will create jobs and stimulate entrepreneurship. And they will help restore the tax base to communities that have been forced to provide increasing social services with decreasing sources of revenue.
Enterprise zones are not the whole cure for the social and economic ills of our cities, but they are clearly a big step in the right direction. So let us seize this post-Los Angeles moment and get something passed that works.

HEADLINE: Eating WellGene-Spliced Foods: Is It Safe Soup Yet?

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS

 BODY:
DR. DAVID A. KESSLER, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, is adamant: there are stringent rules for regulating genetically engineered foods, and he intends to enforce them. "This is not a voluntary system," he said.
 Michael Hansen, a research associate at Consumers Union, is equally adamant: the rules aren't stringent. "Everything is left up to the discretion of the companies," he said. "The industry is on the honor system." 
These uncompromising interpretations of a genetic-engineering policy, published by the F.D.A. last month in the Federal Register, were made after Vice President Quayle told industry executives in May that the policy was part of the Bush Administration's "regulatory relief" program. But, Mr. Quayle added, "we will not compromise safety one bit."
 Many consumer and environmental groups, including the Environmental Defense Fund and the National Wildlife Federation, said that because genetically engineered food is so new, it should be subject to testing before it appears on the market. At the very least, they said, the foods should be labeled so that consumers can decide for themselves whether they want to eat the results of gene splicing.
 They contend that genetic material placed into another food is a new substance and should be treated as a new food additive, which requires premarket testing.
 "Genetic engineers are taking genes from bacteria, viruses and insects and adding them to fruits, grains and vegetables," said Dr. Rebecca Goldberg, a senior scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund. "They are producing foods that have never before been eaten by human beings. Consumers should not be guinea pigs for untested food substances."
 But it is the position of the biotechnology industry and the F.D.A. that gene splicing is nothing more than an advanced form of crossbreeding, a century-old practice responsible for such familiar foods as tangelos, a hybrid of tangerines and grapefruits. They reasoned that hybridized crops have never required premarket testing or labeling, so there is no reason that foods created from gene splicing should be treated differently. According to the F.D.A.'s policy statement, the agency "is not aware of any information showing that foods derived by these new methods differ from other foods in any meaningful or uniform way." To put it another way, as long the components of these new foods are generally recognized as safe, the food itself is considered safe.
 Under this reasoning, the genes spliced into these new foods would not generally be considered new food additives; therefore, they would not require premarket review by the agency. But if the presence of the new genes in a food produces a significant change in the level of important nutrients or creates allergens or previously unknown substances, companies making such foods would have to consult with the agency. The food might still end up on the market, but it would have to be labeled to reveal the presence of the allergen, the new substance or the change in nutrient level, or else require F.D.A. approval.
 It is up to companies producing new foods to decide into which category their products fall. Michael Taylor, a deputy commissioner of the F.D.A., said the agency expected the industry to be accountable. "We have laid out what amounts to a standard of care for evaluating safety," he added. "If they do not come to us and we have any questions, we have the authority to prevent the marketing of that product and we can seize or enjoin the product."
 Dr. Eric Flamm, a microbiologist in the F.D.A.'s office of technology, acknowledged that the agency has a public relations problem. "We are attempting to correct the misinformation," Dr. Flamm said, "by writing letters to the editor and articles that will put the regulation in better perspective." In addition, the agency is planning at least two public meetings with industry representatives and consumers this summer to discuss the issues. Details of themeetings have not been completed.
 The F.D.A. has its work cut out for it. Many scientists do not believe that gene splicing is an extension of the kind of breeding that has gone on for the last century, and they do not approve of the proposed regulations.
 "There is no form of crossbreeding that allows the placing of human genes into a tomato," said Dr. Margaret Mellon, the director of the biotechnology policy center of the National Wildlife Federation in Washington. "This is radically new. To say that it is a minor extension of older technology flies in the face of scientific truth."
 Dr. Mellon was referring to the implanting of animal and human genes into plants, and vice versa. For example, a firefly gene can be planted in corn, and a trout gene in celery. A new designer tomato, FlavrSavr, made by Calgene Inc. in Davis, Calif., which will last for 20 days on the shelf, contains a bacterial gene that confers a resistance to antibiotics.
 Asked if people might build up a resistance to antibiotics by eating these tomatoes and other foods that could contain the same gene, the chairman of the company, Roger Salquist, said, "It is simply not an issue." The gene, known as a marker gene, is used by the manufacturer to identify a successful splicing.
 The F.D.A., however, said it was concerned about the safety of such a marker gene and was evaluating it. In the Federal Register, the agency said that it "believes that it will be important to evaluate such concerns with respect to commercial use of antibiotic resistance marker genes in food, especially those that will be widely used."
 Other critics of the regulations have expressed concerns that a food with an unnaturally long shelf life would lose its nutrients. Mr. Salquist said he was not sure whether this subject had been studied, but he added, "I don't believe there is any decline over time."
 Critics also worry about unknown hazards. "In the past we have been able to know what was dangerous over a long period of trial and error," said Jeremy Rifkin, the president of the Foundation on Economic Trends, a nonprofit public interest group that focuses on environmental, economic and ethical issues raised by technology. "Here we have no information. There may be novel allergenic effects from recombining. It may create new mutations. Some mutations may have long- and short-term effects we know nothing about."
 A case in point could be a sometimes fatal blood disorder that in 1990 was linked to the use of the dietary supplement L-tryptophan, which contained genetically engineered bacteria. While there is no evidence that genetic engineering caused contamination to the supplement, the full answer may never be known. The Japanese manufacturer stonewalled American officials, delaying access to the plant that produced the dietary supplement until the area of the plant making it had been shut down for six months. Dr. Mellon said there was reason to "suspect that genetic engineering might have played a role."
 "It is true that F.D.A. cannot prove that genetic engineering caused the deaths," she said, "but they should also say that they cannot prove that it didn't. They are trying to dampen down any concern about this link." She cited a remark about L-tryptophan by Samuel W. Page, the chief of the natural products and instrumentation branch of the F.D.A., in the Aug. 31, 1990, issue of the journal Science. "The whole question -- Is there any relation to genetic engineering? -- is premature, especially given the impact on industry." Dr. Kessler denied the possibility, though he said research was incomplete.
 Other critics cited the potential for allergic reactions to genetically engineered food among small parts of the population. The F.D.A. "has neglected to consider people who have allergies to foods that are not necessarily considered allergens," Dr. Goldberg said. She cited the case of a woman who is allergic to bananas, a food seldom thought of as a potential allergen, and who is concerned that she may unknowingly eat a food in which a banana gene has been planted.
 Dr. Kessler acknowledged the lack of information in an article for the June 26 issue of Science, a draft copy of which he made available. He wrote: "At this time we are unaware of any practical method to predict or assess the potential for new proteins in food to induce allergenicity."
 There is also a potential problem for vegetarians, Orthodox Jews, Moslems and Buddhists when animal genes are spliced into vegetables and the vegetables are not labeled. The issue is not addressed by the F.D.A. document. "We will be talking to religious leaders," Dr. Kessler said.
 Dr. Goldberg said consumers are entitled to know what is in their food. Some New York City chefs think so, too. They held a news conference on June 2 to say they would boycott genetically engineered foods. But it is impossible to boycott genetically engineered foods if they are not labeled. The chefs said they planned to ask the city's Department of Consumer Affairs to require labeling.
 Mark Green, the city's Commissioner of Consumer Affairs, said that his office is looking into the "feasibility and legality of a local labeling law."
 Mr. Rifkin, whose foundation is running a campaign to pressure Congress and the F.D.A. to require labeling and testing, said chefs around the country and farmers had joined the effort, which is to include writing to the F.D.A. by Aug. 27, the end of the period in which the regulation is open for public comment.
 But neither Mr. Taylor nor Dr. Kessler would say whether public comment would make them reconsider. "We will evaluate the comments and see whether we have the authority to regulate," Mr. Taylor said.
 Written comments may be sent until Aug. 27 to: Dockets Management Branch (H.F.A.-305), Food and Drug Administration, Room 1-23, 12420 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Md. 20857. Comments should include the docket number, 92N-0139.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN WASHINGTON;
YELTSIN CHEERED AT CAPITOL AS HE PLEDGES ERA OF TRUST AND ASKS FOR ACTION ON AID

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
On a day that the United States gave Russia a set of trade incentives to boost its struggling economy, President Boris N. Yeltsin swept through official Washington like a conquering hero today and announced that he was deactivating the most potent nuclear missiles aimed at America.
Amid chants of "Boris, Boris, Boris!" reverberating through the House of Representatives chamber, Mr. Yeltsin stirred Congress to 13 standing ovations as he vowed that the "idol of Communism" had "collapsed, never to rise again." [Excerpts, page A18.] 
 Having caused a furor on Monday by asserting that some Americans taken prisoner in Vietnam or other wars may still be alive in Russia, Mr. Yeltsin pledged to do whatever was needed to find them. He leaped ahead of the agreement to cut long-range nuclear weapons that he and President Bush announced on Tuesday by telling the joint meeting of Congress that he had ordered the 10-warhead SS-18 missiles that are to be destroyed under the accord removed immediately from active status.
 
Money for Ex-Soviet Lands
 Then he said it was time for the United States to repay Russia's good will by approving a stalled package of aid that includes $12 billion the International Monetary Fund says it needs to begin lending to Russia and the other former Soviet republics.
Appearing later at a news conference with President Bush, Mr. Yeltsin was even more direct.
"If we do not take measures now to support Russia," he said, "this will not be a collapse of Russia only, it will be a collapse of the United States, because it will mean new trillions of dollars for the arms race."
Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Bush took a big step toward thawing commercial relations today by signing agreements granting Russia most-favored-nation status in trade and liberalizing rules for American investment in Russia. [Page A19.] But Mr. Bush will have to expend considerable political capital to insure Congressional passage of the stalled aid package.
 
Bush Appeals to Congress
 He joined Mr. Yeltsin's appeal for action, asking lawmakers to put aside election-year pressure to spend money only at home and move quickly to approve the aid program for former Soviet republics.
"Let me just say to the American people, our support for Russia is unshakable because it is in our interest," Mr. Bush said at the joint news conference, which followed the signing ceremony in the White House East Room. "Success for Russian democracy will enhance the security of every American. Think for just a minute about what that means -- not for presidents, nor for heads of state, or historians, but for parents and their children. It means a future free from fear."
Mr. Yeltsin obtained the favorable tariff treatment he has long sought from Washington when the two Presidents signed the packet of commercial agreements. The documents also prohibit double taxation of profits, provide risk insurance for American investors and expand the availability of export credits for American companies.
Other agreements signed on the final day of the first Russian-American summit meeting expand the official relationship between the two countries, including cooperation in space and the formation of a joint early-warning system for missile launches.
 
Russia at the Center
 Similar accords are likely to be signed in time with Ukraine and other former republics, but it seemed evident that Russia, by far the largest of the 15 countries that have emerged from the wreckage of the old Soviet Union, is at the center of Washington's attention.
Lawmakers said Mr. Yeltsin appeared to have won some converts with his stirring speech and dramatic personal confrontation of lawmakers who had been opposing passage of the aid program. But the measure's prospects in Congress remained uncertain and much certainly depended on how much private arm-twisting Mr. Bush was prepared to do to back the public appeals for passage he has made at every opportunity in the last two days.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin also signed an agreement to produce a treaty that would slash the two countries' strategic nuclear weapons to one-third of their current size.
Mr. Bush said the two countries have "indeed formed a truly new relationship, one of peace, friendship, trust and growing partnership." He added, "I am confident that this new relationship and our historic agreements at this summit will lead to a safer, more stable and peaceful world in the next century."
As important as the documents were, the most dramatic moment of the day came when Mr. Yeltsin strode into the packed chamber of the House of Representatives to a standing ovation that was more enthusiastic than the reception Mr. Yeltsin gets in the Russian Parliament and rivaled Mr. Bush's own reception in Congress after the American victory in the Persian Gulf.
The enthusiasm came as something of a surprise since before Mr. Yeltsin's arrival there were few lawmakers who thought that he would outdo his political rival, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in popularity in Washington. But Mr. Yeltsin put his political deftness on display and appeared to win over even those lawmakers who had been demanding that the aid package be held up until Russia accounts for all American prisoners of war who might have been taken to the former Soviet Union.
 
A Display of Skills
 He stood before the House's enormous American flag, with his broad shoulders and swept-back silver hair towering over the rostrum. His broad face creasing frequently into his easy grin, Mr. Yeltsin alternately flattered, cajoled, pleaded, blustered and sternly lectured the assembled Senators and Representatives about their responsibility to promote political and economic reform in the former Soviet Union.
But he seemed bent primarily on assuring the lawmakers that they can now trust the Russian Government, and in doing so he seemed to overshadow even the powerful appearances in Washington by Mr. Gorbachev, the last Soviet President.
"We are firmly resolved not to lie anymore, either to our negotiating partners, or to the Russian or American or any other people," he said, denouncing even the vision of a more humane Communism offered by Mr. Gorbachev. "There will be no more lies, ever."
 
Promise on Prisoners
 Drawing a thundering ovation, Mr. Yeltsin promised to account for every American prisoner of war that may have been brought to the Soviet Union during World War II, the Korean War or the Vietnam War.
"Even if one American has been detained in my country and can still be found, I will find him," Mr. Yeltsin said. "I will get him back to his family."
Then, as the applause died down, Mr. Yeltsin smiled almost mischievously and chided lawmakers who had said the Russian aid package should be frozen until the issue of missing servicemen is resolved.
"I thank you for the applause," he said. But he added, "Yeltsin has already opened the archives and is inviting you to join us in investigating the fate of each and every unaccounted-for American. So now you are telling me first to do the job and then we shall support you in passing that act. I don't quite understand you."
 
2 Legislators Yield
 The two lawmakers who had called for linking the aid package to the prisoners issues, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Representative Robert K. Dornan, Republican of California, both said later they were persuaded by Mr. Yeltsin.
Mr. Yeltsin also promised to ferret out the truth about how a Soviet SU-15 fighter-bomber shot down the Korean Air Lines Boeing 747 in September 1983. He said at a news conference later that Russian authorities had found a K.G.B. document suggesting that there are hidden files on the subject and are now searching for them.
Both Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Bush, who lavished heavy praise on the Russian President, spent the day seeking to underscore the notion that their meeting marked a watershed in relations between their two countries.
"For many years, our two nations were the two poles, the two opposites," Mr. Yeltsin told Congress. But he said, "That evil scenario is becoming a thing of the past. Reason begins to triumph over madness. We have left behind the period when America and Russia looked at each other through gunsights, ready to pull the trigger at any time."
Anticipating the domestic political pressures he may face in light of the agreement to cut long-range nuclear weapons, Mr. Bush warned at the news conference that it would not produce a windfall "peace dividend" that might be spent on American domestic programs.
"The dividend is declared when you make a profit and our Government is operating at an enormous deficit," he said.
 
'No Human Face'
 Seeking to persuade Congress that his country has taken steps toward democracy and free markets that cannot be retraced, Mr. Yeltsin said, "There can be no coexistence between a civic society, which is pluralistic by definition, and Communist intolerance to dissent. The experience of the past decades has taught us Communism has no human face. Freedom and Communism are incompatible."
He displayed a mastery of the American political dialect, making his speech intensely personal. He thanked his wife and family for their support in troubled times and offering himself as the bulwark of democratic reform. "It is practically impossible to topple Yeltsin in Russia," he said. "I am in good health and I will not say 'uncle' before I make the reforms irreversible.' "
He also reminded the lawmakers that it was he who defied the attempted coup in the Kremlin nearly a year ago. "I will be candid with you," he said. "At that moment I feared. But I had no fear for myself. I feared for the future of democracy in Russia and throughout the world because I was aware what could happen if we failed to win."
 
Recalling Bush's Support
 At a final dinner tonight at the Russian Embassy, Mr. Yeltsin invoked the coup attempt once again as he and Mr. Bush toasted each other with some of the most personal comments to come from their meeting.
Mr. Yeltsin said that when Mr. Gorbachev was a captive of reactionaries and Russia's fate hinged on the world's willingness to ratify a de facto coup, Mr. Bush was the first leader to call him at Moscow's White House, then the seat of Russia's government, and vow his support.
Other leaders followed, he said, but only at Mr. Bush's suggestion, and in many cases only after the collapse of the coup was clear. The American President "was the first to understand the true meaning of the victory of the Russian people," Mr. Yeltsin said.
Mr. Bush's response was brief and apparently heartfelt. "You leave with all of us feeling you are going to make it, somehow," he said. "We are at your side."

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN WASHINGTON;
Shaping a New Agenda

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
Although the biggest news out of this week's summit meeting was the agreement to sharply reduce American and Russian nuclear arsenals, the centerpiece turned out to be economic relations between the two former rivals.
In effect, these two days marked the moment when the currency of American-Russian relations shifted from warheads to dollars. Stripped to its essence, what President Boris N. Yeltsin did this week was promise Mr. Bush that Russia would trash thousands of warheads in exchange for long-promised trade privileges, a bilateral investment treaty, removal of cold-war trade barriers and the hope of lucrative American investment and quick Congressional approval of a Russian aid package. 
 To be sure, there were other turning points as well. The meeting finally gave Mr. Yeltsin the chance to step out of the shadow Mikhail S. Gorbachev long cast in Washington. It was only last August that senior White House officials were still telling reporters on background that Mr. Yeltsin was a "demagogue," a buffoon, and a man with more taste for vodka than for the complexities of diplomacy and arms control.
 
Firmly Established
 With his performance today before the United States Congress, with his concessions on arms control and with his frank disclosures about American prisoners of war in the Soviet Union, Mr. Yeltsin has firmly established himself in Washington as the legitimate leader of a reformist Russia. It is safe to say he is no longer perceived as the the coarse populist who was resented for ousting Mr. Bush's "friend," Mr. Gorbachev.
Mr. Yeltsin is delivering the goods in arms cuts and in candor that Mr. Gorbachev promised but never fully accomplished. Throughout his public comments in Washington, Mr. Yeltsin drew a sharp contrast between his intentions -- to destroy Communism and bare its worst excesses -- and Mr. Gorbachev's -- to reform Communism and preserve secrets.
Congress clearly acknowledged Mr. Yeltsin's new status, not to mention an appreciation of his frankness, with gleeful chants of "Boris, Boris, Boris!" at the high points of Mr. Yeltsin's speech in the House chamber today.
In addition to these economic and personal transformations, of course, the arms control accord, radically reducing nuclear arsenals by the year 2003, will fundamentally reshape the nuclear balance. Because the most potent offensive weapons used in a pre-emptive nuclear strike will be destroyed, the fear Americans and Russians have lived under for 40 years will be drastically diminished.
After these cuts are completed in 10 years, the cold war balance of terror will be replaced by a new imbalance. According to the proposed treaty, the United States, as the world's biggest superpower and de facto policeman, will be allowed to maintain an edge in its advanced, mostly defensive, submarine-launched weapons, while the Russians, who can no longer afford the arms race, will accept a secondary status.
 
No Longer a Distraction
 For all of these seemingly positive outcomes, though, a caveat is in order. The arms cuts may not survive unless Mr. Yeltsin or another reformist democrat also survives in the Kremlin. The very reason that Mr. Yeltsin agreed to such a sweeping, asymmetrical deal, American officials say, was to get this issue off the agenda so it could no longer be used as an excuse or a distraction from what is for him the real issue: transforming his economy.
And it is the success or failure of that transformation -- far more than the nuclear balance -- that is likely to determine the stability and quality of United States-Russian relations.
The importance of the economic agreements signed today, offering most-favored-nation trade benefits to Russian exporters, export credits, a taxation treaty, insurance to American companies wanting to invest in Russia and a treaty to govern mutual investment, is that they promote what will really transform the Russian economy: not foreign aid, but private investment.
 
Need for Investment
 One thing American officials have learned from the experience of Poland is that while Western aid is necessary for transformation to a free market, they are not sufficient. There is no capitalism without capitalists, and unless Russia is opened up to investment, unless state-owned industries are privatized quickly, unless the ruble is made convertible and unless there is a modicum of internal stability to attract foreign businesses, no external aid package will be big enough.
To the extent that the American-Russian relationship shifts to economics, the role of statesmen, and even summit meetings, is bound to diminish. Far more important will be a thousand small decisions made by a thousand small businessmen, on whether to invest in or trade with Russia.
Mr. Yeltsin himself noted that as important as American and Western aid and credits from the International Monetary Fund are to his economy, they "will not save Russia; they will not even significantly help us."
The most important thing, he said, is that once Russia gets an I.M.F. stamp of approval "this will open the door for a powerful influx of private capital, and those will not be credits, those will be direct investments from private companies, and that will be a matter of hundreds of billions of dollars, and that will be very important aid; it will be direct aid, it will be civilized aid."
 
On Missing G.I.'s
 But Mr. Yeltsin also learned this week that the shifting relationship is a double-edged sword. It is precisely because Russia no longer seems to be a threat that Congressional interest in acting on Russian aid has been diminishing, especially when American domestic problems seem so pressing. Many in Congress seem to be saying: why pay to heal a country we no longer fear?
Just the barest hint by Mr. Yeltsin that some Americans might have been held as prisoners of war in Russia, prompted calls in Congress to hold up any Russian aid until this mystery is sorted out.
Mr. Yeltsin was clearly frustrated by this attitude that American aid to Russia is a luxury, that can seemingly be held up by any whim, not a necessity in order to stabilize one of the biggest countries on earth.
He told Congress: "Some of you who have just risen here to applaud me have also written in the press that until Yeltsin gets things done and gets all the jobs done, there should be no Freedom Support Act passing through the Congress. Well, I don't really quite understand you, ladies and gentlemen. Yeltsin has already opened the archives, and is inviting you to join us in investigating the fate of each and every unaccounted American. I don't quite understand you."

After a month of hard-nosed bargaining and political posturing, White House and Congressional negotiators agreed today on a $1.3 billion urban aid package including loans and grants for summer jobs for youths and disaster relief for people whose homes and businesses were destroyed in the Los Angeles riots.
The compromise fell far short of what the nation's big-city mayors and some Democratic lawmakers were seeking, and it also excluded law-enforcement and investment programs that President Bush wanted passed quickly in the aftermath of the riots. 
 "It's not sufficient from our viewpoint," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader and chief Congressional negotiator on the aid package. "But it's something we need to get done now. We need to move forward. I think we'll get it passed in both houses, hopefully tomorrow."
 
Break in the Logjam
 Congressional leaders said they hoped that the agreement would mark the beginning of further negotiations to come up with a plan of tax relief and other benefits to businesses willing to locate in the inner cities.
"This action means that the logjam is finally breaking," said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, who has led the fight in the Senate for more urban aid.
Putting a positive interpretation on a compromise package that excluded more than $800 million in money for Head Start and other summer youth programs he had sought, Mr. Kennedy added, "It is gratifying that Congress and the Administration are also making progress on a further aid package with substantial additional funds for communities with the greatest need."
The compromise roughly split the difference between a House bill providing $822 million in grants and loans to Los Angeles and Chicago, which Mr. Bush supported, and a Senate bill that would have provided an additional $1.5 billion to 75 cities, which Mr. Bush said was too costly. A House-Senate conference committee agreed on a version that came close to the Senate language, but the White House threatened a veto.
 
Factions in Administration
 Today's agreement also served as a compromise between two wings of the Administration: one led by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, which did not want to give an inch to Democratic lawmakers, and the other led by Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp, which wanted to grant substantially more aid.
The package must still be passed by both the House and Senate and signed by Mr. Bush. And even then, a Presidential declaration of a budgetary emergency is required to allow the money to flow. The money would come outside current budget limits by adding to the Federal deficit.
The package includes all the grants and loans to rebuild homes and businesses destroyed in the Los Angeles riots as well as property damaged in an early April flood in downtown Chicago that were in the House bill, and it adds $500 million for summer jobs around the country. The money would allow 360,000 youths to be put to work in various Federal programs, double the number under current ones, Mr. Kennedy said.
An aide to Mr. Gephardt said Democrats had been eager to make a deal with the White House because "the summer youth program is very time sensitive."
But by cutting off the negotiations now, the Democrats conceded several other summer programs they sorely wanted. Among them were an additional $175 million for summer jobs, $250 million more for summer Head Start programs and $250 million for summer school programs for disadvantaged elementary and secondary school students.
The Administration, in turn, sacrificed $250 million that the Democrats were willing to include for its new "weed and seed" program in which SWAT teams and specially trained police officers would rid neighborhoods of gangs and drug dealers to provide security as new educational and other social programs are instituted.
 
Pressure on Bush
 The monthlong negotiations ran into snags on several occasions, with Democrats and the White House adding new conditions. The fact that the majority of Americans have given Mr. Bush low marks on domestic policy and stewardship of the economy has never been far from the minds of those in the White House in this election year.
There is still an outside chance of more setbacks. Normally, such a compromise agreement would win easy passage, but this one could be blocked by an unusual, de facto coalition of rural-state lawmakers who contend it is too generous and urban-state lawmakers who want more aid.
 
The Perot Factor
 In recent days, Democratic and Republican strategists said they worried that the public would punish both parties if they could not agree to some urban aid package. The shadow of Ross Perot's Presidential candidacy seemed to impel both sides to reach an arrangement.
"It was nothing as climatic as a handshake at the table," the Gephardt aide said, adding that the next phase of negotiations would focus on the program for tax breaks for new inner-city businesses. Democrats hope to link various investment incentives to the cuts in the capital gains tax that the Administration wants to grant to businesses willing to risk locating in impoverished city neighborhoods.
Mr. Gephardt said one area in which the negotiators could not agree was the allotment of "weed and seed" money. The Administration wanted 80 percent of the money to go to law enforcement, and 20 percent to the social programs, he said, while the Democrats favored the reverse.
Mr. Gephardt said he thought that the two sides would eventually come to an agreement on the program.

HEADLINE: City's Survivors, With a Diploma to Prove It

SERIES: Into Uncertainty: The Class of '92 -- Last of three articles.

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
Falasha Spruiell and Charisse Lenoir wearily circled the graffiti-covered high school track, sweating and breathing heavily. The track season was winding down, like high school itself. Only the championships remained -- and graduation.
For Ms. Spruiell and Ms. Lenoir, seniors at Boys and Girls High in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, the long, precarious obstacle course through inner-city adolescence was over. And they had made it. 
 Still, their sense of achievement -- their success when so many around them have failed -- has brought on the realization that they have won one race only to begin another.
"If you think about it, it doesn't really end," said Ms. Spruiell, whose speed on the track has several universities recruiting her. "I've just started, and I have to start at the bottom and work my way up again."
Then she shrugged, as she must have shrugged when she entered high school four years ago, and they began running again.
In a neighborhood where the streets constantly conspire against success, Ms. Spruiell, Ms. Lenoir and the 420 other graduating seniors at Boys and Girls are the survivors. They have resisted the temptations, avoided the violence, heeded the pressure to stay in school when the "in crowd" drops out.
Now, as the final days of high school hurtle toward graduation next Thursday, the seniors at Boys and Girls are preparing for that ritual leap out of childhood with a mix of cool confidence and hard-edged realism.
They have grown up with less, and fought off much more, than their counterparts in less perilous communities. And while they know their futures will be fraught with obstacles -- a weak economy, a faltering job market and a society they feel offers dim prospects for young blacks from the inner city -- they seem less daunted by them, if only because they have already made it this far.
"They've overcome so many major things," said Gary Keenan, the senior class's adviser. "They've seen their friends blown away. They've seen their friends have babies. They've seen their friends drop out. At this point a slowdown in the economy is a pretty minor thing to overcome."
 
'I Want to Make It'
 Errol Roy, a lanky senior who sings gospel, clears almost 40 feet in the triple jump and plans to leave for the University of Florida the day after graduation, said many people he started out with didn't make it.
"They're either selling drugs, on drugs or dead," he said. "I have a lot of friends who say, 'Go this way,' or, 'Go that way. But I say, 'No, I'm going to go home.' I want to make it."
With unemployment for 16- to 19-year-olds in New York City running at nearly 17 percent, and nearly double that in Bedford-Stuyvesant, the seniors say they realize that few opportunities exist without college. Nearly 80 percent of those who have made it to graduation plan to attend college this fall -- roughly average for the city's public high schools.
"Your best bet is going to college," said Porsha Cohen, who lives in the Roosevelt Houses, a public-housing project where the crackle of gunfire sometimes interrupts her late-night studying. "Trying to get an entry-level job is impossible. They're either unavailable or inaccessible. Where does that leave a high school student with just a diploma?"
 
'All-American Kids'
 Like seniors everywhere, they have the irrepressible dreams of teen-agers. Generaldo Scott, who belongs to a church drama troupe called the Creationists that performs works about young people who succumb to drugs and violence, wants to be a talk show host (somewhere between Arsenio Hall and Oprah Winfrey). Angela Simon wants to be a photographer. Charzetta Payden wants to write for teen magazines. Sabrina Knox just wants to get away from New York.
Rashida Rahim, an honors student and cheerleader, plans to study business management at Pace University, or maybe Baruch College. She wants to own a laundry. She'll need $100,000 to get started, she said, maybe through loans. Not to worry -- she has it all figured out. "I'm going to make it," she said.
"If you look at my kids," the school's principal, Frank N. Mickens, said, "they're all-American kids. They're like kids all over the country, their aspirations, their enthusiasm. But they're tough. They know what's going on around them."
Only 36 percent of the students at Boys and Girls graduate on time, slightly lower than the city average. To make it through school, Mr. Mickens said, they have to be determined. To make it in the world, they will have to be better than everybody else -- because they are black, because they are from Bed-Stuy.
"That's not fair, but they understand that," he said. "It's like the same things said to me, what, 27 years ago."
 
Importance of Self-Esteem
 Many seniors credited their success, and their optimism, to the sense of pride Mr. Mickens and the teachers at Boys and Girls have nurtured. In a city where public schools are not always immune to the deterioration around them, these students described the modern, boxy school on Fulton Street as an oasis where the violence of the streets never breached the heavily guarded doors.
In the clean, shiny hallways, banners and posters extol self-esteem, which the students say is vital to resisting failure's incessant tug. "Respect yourself," one poster demands. "NO shorts, spandex, sleeveless shirts, tank tops, culottes, see-through blouses, cut jeans."
Mr. Mickens, who carries a walkie-talkie and at times a hammer as a symbol of his tough approach, has imposed a strict set of rules -- everything from not wearing gold teeth or hanging out in the hallways to wearing ties on Fridays and trying to earn the honor of a Regents Diploma (there will be 50 this year).
In a school where most students come from families headed by single mothers, many of them unemployed or on welfare, Mr. Mickens has become a kind of surrogate father or grandfather, whom many students said they would miss the minute the final bell rang.
"He's on our backs," said Antoinette Haynes, who plans to go to a community college until she can raise the money to go to Cheney State College in Pennsylvania to study education. "I don't know if we're going to get that kind of attention in college."
As she sat on a stool at Pat's Kitchen, a Caribbean restaurant on Fulton Street where many students hang out after school, Tanisha Yates said she needed that kind of support to withstand the pressures to give up.
"Growing up in the neighborhood is really hard for someone going to high school," she said. "There's a lot of drugs and shootings and robberies. A lot of my friends got pregnant and dropped out."
For Ms. Yates, who plans to attend Columbus College in Georgia next fall, the pressures were almost too much. She is an only child whose mother is on welfare. In junior high school, she ran into a lot of trouble. "I used to fight a lot," she said. "I got suspended a lot." She doesn't know why; she was angry, frustrated.
Things improved when she moved in with her grandmother and started going to Boys and Girls -- two events that imposed new order on her young tumultuous life. She studied hard, joined the dance squad and the softball team, became a cheerleader and worked during her school breaks.
She has made it, she said, by sticking with "a certain crowd" who avoided trouble the way most seniors avoid homework at this time of year. "If I finish school," she said, "then I think I have a great future."
 
'It's Your Choice'
 The restaurant's owner, Patricia Wiggins, said she had seen a lot of students like Ms. Yates pass through -- some going somewhere, some going nowhere. "I tell them, 'Hanging out here isn't going to get you anywhere,' " said Ms. Wiggins, who is popular with students who come to order roti, oxtail stew, rice and beans, but mostly burgers. "I tell them to go to college, because there's nothing out here for them."
As they do at every school, the seniors fell into cliques over the years: football cliques, fashion cliques, student-government cliques. There were other, more insidious cliques that most of those who will graduate managed to avoid.
"If you come with your mind made up, you'll get out," Ms. Haynes said. "Just like if you have your mind made up to kill someone, you can do it. It's your choice to choose the right one."
But the pressures always remain. One in three of the girls who graduate on June 25 will graduate as mothers, Mr. Keenan said. And the graduating seniors talked about not dropping out as if they were still trying to convince themselves to stay in -- with only two weeks to go. While most of their close friends will graduate, they all know more who dropped out along the way.
 
Aiming High
 Now, as graduation approaches, the seniors are busy with the usual senior things: finals, the prom and caps and gowns, looking for summer jobs, skipping classes and having fun.
Ms. Spruiell, the state indoor champion in the 600 meters, has been cramming to take the Scholastic Aptitude Test again. She scored a combined 680 the first time -- 20 points below what she needs to qualify for the athletic scholarships that Arizona, Kentucky and Seton Hall have offered her. "Math," she said.
She wants to pursue a master's degree, then a doctorate, in business or school administration. She wants to run in the Olympics in 1996. Her coach, Loraine Tummings, says she has a shot, if she puts her mind to it.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN WASHINGTON;
Russia Is Given Most-Favored Status

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin flung open the door today to increased trade and investment, signing a package of commercial agreements that brush aside barricades put up during the cold war to block commerce between the United States and Russia.
In a major trade development, the United States granted Russia most-favored-nation status in trade relations for the first time in more than four decades, giving it the same low tariffs that it gives other friendly nations. 
 Other agreements signed today set liberal new rules for American investment in Russia, expand the amount of credit available for American exports to Russia and provide risk insurance for American investments there.
"Today is really a turning point in U.S.-Russian commercial relations," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International. "It puts an end to 40 years of cold-war restrictions on trade and comerce."
 
Plans for a Hotel
 American and Russian officials said that with today's agreements, the United States and Russia have gone far to replace their frosty commercial relations with warmer ones. Indeed, Commerce Secretary Barbara Franklin said her goal was for the United States to become Russia's largest trading partner.
The accords technically only relate to the United States and Russia. But it is expected in coming months that similar pacts will be worked out with the other former Soviet republics that want them.
"There are plenty of investment opportunities all around the world where things are more settled, but I think what happened today will open the gates to investment in Russia," said Curtis L. Carlson, the Minneapolis-based billionaire whose Carlson Companies owns the Radisson Hotel chain.
Saying the agreements would help advance plans to build a hotel in St. Petersburg, Mr. Carlson was one of many executives who said they would speed up contemplated investments in Russia that had long been on hold.
Economists said the agreements would give Russia more of a psychological boost than an actual economic boost over the next few months, but they said that over a year or two, the accord could mean a significant increase in bilateral trade and in American investment in Russia.
Even after the signing of the agreements, American executives said many obstacles remain to investment, including the lack of convertiblity of the ruble, difficulties in buying land, and the absence of a legal structure to govern contracts, private property and other aspects of a market economy.
At a meeting that was called the first United States-Russia Business Summit, Mr. Yeltsin provided an invitation for investment that was far more welcoming than any speech made by Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Mr. Yelstin and his team of economic advisers also vowed to do what was necessary to attract foreign investment, saying that private capital was needed to supplement foreign aid to rebuild Russia.
Speaking to more than 200 leading American and Russian executives, Mr. Yeltsin often sounded like former President Ronald Reagan in hailing free enterprise and calling for scrapping burdensome regulations.
"Having returned to the world economic system, we believe that Russia will become a fast-growing market," said Mr. Yeltsin. "We hope to accommodate foreign investment to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. We have scientific potential, natural resources. We have skilled scientists. We have low wages, measured by world standards. This is a unique combination of factors that provide the opportunity to produce enormous profits."
Under one agreement signed today, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation will greatly reduce the risk for American businesses making investments in Russia by offering insurance that protects American investors against the risk of war, expropriation and difficulties in converting their profits into hard currency.
The president of the corporation, Fred M. Zeder, said American companies had already filed applications for $15 billion in risk insurance for various investments in Russia. He said he did not know what percentage of those projects would be completed.
Another accord greatly expands the ability of the Export-Import Bank to extend loans, loan guarantees and trade insurance to American companies seeking to export to Russia. The Export-Import Bank is negotating with Russian authorities to finance the sale of $1 billion in American oilfield equipment to Russia, as well as $200 million in American equipment for modernizing nuclear power plants and for cleaning up the environment.
A bilateral investment pact signed today sets a framework for American investment in Russia, promises American investors fair treatment, gives them the right to set up offices, and sets up a mechanism for resolving investment disputes.
Not having most-favored-nation status meant that tariffs on Russian goods are 5 to 10 times those on goods from most-favored nations.

Yeltsin Speaks, and Congressional Wall Tumbles

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
With oratory that thrilled even Congressional critics of aid, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia appeared today to have virtually eliminated an important obstacle to passage of an aid program for the former Soviet republics.
After his speech at a joint meeting of Congress interrupted by standing ovations, legislative leaders said they thought that Mr. Yeltsin had persuaded even skeptical lawmakers of his determination to help find missing American servicemen, and had thus won vital votes for the American portion of a $24 billion international assistance package for former Soviet republics. 
 But lawmakers warned that the battle for Congressional approval would ultimately be determined by whether Mr. Yeltsin's visit also overcame wide opposition among their constituents to granting foreign aid at a time when many Americans are unemployed or pessimistic about their future.
Senators and members of the House expressed pleasure and astonishment at Mr. Yeltsin's emotional attack on the evils of Communism, his willingness to reduce his country's nuclear arsenal and his invitation to American officials to inspect the archives of the K.G.B. and Soviet Communist Party for clues to the fate of Americans missing in the Vietnam War.
"None of us expected to see anything in our lifetime like this," said Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip in the House. "Emotionally, how can you abandon a man like this?"
Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, a senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee who has been skeptical about Administration proposals for aiding Russia, said of the speech: "It was as historic a postwar event as the tearing down of the Berlin wall. It will win him votes."
When Mr. Yeltsin arrived this morning on Capitol Hill, the aid he sought was caught in the political gridlock that has paralyzed Congress and the White House for most of the last year.
Most liberals were ready to delay aid to the former Soviet republics until President Bush was willing to free up money for unemployment compensation and aid to the cities. Conservatives were ready to block aid until the Russians provided a full accounting of American servicemen from the Vietnam War who Mr. Yeltsin said may still be alive somewhere in his country.
Legislation now before Congress would grant the Administration authority to spend $610 million for the 12 former Soviet republics, excluding the Baltic republics, in 1992 and 1993. It would also authorize the Administration to augment its contribution to the International Monetary Fund by $12 billion, which would go toward financing long-term projects in the republics.
But the measure awaits floor action in both houses, and 103 Democratic lawmakers have signed a letter linking their votes for the aid effort to Republican support for domestic programs.
Democratic leaders said they thought Mr. Yeltsin had gone a long way to bring liberals along. Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, said he was preparing to bring an aid bill to the Senate floor.
 
Reassurances on Servicemen
 But the Russian leader made the most headway with Republican conservatives who had threatened to stall aid after Mr. Yeltsin disclosed on Monday that some American servicemen captured in Vietnam, Korea and World War II had been transferred to labor camps in the Soviet Union and might still be alive. Mr. Yeltsin sought out Senator John McCain of Arizona, a Republican who was himself a prisoner of war in Vietnam, for a private meeting to persuade him that he was serious about investigating the whereabouts of the missing.
"I'm satisfied with his commitment," Mr. McCain said after the meeting. He dropped his threat to block the aid package, adding, "I have to take his word when he looks me in the eye."

Excerpts From Yeltsin's Speech: 'There Will Be No More Lies'

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a speech to a joint meeting of Congress by President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, who spoke through an interpreter:
It is indeed a great honor for me to address the Congress of the great land of freedom as the first ever over 1,000 years of history of Russia popularly elected President, as a citizen of the great country which has made its choice in favor of liberty and democracy. 
 For many years, our two nations were the two poles, the two opposites. They wanted to make us implacable enemies. That affected the destinies of the world in a most tragic way.
The world was shaken by the storms of confrontation. It was close to exploding, close to perishing beyond salvation.
That evil scenario is becoming a thing of the past. Reason begins to triumph over madness. We have left behind the period when America and Russia looked at each other through gunsights, ready to pull the trigger at any time.
Despite what we saw in the well-known American film "The Day After," it can be said today, tomorrow will be a day of peace, less of fear and more of hope for the happiness of our children. The world can sign in relief. The idol of Communism, which spread everywhere social strife, animosity, and unparalleled brutality, which instilled fear in humanity, has collapsed. It has collapsed never to rise again. I am here to assure you, we will not let it rise again in our land.

 	 	 		. . .	 	You will recall August 1991, when for three days Russia was under the dark cloud of dictatorship. I addressed the Muscovites who were defending the White House of Russia. I addressed all the people of Russia. I addressed them standing on top of the tank whose crew had disobeyed criminal orders.
 
'I Will Not Say Uncle'
 I will be candid with you. At that moment, I feared. But I had no fear for myself. I feared for the future of democracy in Russia and throughout the world. Because I was aware what could happen if we failed to win.
Citizens of Russia upheld their freedom, and did not allow the continuation of the 75 years of nightmare. From this high rostrum I want to express our sincere thanks and gratitude to President Bush and to the American people for their invaluable moral support for the just cause of the people of Russia.

 	 	 		. . .	 	We must carry through unprecedented reforms in the economy, that over the seven decades, has been stripped of all market infrastructure, lay the foundations for democracy, and restore the rule of law in the country that for scores of years was poisoned with political strife and political oppression. Guarantee domestic social and political stability, as well as maintenance of civil peace.
We have no right to fail in this most difficult endeavor, for there will be no second try, as in sports. Our predecessors have used them all up. The reforms must succeed. . . .
Today I am telling you what I tell my fellow countrymen. I will not go back on the reforms. And it is practically impossible to topple Yeltsin in Russia. I am in good health, and I will not say uncle before I make the reforms irreversible. We realize our great responsibility for the success of our changes, not only toward the people of Russia, but also toward the citizens of America, and of the entire world. Today the freedom of America is being upheld in Russia. Should the reforms fail, it will cost hundreds of billions to upset that failure.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Russia has brought its policies toward a number of countries in line with its solemn declarations of the recent years. We have stopped arms deliveries to Afghanistan, where the senseless military adventure has taken thousands of Russians and hundreds of thousands of Afghan lives.
 
'No More Lies'
 With external props removed, the puppet regime collapsed.
We have corrected the well-known imbalances in relations with Cuba. At present that country is one of our Latin American partners. Our commerce with Cuba is based on universally accepted principles and world prices.
It is Russia that once and for all has done away with double standards in foreign policy. We are firmly resolved not to lie any more, either to our negotiating partners, or to the Russia or American or any other people.
There will be no more lies -- ever.
The same applies to biological weapons experiments, and the facts that have been revealed about American prisoners of war, the KAL 007 flight, and many other things. That list could be continued.
The archives of the K.G.B. and the Communist Party Central Committee are being opened. Moreover, we are inviting the cooperation of the United States and other nations to investigate these dark pages.
I promise you that each and every document in each and every archive will be examined in order to investigate the fate of every American unaccounted for. As President of Russia, I assure you that even if one American has been detained in my country, and can still be found, I will find him. I will get him back to his family.

 	 	 		. . .	 	I would like now to conclude my statement with the words from a song by Irving Berlin, an American of Russian descent -- God bless America, to which I add, and Russia.

HEADLINE: Mexicans Mollified Over Drug Ruling

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, June 17

 BODY:
Mexico and the United States backed away from a diplomatic confrontation today when Mexican officials said they had received assurances from Washington that there would be no more kidnappings of criminal suspects from their territory.
In Washington, the Bush Administration continued to avoid any explicit promise to refrain from such kidnappings, while the State Department repeated its pledge to extend "full respect for the sovereign rights and prerogatives" of Mexico. 
 The confrontation arose Monday when the United States Supreme Court asserted the right of the United States to kidnap a criminal suspect from another country, in effect sanctioning the seizure of a Mexican gynecologist in 1990. The Mexico Foreign Ministry angrily criticised the decision and said it would suspend United States drug enforcement activities in Mexico.
Today, declaring that the United States had been responsive to their concerns, Mexican official backed away from their threat to suspend the activities of United States agents and to recall its own drug-control agents from the United States.
Mexican officials also planned to resume talks with the United States on Mexico's demands for changes in a 1978 extradition treaty that would expressly bar the abductions.
"What we set out to do was to very quickly find solutions so that this issue would not become a very long, protracted difficulty or controversy," a senior Mexican official said, "and we did."
Mexican officials said that within hours after notifying the United States Embassy here on Monday that it would suspend the activities of the 39 drug-enforcement agents in Mexico, the Government was contacted by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and other Administration officials.
 
No Sources Named
 The officials would not say from whom they had received the assurances that kidnappings would not occur. But Andres Rozental, the Undersecretary of Foreign Relations in charge of North America, said the assurances had come from "the highest levels" in Washington.
A United States Embassy official said he could not confirm that such an explicit assurance had been given. But he said the thrust of the assurance was that independently of the court decision, policy changes had been made since the abduction to render it unlikely that a similar action could take place.
Like the clash over the kidnapping itself, the quick movement towards its resolution reflected the shifting relations between the United States and Mexico in light of their negotiations for a North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada.
With concern rising about the trade agreement, Mexican stock prices fell sharply again today for the third day.
For months, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has worked to convince Mexicans to put aside their mistrust of the United States and enter into a closer partnership that would increase the flow of foreign investment.
His administration has also tried to reassure critics of Mexico in the United States by cooperating more with Washington on problems like drug trafficking, immigration and the environment.
At the same time, however, Mr. Salinas has tried to remain assertive with the United States to rebut domestic criticism that he has mortgaged the country's independence for economic growth. But as Mexico's quick retreat from confrontation over the Supreme Court decision suggested, Mexican officials are also weighing the political costs they must pay in Washington for a vigorous public defense of Mexican sovereignty.
Mexicans, for the most part, hesitated to defend Humberto Alvarez Machain, the Mexican doctor who was kidnapped in 1990 by bounty hunters hired by agents of the D.E.A. Dr. Alvarez is accused of helping to keep alive a United States agent, Enrique Camarena, during torture in 1985.
Yet as Dr. Alvarez's case passed through the courts, Mexican officials became alarmed that the Administration was claiming a right to kidnap him and others if extradition treaties did not specifically prohibit it. The Supreme Court endorsement of that claim set off angry protests here.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House;
Bush Criticized Over Visit to Recycler

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
Days after President Bush angered participants in the Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro, environmentalists are attacking him again for traveling Thursday to an oil-recycling company that has criticized the Administration's environmental policies.
On the first stop of a three-day campaign trip to California and Texas, Mr. Bush plans to tour Evergreen Oil Company, in Newark, Calif., which has been praised by environmentalists as being on the cutting edge in recycling used motor oil. 
 But environmental organizations asserted today that it was hypocritical of Mr. Bush to visit the company because his Administration has not been an advocate of the oil recycling industry. And they say they are surprised that Evergreen is welcoming Mr. Bush because it played an active role last year in a trade group's lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency on the issue.
Officials of Evergreen said today that they were pleased about the President's visit and the publicity it would bring. But Richard C. Fortuna, executive director of the Hazardous Waste Treatment Council, a group of high-tech companies, of which Evergreen is a member, that sued the E.P.A., called the trip an attempt by Mr. Bush to deflect attention from his environmental record.
"For George Bush to go stand in front of a refinery and preach environmentalism would be like Jimmy Swaggart going before the Vatican and preaching infidelity," Mr. Fortuna said.
 
Dispute Over Lead
 The treatment council was a plaintiff in a suit filed in May in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia that accused the E.P.A. of not properly regulating the burning of used oil. Environmentalists say Administration policies encourage burning the oil, which is less costly than purifying it, and thus give big oil companies that burn an advantage over small companies like Evergreen that recycle.
Environmentalists say companies that burn should be required to remove lead from the oil, which would increase their costs, but produce less pollution.
"While Evergreen is trying to clean up used oil, these other companies use it as a fuel," said Daniel J. Weiss, director of the Sierra Club's environmental quality program. "Because the Bush Administration has opposed regulating the lead content in used oil, Evergreen and other green companies have struggled to expand their businesses. This is another example of George Bush as the hypocrisy President, not the environmental President."
In addition to the lawsuit, an Evergreen official, Peter H. Weiner, criticized the E.P.A. in testimony last year before a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, asserting that "it is time to take the lead out of E.P.A.'s pace in regulating used oil."
 
'Fantastic Press'
 But today, Curtis Morgan, chairman of the 100-employee company near San Jose, sought to play down differences with the Administration.
"This gives fantastic press for us and our industry," Mr. Morgan said. "We couldn't be happier. I don't know what the President's agenda is for coming here, but we're very happy he is."
Pressed on the Bush Administration's policies toward his industry, Mr. Morgan said: "We don't think it's enough, but we think it's a start. Things have been better than they were under the Reagan Administration."
Mr. Morgan said officials planning Mr. Bush's trip were referred to his company by the state Environmental Protection Agency.
Brushing aside the criticism, Torie Clarke, a spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, said: "Some of the environmental groups never miss an opportunity to score a few points. Evergreen happens to be a very good company. They are cleaning up the environment. They are good for the economy. They are on the cutting edge of U.S. industry. And they are very happy to have the President there."
Ms. Clarke said it was "not at all unusual in environmental matters" for companies to take part in suits against the Administration. "These things happen," she said. "It does not take away from the fact that the President is being welcomed."

HEADLINE: Digging Out and Digging In;
Debate Over Dredging Sharpens as Port Channels Deepen in the Kill Van Kull

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER

 BODY:
The Rev. John H. Walsted tiptoed around a clicking seismograph in the sanctuary of his church, Christ Episcopal on Staten Island. Since the blasts began in November, granite blocks have shifted; a fissure opened in the majestic church's north wall; a crack split the belly of the baby Jesus in a stained glass window too precious to replace.
All this, he believes, has rumbled up from work on a waterway 3,500 feet from his 88-year-old church -- part of a dredging project billed as vital to the economy of the New York region. Like most dredging projects, this one is as massive as it is mundane: workers are blasting at the bedrock in the Kill Van Kull and Newark Bay to deepen the shipping channels from 35 to 40 feet. 
 Engineers reject claims that the underwater explosions are damaging the churches and Victorian mansions on Staten Island's north shore. But blasting has emerged as one of several issues focusing unusual attention on dredging, an almost ignored task that keeps the region's waterways deep and clear for commerce.
 
Depth Charges
 Critics have also raised questions about the long-range competitiveness of New York Harbor and whether the current, expensive work will make the channels deep enough to handle any ship that calls. And in a debate echoed in ports around the nation, a second, smaller dredging project proposed for Port Newark and Port Elizabeth is causing concern among environmental groups worried by the recent discovery of dioxin, a toxic chemical, there.
But few people oppose the dredging itself, which keeps alive a port industry responsible for 180,800 jobs and $17.7 billion each year to the region's economy.
"In New York, our port was God-given," said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University. "Now we have to supplement God's generosity with our own ingenuity."
This is true for two reasons.
The first is nature: without dredging, silt flowing from the Passaic, Hackensack, Hudson and East Rivers would settle in the channels and slowly choke off sea lanes to a depth of 18 or 19 feet.
The second is competition: ships have grown larger and need deeper water. And in an atmosphere of increased competition among the ports on the East Coast -- where New York still remains the largest by far -- the deepest ports generally attract the most business.
"If ocean carriers lose confidence in our ability to adequately maintain our facility, they may divert their operations -- and that is something we never wish to see happen," said Lillian C. Liburdi, director of the port department of the Port Authority.
The $350 million dredging project was authorized by the Water Resources Development Act of 1986, which provides 65 percent Federal financing for such projects. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is paying the remaining 35 percent, and the Army Corps of Engineers, which disburses the Federal funds, has designed the project and is overseeing its execution.
The most immediate worry has come from the New Brighton and St. George sections of Staten Island, where residents complained of minor damage, most commonly dishes falling or cracks in walls.
Charles Joseph, a dentist on Westervelt Avenue, said that his two X-ray machines were out of commission for three days this spring after the shock waves broke the machines' control board.
Linda Bolesta, a 32-year-old Staten Island resident, has felt her 108-year-old house shudder half a dozen times a day and has found snaking cracks in her walls and in a new concrete floor in her cellar.
And Father Walsted looks nervously at the damage to his church and at its five Tiffany windows, valued at $4 million, recently restored and even more recently plagued with tiny cracks.
The Army Corps of Engineers contends that the blasting is not to blame and has stationed seismographs around the church and in homes in the area. The results, officials say, show no hint that the explosions are the problem.
But just to be sure, the Corps last month reduced by a quarter the amount of liquid explosives used in each blast and dug a trench in the Arthur Kill to absorb shocks.
Less dramatic, but more important for the port's long-term competitiveness, are worries that the dredgers are not going deep enough into the diamond-hard bedrock of the Kill Van Kull and Newark Bay.
There is no question that the channels to Port Newark and Port Elizabeth, the area's main container ports, are now too shallow. The channels are rated at only 35 feet, and some companies already face problems.
One is Naporano Iron and Metal Company, among the largest scrap-metal dealers in New Jersey. The company's co-owner, Andrew Naporano Jr., said that some ships, carrying cargo bound for points around the world, have had to wait until high tide to load and leave the piers in Newark.
"As soon as the tide comes in we have to go like crazy, and God forbid there is a breakdown," Mr. Naporano said. "It's like the clipper ships of old: sail with the tide."
 
10 Feet of Competitive Edge
 Some transportation experts question the decision by the Port Authority to dredge the channel to 40 feet, to be completed by 1994, when New York's main competitors on the East Coast, Norfolk and Baltimore, have already dredged to 50 feet.
Some worry that New York would still be behind even at 45 feet, a depth authorized in the Federal legislation that created the project, though the money has not been appropriated.
"The point is, we are always apparently going to be 5 feet short and 10 years late," said Jerrold Nadler, a New York State Assemblyman who advocates building a huge container port in Brooklyn, a project the Port Authority calls expensive and unfeasible.
Port Authority officials dismiss criticism that the dredging is too shallow, saying the port is used primarily by ships loaded with containers, the 40-foot aluminum boxes that revolutionized the shipping industry three decades ago. And at least for now, experts agree, most of those ships have drafts of 40 feet or less, though some of the newer ships need as much as an additional 5 feet.
There are, however, ships with much deeper drafts that carry bulk cargo like oil and coal, goods that Mr. Bea and others argue are less important to New York than at other ports.
If arguments about the channels' ideal depth sound theoretical, a more immediate issue is how to dispose of silt that is contaminated.
Dioxin has been found along 7 miles of berths at Port Elizabeth and Port Newark, which the authority wants to dredge this summer. They have applied for a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers to dump 600,000 cubic yards of the silt six miles off Sandy Hook, N.J. The project would last three years.
The authority's experts say the amount of dioxin is so small that it is like measuring molecules. And in any case, they intend to cover the material with clean fill to keep it from seeping into the ocean.
But opponents, environmental groups, fishers and some New Jersey politicians, say the dioxin can still work its way up the food chain.
They also say there is an even larger environmental issue: They accuse the authority of not looking at more progressive ways to treat the dredged material before it is dumped and want them to explore decontamination techniques.
"This region needs very much to bring new solutions to dredge material containment than simply moving it from part of the marine environment to another," said Sarah L. Clark, a staff scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund.
But decontamination, a process that uses a number of different technologies and is still in its infancy, costs money, and could raise the price of dumping the silt from $5 to hundreds of dollars per cubic yard. That rise could have a broad impact on dredging projects, given that each year roughly 6 million cubic yards of silt, clay and rock are dredged from the harbor -- enough to fill three towers of the World Trade Center.
"If you change any aspect of what the normal operation is, you could increase the costs," said John F. Tavolaro, the Army Corps's assistant chief of operations. "To what magnitude is uncertain."

HEADLINE: Nimby and Economics Kill Plans for Wood-Powered Plant

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORRINGTON, Conn.

 BODY:
Here in this northwestern Connecticut city surrounded by the forested foothills of the Berkshires, a plan to build a wood-fired power plant might seem as natural as throwing a few more logs on the fireplace.
But residents, fearing that such a plant would cause air pollution, successfully fought plans to build it in what many here viewed as a struggle between a grass-roots movement and an outside developer. 
 The demise of the project, however, had just as much to do with changes in the economics of producing electricity, which undermined a state-sponsored alternative-energy program born in the oil-panicked 1980's.
Since the Torrington project was conceived, prices for oil have dropped and the demand for electricity has fallen far short of what was expected. As a result, there is little incentive to shift to alternative fuels.
So, under a bill passed by the General Assembly, the developer will be bought out as part of an $18 million package. And consumers will pay for the buyout through higher electric bills.

 
Developer Buyout
 The story of the Torrington plant began six years ago, when the developer, Kenetech Energy Systems, through a subsidiary called Bio-Gen, proposed a wood-burning power plant on land in a sparsely populated northern section of the city. Concerns about air pollution led the city to fight the project, but it seemed as if it would be going ahead this April when the City Council agreed to drop its opposition in exchange for $450,000 from the company to cover the city's legal costs.
After hearing about the deal, about 500 angry Torrington citizens, led by Ralph Nader, who grew up in nearby Winsted, marched on City Hall. Eventually the City Council agreed to hold a referendum on whether Torrington should continue to spend money to fight the project. In the referendum, held late last month, the voters said yes -- by a ratio of more than 10 to 1.
In the meantime, the utility company that was to have purchased power from the plant was losing interest. Electrical consumption is down in Connecticut and elsewhere in the region, mainly because the recession has closed businesses and factories or pushed them to relocate.
So the state devised an agreement that would more than repay Bio-Gen for its investment, out of which the company would repay Torrington for its legal fees incurred in the opposition battle. Another developer with a similar proposal in Killingly, a town near the Rhode Island border, would also be bought out under the same legislation. The agreement was approved by the Legislature earlier this month, and Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. is expected to sign the bill within a few weeks.
"We're just very happy we're getting our money and they're gone," said Torrington's Mayor, Delia R. Donne, who took office the year the plant was proposed. "Nobody wants anything in their backyard."
 
Based on Predictions
 State regulatory officials and a spokesman for the power company, Northeast Utilities, admit that a project like the Bio-Gen plant, which seemed like a bright idea in 1986, had become an expensive albatross by this year. Many proposed projects were predicated on the notion that oil prices would keep rising when, in fact, they have fallen to about $15 a barrel today from $35 a barrel in 1985.
At least 25 other power plants, which provide about 10 percent of the electricity used by Northeast's customers, were built under the state program, which began under Federal encouragement after oil prices shot up during the 1970's. About 60 percent of Northeast's power comes from nuclear plants, and another 20 percent from oil. The last 10 percent is generated by company-owned coal-burning, hydroelectric or natural gas plants, said a spokesman, Jeffrey Kotkin.
When economic analysts predicted that Connecticut's dependence on oil would mean horrifically expensive electricity, the State Department of Public Utility Control ordered power companies to sign agreements with suppliers that did not use oil, Mr. Kotkin said.
Those contracts will be lucrative for the next 20 to 30 years for the developers, who receive far more per kilowatt hour than the utility spends on oil-fired plants, Mr. Kotkin said. They are paid 9 cents per kilowatt hour, compared with the 3 1/2 cents that it costs the utility for the other plants, he said, and the price is to rise over the course of the contracts. "The idea was to create a more diverse fuel mix," he said. "But none of them are economically beneficial."
Similarly, a New York State law passed to encourage co-generation, or production of electricity and the use of steam, guarantees generators 6 cents per kilowatt-hour, but utilities say they can make their own power for 3 cents. Richard M. Flynn, the chairman of the New York Power Authority, estimates that over the next 10 years, New York customers may pay $4.5 billion to $5 billion in extra costs because of the provision, which Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is seeking to repeal.
 
Alternative-Energy Plans
 In Connecticut, developers leaped on the alternative-energy plan, and about 30 projects were proposed, including the two wood-burning projects.
William R. Breetz, a Hartford lawyer who represents Bio-Gen, expressed amazement that the project had been so controversial. "A lot of the fear grows out of the evidence that wood smoke by itself is not good to have around you," he said. But he called that "the great irony," noting that emission controls have advanced to the point where the threat of pollution is minimal.
A chief opponent of the project, Steven H. Levy, said the location of the plant, in a valley, would have made the smoke linger around Torrington. "As far as health risks are concerned," said Mr. Levy, who is the treasurer of a group called Citizens Against Pollution, "although nuclear power has risks in an explosion, this has health risks associated with it 365 days a year."
Another opponent, Karen LaRocco, said, "Everybody kept saying there's no way you can fight City Hall, no way you can fight Bio-Gen; it's a done deal." The referendum proved the opposite, she said.
As for the long-term effect on the consumer, Mr. Kotkin said costs will be lower than they would have been if the wood-fired plants had been built. "If these projects actually went through, customer bills between 1994 and 2019 would be $150 million higher," he said. "Public opposition didn't play into our decision at all. Our concern was a financial one."
Mr. Breetz, the Bio-Gen lawyer, disagreed.
"I think public hysteria is a fair description of what has happened," he said, "not only with our project but with a great number of projects. I got a call the other night from a group that wanted to retain our firm to fight a bandstand being proposed in a public park. What we've reached in this country is a sense that people have a right to the absence of change."

HEADLINE: S.& L.'s Earnings Rebound; Outlook Is Less Optimistic

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
Profits at the nation's savings and loan associations rebounded in the first three months of the year, to $1.59 billion, the best performance in six years, the Government said today. Nevertheless, the Congressional Budget Office and private analysts offered lawmakers a less optimistic view of the future of the industry.
Earnings at the healthy portion of the industry, the 2,064 institutions that remain in private hands, more than doubled from $610 million a year ago, the Office of Thrift Supervision said, with 93 percent of the institutions reporting earnings. 
 As for the agency's expected-to-fail list, the office said that after seizing 711 institutions since 1989, only 37 remain to be taken over. In the agency's second-worst category, institutions not in immediate risk, 24 were still a subject of particular concern, the office said.
 
650 New Failures Seen
 But Robert D. Reischauer, the budget office director, told the lawmakers that as many as 650 savings and loans might yet fail, adding that many experts feel the industry could not be declared fully healthy until real estate markets recover.
"The cleanup of the thrift crisis is not over," Mr. Reischauer told the committee. "Thrifts are still not as profitable as they once were."
But he said the data on the industry "provide room for guarded optimism about its long-term viability, albeit as a much smaller player."
The two primary reasons for the recent improvement, the thrift office said, are the Government's seizures of insolvent savings and loans since 1989 and current interest-rate conditions -- the most favorable for financial institutions since the 1970's.
But the office sharply revised the industry's earnings for all of last year, to $1.83 billion, down from an earlier estimate of $2 billion.
Private analysts cautioned against an overly optimistic reading of the improved earnings report.
"From a taxpayer's perspective, the fact that 90 percent of the industry is doing well is secondary to how the worst 5 or 10 percent are doing because that's where the threat lies," said Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va.
In particular, one or more large savings and loans in California are in danger of failing, he said.
 
Election Politics Cited
 Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, the chairman of the Senate panel, and other Congressional Democrats have questioned whether the Bush Administration is trying to keep a lid on bad banking and savings industry news until after the election.
Kenneth H. Thomas, a bank and savings and loan analyst in Miami, said the Federal agency might be understating its count of likely failures by 50 percent.
The worst institutions will also probably continue to pile up losses because the Government cannot afford to close them. Regulators have spent $88 billion on failed savings and loans since 1989; the Administration estimates it needs as much as $42 billion more.
 
Bailout Money on Hold
 But Congress let the spending authority of the bailout agency, the Resolution Trust Corporation, lapse on April 1 and election-year pressures may prevent lawmakers from voting for more money before next spring.
"Things can only get worse in those problem institutions and that hurts everybody," Mr. Ely said. "They contaminate the market."

HEADLINE: Economic Memo;
The Tea Leaves Are Ready

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
With the American economy about to wrap up its fifth straight quarter of expansion, the economic priests who consecrate the beginnings and ends of business cycles are likely to convene sometime this summer to declare the nation's ninth postwar recession officially over.
Many economists believe the dating committee will declare recovery to have begun as long ago as the spring of 1991. But it is only now that the evidence of sustained upturn can be said to look persuasive enough to invite confident declaration. 
 Statistical and anecdotal evidence is mounting almost daily that the recovery is gathering momentum -- although unevenly -- dispelling fears that the flameout that took place during the second half of 1991 will reoccur.
 
Reluctant Consumers
 Those fears have centered on reticent consumers, who account for two-thirds of the economy. They have become more tight-fisted in recent months after an early-year spending spree. In May, for example, retail sales rose only two-tenths of 1 percent.
But consumer confidence polls reflect consumers' expectations of brighter prospects for income and employment. A recent one by Sindlinger & Company, for example, shows household confidence rising for the fourth time in a row last week.
The possibility of relapse is also diminished by Government reports on Tuesday that construction of new housing, which had shown signs of faltering after setting the recovery's early pace, rebounded in May while industrial output posted its fourth straight solid advance.
Two more pieces of optimistic evidence emerged today in surveys by the Federal Reserve and the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation.
Dun & Bradstreet found business expectations for increased sales to be the highest in three years, embracing every major industry. "The economic recovery is now firmly reflected in business order books, leading to improved business confidence," said Joseph W. Duncan, the company's chief economist.
The Federal Reserve's "beige book" -- the survey of economic activity it puts together every six weeks to aid in its policy deliberations -- was also quite bullish. It said that "economic activity continues to improve," and that manufacturing appeared to strengthen in all 12 Fed districts.
Although economists tend to dismiss this survey as merely anecdotal, the widespread nature of the improvement did impress some, as did the Fed's finding that long-depressed loan demand seems to be increasing in most districts.
And the Fed's survey was consistent with comments by corporate executives in interviews today.
"Business is starting to turn up for us," said Norman Katz, head of Qual Craft Industries, a producer of scaffolding brackets and ladder jacks in Stoughton, Mass., outside Boston. "Our order books are filled," he added, noting that he had recently hired four more workers and raised wages for the first time in nearly two years.
In Kent, Ohio, Gougler Industries reported brisker business for plastics used in bathroom fixtures and for air hammers for the mining and construction industries. The company, with sales of $20 million a year, has recalled 10 of 15 laid-off production workers in the last two weeks.
Larry Wittensoldner, the company's controller, said he remained cautious -- partly because of the Presidential election campaign -- and was not yet building inventory. But he noted that conditions were clearly improving. "We're on the rise," he said.
Economists expect manufacturers to do increasingly well, benefiting from an economy with generally lean stocks of goods that mean stepped-up demand will quickly translate into new orders. Prospects for export business, which provided early support for the fledgling recovery, may be fading, however, as overseas economies slow.
Last week's report of one-tenth of 1 percent consumer inflation for May was mostly reassuring, indicating that consumers would retain buying power and suggesting that the Fed would not need to raise interest rates anytime soon. But it also pointed to what many experts regard as the most ominous of the various clouds remaining clouds on the economic horizon.
This is the extraordinary slow growth in the M-2 money supply -- currency, checking accounts, savings accounts and money market mutual funds -- which historically has shown a strong correlation with national output.
 
Worried About Lag
 Although some analysts offer benign explanations for this phenomenon, senior Administration officials are known to be worried that this lag reflects underlying economic weakness. This worry, especially when combined with the political imperatives of the Presidential election, suggests an intensifying campaign to urge the Federal Reserve to insure against a fresh downturn by once again cutting interest rates.
Some Federal Reserve officials, however, are wary that further monetary easing would raise long-term rates by fanning the embers of inflation.
But for now the eyes are mainly on the performance of the economy, and on the National Bureau of Economic Research, the private body that has been designated the official arbiter of business contractions and expansions. The bureau determined that the economy slipped into recession in July 1990 and now is watching eagerly to mark the recession's end and the simultaneous beginning of recovery. The seven members of the dating committee, all academics and scattered around the country, are governed not by the number of quarters of growth in domestic product but with four more specific indicators -- employment, production, income and sales.
In a speech last week assessing the recovery, Susan M. Phillips, a Fed governor, said "No one can forecast with confidence exactly when the positives in the outlook will completely outweigh the remaining negatives" and the possibility of setback cannot be dismissed. "But, that said, there are clearly reasons to be encouraged about both the longer-run and near-term prospects."

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN WASHINGTON: Reporter's Notebook;
The 'Burly' Yeltsin Acquires a New Kind of Stature: Major World Figure

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
A mere two days in Washington, and Boris N. Yeltsin already has some Americans muttering, "Mikhail who?"
This Russian-American summit meeting has in many ways been Mr. Yeltsin's cotillion -- his debut as a world leader -- and in the minds of many here he has demonstrated that he knows all the steps mastered by the President of the old Soviet Union, Mikhail S. Gorbachev. In the process, he seems to have gained a purchase on the title that Mr. Gorbachev inherited, but which Mr. Yeltsin has had to earn through hard labor: that of a global figure. 
 Mr. Yeltsin came to town with a lingering reputation as a rough-hewn politician, his name usually preceded by the adjective "burly," his past strewn with rumors of heavy drinking and disappearances at odd times. When he first visited the United States, in 1989, his Soviet rivals circulated stories that he lost a bout with a bottle of Jack Daniels during an overnight stop at Johns Hopkins University. Some White House officials regarded him with ill-concealed derision.
But Mr. Yeltsin now seems to have dispatched all that. Unlike Mr. Gorbachev, a somewhat pedantic leader whose style was to lecture his audiences, often for hours, the Russian President is more a kindred spirit of the lawmakers he wowed today in an address to a joint meeting of Congress: down-home, always ready with a sound bite. Something of a horse-trader. Shrewd.
That image is both genuine and cultivated, for Mr. Yeltsin is picking up some tricks from his new friends in the arts of politics and public relations, American style.
Before leaving Moscow, an American senator said today, Mr. Yeltsin was given a present by the United States Ambassador to Russia, Robert S. Strauss, to help him prepare for his speech to Congress. It was a videotape recording of an earlier address to the House and Senate by Vaclav Havel, the Czechoslovakian playwright who rose from political imprisonment to the presidency of his country in a matter of weeks after the fall of Communist rule there.
Mr. Havel's speech caused a sensation; Mr. Yeltsin, needing a powerhouse performance to win Congres's approval of economic aid for his country, topped him. Senator Al Gore, a Tennessee Democrat, called Mr. Yeltsin's remarks "classic oratory -- a piece de resistance." Representative Jerry Lewis, a California Republican, said, "He had everyone in the palm of his hand."
"We understood exactly what he was trying to say," Mr. Lewis said. "He was a politican talking to other politicians."
Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Bush both seemed to grasp the fact today that the Russian leader had escaped the long shadow of Mr. Gorbachev, a man who had mesmerized average Americans and their Presidents alike with his flirtations with democratic rule and his frantic dance atop the Soviet power pyramid.
Asked at a news conference why reports had remained secret so long about the possibility of American prisoners of war being held inside Russia, Mr. Yeltsin replied smartly: "You have had a chance to ask the question of the former President of the former Soviet Union why he kept this a secret. I am not responsible for
And Mr. Bush, significantly, interjected, "Good answer."
 
Shipmates of State
 Beyond the George-and-Boris routine, beneath the flowery toasts and heartfelt pledges of eternal alliance, there is one sure-fire sign that Mr. Bush has also elevated Mr. Yeltsin to his A-list of world leaders. He is taking him out on boats.
Mr. Bush, who competes with John F. Kennedy as our most hydrophilic President, always lures his favorite world leaders, or at least the ones he wants most to impress, out on the water. He squires best-friend Brian Mulroney, Canada's Prime Minister, on high-speed chases around Maine's seacoast in his Cigarette boat, Fidelity. He took another favorite, former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan, for a more sedate cruise in Fidelity to view the regional wildlife. Unable to find a speedboat for his 1990 summit meeting with Mr. Gorbachev off the Mediterranean island of Malta, the President insisted that both men anchor off the isle in ships.
President Francois Mitterrand of France, not a favorite of Mr. Bush but a needed ally nonetheless, refused the President's entreaties to go to sea. Mal de mer, he said.
The first time Mr. Yeltsin came to Washington as Russia's leader, last February, Mr. Bush rewarded him with a few hours at the Presidential retreat in Camp David, Md. But today, his alliance with the Russian leader sealed and delivered, the President took Mr. Yeltsin by helicopter to nearby Annapolis and sailed with him for an hour and a quarter on the picturesque Severn River.
Alas, his 80-mile-per-hour Fidelity was moored in Maine. The two leaders putted sedately upriver in a converted PT boat once seized from drug dealers and now owned by the Chief of Naval Operations. Top speed: 14 knots.
 
Footnote on Flight 007

At his news conference with Mr. Bush in the East Room of the White House, Mr. Yeltsin offered a glimpse into the dark world of the former Soviet empire, which his Government is only just starting to unravel.
Asked what information Moscow might have about the downing of the South Korean jumbo jet, KAL Flight 007, in September 1985, Mr. Yeltsin began a cloak-and-dagger tale on the evening of Aug. 20, 1991, as the attempted Kremlin coup was collapsing.
"When it was clear that the coup leaders had lost, we seized the archives of the K.G.B. and the former Central Committee of the Communist Party and we placed armed guards around the building," he said. "But several hours before that, one car from each place had time to remove some of the archives from those two buildings and destroy them. We do not know what was in those archives."
Now, he said, the Russians are trying to trace those missing archives by combing through what is left. In doing so, "we stumbled upon one document which we feel might be the beginning of a chain that might help us to unravel the entire tragedy with the Korean Boeing."
Mr. Yeltsin said the document was "a memorandum from K.G.B. to the Central Committee of the Communist Party" that referred to documents "which would clarify the entire picture."
"The next line then says these documents are so well concealed that it is doubtful that our children will be able to find them," he said.
And that, the Russian President said, "is our task." He promised that as soon as the documents were found, "I will be the first to call President Bush personally and tell him about it."

HEADLINE: U.S. Output Per Hour On the Rise

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
After two years of stagnant sales, relentless belt tightening and waves of white-collar layoffs, the productivity of American businesses is on the rebound.
Output per hour in businesses other than farms grew at a robust annual rate of 2.7 percent last winter, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday. That is the biggest spurt in two years. 
 "It looks as though productivity is picking up widely," said Michael Harper, director of the office of productivity research at the bureau.
Perkier productivity growth -- typical when the economy recovers from recession -- is good for costs, profits and inflation.
"From the point of view of firms, it's very good," said Mark Lasky, an economist at DRI/McGraw Hill.
Higher productivity is helping to ease cost pressures. Unit labor costs, the bureau reported, have been slowing for several quarters and actually fell a bit in the first quarter. Pay has also been rising more slowly.
 
Gains in Service Area
 The productivity surge reflects efficiency gains in the nation's sprawling service economy -- from airlines to banks to retail chains. And some economists saw that as one of the first concrete signs that the far-reaching effort to streamline service companies and the ranks of their white-collar work forces is paying off.
"The bulk of the efficiency improvements were powered by the tremendous improvements in the service sector," said Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley. "Services is starting -- and I stress starting -- to turn the corner."
The process still has a long way to go, executives and economists alike agree. "Technology has moved faster than management has been willing to redeploy people," said Scott G. McNealy, chief executive at Sun Microsystems.
Factory productivity actually slipped at a 1 percent annual rate in the first quarter. But experts shrugged off the dip as a measurement fluke. According to Mr. Harper, manufacturing output fell faster than hours until it hit a trough in January. Even though output improved after that, the depressed January level held down the quarterly average.
"This isn't a sign that the gains in manufacturing have come to an end, absolutely not," Mr. Harper said. "Manufacturing output has gone up sharply since January, and hours haven't gone up as fast."
Several economists saw the productivity spurt as a sign -- if hardly proof -- that the nation's long-run productivity trend may be improving. Productivity has been stagnating -- edging up less than 1 percent a year -- for nearly two decades.
"There's a hint of something more than a cyclical recovery," Mr. Lasky, the DRI economist, said. He thinks the latest report is consistent with DRI's forecast of a slightly better trend for the 1990's -- somewhere between 1 percent and 1.5 percent at an annual rate.
To be sure, there are caveats. Productivity always leaps at the start of recoveries because managers are typically reluctant to hire new hands and instead fill new orders by driving workers harder. And, as always, a single quarter -- subject in any case to future revisions -- does not make a trend.
For workers, the productivity report contains mixed news. On the one hand, business can produce more with fewer hands. Indeed, total hours have declined for eight straight quarters through the winter, and the number of jobs did not climb above last year's levels until last month.
But, in the long run, nothing could be better than a productivity revival. The pace of productivity growth basically determines how quickly living standards -- lately a source of worry for many Americans -- can rise.

HEADLINE: Drought Unites South Africa and Neighbors

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, June 16

 BODY:
Past withered cornfields and sun-cracked river beds, freight trains packed with grain have been rolling across the parched farmland of the Transvaal, carrying relief to South Africa's once hostile northern neighbors.
With southern Africa parched by the worst drought in recent memory, South Africa, with its modern harbors, railway network and highways, has emerged as the region's lifeline for grain imports, even as it struggles with its own drought problems. 
 South Africa, which once ranked behind the United States and Argentina as a grain exporting country, is handling up to 10 million tons of imported grain this year. Of this, over 4.5 million tons of corn and one million tons of other grain will be consumed in South Africa, according to Frans Loots, a spokesman for Agriculture Minister Kraai van Niekirk.
 
Imports for Neighbors
 The other 4.5 million tons of corn are being shipped to Zimbabwe, Zambia and other countries facing dire food shortages. By one estimate, two million million tons of corn are being transported to Zimbabwe and at least 800,000 tons each to Malawi and Zambia. Corn meal forms the dietary staple throughout southern Africa.
The logistics of food distribution were thrashed out at a conference in Pretoria on April 22 and attended by officials from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zamibia, Botswana and Malawi.
The United States has pledged $382 million in food and cash assistance to the southern Africa region to combat the drought. The recipients have not included South Africa, which sold 100,000 tons of its grain to Zimbabwe and Zambia before realizing the extent of its own deficit. Because of the drought, South Africa's food imports are expected to rise by $1.3 billion.
Agriculture Minister van Niekirk said it would cost South Africa $661 million just to import 4.6 million tons of corn, or 70 percent of its domestic requirement, up to next April.
The relief effort has given South Africa the opportunity to display its regional indispensability at a time when it has won new acceptance in Africa because of the steps taken by President F. W. de Klerk to dismantle apartheid.
About half of the grain imported into South Africa is being channeled through Durban, with the rest handled at other ports in Cape Town, East London and Port Elizabeth. Describing the logistics involved, Foreign Minister Roelof F. Botha said moving one million tons of imported food would require 30 large ships, 750 freight trains or 33,000 truckloads.
The magnitude of the supply effort raised fears of congestion on railways and roads unaccustomed to such a volume of traffic, but the initial delays were bureaucratic. South African trucks carrying the first grain into Zimbabwe were held up at the border while Zimbabwean customs officials imposed various taxes and road fees. No such problems have been reported for trains delivering most of the grain.
At the same time, South Africa must cope with its own grain shortage. Its annual grain harvests averaged 7.5 million tons, of which up to two million tons were once exported. This year, agricultural officials have predicted a harvest of 2.3 million tons.
Johan Willemse, an agricultural economist, has described the drought as the worst in 59 years.

HEADLINE: China Signs U.S. Oil Deal for Disputed Waters

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, June 17

 BODY:
In an aggressive move to take control of disputed territory in the South China Sea, the Chinese Government has signed an oil exploration contract with an American company for a stretch of the sea that is also claimed by Vietnam.
The contract marks the first time in many years that any country has acted unilaterally to develop the rich mineral resources in the southern part of the sea, which is the subject of overlapping claims by China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan and Brunei. 
 The last time such a contract was awarded was apparently 1973, when the collapsing Government of South Vietnam gave Western companies oil concessions that included disputed territory. That led to a battle in January 1974 between Chinese and Vietnamese naval forces.
China has pledged that it will use its navy to back the American oil company, and the move seems certain to raise tensions in the area. Vietnam has protested strongly, the Philippines has described the award of the contract as "unhelpful," and other nations are concerned that Beijing now intends to use force to assert its claims.
"There are some indications that China is changing its policy toward disputed areas and taking a more aggressive stance," an Asian diplomat in Beijing said. "But it's still too early to say if this is a turning point."
Randall C. Thompson, chairman of theCrestone Energy Corporation, the Denver-based company that won the contract, said he knew that the area was disputed but had strong backing from China.
"I was assured by top Chinese officials that they will protect me with their full naval might," Mr. Thompson said by telephone. "That's what they told me in negotiations -- that they'll have the entire full naval fleet out there backing me up, if necessary."
Giving the contract to an American company was a canny move by China, because it means that any forceful intervention by Vietnam might harm relations with Washington as well as Beijing. Vietnam has made great efforts in recent years to improve ties with China, and it particularly wants to establish diplomatic and economic relations with the United States.
China claims a huge swath of the South China Sea, extending more than 1,000 miles south of the nearest populated Chinese island. The waters it claims virtually lap against Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines. In 1988, China and Vietnam fought a brief naval battle over the disputed waters.
The area includes the Spratly and Paracel island groups, which China calls the Nansha and Xisha chains. These archipelagos, consisting mostly of uninhabited islands, control fisheries and important international sea lanes and are also thought to contain valuable oil and mineral deposits.
The contract, signed on May 8, covers 9,700 square miles that are claimed only by Vietnam and China.
Mr. Thompson said that the area was extremely promising, but that Crestone would first have to conduct extensive data analysis and that it would be a year or two before it sends any boats into the area.
A United States Embassy officer was present at the signing of the contract, but the embassy said later that it had no involvement in the negotiations, that territorial disputes should be resolved peacefully and that freedom of navigation should be preserved.

HEADLINE: Poles Learn the Hard Way; Schools Are Hurt by Reform

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARSAW, June 17

 BODY:
The only decoration in the physics lab at Copernicus High School is a large display of the molecular structure of cement. In the chemistry classroom next door, a cracked, sun-beaten poster of the Polish-born Nobel laureate Marie Curie looks over lopsided tables and chairs. Broken cupboards reveal only chipped and stained flasks.
The appearance of one of Warsaw's most elite schools is revealing enough, but the state of education is even worse than these dilapidated classrooms would suggest. While the country's economy is at a critical point, it is education here, as in many other countries, that is suffering most. 
 Indeed, Poland's two-year-old economic reform plan, which has slashed state subsidies and increased prices of most goods and services -- but not wages -- to world levels, has hit teachers and students particularly hard.
 
Salaries of $150 a Month
 Budget cuts have forced the elimination of all extracurricular activities, from physical education to classes for students with learning disabilities. Teachers, who are the lowest-paid workers in the nation, earn an average of $150 a month, compared with the national industrial wage of about $200. Low salaries and budget cuts may sound familiar to American educators, but in Poland, as in other former East-bloc countries, teachers were accustomed to relatively high pay for 45 years.
Some schools, like Copernicus High School, are in such financial straits they must appeal to parents for donations to keep afloat.
"Imagine asking parents to help supplement your budget," said Albert Stoma, principal of Copernicus High School. "It's just not right. It is a public school, something the state has provided for decades. And now look. We don't even have enough money for garbage collection, or floor-cleaning detergent. Some days we don't heat the school to save money."
Teachers' salaries, the Ministry of Education says, consume 90 percent of Polish school expenditures. That leaves little for new, much-needed books and new science equipment, let alone computers. Or for competitive salaries for language teachers, especially English instructors, who can easily put their skills to use at well-paying Western companies. In fact, in 1991, a year in which prices rose 70 percent, teachers' wages actually dropped 17 percent.
 
Teacher Shortage Predicted
 "Morale is very, very low," said Krystyna Humiecka, a Warsaw English teacher who, with 20 years of service, earns only $150 a month for her 34-hour workweek. She teaches English privately for three hours a week, earning an additional $120 to supplement her income.
"This crisis is not just affecting us," she said. "Of course students today, and students a few years from now, will suffer, too, because we are going to have a shortage of teachers."
Rafal Krawczyk, a 17-year-old high school junior, said he could sense the struggles his instructors face. "You can see it's hard on them," he said. "You can tell they're worried, and tired. Most of them have to take extra jobs."
Another student complained about outdated textbooks and aging science equipment. "Many schools in Poland are hoping for miracles," Mr. Stoma, the principal, said.

HEADLINE: Council Seeks to Block Limiting Of Its Power Over Landmarking

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Fearing that its power over landmarking decisions was severely limited by a recent court ruling, the New York City Council said yesterday that it would seek to have the decision overturned.
At stake, Council leaders say, is the Council's power to make changes in City Landmarks Preservation Commission decisions without entirely rejecting the landmark designation. 
 Last month, a New York State appeals court handed down a ruling that said landmark designations could not be compromised for political or economic reasons. The ruling by the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court in Manhattan overturned a decision by the Board of Estimate in its last days before it was disbanded in the new City Charter.
In 1990, the board tinkered with a landmarks commission designation to allow Peter S. Kalikow, the developer and publisher, to build an enormous apartment tower on the site of 4 of 14 historic tenements that the commission had designated as a historic district.
The 14-building complex between 78th and 79th Streets on the Upper East Side is known as City and Suburban York Estates. It was given landmark status in April 1990 over the protests of Mr. Kalikow and with the support of a neighborhood group that opposed the new apartment tower.
 
Intense Lobbying
 Four months later, after intense lobbying from the developer, the Board of Estimate separated four of the easternmost buildings from the historic district so that Mr. Kalikow could build there.
Preservationists sued the city and eventually won. Last month the five-member Appellate Division said the board had no right to carve up or alter a historic district for "arbitrary or capricious" reasons.
The decision meant the board should only have considered the landmarks commission's arguments for the historical or esthetic importance of the site, not whether it would hinder development, cost jobs or crimp tax revenues.
Now the Council's leadership, which under the 1989 City Charter revision has inherited the old Board of Estimate's power over land-use decisions, fears the broadly worded decision will clip its wings.
"It would turn us into a rubber stamp," said Peg Breen, a spokeswoman for Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone. "It pretty much wipes out the role of the Legislature."
 
No Precedent Is Seen
 The Dinkins administration sees it differently. O. Peter Sherwood, the city's Corporation Counsel, said the administration does not believe the decision will set a precedent that will curb the Council's authority since it concerns a specific project and a defunct board.
Mr. Sherwood said the Mayor decided not to appeal the decision because he agreed with the preservationists. When he was Manhattan Borough President, Mr. Dinkins was one of five members of the Board of Estimate who voted against changing the landmarks designation for Mr. Kalikow's benefit.
Since the Council was not sued in the original lawsuit, its lawyers will petition the Appellate Division for the right to appeal the decision to the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals in Albany, Ms. Breen said.
Ms. Breen insisted that the Council was not entering the fray to aid Mr. Kalikow, who also owns The New York Post, but rather to protect its legislative prerogatives. Yet that is not the way it looked to some preservationists.
"It seems to me the only one whose interest is served by the appeal is Kalikow," said Anthony C. Wood, president of Friends of the Upper East Side Historic Districts, one of the groups who fought for the historic district. "The Council may be more concerned with currying favor with the owner of a daily newspaper than anything else."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Labor;
Union Leaders Seek to Keep Auto Workers From the Arms of Perot

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, June 17

 BODY:
Already buffeted by weaknesses in the auto industry, layoffs at aerospace plants and setbacks in Washington, the United Automobile Workers Union now has a political headache: an independent Presidential candidate enticing its members to break ranks with the union's endorsed candidate.
Yet a recent survey suggested there were insurgent stirrings among union members in support of Ross Perot, and U.A.W. leaders meeting here are publicly taking steps to counter them. They are predicting that support for Mr. Perot will fade as he and his ideas become better known, and they are planning to publicize what they say is his history of anti-union activity. 
 The leaders are hoping auto workers will ultimately turn out strongly for Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who won the union's endorsement after he aligned himself with striking workers at Caterpillar Inc. earlier this year and supported legislation to prevent the hiring of permanent replacement workers during strikes.
But privately, union leaders say they are not surprised by Mr. Perot's popularity.
 
Linking Decline to G.O.P.
 Rank-and-file support of Democratic candidates has been difficult to muster since 1980, when many union auto workers, especially white men, voted for Ronald Reagan and then for George Bush. Indeed, the disenchantment of union voters with the Democratic Party has been an important factor in the party's poor showing in the last three Presidential elections.
So U.A.W. leaders are now working overtime to make the point that labor's losses in the workplace are linked to Republican economic policies. They charge, for example, that Republican opposition to protectionist policy that would restrain Japanese auto sales in this country helped force the American auto industry to reorganize. That restructuring has reduced U.A.W. membership in the last decade by nearly 40 percent, to less than 900,000 in 1991.
Evidence of Mr. Perot's popularity was found in a small poll that The Detroit Free Press published last week. It said that among of 150 U.A.W. members in the Detroit area, 50 said they would most likely vote for Mr. Perot, 37 for Mr. Clinton and 15 for President Bush, with the remaining 48 undecided. Beyond that, there is anecdotal evidence suggesting that U.A.W. members are ready to abandon their support of Republicans, which makes Mr. Perot's emergence all the more frustrating to Clinton supporters.
Mr. Perot may have attracted some auto workers with statements opposing free trade with Mexico and others promising tough treatment for Japanese automakers. Mr. Clinton, by contrast, favors a free trade agreement with Mexico, which the union fears could cause an exodus of auto-industry jobs south of the border, where wage rates are lower. But many U.A.W. leaders believe Mr. Perot's main appeal is the same among auto workers as it seems to be generally: that he is a departure from traditional politics.
 
An Opening for Clinton
 "I think Perot would be a disaster," said Paul Korman, a U.A.W. assistant regional director from Des Plaines, Ill., "but don't kid yourself, he has support. He's not being very specific, but he's saying all the right things about unemployment and the trade imbalance."
Still, U.A.W. strategists see a potential silver lining in Mr. Perot's candidacy. They had feared that a Democrat running alone against President Bush faced almost sure defeat. But now they say that if Mr. Perot draws more support away from Mr. Bush than from Mr. Clinton, Mr. Clinton might have enough votes "to thread the needle." Such an outcome could also leave no candidate with enough electoral votes to win, and the House of Representatives would choose the President.
Given this possibility, Owen F. Bieber, the U.A.W. president, urged the union officers convening here on Sunday to "work extra hard in key House and Senate races." Standing for election to his final term as U.A.W. president before retirement, Mr. Bieber, 62 years old, faces token opposition.
Mr. Bieber charged that as chairman of Electronic Data Systems Corporation in the early 1970's, Mr. Perot "went to great lengths to keep workers" in an E.D.S. office near San Francisco from forming a union. When the workers did vote to recognize the union, he said, E.D.S. shut the office and moved to a nonunion office.
An E.D.S. spokesman, Tony Good, disputed the union's account. He said the company was neutral on the union vote and later sold the office for unrelated reasons to another company, which eventually closed it.
Mr. Perot, who sold E.D.S. to the General Motors Corporation in 1984, says he had no recollection of the episode in San Francisco. In a telephone interview on Monday, he sidestepped an invitation to spell out his position on collective bargaining, saying that "the highest priority must be to form a united team within a company."
On Monday, Mr. Clinton received a warm, if less than rousing, welcome when he addressed the 2,000 or so delegates here. He sketched his version of traditional Democratic planks like national health care and tuition support for public education.
But delegates eager to hear a protectionist anthem were disappointed. While condemning tax advantages for companies that close United States plants so they can open overseas, Mr. Clinton spoke of the reality of a global marketplace that forced American companies to trade with Latin America: "The world we once knew we will never know again."

HEADLINE: Plan for Ice Rink and TV Studio on Chelsea Piers

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
New York State selected a development group yesterday to build ice-skating rinks, film and television studios and a marina on the Chelsea Piers as part of a plan to revitalize Manhattan's decaying Hudson River waterfront.
The group, Chelsea Piers L.P., submitted the lowest bid of three finalists seeking to develop the aging piers between West 18th and 23d Streets. But officials of the State Department of Transportation, which owns the piers, said the group was selected because its $25 million plan would fit best into a proposed ribbon of riverfront parkland and businesses envisioned by city and state officials. 
 The four Chelsea piers are the first of three riverfront sites that will be leased to private developers as part of a plan agreed to by Mayor David N. Dinkins and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to construct 40 acres of parkland alongside a new highway stretching from Battery Park to 59th Street.
A more elaborate form of the plan, known as Westway, collapsed under opposition from environmental and community groups in 1985.
"I am so excited I can't see straight," said Roland W. Betts, a partner in the development group. "This is great for the city." The group plans to begin construction in January 1993.
The development group includes Sky Rink, an indoor ice-skating rink on West 33d Street, and Silver Screen Studios, which underwrites films by the Walt Disney Company. Mr. Betts is the chairman of Sky Rink and president of Silver Screen Studios.
 
Yachting School Planned
 The group's plan calls for building two glass-enclosed skating rinks, expanding existing television and film studios and opening a yachting school operated by Dennis Conner, the three-time America's Cup champion.
Chelsea Piers bid $157,000 per month for a 10-year lease for the piers. Hirschfeld Realty, the Manhattan development company, made the highest bid, $162,000 per month. The second highest bid, $161,000 a month, was placed by a group that included World Yacht, a dinner-cruise line that currently rents one of the piers.
Abraham Hirschfeld criticized the state for selecting Mr. Betts's group, saying it would be unable to obtain financing. "They will do something with those piers when hair grows on my palms," said Mr. Hirschfeld, a one-time candidate for lieutenant governor. His proposal had called for building a wholesale shopping market, among other things.
But Tom Ryan, a spokesman for the Transportation Department, said Chelsea Piers L.P. was unanimously selected by an eight-member review panel because its proposal was the most appropriate and detailed. The panel thought the other two bids were "vague and speculative," Mr. Ryan said.

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Plan: One Fare Rise Over 5 Years

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
The head of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority yesterday proposed a broad new financial plan that would raise the fare on New York City's subway and buses only once in the next five years, while offering an array of new discounts.
Under the plan by the M.T.A. chairman, Peter E. Stangl, subway and bus fares would probably increase 25 cents, to $1.50, in 1994. The authority would also try to attract new riders with a monthly pass allowing unlimited trips for subway and bus passengers. And it would offer discounts for commuters who take a bus and the subway, paying two fares, and for suburban commuters who ride Metro-North or Long Island Rail Road and then take a subway or bus in the city. 
 In addition, the M.T.A. would raise tolls 50 cents, to $3, next year on many bridges and tunnels.
In recent months, Mr. Stangl has struggled to get the attention of city and state elected officials, as well as the general public, on the significant financial problems the M.T.A. faces.
"We need to be bold," Mr. Stangl said. "We need to be more ambitious. If you want a modern, functioning transit system that moves people conveniently at a reasonable price, you have to do these things."
 
Dividing Up Subsidies
 The chairman's plan does not solve the agency's deficits; in fact, it would add to them. But Mr. Stangl is hoping that his proposed innovations will be so appealing that they will induce City Hall and Albany to come up with the money the M.T.A. has been unsuccessfully seeking to solve the system's long-term problems.
The proposal also represents the M.T.A.'s opening public salvo in what will undoubtedly be a prolonged and politically divisive battle over the next year on how to apportion an estimated $16 billion in new government transportation subsidies that are expected to become available over the next six years.
Mr. Stangl made it clear, in a briefing on the plan at his office at M.T.A. headquarters on Madison Avenue, that he hoped the plan would spur some movement on the agency's five-year rebuilding plan, which has languished for a year. The M.T.A. has proposed a $10 billion, five-year plan for continuing the renovation of the subway and commuter lines, but it has received approval only for a one-year, $1.6 billion plan from the State Legislature.
The proposal by Mr. Stangl, contained in a five-year business strategy plan that the M.T.A. produces annually, seeks to tie together the innovations directly with the agency's existing plans. For example, the monthly subway passes and fare discounts would be possible only if the M.T.A. installs an elaborate new automated fare system on the subway; the new automated system is a major component of the M.T.A.'s five-year capital plan.
"If you like the plan, if you think as I do that the services that the M.T.A. provides are fundamental to this region and to its ability to compete, then you have to spend some money," he said.
 
State and Federal Money
 Without such innovations, he contended, the whole transit system could be headed for a long, slow decline, reversing the substantial progress of the last decade. Since the recession began three years ago, the transit lines have lost about 7 percent of their riders altogether, and subsidies from economically sensitive state taxes have declined precipitously.
The discounts and monthly passes would actually cost the M.T.A. money. Preliminary estimates suggest that they would cost an additional $400 million a year, Mr. Stangl said, but that cost could be partly offset by an estimated $150 million in new revenue from increased ridership.
The proposal also identifies how much of the new state and Federal money the M.T.A. would like, including 50 percent of the more than $700 million a year that will be raised by the state's new petroleum business tax. It says the M.T.A. should receive $100 million a year more in Federal transportation money than the $570 million it is already scheduled to get.
Mr. Stangl also said the city should increase its allotment to the transit agency by $65 million, under a complicated transaction involving recalculations of the city's contributions to the pension fund for transit police officers. The city pays for the transit police.
Even if all these requests were granted -- and they would require approval of the M.T.A. board, the Dinkins and Cuomo administrations and the State Legislature -- the M.T.A. would still face a potential budget gap of about $700 million over the next five years. Mr. Stangl said a new regional tax might be needed for the additional subsidies.
Response yesterday to the proposal was generally positive, although several officials noted that the obvious problem was how to pay for the whole package. A legislator who will have a major role in deciding how the new state and Federal money will be divided up, State Senator Norman Levy, the Long Island Republican who is chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee, declined to comment because he had not been briefed on the plan, said James Moriarty, a spokesman for Mr. Levy.
 
The Issue: How to Pay
 Norman Steisel, the First Deputy Mayor, said the Dinkins administration found the new ideas bold and sensible. "The issue is how to pay for it," Mr. Steisel said. The city hopes to work with the M.T.A. to obtain a fair share of the new state and Federal money for mass transit in the region, he said, adding, "The state is going to have to be a more active partner."
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's staff is reviewing Mr. Stangl's plan and "is looking forward to discussing it with the M.T.A.," said Charles F. Porcari, a spokesman for the Governor.
Gene Russianoff, staff attorney for the Straphangers Campaign, a riders' group, said, "Stangl's plan has tremendous potential."
Mr. Russianoff said the proposal to create new discounts and flexibility in fares represented a complete shift in the M.T.A.'s policy. "Before, they were scared to death of taking a risk," he said.
"If Peter Stangl can get New Yorkers an unlimited-ride monthly pass and cut down the cost of a two-fare zone, he'll really have given the city something," Mr. Russianoff said.

 Fares on the subways and busses would go up in 1994, probably by 25 cents, to $1.50. Fares on the suburban commuter railroad lines would go up by the same percentage, 20 percent. This would be the only fare increase in the next five years.
 Tolls would increase in January by 50 cents, to $3, on tunnels and bridges including the Triborough Bridge, the Midtown Tunnel, the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel and the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.
 After the subway's automated fare system begins to be installed in 1994, the agency would start selling monthly passes for unlimited subway and bus rides. The price of the monthly pass has not be set, but has be discussed as the cost of 50 single rides, or $75 on a $1.50 fare.
 Discounts would be offered for New Yorkers who ride both buses and subways to commute to work. The amount of the discount has not been set, but might be half the ordinary fare.
 Suburban commuters who ride the Metro-North or long lsland lines into the city could get discounts when they complete their trips using city buses or the subway. The amount of the discount has not been set.

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall As the Dow Loses 41.73

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Stock prices fell sharply yesterday, shaken by domestic political concerns, big falls in markets abroad and tremors linked to the expiration of options tomorrow.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 41.73 points, or 1.3 percent, to 3,287.76, its lowest close since April 13. On top of a 25-point drop on Tuesday, the Dow is now down 2 percent in two days. 
 The decline was across the board, with falling stocks leading gainers more than 3 to 1. And the Nasdaq composite index was down 10.83, or 1.9 percent, to 593.24.
As the summer approaches, there seems to be a general malaise hitting markets worldwide as bad news is arising in different places at the same time. Thus there is no good news in one market to help offset the bad elsewhere.
Trading in New York yesterday opened after the Japanese stock market had fallen to its lowest level in more than five and a half years, setting off renewed fears about Japan's financial system. [Page D10.]
The main markets also fell in Europe. And the Mexican stock market plunged 5.9 percent.
The decline in the United States "is developing a snowball effect," argued Robert C. Walberg, an equity analyst at MMS International, an economic research firm in New York. "People who have been nervous are saying that it is time to secure profits."
A. C. Moore, an investment strategist at Argus Investment Management in Santa Barbara, Calif., said he did not think the market was in for what he would call a major slide. But he said investors might have to ride out a 5 to 10 percent decline in the Dow, which would bring it close to 3,000 and would be a significant blow for many investors.
 
Perot Causes Uncertainty
 Mr. Moore and Mr. Walberg said several factors were contributing to the fall in the market, including the political uncertainty caused by the emergence of Ross Perot, weakness in technology stocks, the fall in the Japanese market and the feeling that the Federal Reserve will not now push interest rates lower. And then there is the effect of what is known as the triple witching, the day that options and futures contract expire.
"We have a confluence of factors here," Mr. Moore said, adding that the Perot factor "is creating uncertainty as to what, for example, a new tax code would look like." Also, Mr. Perot and his apparent opposition to a United States-Mexico free-trade agreement was cited as one reason for the sharp fall in the Mexican market.
Mr. Moore also said price cutting by technology companies had weakened those stocks, noting that in the last two weeks Hewlett-Packard was off 16.7 percent, Compaq Computer was down 8.3 percent and Microsoft dropped 10 percent.
Mr. Walberg also said the very slow recovery of the economy also meant that the market was unlikely to see any comforting earnings reports for the second quarter. "The market has very little to be excited about," he said.
He said the declines in the Big Three auto stocks yesterday was a reflection of people taking profits now that they think the market is in for a near-term slide. Many investors were waiting for a signal to sell since the Dow failed to securely breech the 3,400 level, a failure that set the market's nerves on edge.
"Some of yesterday's selloff was tied to some options expirations," said Dennis Jarrett, chief market strategist at Kidder, Peabody & Company. "But it was broad," he added, noting the nearly 2 percent decline in the Nasdaq composite index.
John Brooks at Davis Mendel & Regenstein said the quarterly expiration of stock index options, individual stock options and index futures kept many would-be buyers sidelined. And he said they are likely to remain sidelined until next week.
 
Big Changes Among Shares
 Among some of the market movers yesterday were Philips N.V., down 5, to 16 5/8. The company announced that its second-quarter earnings would be substantially below the level a yearearlier, and full-year profit unlikely to match 1991. The company cited a soft consumer-electronics market.
Adobe Systems rose 3 1/4, to 46, after it posted a rise in profits off a 22 percent increase in revenues.
Lower earnings forecast for the second quarter by Upjohn took the stock down 1 3/4, to 32 1/4. Lower Halcion sales, weak prescription drug sales in the United States and a soft agricultural market were some of the factors noted.
Volume leaders were topped by Telefonos de Mexico, as it traded 10.8 million shares to close at 45 3/8, down 3 1/8.
Coca-Cola, according to analysts, indicated a couple of weeks ago that its second-quarter earnings would be in line with their 42 cents to 44 cents a share estimates. But soft-drink volume growth in the second quarter was weak, so investors used the general concern over second-quarter earnings and a weak market to sell their Coke shares, as the stock fell 1 3/8, to 39 3/8.

HEADLINE: Ford and Chrysler Outpace Japanese in Reducing Costs

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Ford and Chrysler have increased the efficiency of their factories and workers so much in recent years that their basic cost of producing a car is now less than that of their Japanese rivals, according to a study published today.
Auto analysts have long recognized the productivity improvements at the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation. But the assumption within the industry has been that a production-cost gap remains between Detroit's second- and third-largest auto makers and the Japanese car companies, especially the Toyota Motor Corporation, generally regarded as the low-cost producer worldwide. 
 But that assumption is no longer true, according to the report by the Economic Strategy Institute, a research organization in Washington. Based on a yearlong study, conducted with the help of the University of Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transport, the private research group estimates that the direct cost of producing a small car at Ford is $5,415, Chrysler's cost is $5,841 and Toyota's $6,216.
The comparable cost for the other three leading Japanese companies -- Nissan, Honda and Mazda -- are somewhat higher than Toyota, while General Motors is the high-cost producer, at $7,205 a car.
"The good performance of Ford and Chrysler is surprising," said Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., president of the Economic Strategy Institute. "And the figures show that Ford and Chrysler really have become competitive with the Japanese."
The glaring exception in the report's picture of the American industry as an efficient producer is the General Motors Corporation, the nation's largest auto maker. And its laggard position in terms of cost of production helps explain the urgency of its recent management changes, payroll cutbacks and plant closings.
Other analysts agreed that Ford and possibly Chrysler were now quite competitive with the Japanese companies, but said that the Economic Strategy Institute report may have overstated the case. By stating the results in terms of United States dollars, they noted, the biggest single reason for the new-found cost advantage for Ford and Chrysler was the 85 percent decline in the value of the dollar against the yen since 1985.
But more recent studies have tended to focus on the number of worker-hours, rather than dollars, required to make a car.
"Ford has done a terrific job and, in the past few years, Chrylser has made huge gains in its productivity," said James Harbour of Harbour & Associates in Troy, Mich. "But I'd still rank Toyota No. 1 with Ford close behind."
 
U.S. Lagged 10 Years Ago
 In 1981, Harbour & Associates published a landmark study that concluded that the Japanese industry could produce a small car for $1,500 less than Detroit. Some later studies were even more pessimistic about how far the American industry lagged, estimating that Japanese costs were $2,500 or more below Detroit's.
Today, the Economic Strategy Institute report found that in terms of man-hours and total labor costs in each produced the Japanese still have an edge over all the Detroit companies. But the research group calculated that Ford and Chrysler more than made up that deficit by the lower prices in America for other costs like purchasing glass, rubber and industrial fuel.
The report, "The Future of the Auto Industry: It Can Compete, Can It Survive?," written by Mr. Prestowitz, Paul S. Willen and Larry Chimerine, separately figured the costs that are often beyond the direct control of managers and workers. For example, they estimated that higher health care and pension expenses -- nearly half of which go to retirees and laid off workers -- meant an additional cost of $600 on each car Detroit makes, compared with the Japanese.
 
Social Costs Added In
 And the fact that the American industry ran its plants at only 62 percent of capacity in 1991 versus 95 percent for the Japanese resulted in a cost penalty of $800 to $1,500 a car for the Detroit producers. When what the report calls these social costs, including a slightly higher cost of capital for investment in the United States, are added in, Toyota becomes the low-cost producer and Ford slips to No. 2.
"The U.S. industry does carry all these burdens compared with Japan, but they are part of the competitive environment," said Maryann Keller, an auto analyst at Furman Selz Inc.
The Economic Strategy Institute's discussion of the social costs borne by the industry and its policy recommendations for reviving the auto industry will likely be the more controversial part of the report. Its recommendations include drafting an industrial policy for the American industry, putting more pressure on Japanese transplant factories in the United States to buy low-cost American parts, and attaching a "North American content" sticker on all cars sold in the United States.
Mr. Prestowitz, a former Japan expert in the Commerce Department, is an advocate of an industrial policy for leading American industries and he has often been critical of Japan's trading practices. The Economic Strategy Institute is supported by some 200 donors including corporations, foundations, unions and individuals, with auto companies and suppliers accounting for roughly 15 percent of its financing.

Soaring Taxes Steal Cafes' Sizzle

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN

 BODY:
ON a wall at Louis' Lunch here, a sign proclaims: "Prices subject to change according to customer's attitude."
But customers' attitudes may have a lot less to do with the future of Louis's hamburger prices -- and indeed Louis' itself -- than a tax increase that is making the restaurant's owner consider leaving town. 
 "Our property tax assessment tripled," said Kenneth Lassen, whose grandfather founded this New Haven culinary landmark in 1895 and who works long hours behind the counter with his wife and son. "We can't pass it on to the customers, so we'd decide to move if it becomes economically necessary."
Ray Larson, who has been eating at Louis' for 60 of his 80 years, said that he could not imagine New Haven without the tiny restaurant that claims -- among other contenders -- to be the birthplace of the hamburger.
"It's irreplaceable," he said, as he left the tiny brick restaurant that has only two tables, a half dozen pew-style chairs and five stools across from the ovens. "If they leave, this city's going to the dogs."
Terry Halwes, a scientist who heads a company called Precision Neurometrics, said that Louis' extra-large, extra-lean burgers are a staple of his diet. "There are people whose doctors prescribe his burgers because they're so low in fat," he said.
Louis' is one of a handful of well-known, longtime New Haven restaurants and other businesses whose owners say they may move because of a recent property-tax revaluation that Peter Halsey, the city controller, said would raise taxes for small businesses and homeowners by an average of 238 percent over five years.
Many business owners are appealing their assessments, and some seem to be hoping against hope that city officials may scale back the increase.
"My taxes here will go up by $11,000 just during the first phase in July," said Flo Consiglio, whose husband founded another landmark New Haven restaurant, Sally's Apizza, 54 years ago. "If you bring your prices up to reflect taxes, people won't come. And for many people, pizza is all they can afford to go out to eat these days."
Despite the hourlong lines for dinner, to legions of Sally's devotees, a New Haven without Sally's is as improbable as one without another beleaguered city institution -- Yale University.
"Sally's and Pepe's are the best pizza in the country," said John Massaro, a regular customer, referring to another veteran pizzeria a few blocks away on Wooster Street in New Haven's Little Italy section. "To close because of retirement would be one thing, but it's crazy to have this happen because of taxes."
Mike Spoerndle, the owner of Toad's nightclub who is also contemplating a cost-cutting exit from New Haven, is quick to say that closing is not imminent for his sprawling music emporium, nor for Louis' or Sally's. But, he said, their future in New Haven is far from secure.
"I love it here," he said, surveying a stage where Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen and other luminaries have performed since the club opened in 1975. "We've put tons of money into this. But I've been looking at San Diego and Tijuana, because I can't make a living for my family here when they hit us with higher property taxes, cabaret and entertainment taxes and sales tax. And, here in Connecticut, in the insurance capital of America, the insurance rates are pretty bad."
Toad's has its own die-hard fans, including Alderman Michael Morand, who said: "If it left, it would be an irreplaceable loss. Toad's is the best club between New York and Boston."
Like other New Haven merchants, Mr. Spoerndle denounced the city for hitting small and medium-sized businesses with the tax increase while giving tax breaks to retain large businesses like Macy's.
But confronted with the threatened exodus, city officials cast the blame elsewhere.
"The Federal Government has shifted the burdens to the states," Mr. Halsey said. "And the state has shifted the bill to the communities. With business lousy in this part of the world, the easiest thing for people to vent their frustrations at is the local tax bill. We're the closest ones to yell at."

Treasury Bond Prices Up Slightly

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices closed slightly higher yesterday after an erratic session tied to favorable economic news.
The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond, which gained 7/32 point on Tuesday, rose 5/32 point, or $1.56 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield slipped to 7.81 percent, from 7.83 percent late Tuesday. 
 The market rose in morning trading after a Government report on productivity showed inflation in check. It declined after the Federal Reserve dimmed hopes for lower interest rates when its "beige book" report showed economic improvement early this month.
Bond prices then reversed course again, as traders sold at higher prices to take profits and apparently reassessed the Fed survey of business conditions in the 12 Fed districts.
Kathleen Stephanson, a money market economist at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation, said she was surprised the market fell after the Fed survey, because the upturn in the economy had been expected.
She said the report on closer inspection showed few surprises, which contributed to the market's late rebound to positive territory.
Trading was light for the third straight session.
Bonds got an early lift following the release of a report that the productivity of American workers rose 2.7 percent during the first quarter of 1992, the largest increase in nearly two years.
The Labor Department said the increase in productivity, defined as output per hour of work, matched the advance posted in the second quarter of 1990, when the economy was sliding into the recession.
 
Lower Prices for Goods Seen
 Traders speculated that an improvement in productivity would translate to lower prices for goods, which in turn keeps inflation at bay. That is positive for bonds because inflation erodes the value of fixed-income securities.
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term maturities rose 1/16 point to 3/32 point, intermediate maturities gained 1/16 point to 5/32 point and long-term issues rose about 3/16 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported.
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, closed at 1,234.60, up 0.77.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 3.68 percent as the discount dropped 3 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 3.61 percent. Yields on six-month bills fell to 3.81 percent as the discount fell 3 basis points, to 3.70 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 4.06 percent as the discount dropped 1 basis point, to 3.90 percent.
The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity.
The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 3 11/16 percent, up from 3 5/8 late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: House Panel Passes a Weakened Cable Bill

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
Deciding that it would be smarter to run and fight again some other day, the House Energy and Commerce Committee voted today, 31 to 12, in favor of a bill that would impose tough new rate regulation on most cable television systems but is much weaker than a measure passed by the Senate in January.
The thrust-and-parry strategy marked an attempt by the panel's chairman, Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, to sidestep the deadlocks and jursidictional squabbles that have stalled House action on the bill for months. 
 The upshot is a measure that would regulate prices but does not include the two provisions, including one intended to increase competition, that the industry most vehemently opposed. Supporters had said the provisions were the bill's most important features, one for the public interest and the other for political purposes.
 
'I Want to Win This Thing'
 Supporters of the bill have vowed to put the provisions back when the measure reaches the House floor or in House-Senate conference committee, where they believe they have a better chance of success.
"I want to win this thing in the long run," said Representative Billy Tauzin, a Louisiana Democrat who supports a stronger bill. "What we're doing is drawing the fight to a better field on a better day."
The new bill would require the Federal Communications Commission to set maximum rates for a basic tier of cable television service and allow it to roll back prices for premium services, like those that include Home Box Office or the Disney channel, if the prices are deemed "unreasonable."
But it eliminated a provision that was intended to promote greater competition for cable systems. That provision would have required big cable companies that also produce popular programming to license their shows to such potential rivals as companies that transmit programming by satellite.
The new substitute also eliminated a provision that had been inserted to attract political support from the television networks and over-the-air television broadcasters. That measure would have forced local cable systems to pay royalties to television stations for the right to retransmit their signals. Under current law, cable systems have an automatic license to carry over-the-air television signals without payment.
The partial retreat stems in part from Mr. Dingell's fear that the two provisions would make an overall cable bill much harder to get through the House. Mr. Dingell has been embroiled in an increasingly bitter turf battle with the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Representative Jack Brooks of Texas, who is determined to change the provision that benefits broadcasters.
The provision affecting competition has come under attack from many Democrats, and it almost prevented the House telecommunications subcommittee from being able to pass a bill several months ago.
Now, supporters of a tough bill say they will try to get their way either on the House floor or in conference committee.
 
Threat of a Veto
 President Bush has repeatedly threatened to veto any measure that imposes significant new regulation on the cable industry. The White House argues that the best way to control cable television prices is to let telephone companies compete in providing television services.
The bill has also come under attack from the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Alfred C. Sikes, who charged last week that the cost of enforcing the bill could total as much as $54.7 million, or 44 percent of the F.C.C.'s annual budget.
But with prices for basic cable television service rising far faster than the rate of inflation, Congressional Democrats see a tough measure as a good way to attract middle-class voters in an election season.
The cable television industry quickly denounced the measure. "Over all, this legislation remains excessive," said James P. Mooney, president of the National Cable Television Association. "The bill still imposes major costs on cable companies that will result in higher consumer prices."
 
Partial Consumer Victory
 But Gene Kimmelman, legislative director for the Consumer Federation of America, declared today's vote a partial victory. "The bill is very strong on meeting consumers' short-term needs. The longer-term desire to bring about more competition has not been dealt with, but we hope it will be at a later point," he said.
The House passed a much more modest regulatory bill in 1990, but that measure was blocked in the Senate that year by a combination of Republicans and a few Democrats. Now, the trouble is in the House, where Republican opponents are being helped out by dissension among Democrats.
The debate over cable television stems from the effects of the Cable Television Act of 1984. That measure, intended to foster the growth of cable television, freed local cable systems from any local price regulation. The theory was that new services, like those that use satellites and microwave transmission, would provide the competition needed to keep prices under control.
But neither of those industries has grown much in the intervening years, leaving cable systems in the vast majority of cities with virtual monopolies.

New York Lets Insurers Join Forces

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
Approving what could be a model for troubled life insurance companies, New York State regulators gave the go-ahead yesterday to the largest merger in history of two mutual life insurance companies, allowing the creation on July 1 of the Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Company, with combined assets of more than $10 billion.
Industry experts say that if successful, the merger may be copied by other mid-size mutual insurers around the country. Many of them have been losing market share to companies that are larger or have higher financial ratings. The companies announced their merger in December and were waiting for State Insurance Department approval. 
 The merger, of the Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Company of Hartford, and Home Life Insurance of New York City, comes at a time of turmoil for mutual insurers, which are owned by their policyholders.
By merging operations to save $70 million a year, the companies' leaders say they hope to reassure regulators and the public about their financial strength. But some critics question whether merging companies struggling with weak commercial real estate portfolios and wary consumers might just create larger companies with bigger problems.
"From the policyholders' perspective, this is definitely going to reduce costs," Terence Lennon, the chief examiner of the State Insurance Department, said. "This industry became stressed in the 1980's, and now companies are going to have to compete on the basis of cost as they never have before. This shows other companies that a merger can be done."
Following another unusual strategy for dealing with mutual insurers' problems, New York is supervising the transformation of the third-largest mutual, the Equitable Life Assurance Society, into a stock company. Equitable is expected to make its initial public offering next month.
John Gummere, the chairman and chief executive of the Phoenix, and William B. Wallace, the chairman and chief executive of Home Life, said in interviews yesterday that they expected major savings from the reduction of the two companies' work forces of 2,450 to 1,667 by the end of next year, and from the combining of their three computer centers into one. The cost reductions, they said, will eventually result in higher dividends for policyholders and more competitive insurance policies.
"It will let us build capital, and it will directly benefit our policyholders," Mr. Gummere said.
As one example of the many difficulties the companies faced in getting regulators to approve the deal, they had to agree to make New York the new company's legal home, but also had to agree to give Connecticut most of its jobs. New York's Insurance Department, which is large and considered more aggressive than those of most other states, wanted to maintain regulatory control over the company to protect policyholders. Mr. Gummere said Connecticut officials, including Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., had insisted on protection for their state's weak economy.
As a result, more than 500 jobs will disappear from Home Life's offices in Piscataway, N.J., and New York City, while Phoenix's Hartford offices will retain their work force of more than 2,000. The company's corporate books will be kept in a new office near Albany, which will employ about 200.

Upjohn Expects Earnings To Be Flat in 2d Quarter

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: KALAMAZOO, Mich., June 17

 BODY:
The Upjohn Company said today that it expected that second-quarter net income would not exceed the $128 million, or 70 cents a share, earned in the comparable quarter a year ago.
The company attributed the flat performance to a decline in sales of its controversial Halcion sleeping drug and weakness in its overall United States drug prescription sales. 
 Upjohn said it was offering voluntary early retirement to about 1,100 workers, or about 10 percent of its work force, in an effort to reduce costs. The amount of the charges for the plan have not been determined, but will be taken in the third quarter, the company said.
All employees aged 53 or older in the United States and Puerto Rico except those in research and development and United States field sales are eligible, and must retire no later than Sept. 2.
 
Decline in Upjohn Shares
 Upjohn shares fell $1.75 today, closing at $32.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Upjohn had been expected to earn about 77 cents a share for the second quarter, according to a consensus by Zack's Investment Research.
In addition to the decline in Halcion sales, which the company tied to "controversy concerning the product," a weak United States prescription pharmaceutical business "due to unfavorable timing comparisons in buying patterns" and weakness in agricultural operations because of the "recessionary pressure and drought" put pressure on earnings, Upjohn said.
In late May, the company imposed what it called a short-term wage and hiring freeze on its United States operations to reassess its long-term strategies. The wage freeze was lifted June 9, but the hiring freeze continues, a company spokesman, John Lambrechts, said.
Upjohn said in May that the negative publicity surrounding Halcion and the amount of money spent by the pharmaceutical company to defend it were related to the hiring freeze.
In mid-May, the United States Food and Drug Administration determined that Halcion was safe at prescribed dosages, although it had been banned by the British in September.
Despite the F.D.A.'s findings, prescriptions for Halcion, one of Upjohn's biggest revenue producers, fell 48 percent in the United States during the first quarter of 1992.
Halcion is Upjohn's second-highest revenue-producing drug, with sales of $100 million in the United States and $237 million worldwide in 1991, down about 39 percent from the year before.
Upjohn's stock has steadily declined because of negative reports and patient complaints about Halcion, which can cause memory lapse, anxiety and other side effects. The shares were at a record high of $42 in late February.
Industry analysts said patent expirations on several drugs, including Halcion and Xanax, were clouding the outlook for Upjohn.
Early tests of its Freedox drug used to treat head, neck and spinal cord injuries look promising, analysts said. Approval could come in 1994 or 1995.

HEADLINE: In Moscow, Capitalist Wheels Roll

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 17

 BODY:
Just inside the main entrance of Detsky Mir, a Government-owned department store, the vast lobby has been turned into a glass-enclosed showroom for shiny new Fords. What is striking is not the display -- there are a dozen like it in Moscow -- but that owning a foreign car has suddenly become so acceptable in Russia that even the state encourages the practice.
Aside from providing this new prestige, the influx of foreign cars along with many other imported items is helping to satisfy consumer demand, easing social tension at a time when Russian production is falling and domestic goods are in painfully short supply. 
 Encouraging the import trend, the Government has removed import tariffs for the time being on most consumer products, including cars. The products appear side by side with Russian products in dozens of stores. "We are happy to be flooded with foreign goods; the more the better," said Yuri V. Krichmar, a Moscow city government economist, offering the view held by many officials.
Until perestroika, foreign cars were restricted almost entirely to diplomats. Now the lineup of cars idling at a traffic light regularly includes a Honda, Chevy, Volvo, Ford, Toyota or some other foreign make.
The mass entry of foreign goods is an abrupt change. For decades such products were available only to foreigners in special dollar shops, or to Russians buying on the black market. Now hundreds of consumer items enter the country duty-free and are sold legally in state stores, as well as on the streets, with customers paying sometimes in dollars and sometimes rubles.
The only question is, where are Russians getting the dollars and other hard currencies to import so much? The only source is dollars earned from exports, and that suggests to economists that Russians are earning from exports far more than the $30 billion a year that is declared to the Government.
In recent months, nearly 1,000 foreign cars have entered Russia daily, the Ministry of Autos estimates. They come by land from Europe, by freighter from the United States and aboard cargo ships that ferry timber to Japan and return to Vladivostok with cars.
Some are new, but most are second-hand vehicles, purchased or stolen abroad and often sold here for less than $6,000 apiece. That makes them competitive in price with Russian cars.
"Foreign cars are not necessarily better than Russian-made cars, but they do give you prestige in people's eyes, and that is a nice feeling," said Valery Gleikh, an interpreter, who bought a second-hand 1982 Volvo for his wife for $2,200 and a 1987 Ford for himself for $6,300. "If I get a flat tire fixed, the service station charges me twice the price for fixing a tire on a Russian car. They think I am rich."
Foreign car sales in Russia -- roughly 100,000 vehicles have been sold in the last six months, the Auto Ministry says -- represent more than 20 percent of the 850,000 cars expected to be sold in Russia this year, according to Aleksandr Kovrigin, an Auto Ministry official. The Russian Zhiguli, styled after a 1960's Fiat, is the biggest seller, with foreign cars as a group in second place.
The average Russian income is the ruble equivalent of less than $100 a month. A Pontiac 6000 brought from abroad, for example, ranges from $5,880 for a 1986 model to $19,950 for a 1991 car, payable in dollars. By comparison, a new Zhiguli sedan goes for $2,500 to $5,400 in rubles, if the car is purchased from the factory, a process that can require several years on a waiting list. And to get a new Zhiguli for immediate delivery, the price can be as much as $10,000.
An influx of foreign cars should shorten the long waiting time to buy new Russian cars. And, in fact, some Russian cars, like the Moskvich, a compact, are now available for immediate delivery -- but not because the nation is so saturated with foreign cars, Mr. Kovrigin argued. Since the lifting of price ceilings in January on most Russian goods, the prices of Russian cars have risen twentyfold, and many people who once could afford a car no longer can.
 
Less Wealthy Kick Tires
 But if only the wealthiest Russians are buying new cars, the less wealthy enjoy gazing at those that come from abroad, as shoppers do at Detsky Mir, where the 10 Ford models on display in the glass enclosures seem to Russians as fascinating, and untouchable, as Fifth Avenue store windows are for New Yorkers during Christmas.
"With pleasure I would buy such a car; they are very beautiful and much more reliable than our cars," said Viktor Nekrasov, admiring a black Lincoln Continental that, like the other cars behind the glass, carries no price tag. Mr. Nekrasov, who earns 10,000 rubles a month, or $100, as an Aeroflot pilot, was out shopping with his wife, Natalia, who said, "I have never been in such a car, but I hear it is noiseless, with automatic windows."
No sales representative from the private company that leases the lobby space staffs the display. That will happen soon, a sign promises. Meanwhile, a phone number is given, in case any of the shoppers buying toys and school supplies for their children -- the store sells mostly goods for youngsters -- might also want to purchase the new Taurus or the Lincoln or the other Fords.
But most of the foreign cars being brought in are second-hand, and they -- along with imported goods in general -- are at the low end of Western prices. These goods, for example, are dresses made in China, shoes from Turkey or 1980's American cars purchased at Midwestern used-car lots and shipped here by American entrepreneurs.
Aleksandr Ozolin, deputy director of Grediron, an auto sales agency, represents some of the foreign suppliers who ship cars to him from abroad. A car is imported only after a Russian places an order and makes a down payment. Answering Grediron's half-page auto ad in Izvestia last week, a buyer comes not to a used-car lot -- there aren't any in Moscow yet -- but to a cramped ground-floor office staffed by Mr. Ozolin and five other men, all in their 20's.
Cars are offered from printed lists that tell Mr. Ozolin and his colleagues where they can obtain almost any make or model, foreign or Russian, going back to 1986. Payment is in dollars, if the car, once ordered, is to be brought from abroad, or in dollars or rubles, if it is a foreign car already in the country, perhaps owned by a Russian who decided that maintenance costs had become too burdensome. That is a growing decision, Mr. Ozolin said, at a time when inflation is rising faster than incomes for most Russians.
"We ask a customer how much he is willing to pay, in what currency and if he is willing to pay in cash, which entitles him to a discount, or through a bank transfer, and then we choose a model that fits," Mr. Ozolin said. "You get your car in 30 days." If for some reason, the buyer does not like the car, he is usually charged only for the shipping costs, and Mr. Ozolin turns around and sells it to someone else.
Mr. Ozolin describes the customers as Russia's nouveau riche, mainly traders and brokers. But even they are feeling pinched, with inflation rising at a rate of more than 100 percent a year while incomes go up more slowly. The ratio of sales of second-hand foreign cars to second-hand Russian cars at Mr. Ozolin's agency have fallen to 1 foreign car in 8 sales from 1 in 5 last January.
There are problems besides price. Russia's rutted roads require extra-strong suspension. Russia's low-octane gasoline, lower than in other nations, destroys foreign car engines in a year or two, unless they are specially adjusted. Right-hand-drive cars coming from Japan's used-car lots and selling here for as little as $2,000, are hazardous in Russia, which uses standard left-hand drive. Most troublesome, getting parts can be difficult, although foreign-parts suppliers are beginning to appear. Toyota even has a service center in Vladivostock with 15 repair bays. And Mr. Gleikh says the parts problem is overstated.
"Getting them is no problem if you have hard currency," he said. "You can visit shops in Moscow that have foreign-car parts. And Russian cars are just as difficult to maintain."
The new-car dealers -- Volvo, Mercedes, BMW, Honda, Citroen, Ford and Opel -- play up maintenance in their sales pitches. Nathan M. Jacobson, president of Trinity Motors, a General Motors dealership with American and Russian investors, pitches custom-ordered Chevrolets, Pontiacs and Cadillacs specially equipped for Russia, with maintenance warranties. The selling price is $15,000 to $50,000 a car, in dollars.
In Trinity's first six weeks, five cars have been delivered and 150 ordered, says James Walker, Trinity's business manager. He and Mr. Jacobson are counting on Russians to be as smitten with the quality of American cars as Americans have been with Japanese cars. In addition, they are counting on fleet sales to government ministries, where the watchword, reflecting public attitudes, is often buy foreign not Russian.
"No minister has come in and ordered 250 cars yet," Mr. Walker said. "We'll get those orders, but so far it has been only one or two at a time."

Dollar Increases Worldwide But Most Focus on the Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed higher yesterday across the board, but trading largely centered on the European currencies.
Gold prices were mostly lower. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $341.20 an ounce, off $1 from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank said gold slipped 65 cents an ounce, to $341.35. 
 The dollar posted gains worldwide, but dealers said the heaviest trading involved the German mark, which has been particularly active since Denmark's rejection earlier this month of the treaty for European unity.
Many dealers took profits by selling the Swiss franc, which has appreciated recently, then poured that money into marks, according to John McCarthy, manager of foreign exchange trading at ABN-AMRO Bank N.V.
The mark also benefited from selling of the Italian lira. Mr. McCarthy said the Bank of Italy had stepped in to support the Italian currency several times.
The yen also weakened on the heels of a decline in the Japanese stock market to its lowest level in more than five and a half years amid pessimism about the economy.
"All this activity had the net effect of taking the dollar higher temporarily, but we're closing off the highs" for the day, Mr. McCarthy said.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 126.60 yen, down 0.40 yen from Tuesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at a higher rate of 127.00 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 127.25 yen, up from 126.50 yen on Tuesday.
In London, the pound fell to $1.8535, from $1.8605 late Tuesday. In New York, it cost $1.8565 to buy one pound, less expensive than Tuesday's $1.8645.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.5750 German marks, up from 1.5635; 1.4175 Swiss francs, up from 1.4045; 5.3050 French francs, up from 5.2650; 1,193.00 Italian lire, up from 1,183.25, and 1.1969 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1963.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.5775 German marks, up from 1.5665; 1.4195 Swiss francs, up from 1.4065; 5.3300 French francs, up from 5.2750; 1.7755 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7650; 1,194.00 Italian lire, up from 1,185.50, and 1.1960 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1955.
Gold rose in London to a late bid of $342.60 an ounce, from $342.00 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid of $342.00 an ounce from $342.05. In Hong Kong, gold was unchanged at $341.93 an ounce.

Money Market Fund Yields Continue Downward Trend

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields offered by money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were down in the latest week.
Walter S. Frank, IBC/Donoghue's chief economist, said several events in the tax-exempt sector, happening almost simultaneously, were driving yields lower. 
 "First of all, there is a great deal of money seeking out short-term tax-free yields," he said. "There are seasonal factors that contribute to the amount of investment money available, and interest-rate payment money that also becomes available for reinvestment to some extent.
"We should see more of the same right into next month, when, traditionally, yields move up, as many municipalities begin a new fiscal year and issue a lot of debt.
"What is interesting," Mr. Frank added, "is that yields in tax-exempt funds are still lower this week, despite money moving out of the funds. It shows the huge pent-up demand there is for tax-free paper in the market."
The seven-day compounded average yield for a tax-exempt fund fell by 18 basis points, to 2.53 percent, while the simple yield dropped by 17 basis points, to 2.50 percent. During the same period, the 30-day compounded and simple average yields fell by 12 basis points each, to 2.82 percent and 2.78 percent, respectively. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Assets of tax-free funds fell by $1.3 billion, to a total of $96 billion.
Donoghue's said the average number of days to maturity of tax-exempt securities held in money managers' portfolios rose by 3, to 53.
For investors in the 28 percent tax bracket, the taxable equivalent of the current seven-day tax-free compounded yield is 3.51 percent, while the equivalent for those in the 31 percent tax bracket is 3.66 percent.
 
Salomon Fund at 3.63%
 In its survey of tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, Donoghue's said that the Salomon Brothers New York Municipal Money Market Fund provided the best return, at 3.63 percent, but that it was still more than 10 basis points below last week's best yield, though it was in line with what had happened to other yields in its category.
Salomon Brothers was also the top fund among those investing in only New York issues, while the Fidelity Spartan Connecticut Municipal Money Market Porfolio gave the best return for funds dealing in Connecticut paper, at 3.04 percent. For New Jersey, the best yield was on the Calvert Tax-Free Reserve New Jersey Portfolio, with a yield of 3.14 percent.
In tracking the taxable funds for the week that ended yesterday, Donoghue's said that assets had declined by $482 million, to a total of $487.6 billion. Out of that, institutional assets accounted for a rise of $884 million, to $165.4 billion, while retail assets were down by $1.3 billion, to $322.2 billion.
For taxable funds, the average seven-day compounded and simple yields were both down by a basis point, to 3.50 percent and 3.44 percent, respectively. The 30-day compounded and simple averages were both down by 3 basis points, to 3.52 percent and 3.46 percent, respectively.
And, like the previous week, the Dreyfus Basic Money Market Fund had the best yield among taxables survyed, 4.39 percent.
Elsewhere, the average bank money market account yield, the prime competitor of money funds, was down by a basis point, to 3.36 percent.

2 Wrights Equal an Ellington

 BODY:
WHILE most people think they need more money, Richard Haas, an artist known for his illusionistic murals, thinks they need more currency. He has designed four new bills, including $25 and $200 denominations. They will "fill in important monetary gaps owing to inflation," Mr. Haas said. All four feature prominent American cultural figures instead of statesmen. The fronts are in various colors, but green is still the dominant shade on the backs. Mr. Haas's banknotes were commissioned by Martin Filler, editor of Design Quarterly, the journal of Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, for the summer issue. 
 The front of the $25 bill (above) has a portrait of Frank Lloyd Wright and his Taliesin West studio; his Robie house, in Chicago, is on the back; the $200 bill shows Tennessee Williams. The redesigned $50 bill has Duke Ellington, and the $100 bill has Martha Graham.

The New Hard Line

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In olden times, we hard-liners said: Don't trust the Russians. Fight them every step of the way until the free human spirit wins.
The soft-liners said: Accommodate. Try to understand their fear of us, and some peaceful day the two systems will converge. 
 That was then. Now the new hard-liners say: Trust the Russian reformers. Help them with debt relief and new private investment in this crisis, simultaneously pressing for dramatic arms reduction and withdrawal of imperial forces. The new soft-liners say: Don't help the Russians until we have helped ourselves.
In his dramatic descent on Washington this week, the bold and ebullient Boris Yeltsin put the heat on the new soft-liners.
First he proved he had the political muscle at home to cross the arms-control Rubicon and put an end to the fear of a first strike. Soviet SS-18 land-based MIRV's kept the world on edge for decades. In return, we gave up bargaining-chip land missiles and only half our submarine MIRV's.
Mr. Yeltsin was aware that this agreement, measured by the old calipers, gave the U.S. a strategic advantage. But his new calipers are more realistic: the U.S., which could have ruled the world when it had a nuclear monopoly, proved that it has no such designs. In reality, by giving up his ability to launch a devastating first blow, Yeltsin gave up no Russian security at all.
Second, he showed an ability to improvise under unexpected pressure, which is the mark of the master statesman.
He had concentrated on making the arms deal and lobbying for the Freedom Support Act, which would give him economic breathing room. But he had not foreseen the impact of an afterthought: his revelation that he had discovered evidence of missing Americans in the K.G.B. archives. (They cannot be, as speculated, U-2 pilots; the C.I.A. insists that only Francis Gary Powers was downed.) To Yeltsin's dismay, this became a political impediment to his goal. Americans become passionate on the subject of prisoners of war. Senator John McCain, a former P.O.W., promptly said he would withhold approval of economic aid until the matter was cleared up, and Senator Richard Lugar followed.
Yeltsin moved fast. During his formal address to the joint meeting of Congress, he inserted: "I assure you that even if one American has been detained in my country, and can still be found, I will find him; I will get him back to his family."
Brought the house down. Then he put in the embarrassing zinger: "So now you are telling me, first do the job, and then we shall support you in passing that act. I don't quite understand you."
That changed the political mood. Afterward, Senator McCain went to him, was personally reassured, and withdrew his opposition. Yeltsin's improvisation worked.
Now remains the opposition of the soft-liners led by House Speaker Tom Foley. He is fearful of the selfish, isolationist sentiment of many voters about foreign aid. Nor is he alone; it took Richard Nixon (now touring Russia to escape Watergate anniversary orgies) to pressure George Bush to propose to join the Western salvation package.
Are Democrats to be the new soft-liners? Or will Bill Clinton exercise party leadership and persuade Congressional Democrats to invest a few billions now -- to avert the need for trillions in armaments tomorrow if democracy in Russia fails?
Let's hope so; we won't get much help from controversy-averse Ross Perot (who just canceled his date with Congress to discuss M.I.A.'s, fearful of being asked under oath about his business proposition to the Vietnamese). This is the time for a profile in courage from Mr. Clinton: not just a pious statement, but some responsible arm-twisting.
Give Mr. Bush and James Baker good marks on the arms deal, presuming the timetable can be speeded and that S.D.I. cooperation was not neglected. The new hard-liners hope Bush also pressed the need to get Russian troops out of the Baltics and K.G.B. agents out of Washington.
And give more than a grudging salute to Boris Yeltsin. He left us with a profound thought to chew over: "Today, the freedom of America is being upheld in Russia." By helping freedom there, we advance it here.

HEADLINE: Japan Had to Join in U.N. Peacekeeping Effort

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Japanese parliament has at last approved Japan's participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations (front page, June 16). It is more important than ever that your simplistic interpretation of opposition to the legislation in "Japan's Healthy Military Allergy" (editorial, June 2) not be allowed to stand unchallenged.
The Governments of Prime Ministers Toshiki Kaifu and Kiichi Miyazawa have wisely sought to begin a process that would slowly diversify and normalize Japan's security relations multilaterally. The reason is not difficult to grasp. The status quo in East Asia rests largely on the United States-Japan security arrangement, in which the United States provides a defense umbrella for Japan. 
 That relationship alone has made it possible for Japan to avoid creating alternative security structures, and it alone has given Japan's neighbors confidence that Japan is being held in check. But alter those terms, as Congress is certain to do before long, now that the cold war is over and Japan's wealth is exceeded only by our own, and all bets are off. Japan would be left in a security void, which would send both it and its neighbors scrambling in undesirable unilateralist military directions.
Fully aware of that prospect, Japan has persuaded the annual postministerial conference of the Association of South East Asian Nations to address political and security issues, in addition to economic ones. Together with its allies and the International Atomic Energy Agency, Japan has deployed its diplomatic skills and financial carrots to flush out and try to arrest North Korea's nuclear intentions. Japan is playing a major administrative and financial role in disarming and rebuilding Cambodia. And Japan has even explored establishing a working relationship with the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
The peacekeeping bill was yet another, and a particularly critical, step in the direction of normalization through multilateralization.
Moreover, the constitutional issue is far more complicated than you suggest. The consensus among many legal scholars in Japan is that the Self-Defense Forces themselves may be unconstitutional. By definition, therefore, any foreign deployment of them also would appear to be so. At the same time, however, it is doubtful that the American drafters of Japan's Constitution would have equated the modest noncombatant activities of peacekeeping operations with the resolution of international disputes by the use of force, which is what Japan's Constitution prohibits.
To complicate matters further, Japan has, like every other signatory of the United Nations Charter, a solemn treaty obligation to negotiate an Article 43 agreement with the United Nations that puts fighting forces, not simply peacekeeping troops, at the disposal of the Security Council.
Finally, it is important not to ignore the electoral dimension of the issue. It is surely true that many individuals in the opposition parties worry sincerely about a revival of Japanese militarism and about the constitutional issues raised by the new peacekeeping unit. But it is also true that a very important election for the upper house of Japan's parliament will be held in July, and several of the opposition parties have been happily posturing themselves as opponents of Japanese militarism.
If Japan's Government can be faulted for anything on this issue, it is for not being bold enough. For example, Japan should propose to its neighbors joint programs and facilities for collectively training their peacekeeping troops. Such an arrangement would build confidence in the region, and in Japan.
A proposal to Russia to use one or more of the disputed Northern Territories for that purpose could realize interesting results, by providing a face-saving device for Russia to return the islands to Japan and to benefit, in turn, from Japan's economic largess.

A Setback for Pay-Per-View

 BODY:
An amendment passed last night by a Congressional committee would essentially prevent the four major leagues from pursuing pay-per-view telecasts of their championship games.
The amendment to a bill in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, co-authored by Representatives GERRY SIKORSKI of Minnesota and EDWARD J. MARKEY of Massachusetts, both Democrats, was formulated in the wake of the recent Stanley Cup finals between the Chicago Blackhawks and Pittsburgh Penguins. The Hawks' home games were available only to subscribers who paid a premium. 
 The bill, regulating cable-TV rates, next goes to the House floor for a vote.
The amendment would make it mandatory for local cable regulating agencies to set the price of a pay-per-view telecast. "For political and economic reasons, it would be a ban," said MIKE CONNOLLY, a spokesman for Markey. He explained that local commissions would not allow events of such magnitude to be kept off free television.
The National Football League previously promised Markey that it would not employ pay-per-view of the Super Bowl at least until the end of the century. Basketball and baseball indicated their championship games also would remain on "over-the-air" television.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Financing;
Lagging in the Polls, Clinton Also Faces a Cash Shortage

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 18

 BODY:
As Ross Perot has catapulted to the top of the polls and Gov. Bill Clinton has fallen into third place, the Arkansas Governor's fund raising has also lagged, drawing his campaign so deep into debt that he has been unable to pay hundreds of campaign employees on time.
Campaign officials explain that Mr. Perot's surging candidacy has made it harder for Mr. Clinton to raise money. 
 Even as Mr. Clinton has won enough delegates to clinch the Democratic nomination, his campaign has become so financially weakened that for the first time in memory, the Democratic National Committee is providing significant funds directly to the candidate before his formal nomination.
That, in turn, has led to criticism from senior Republicans. The Republican National Committee is now preparing to file a complaint with Federal election officials accusing the Democratic Party of illegally financing Mr. Clinton's Presidential campaign.
 
Move to Embarrass Clinton
 The complaint, which will be filed with the Federal Election Commission on Friday, is largely symbolic and is not likely to bring any significant penalties. But it could still prove politically embarrassing by highlighting the serious cash shortage confronting Mr. Clinton's campaign.
Financially, Mr. Clinton has suddenly become the weakest of the three candidates. His campaign now owes an Arkansas bank more than $2.7 million. "For fund raising, Perot becomes an excuse not to contribute until people know what it means," said Donald R. Sweitzer, a fund raiser for Mr. Clinton who was the finance director for the Democratic National Committee in 1988. "The Perot phenomenon hurts."
The campaign will receive a large cash infusion from the Government at the end of next month's Democratic National Convention. The money will come from citizens who opt to provide $1 from their income taxes to finance the general election.
 
$400,000 Advance From Party
 For now, though, the cash shortage has forced Mr. Clinton to take on a grueling schedule of fund-raisers this month. It also prompted the Democratic National Committee to advance him $400,000 to pay for a half-hour television "town hall" appearance from Pittsburgh last Friday. This is the advance that the Republicans are complaining about. But the more serious problem for Mr. Clinton is that he will have to pay back this advance, and perhaps other loans too, from funds that are usually saved for use after the July convention.
"It has been an unfortunate distraction from the campaign, but it's real," Mr. Sweitzer said. "The fact that the Clinton campaign has been strapped for cash is a problem, but it's not overwhelming."
The Republicans say the $400,000 payment was improper since the election regulations sharply restrict party contributions during the primaries, and Mr. Clinton used the television program paid for with party money to solicit contributions to help pay off primary debts.
"What it really points up is the dire straits Clinton's campaign faces until the convention because nobody's giving him money," said Benjamin L. Ginsberg, chief counsel to the Republican National Committee, who prepared the complaint.
The Democrats respond that they are no longer bound by primary restraints because Mr. Clinton already has enough delegates to win the nomination next month.
"We can make general election expenditures now," said Carol C. Darr, a lawyer for the Democratic National Committee. She said the party based its decision on a 1984 opinion by the election commission that permitted the Republicans to use funds before the convention to run television advertisements for President Reagan.
Once they are formally nominated this summer, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bush would each receive $55.2 million from the Government to spend on the general election, and their parties will get $10.3 million that can be spent for the conventions and the general election.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bush will also benefit from hundreds of millions of dollars of "soft money" raised by local party and independent groups that can be used to help the candidates in exercises like voter registration drives and get-out-the-vote appeals.
 
Perot Is On His Own
 Mr. Perot, on the other hand, has pledged to forgo all Federal financing. Under a 1976 Supreme Court ruling, he can spend as much as he likes. The billionaire businessman has said he is willing to spend $100 million or more of his own money, and virtually all the money he has spent so far has been his own.
Mr. Clinton's campaign raised about $2.3 million in May, and campaign officials say it has already raised $1 million this month and hopes to raise another $1.5 million to $2 million in the rest of June. But that is less than expected, and expenses are still significantly outpacing the campaign's contributions -- so much so that it is behind in paying more than 200 campaign employees.
Any debt Mr. Clinton carries over from the primary season will only eat into his available financing for the general election. With the economy still weak, some corporate and individual contributors who gave in the last general election may not give this time. And with Mr. Clinton in third place in the polls, his fund-raisers say they have had a harder than usual time finding new money.
"There are fewer millionaires than there were in 1988 and fewer people who are able to write $1,000 checks," Mr. Sweitzer said. He noted that four years ago Mr. Dukakis was in considerably better financial shape.
 
$2.7 Million in Loans
 Mr. Clinton's latest campaign disclosure statement, which covers the period ended April 30, showed that he had more than $2.7 million in outstanding loans and that he only had $258,000, less than a quarter of Mr. Dukakis's available funds for the similar period four years ago. That is also much less than President Bush has. The President's campaign is debt-free, and in a new filing on Saturday is expected to show that it had more than $8 million in cash on hand at the end of May.
Most of Mr. Clinton's debt is owed to the Worthen National Bank of Little Rock. It is primarily owned by the Stephens family, an influential group that has helped Mr. Clinton raise money in his gubernatorial races and has also contributed substantially to the Republicans. The family has vast holdings in natural gas and real estate and owns one of the nation's largest investment firms.

HEADLINE: Bucking Traditions in Trenton: G.O.P. Budget

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 18

 BODY:
No government document is more political than a budget, and the one unveiled by the omnipotent new Republican legislative majority in Trenton today represents a stark repudiation of nearly two decades of moderate to liberal government under both Democratic and Republican administrations.
Riding a tide of anti-tax anger in New Jersey, the Republicans rescinded or gutted a host of social and other programs for the poor and middle class endorsed not only by their archenemy Jim Florio, the Democratic Governor, but also by his Republican predecessor, Thomas H. Kean. 
 All told, the Republicans, who hold vetoproof majorities in both houses of the Legislature, cut $1.1 billion from the Governor's proposed budget for the fiscal year starting next month, although a large part of it, most notably $385 million in rebates to property taxpayers, amounted to a shift, not a cut. [Page B4.]
The Republicans have also taken aim at about 900 middle managers and about that many other state employees whose jobs would be eliminated when the Motor Vehicles Department and the state-owned New Jersey Network television system are "privatized." Other state workers could come under the ax if the budget gap widens further, as some legislators say it may if the sputtering economy continues to put the lie to predictions of an upswing.
The current Republican policy of restraint is in sharp contrast to Mr. Kean's tenure, when the state budget rose substantially every year, doubling from $6 billion to $12 billion over his eight years in office as the state work force increased 20 percent.
One clear example of the U-turn the Republicans are making this year is their plan to sever the New Jersey Network from the state and turn it over to another noncommercial operator, probably WNET, Channel 13. That was not the way Governor Kean wanted things.
It was in the Kean administration that plans were laid and bonds approved to build a $23 million studio and headquarters for the public television system. The building is even now under construction in Trenton. The new Republican budget cuts the network's $8 million appropriation in half and calls for dissolving the system within six months as part of a sweeping drive to "privatize" state functions.
Political and legal realities seem to have thwarted Republican plans for sharp cuts in aid to higher education, desegregation assistance and affirmative-action programs.
 
Scuttled at 11th Hour
 The original Republican plan, scuttled at the 11th hour because of outcries from education officials that tuition would soar by between $200 and $300 a semester at state-supported colleges, proposed dropping a $30 million appropriation for tuition assistance.
But the Department of Human Services, which primarily assists the poor, was not so fortunate. Its proposed $3.7 billion appropriation was reduced by more than $190 million.
Assistance to mass transit, support for the arts -- another area that was dear to the heart of Governor Kean -- and general assistance to the poor will be hard hit this time.
The budget cuts include $35 million in aid to N.J. Transit, which the Republicans insist will not result in fare increases because of offsetting operational cuts. They are also considering making N.J. Transit private, a prospect that sends shudders through riders who remember the shoddy service and poor maintenance that plagued the private system N.J. Transit replaced more than a decade ago.
 
A Voice May Be Silenced
 The Republican budget ax actually has swung as far back as 1974, the year the Legislature, in the administration of Gov. Brendan T. Byrne, created the Department of the Public Advocate as the "voice of the voiceless" that would bring lawsuits in the public interest, particularly helping the poor.
Under the Republican budget plan, two divisions of the Advocate's office would be all but eliminated. It is probably not coincidental that several Republican legislators called last year for the resignation of the Public Advocate, Wilfredo Caraballo, because he had joined a suit to allow the integration of schools across district lines.
When the court agreed with Mr. Caraballo this week, a prominent Republican newcomer to the Legislature, Senator John P. Scott, who represents parts of Bergen, Essex and Passaic Counties, told his colleagues, "We cannot wait any longer to act and stop the liberal courts and Florio's social engineers."
The Republicans, with two-thirds majorities in both houses -- enough to override any Florio veto -- had also planned to drop about $14 million in desegregation assistance to school districts from the budget, but they reinstituted the funds when it appeared that cutting them could thwart court orders.
Political considerations apparently saved about $100 million in municipal aid when the Republican majority, whose representation across the state is so broad that the cutbacks would affect many of their constituents, restored much of the money in the final version of the budget.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE SUMMIT;
U.S. Backs Easier Terms for Russian Aid

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 18

 BODY:
The Bush Administration, in a shift of approach toward aid for Moscow, has called on the International Monetary Fund to ease some demands for harsh reform and not delay an aid agreement once Russia commits itself to broad economic changes.
Administration officials said today that they feared that a delay in signing an accord with the I.M.F. would block the flow of economic assistance and destabilize the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin at a time when Western governments want nothing more than to consolidate Moscow's fledgling democracy. 
 "The reason we have a sense of urgency on the economic side is if Boris Yeltsin can't succeed on economic reform, he will have a hard time staying as leader in Russia," a senior Administration official said. "This could seriously threaten the democratic reforms that are so much in our interest. The I.M.F. agreement is key to this."
 
Shift Is Linked to Reforms
 The Administration's position this week was in contrast to its statements of a year ago. Last July, for example, at a meeting of the major industrial nations in London, President Bush was less eager than several European leaders to grant President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's request for extensive aid.
Administration officials said then that technical aid was appropriate, asserting that economic aid would be wasted because Russia had not yet begun comprehensive reforms.
The Administration's view began to change after the Soviet Union collapsed in December and President Yeltsin spoke out in favor of radical changes. Last winter, Washington took a leading role in forging the industrial nations' $24 billion aid package. With Mr. Yeltsin's visit, the Administration appears to be taking an even more active role on Russia's behalf.
 
Changes Is Called Too Tough
 Some Administration officials argue that I.M.F. economists are demanding changes that are too difficult to carry out. These include requiring Russia to reduce its budget deficit to zero and removing all price controls on oil: changes that may be so strict that Russia will balk at an accord, which is essential for receiving billions of dollars in new aid.
The Administration's decision to pressure the I.M.F. began to emerge on Monday as President Yeltsin arrived in Washington, and it appears to have solidified after the favorable impression Mr. Yeltsin made from his concessions on arms control and his conversations at the White House and appearance in the Congress.
Last year, the United States and the other major industrial nations making up what is known as the Group of Seven asked the I.M.F. to take the leading role in coordinating aid for Russia because of the fund's experience in pressing developing countries for reforms in return for loans. But now some American officials worry that the I.M.F.'s hard-line bankers and economists might be prescribing medicine far tougher than the Group of Seven doctors had ordered.
During Mr. Yeltsin's visit here, Russian and American officials engaged in rare public jawboning to press the I.M.F. not to drive too hard a bargain.
"If there is such a thing as a Chevrolet three-speed stick-shift agreement with the I.M.F., as opposed to a Cadillac agreement, and if we can get a Chevrolet, then let's do it," a senior Administration official said.
 
Aid Flow Is Tied to Pact
 The Russians are eager for an agreement because it will enable them to tap much of the $24 billion aid package for 1992 that the industrial countries pledged in April. The package includes $11 billion in bilateral aid from various participating countries, $6 billion for a special multilateral fund to stabilize the ruble and about $4.5 billion in loans from the I.M.F. and World Bank.
While I.M.F. and Russian officials say there is broad agreement on what reforms are needed, the talks have become snarled over details, some Russian negotiators say. Marking the American shift in approach, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said on Monday that if Russia committed itself to move forward in several important areas, Washington would press the I.M.F. not to delay an agreement because of concerns about minor details.
American officials have recently said that while they would like the I.M.F. to sign an agreement with Russia as soon as possible, they would be willing to wait a few weeks if that was what it took to insure a solid agreement.
In an apparent sign that the I.M.F. also recognizes a need for urgency, the fund's Managing Director, Michel Camdessus, and Yegor T. Gaidar, Russia's Acting Prime Minister, issued a joint statement today saying they are "in basic agreement on the crucial objectives of an economic strategy devised to restore and sustain growth in the Russian economy on the basis of a market-oriented system."
The two officials met in Washington for three hours today, after a 40-minute meeting Wednesday. Their statement said "both sides were confident" that the negotiations "would lead to an early agreement on a program."
Russia has sought to sign an accord by July 1, but this week some I.M.F. officials said it might not happen until early September.
American pressure on the I.M.F. may not be easy, even though the United States is its biggest shareholder. I.M.F. officials assert, for example, that if they show leniency to Russia in negotiating an agreement, then African and Latin nations will demand similar leniency when they sign agreements with the monetary fund.
 
Fears of Nullifying Aid
 Some of Russia's negotiators expressed fears that the I.M.F.'s technical staff, in demanding tough commitments from Russia, would nullify the benefits of much of the $24 billion in aid the Group of Seven pledged to Russia in April. For example, according to negotiators for Russia, the monetary fund says that if Russia draws any money from a $6 billion fund planned to stabilize the ruble, then Russia should pay back that money within 90 days.
Such a demand, Russia's negotiators said, could render the ruble fund almost meaningless because it would force Russia, which is desperately short of hard currency reserves, to be the main country carrying the burden of underwriting the ruble -- not the 11 wealthy countries that have promised to back the ruble fund.
Administration officials say Russia should commit itself to reforms in three essential areas: reining in its budget deficit, keeping its money supply and credit under control, and making the ruble convertible -- that is, allowing anyone possessing rubles to exchange them for hard currency -- to help integrate Russia into the world economy.
I.M.F. negotiators also want Russia to move in these areas, but they have pressed Russia further, asking Moscow to remove controls on oil prices as soon as possible. In recent months, Russia has let oil prices more than quadruple, creating much hardship.
"They've already had a dramatic increase in prices," a senior Administration official said today. "Clearly the goal should be to liberalize energy prices as soon as possible, but whether that should be an absolute quid pro quo for an I.M.F. agreement, I don't know. There is a limit to what the political traffic will bear right now."
On Monday, Treasury Under Secretary David C. Mulford, said the I.M.F. should be quick to negotiate an accord, but should not rush itself into a weak agreement.
"There has to be a sufficient quality there to establish credibility," he said. "This may take time, and probably it is more important to get the quality in place even if it takes an extra few weeks of negotiation."
One of the most difficult points in Russia's talks with the I.M.F. is that the fund wants Moscow to coordinate its monetary policy with other former Soviet republics that plan to use the ruble. This demand, I.M.F. and Russian officials concede, will be difficult to meet because some of the other republics do not want to sacrifice their control over monetary policy. But Russian officials say that if other republics continue to print billions of rubles, it will be impossible to control inflation.

The poll, conducted in May by the Gallup Organization and commissioned by a coalition of groups seeking fundamental changes in the structure and policy of the church, was released as the nation's bishops gathered at the University of Notre Dame for their first open debate on a pastoral letter on the role of women in church and society. The letter, crafted over a period of nine years, deplores "the sin of sexism" but affirms Vatican positions against female priests, artificial birth control and abortion. 
 The poll shows that lay Catholics are at odds with their bishops and the Vatican on these and other issues. Sixty-seven percent of Catholics agreed with the statement, "It would be a good thing if women were allowed to be ordained as priests," up from 47 percent in 1985. The poll also found that 70 percent favored allowing priests to marry, up from 49 percent in 1971.
Ruth McDonough Fitzpatrick of the Women's Ordination Conference, a sponsor of the poll, said it demonstrated that the bishops were "clearly not in touch with the pulse of the people." But the poll also found that Pope John Paul II was overwhelmingly popular: 84 percent agreed with the statement that he was "doing a good job in leading the church," and only 10 percent disagreed.
 
Differences by Age
 The poll also showed that Catholics under the age of 35 were more likely to favor change, a finding that the sponsors said signaled that the problems were not going to go away.
The poll, conducted by telephone in English and Spanish among 802 Catholics nationwide from May 5 to 17, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
Sister Maureen Fiedler, co-director of one of the sponsoring groups, Catholics Speak Out, said the poll demonstrated "nothing less than a quiet but massive grass-roots revolution" in the American church. She added, "The people have developed a whole new consensus of opinion and behavior different from that of the bishops, but which they believe is morally acceptable to their consciences and faithful to the Catholic tradition."
Bishop Raymond J. Boland, chairman of the bishops' communication committee, said today that he had not had time to study the Gallup poll or a Time magazine poll released earlier this week that also showed widespread dissent among the Catholic laity, but he added:
"The church decides its doctrine on 2,000 years of traditional teaching based on the Scriptures and the message of our Lord Jesus Christ. We're not about to change it just because of the polls."
Polls, he said, are of value at times but "extremely transient."
 
Effect on Church Policy
 A number of Catholic experts said today that they were struck by the sharp increase in support for ordination of women, but they were divided on how it would affect church policy. "These people are getting their message across," the Rev. Thomas A. Reese, a Jesuit and author of several books on the priests, said of the liberal Catholic groups. "The bishops are not."
Mary T. Hanna, a political scientist at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash., who specializes in religion and politics, said she agreed with Sister Maureen that a grass-roots revolution was building.
She said she suspected that if it were up to American bishops, the church would soon ordain women as priests. "But it's not up to American bishops," she went on. "It's up to the Pope and to Rome, and I don't believe we're going to see it happen in the lifetime of this Pope."
But Andrew M. Greeley, a professor of social science at the University of Chicago, said he did not believe the growing support for ordination of women and for allowing priests to marry would sway American bishops in the least.
"I would say that opposition among bishops has increased with the appointments in the past few years," he said. "Some have been appointed for that reason alone. You have to understand that these are the matters of the highest import when it comes to appointments."
"And I don't think Rome will take note either," Professor Greeley added.
He said he would not characterize the increases as a revolution in Catholic sentiment. "It's a pretty sharp trend line up," he said. "But I would only call it a revolution if you could persuade me that this is something that's really high on people's agendas. This poll can't show us really how important this is to everyone. If people started doing something about their convictions, like cutting off their contributions to the church, then I might call it a revolution."
Representatives of the seven groups that commissioned the study were on hand today at Notre Dame. In addition to groups advocating women in the clergy were those seeking greater roles in the church for married men and homosexuals.
Several of those involved in the sponsoring groups were priests, brothers and nuns. They held a news conference this morning at the Notre Dame Library Auditorium, and later in the afternoon many of them joined a "feminist liturgy" in which women consecrated bread in apparent violation of canon law.
Also on hand at the campus were the bishops, many of whom stayed in the dormitories recently vacated by students. The bishops met for their review of the pastoral letter on women in the nearby Joyce Athletic and Convocation Center. Their four-day meeting included time for business as well as time for prayer and quiet reflection.
 
Bishops' Policies Contradicted
 The sponsors of the poll called the pastoral letter "fatally flawed" because it accepted Vatican policies.
Many of the findings of the survey contradicted the stated policies of the bishops and the Vatican.
For example, the bishops have taken a strong position against the use of condoms as a means to prevent the spread of AIDS. But 83 percent of those questioned favored the use of condoms.
Only 13 percent of Catholics agreed with the bishops that abortion could never be a moral choice. Forty-one said it was morally acceptable in rare circumstances and another 41 percent said it was morally acceptable in many or all circumstances.
Forty-eight percent of Catholics agreed with the bishops that relations between gay or lesbian people in a committed relationship could not be morally acceptable. But 46 percent said that such relations could be morally acceptable.
And while the bishops are opposed to capital punishment, 66 percent of Catholic favor it, reflecting the rough percentage of all Americans who support it.
Respondents to the poll also made it clear that they would like to see the church adopt more democratic principles.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE SUMMIT;
Ol' Khrushchev Trail Leads Yeltsin to Kansas

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WICHITA, Kan., June 18

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia was beaming today when he met Dmitri Antoniadi, a fellow Russian and a student at a university in this city on the Kansas plains.
But his smile grew when he was told that Mr. Antoniadi's father is the manager of a Pizza Hut restaurant in Moscow, part of the capitalist beachhead that the former Communist is so eager to see develop into an all-out assault on the Soviet past. 
 "I'll make a point of going to that restaurant," Mr. Yeltsin told Mr. Antoniadi and about 500 others in a speech at Wichita State University. "I hope he doesn't ask me to pay in dollars. I don't have any."
The audience laughed. Mr. Yeltsin waved and continued on a hectic, four-hour tour that swept through this city like one of the tornadoes that have made Kansas famous from Moscow to Oz.
 
Barbecue and Wheat
 Mr. Yeltsin began at an Air Force base where warplanes were once on around-the-clock alert, ready to destroy the Russian homeland. Accompanied by his host, Senator Bob Dole, Mr. Yeltsin then toured a meat-packing plant, gave his speech at Wichita State University, downed a lunch of barbecued pork and tried harvesting wheat.
Mr. Yeltsin was following a Russian trail first blazed in 1959 by Nikita S. Khrushchev, who whisked across the United States, savoring his first hot dog and marveling at the lush corn fields of Iowa.
"The Midwest is more like central Russia than any other part of the United States," Ronald G. Suny, a professor of Russian history at the University of Michigan, said in a telephone interview. "It corresponds with Central Russia: A great flat plain producing grain. So it makes a kind of symbolic sense for these leaders to go there."
 
A 'Wonderful' Neo-Capitalist
 Mr. Khrushchev had lunch on the farm of Roswell and Elizabeth Garst, near Coon Rapids, Iowa. Mr. Garst died in 1977 but his widow said the other day: "I hope he knows what's going on in Russia. I think it's great. He would, too. It's wonderful, their struggling along, becoming capitalists. When Mr. Khrushchev was here, I think everyone had fun."
The fun in Kansas began today at McConnell Air Force Base, where the welcomers included Melissa Hettich, Miss Kansas World 1992. "I think it's great that he has the opportunity to get a little taste of Kansas because we have a lot to offer," she said.
Such as?
"That's a good question," Ms. Hettich said. "I think it's important to know we have some of the friendliest people around. We don't have mountains but the Flint Hills are beautiful. And the wheat fields are important because they symbolize us."
Standing nearby was Maj. James E. Hazuka and his family. Major Hazuka has spent most of his 14-year Air Force career in the Strategic Air Command, whose only mission has been to bomb the Soviet Union on a moment's notice.
 
'Feel Good About the Future'
 "It's great," he said. "This is something I thought would never happen, a Russian leader standing 50 yards away. I feel very good about the future, with only one exception: the economy. But I don't think Yeltsin can do anything about that."
Mr. Yeltsin quickly charmed the crowd of warriors and their families and friends when he talked of peace and then shook hands with some of the 300 people on hand.
The largest cheer came when Mr. Yeltsin said, "There will never be war between our two countries, I am convinced of that."
Mr. Yeltsin said that some might wonder why he had decided to stop in Wichita, besides Washington the only city in the country on his schedule. "I know you have not been showered with state visits before," he said, adding that he had come to Wichita to learn about agricultural techniques.
Then Mr. Yeltsin worked the crowd like a big-city mayor two days before election day.
Children must hold a special spell over politicians because one of the first hands Mr. Yeltsin shook belonged to Brendan Lindsey, who is 2.
But Mr. Yeltsin wasn't satisfied with just shaking the boy's hand. He took him from his father and held him in his arms. Later, as Mr. Yeltsin's motorcade left the air base, Brendan's father, Troy, a 28-year-old financial analyst from Wichita, said, "I'm very proud. We'll go get some ice cream and call mom."
 
Thumbs-Up, a Lot
 Mr. Lindsey said Mr. Yeltsin had said something to him as he handed his son back, "but they never interpreted it."
"All I could understand," Mr. Lindsey said, "was the thumbs-up sign."
Later, Mr. Yeltsin toured Dold Meatpacking Plant, where he walked up to Marilyn Terto, 34, who was working on the hambone line.
How much do you make? Mr. Yeltsin asked her, to which she answered, $9.43 an hour.
"All right, all right," he said, flashing thumbs-up as slabs of pork whirled past on hooks.
While her husband toured the meat-packing plant, Naina Yeltsin attended a reception in her honor, with Elizabeth Dole as host, at a local hotel. From there she took a wagon ride at the Cowtown Museum, a recreation of a Kansas prairie town 100 years ago.
Another site Mr. Yeltsin visited was the farm of Greg and Sandra Rau, who spent the week sprucing up their 2,000-acre spread. Their farm, a few miles from the Air Force base, was selected to give Mr. Yeltsin a taste of Kansas farm life.
But the visit came at a busy time for the Raus: Because of heavy rains lately, the farmers are behind in harvesting the spring wheat.
"It has been exhausting," Mr. Rau said. "But we're very proud."
The Raus turned their farm into a showcase, parking a fleet of shiny combines and tractors in a field for Mr. Yeltsin to inspect.
Mr. Yeltsin, seeming to know his way around farm machinery, climbed into the cab of a green combine, waved people out of the way and jerked it forward. Clara Belden, a farmer and a high school English teacher, watched Mr. Yeltsin, helped by Mr. Rau, drive the combine around the field.
"I thought that was the magic moment," Mrs. Belden said. "As farmers we know being in that combine is a place we feel most deeply what the harvest is all about.""
Some of it may wind up in Russian bakeries. In 1991 the United States exported 3.9 million metric tons of wheat to the Soviet Union, according to the Agriculture Department, this year just over 4 million tons have already gone to Russia and the other former Soviet republics.
Before he left for the airport for a trip to Canada, Mr. Yeltsin was asked what he would most like to take back with him from Kansas.
"Everything," he said.

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT;
Backers of '78 Tax Revolt Hail Ruling

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 18

 BODY:
Backers of the California property tax revolt that was upheld today by the United States Supreme Court rejoiced in what they said was an affirmation of the citizen's right to keep down taxes.
"The question was, 'Do people have a right to control their own destiny regarding taxation?' And the answer is: yes," said Joel D. Fox, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association. 
 Mr. Jarvis, now dead, was the co-author of Proposition 13, the centerpiece of the California tax revolt in 1978 that halted property-tax increases but also contributed in the long run to an $11 billion budget deficit that is now paralyzing the State Legislature, which is struggling to pass a budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1.
 
Governor Praises Ruling
 In an 8-1 ruling today, the Supreme Court left in place what it called California's "grand experiment" in popular limitations on taxation.
"There is clearly no question about it that the dramatic falloff in revenue to local governments and the fact that the state has had to finance more and more of local services has contributed in large measure to the deficit," said Ann Carlson, a lawyer who represented the plaintiff in the case, Stephanie Nordlinger, a homeowner in Southern California.
Gov. Pete Wilson, whose administration has been defined by the challenges of the staggering budget deficit, nevertheless praised the ruling today, saying property-tax controls fostered a positive business climate.
"Proposition 13 is essential to our efforts to protect Californians from unfair and crippling property taxes, especially the elderly who live on limited and fixed incomes," he said. "Only by keeping a tight rein on taxes can we keep California competitive and not allow it to turn into the job-killing machine that higher taxes would result in."
 
What Proposition Did
 When it was enacted in 1978 after a statewide referendum, Proposition 13 set the property tax rate at 1 percent of the property's value and decreed that assessments be rolled back to their 1975-76 level. The tax cannot increase faster than 2 percent a year, under the proposition. Buyers who bought property after 1978 would pay taxes based on the market value.
The rollback was intended to prevent the elderly and other long-time property owners from being forced out of their homes after property taxes had skyrocketed in the late 1970's because of soaring property values. But in a booming real estate market, one of the results of Proposition 13 was to create wild imbalances between the low taxes of long-time residents and the soaring rates of new buyers.
Ms. Nordlinger's lawyers told the Court she was forced by Proposition 13 to pay the same taxes on her modest home in a middle-income neighborhood as the long-time owner of a house worth $2.1 million in an exclusive portion of Malibu. The lawyers argued that the discrepancy in property taxes violated the equal-protection clause of the United States Constitution.
 
Changed 'Way Money Is Raised'
 In addition to its impact on the state budget, Cynthia Kroll, an economist, said Proposition 13 resulted in a reliance by local communities on new development for revenues to support new roads, schools and other services, while maintenance of existing infrastructure suffered.
"Proposition 13 has changed the whole way money is raised in California," she said."It has affected the way development has occurred and has left the state with some real growth dilemmas."
With the recession, such development has also slowed, further squeezing local budgets, said Ms. Kroll, who is regional economist for the Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California at Berkeley.
With Proposition 13 in place for more than a decade, said Los Angeles County Assessor Kenneth Hahn, "It would have been absolute chaos if the Court had not made the decision they made, because we have 2.3 million properties which would have had to be reassessed." He said his office had estimated that it would have taken more than seven years to reappraise every property in the county.
Philip M. Tatarowicz, national director of state and local tax services for Ernst & Young, said today's ruling might give an impetus to other states to attempt to adopt California's approach to controlling rising property taxes.
More common around the nation, he said, is a "circuit breaker" system that limits property-tax increases as a proportion of income.
But he noted that the Supreme Court ruling today had been based on specific arguments and that there were still issues that could provide grounds for further challenges to Proposition 13. "So I don't think we've heard the last word," he said.

HEADLINE: Fed Will Push Inflation Fight

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., June 18

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Board intends to continue squeezing inflation down, a Fed governor said today.
The official, John P. LaWare, spoke to reporters while attending a hearing of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council here. 
 Inflation has been "on a downward trend, and we hope to keep it headed in that direction," he said.
Inflation is running at about a 3 percent rate so far this year, down slightly from last year's 3.1 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index.

HEADLINE: After the Cold War: Views From Vietnam;
Vietnam, Now Master of Its Own House, Tries to Mend Neighborhood Fences

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam

 BODY:
For the first time since French gunboats laid waste to the port of Da Nang in 1858 and began the colonization of what became French Indochina, Vietnam is free of domination by distant powers. But the post-cold-war task of emerging from the umbrella of the old Soviet Union and finding a new place in the rapidly developing region of Southeast Asia is daunting.
"The collapse of the Soviet Union was a devastating blow for us," said Maj. Gen. Tran Cong Man, a Vietnamese Government spokesman. "The Soviet Union was our support, ideologically and psychologically, also militarily and economically. It was our unique model. Now we find it was a false model." 
 The end of the unequal alliance between Hanoi and Moscow means much more than political, diplomatic and economic disarray; it marks a turning point in Vietnamese history.
France, temporarily succeeded by Japan during World War II, returned briefly as a colonial power and was replaced, after the defeat at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, by the United States in the southern half of the newly partitioned country. The American defeat in 1975 enabled the Soviet Union to take over for 16 years as the foreign power on which Vietnam depended.
"It was very unfortunate for us that Vietnam was put in the focus of superpower conflicts for many decades, and it is good for us not to be tied into the framework of bipolar confrontations," Deputy Foreign Minister Tran Quang Co said in an interview here. "We would like to have the same fate as other Southeast Asian countries -- independence, peace and stability. But unhappily for Vietnam, there is still an enormous gap."
 
A Blow for the Old Guard
 The end of Moscow's economic and military support has been a particularly heavy blow for Vietnam's old-guard, orthodox Communist leadership, forcing this country of 66 million people to abandon its dominant position over neighboring Cambodia and Laos.
Its military forces and advisers have been mainly withdrawn, and its leaders now assert that Hanoi never aspired to control the old French Indochina.
Vietnam's signature last October of the Paris agreement to settle the Cambodian conflict formalized its fading from leadership in Indochina. A senior Laotian diplomat said: "We can't speak any more of a special solidarity, as in the past. Cooperation will no longer be on an ideological basis but on the basis of good neighborliness."
The Soviet collapse has obliged all three nations to redirect their diplomacy toward an accommodation with China. During their war against the United States, the Communist leaders in the three countries had the full support of both the Soviet Union and China, despite the rivalry between Moscow and Beijing. The American withdrawal ended this marriage of convenience.
 
Soviet Clients
 Vietnam and Laos slid into the Soviet orbit; Cambodia, under the Khmer Rouge, followed its historic anti-Vietnamese outlook and accepted Chinese tutelage. The Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1979 and the installation of a puppet government in Phnom Penh made all three Soviet clients.
"We committed the error of having one friend only and chose confrontation with China," said General Man. "We should have been more flexible. We will always live next to China. It is a demographic power. We must never confront them."
"We are very happy at having succeeded in normalizing our relations with China," said Mr. Co, the Deputy Foreign Minister, who also served as Vietnam's Ambassador to Thailand. "We think China, at least for this decade, also needs peace and stability for the modernization of the country. They have to shelve any other ambition for another time."
Vietnam wants to use the respite in tension with China to achieve its integration into Southeast Asia.
Le Bang, acting director of the Foreign Ministry's Americas Department, put it succinctly. "After the cold war, we can't rely on anyone and must be friends with everyone," he said.
 
An Old Rival
 In its effort to make friends with the non-Communist countries in the region, linked in the six-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Vietnam must deal with the considerable challenge of its historic rival, Thailand.
Vietnamese officials feel their withdrawal from Cambodia has reassured Thailand, but they say that Bangkok has asserted itself economically, in Cambodia and in Laos, as if it wants to achieve through trade and investment what Vietnam failed to gain through military and political might.
"The Thais show a bit of hegemonism," said General Man. "Economically it is difficult for us to do anything against it, but politically and also militarily we still have significant power to influence Laos and Cambodia."
But younger officials expressly deny any Vietnamese intention to act militarily again.
"We gave up the burden of Cambodia," said Mr. Bang. "We are not committing the mistake again of sending in troops and staying too long. The military is nothing today. We can't invade Cambodia and hold it."
 
A Difference in Attitudes
 The difference in attitudes between the older generation and the younger officials is another consequence of Vietnam's loss of its Soviet ally and the collapse of Communism.
Communist dogma persists in open contradiction to the laissez-faire economic liberalism that has been instituted in Vietnam, and which has in great measure succeeded in making up through trade and investment for the loss of Soviet aid, estimated at $1 billion a year. Faced with this success, the leadership of Do Muoi, the Communist Party Secretary General, and Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet faces a general crisis of confidence in Communism and the party.
"Vietnam is gradually going away from socialism," a senior Russian diplomat of long experience in Vietnam said. "Socialism here has become a tradition that is more rhetorical than real. But contrary to us Russians, who were bothered by the gap between ideology and real life, the Vietnamese know how to live with both.
"In the Vietnamese mind," the Russian continued, "there is peaceful coexistence of the old gods and the pragmatism of peasants and traders. Now they are leaving Marxism-Leninism behind on the altars of their ancestors. When they feel the need, at night, they pray to these gods, but during the day they do business."
 
Looking to Washington
 But there is unanimity throughout this country on what Vietnamese want from the United States.
"The remaining big point in our diplomacy is normalization with the United States," said Mr. Co. "I think we are now in the right direction in the process of establishing diplomatic relations, but it's a little too slow."
This was a diplomatic expression of palpable impatience, most pronounced among economic officials and independent-minded intellectuals, with the United States' refusal to end its embargo on dealings with Vietnam.
"I don't think the United States is missing all opportunities," joked Pham Chi Lan, deputy secretary general of the Chamber of Commerce. "But it shouldn't wait too long.
The American embargo is perceived as particularly harmful because United States opposition in the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and Asian Development Bank is preventing development loans for major projects to improve Vietnam's fragile infrastructure.
Several Vietnamese said they consider America's reluctance a potent asset to the leadership in its refusal to loosen its grip.
"America has won the cold war," said a senior military officer. "It can afford to be generous to us."
