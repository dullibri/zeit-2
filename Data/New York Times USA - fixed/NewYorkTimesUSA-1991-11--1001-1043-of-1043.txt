HEADLINE: Bank Aid Is Called Insufficient

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28

 BODY:
The Government's senior auditor says he believes the money provided by Congress this week to handle the banking crisis will not be sufficient and that it could be completely used up by the failure of just one of the nation's largest banks.
Charles A. Bowsher, the Comptroller General, said that existing accounting standards had enabled banks to conceal huge amounts of potential liabilities that could easily deplete the $70 billion or so that Congress, at the end of its session on Wednesday, provided in new taxpayer loans to keep afloat the insurance fund that protects bank deposits. 
 "If any one really large bank went down, you'd have them right back there," Mr. Bowsher said of the lawmakers.
 
'Much Bigger' Problem
 In an interview Wednesday night shortly after Congress voted, he added, "I've been worried that the problem is much bigger than the regulators and the Administration have admitted."
Mr. Bowsher heads the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress that is required to audit the bank insurance fund. The G.A.O. has seen a confidential list prepared by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation of more than 1,000 troubled banks that the F.D.I.C. says are in danger of failing.
The list, prepared with bank regulators from two other Federal agencies as well as state officials, is based on a review of banks' earnings; their capital, or cushion against losses; their portfolios of delinquent loans, and assessments of how well they are managed.
 
Larger Troubled Banks
 While the number of institutions on the list has been declining, the average size of the troubled banks on it has grown steadily, the F.D.I.C. says, raising concerns that the bank insurance fund will suffer even greater losses. The names of banks on the list are not made public, because regulators say that could cause huge depositor withdrawals, but general data about the troubled institutions are made available each quarter.
Asked whether he thought one of the nation's largest banks could be nearing collapse, Mr. Bowsher said: "Just how much trouble they're in is very hard to determine. A lot of them have very deep, imbedded losses."
He said it was not possible to measure the depth of banks' problems with certainty, but he took issue with the Administration's position that banks' problems were caused primarily by declines in the economy and in real estate.
"The fact is that the banks have made many bad loans," he said. "It's true that the real estate markets have hurt them in part. But I really think it's inaccurate to lay most of the banks' problems on the economy."
For months, Mr. Bowsher has been pushing to change accounting standards so that they more accurately reflect the true financial health of institutions. Some of his suggestions were adopted in the new legislation.
Mr. Bowsher was the first senior Government official to predict this year that the bank insurance fund would run out of money by year-end. His call last spring to return the fund to health by substantially increasing the amount that banks pay in premiums was initially ridiculed by both regulators and lawmakers. But this week, the chairman of the F.D.I.C., William Taylor, said the Government was considering a 30 percent increase in the premiums next year.
Unlike the nation's savings and loan institutions, the vast majority of banks remain profitable, although many of the largest banks, which have made the greatest number of construction and development loans, have posted staggering losses.
A new study this week by Veribanc Inc., a research and consulting concern in Wakefield, Mass., of 1,073 banks holding almost a quarter of the industry's assets found a bleak third quarter for earnings. The study also showed that banks were bracing for more sour loans by setting aside large reserves to cover losses.
Since the beginning of the year, Mr. Bowsher has openly disagreed with the Administration about the magnitude of the banking industry's difficulties.
 
Raising the Premiums
 In March, Mr. Bowsher said it would be "foolish" for the Administration to increase the borrowing authority of the F.D.I.C., instead of simply providing adequate money. And though lawmakers and regulators rejected outright his proposal in April to increase bank premiums sharply, Mr. Taylor of the F.D.I.C. acknowledged this week that the premiums may be raised by as much as 30 percent next year, to 30 cents per $100 held in deposits. Five months ago, the premiums rose to 23 cents per $100, a 92 percent jump over last year's fee.
The legislation approved by Congress on Wednesday enables the insurance fund to borrow up to $30 billion for as long as 15 years to cover the losses of failed banks. It also provides unspecified tens of billions of dollars more for bank working capital, which is supposed to be repaid through the sale of assets held by failed banks. But this could add to the fund's ultimate losses if the assets cannot be sold for 100 cents on the dollar.
Whether the loans are ultimately repaid by the banks or whether there will be another taxpayer bailout, the public purse will be affected. If the banks do repay the loans, they pass those costs on to their shareholders, ranging from small investors to large pension funds, and to bank customers, who pay higher fees for loans and bank services and receive lower yields on deposits.
 
Shift by Brady
 The Treasury Department has insisted since the beginning of the year that the banking industry's problems were significantly smaller than those of the nation's savings and loans; by some estimates, savings and loan failures could cost taxpayers $500 billion over 40 years. But over the last few months, the Treasury Secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, has slowly shifted his views; he now no longer guarantees that the banks will ultimately be able to repay taxpayer loans.
In an attempt to diminish the costs of bailing out the banks, senior regulators and lawmakers have begun considering ways to provide short-term financial assistance to weak banks, on the theory that it would be cheaper to keep them afloat than to liquidate or seize them.
Such proposals have run into difficulty, however, because they are not easy to implement fairly and can involve political decisions about whether to rescue bank shareholders and under what circumstances to remove management of banks that may not be technically insolvent but are failing to meet financial requirements.
On Monday, Mr. Taylor said he had begun studying ways to provide financing on a short-term basis. After hearing from Mr. Taylor, Donald W. Riegle Jr., the Michigan Democrat who heads the Senate Banking Committee, wrote President Bush proposing an initiative along the lines of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.
That agency was set up during the Great Depression and spent billions of dollars to prop up some 6,000 banks by buying stock in them. Such banks included predecessors to some of today's largest banks that have again been hit by hard times: Chase National, which became the Chase Manhattan Bank; Chemical Bank and Trust; Manufacturers National, which became Manufacturers Hanover Trust, and National City Trust, the predecessor of Citibank.

HEADLINE: Banks Fail to Overcome a Hostile Environment

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
When it comes to winning friends in Washington, these are not great days for bankers.
Legislation to give banks sweeping new powers -- a cornerstone of the Bush Administration's domestic agenda -- was tossed out by an unreceptive Congress before it adjourned for Thanksgiving. The measure that survived would replenish the nearly empty bank insurance fund, something Congress had little choice but to pass. 
 Adding further insult, banks just escaped a Congressional attempt to limit the interest rates they charge on credit cards, one of their most profitable businesses.
"We've been hit hard; there's no doubt of that," said Ed Yingling, chief lobbyist with the American Bankers Association, which represents large banks. "It would be hard to think of a worse atmosphere to bring up a banking bill. Frankly, I expected that the bill could be a mess at the end, but a series of events have occurred to make it even worse."
 
Promise of Gifts for Banks
 The year began with considerable promise for banks. The Administration proposed a comprehensive package to whisk away Depression-era regulations and allow banks to sell insurance and real estate, underwrite securities, merge with industrial companies and open branches across state lines. For many in an industry hurt by falling profits and rising failures, it was as though Christmas would come early.
But by the time the legislation emerged from Congress, it had been twisted into what many interest groups saw as an anti-banking measure, and the industry lobbied for its defeat. In the end, bankers were happy to accept a narrow measure to protect insured deposits and call it a day.
The measure on deposit insurance would provide more than $70 billion in taxpayer loans for the banking industry to cover mounting losses, mostly on bad loans held by the banks in a difficult economic environment.
In the background of the political battling is a longstanding hostility toward banks in the United States.
"Banks have historically never been popular creatures in American society," said Robert Litan, a banking analyst at the Brookings Institution. "And the rising costs of bank failures make banks increasingly look like savings and loans. Savings and loans are skunks. So banks become more skunk-like."
Add to this the recent reports of financial misdeeds by Salomon Brothers and the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, and members of Congress feared that passing the bill would bring about another billion-dollar financial debacle. They worried about being tarred by these scandals if they voted for any measure that could be seen as pro-bank.
Indeed, critics of the Administration's recommendations asserted that such deregulation of the banking industry would lead to greater losses that would ultimately have to be borne by taxpayers.
"A lot of people don't know the difference between a bank and a savings and loan," said Kenneth Guenther, lobbyist for the Independent Bankers Association, which represents small banks. "There was the whole aroma of sleaze coming out of the savings and loan problems out there."
 
Fear of Political Consequences
 Representative Thomas Carper, a Democrat of Delaware, added: "Any version of a comprehensive bank bill is seen as an invitation to the son of the savings and loan debacle, whether that's true or not. A lot of members are fearful of what their opponents could do with a 30-second spot."
What is more, big banks have few friends on the grass-roots level, where banks are often seen as hostile institutions that refuse to lend to ordinary individuals while freely making loans to third world countries, takeover artists and real estate speculators.
"Lots of people have had bad experiences in dealing with banks in their daily lives, whether it is standing in line to cash a check or the long process of getting a mortgage," said Cory Strupp, a chief lobbyist for J. P. Morgan Bank. "Banks, by their nature, are not warm, cuddly institutions."
Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat, said: "Bankers are not compromising types. The only time they were willing to compromise was after they lost everything. But that's part of what it is to be a banker -- you have people coming to you."
 
Administration's Sales Job
 There was also a general feeling that the Administration did not do a good job of selling the idea of a broad bank overhaul. After introducing the measure, President Bush kept his hands off. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, in contrast to his predecessors, remained isolated and somewhat inarticulate on the issue, lobbyists on both sides said. And the Treasury's point man, Under Secretary Robert R. Glauber, remained unwilling to compromise, to the point of holding out for everything and getting almost nothing, the lobbyists say.
Congress had plenty of voters and some of the most effective lobbyists around -- insurance agents and stockbrokers -- telling members why to vote against the bill, but it did not have an Administration telling them why the measure should pass. The Administration failed to convince nervous Congressmen that its proposals would permit banks to grow stronger.
 
Compromises Rebuffed
 A number of lobbyists on both sides of the bill, as well as members of Congress, said they had approached the Treasury Department with hard-fought political compromises, only to be rebuffed.
"Treasury felt they could just dictate the terms and that Congress would just go along," one lobbyist said.
Mr. Yingling of the bankers association said his organization had long ago figured out it would have a tough time in Congress. So the group instead adopted a strategy of bypassing Congress and seeking the changes it wants from the Federal Reserve Board, the regulators and the courts.
"We felt that we were successful in keeping away a lot of negatives," Mr. Yingling said. "And we know that it is hard for us to get things through Congress. That's why we're trying not to rely too much on Congress."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Behind the Gloom Of Consumers

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
WHAT ails the consumer? The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence has plunged below the lowest level it hit in the 1982 recession. Consumer spending is down, and the department stores are already announcing pre-Christmas sales, with discounts up to 50 percent.
Many people are trying to explain the gloom of consumers through pop psychology: She or he has been shaken by someone or something. Here, the villains differ. The news media are a favorite of some, while others point to the vacillations of President Bush on economic policy, the battles between conservatives who want to hold tight and supply-siders who want to slash taxes, the Republican right's challenge to Mr. Bush's leadership, the divisions and inertia among the Democrats, public anxiety over both public and private corruption, and racial tensions. 
 But the recession itself looks like the common cause of these anxiety makers. Rejecting pop psychology, Prof. Rudiger Dornbusch of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology offers an economic explanation of the gloom: "The economic situation of the middle class and of lower-income households has been deteriorating." Median real wages of male workers are now below the 1970 level, he said, adding, "No progress in 20 years!"
Until the current recession, consumers made up for the income squeeze by going deeper into debt. Consumer debt, as a share of personal income after taxes, rose from 62.7 percent in 1970 to 74.9 percent in 1980 and reached 96.9 percent in 1990. But indebtedness has limits. When unemployment rises, even those still working worry about their jobs, so they cut back on borrowing and buying, even with inflation and interest rates going down.
What to do? The President and Congress, before it adjourned this week until January, went through a final burst of activity to prove that they cared.
Congress passed, and the President indicated he would sign, a $151 billion six-year transportation bill advertised to create up to four million jobs.
That is a huge overstatement, if taken to mean additional jobs, according to experts at the Congressional Budget Office and in the Bush Administration. If the present level of transportation spending were projected to continue for six years, it would total $120 billion. The new bill will increase total transportation spending by only $31 billion over six years; annual outlays will rise about $3 billion in 1992, $7 billion in 1993 and an average of about $5 billion in each of the following four years. The net increase in construction jobs is likely to be closer to 100,000 in 1992, not four million. Mostly, the bill will save jobs; it will not create many.
Congress also approved a total of more than $100 billion to bail out banks and savings and loan associations, but these measures will not create jobs. About $70 billion of that money will go to the Government's insurance fund to protect depositors, thus presumably keeping them from withdrawing their money. This is a crucial move to prevent financial disaster, but one unlikely to cause depositors to step up their rate of spending. And Congress weighed a tax-cut package that included a capital gains tax rate reduction to 20 percent from 28 percent, a new Investment Retirement Account and other measures proposed by Representative Newt Gingrich, the Georgia Republican, and the House Republican Policy Committee. The tax package, which Mr. Bush "enthusiastically" endorsed after initial opposition, would have raised $1.6 billion in revenues over five years, according to Treasury estimates. But Democrats regard these estimates as wishful analyzing. The Democrats, confronted by a last-minute Presidential plea to vote the tax proposal up or down, called this move a ploy and said no.
Any tax-cutting to spur the economy, even with Congressional hearings scheduled for December, is unlikely to take place before the new year and could take months longer.
Big-money tax cuts next year seem unlikely, given the worsening of the budget deficit during the economic slowdown. The total Federal budget deficit, according to the new report on the United States by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, will reach a record $358 billion in 1992, up from $225 billion in 1991. But the O.E.C.D., after its report was released, revised its estimate of real United States economic growth next year down to 2.6 percent from 3.1 percent, and the new figure may still be too high.
With the worsening of the economic outlook, it now looks as though next year's total budget deficit, including the Social Security surplus, will approach $400 billion. The on-budget deficit, which excludes Social Security, could exceed $450 billion and bring the national debt above $4 trillion. It was $1 trillion in 1980.
Nevertheless, should the economy stay flat or slide into a double-dip recession, it now seems probable that the Administration will propose a tax cut of about $50 billion. That might take the form of a temporary across-the-board rate cut. But the Administration still hopes that will not be necessary, contending that the consumers will cheer up and the economy recover if the Federal Reserve will just lower interest rates further.

HEADLINE: Recovery Is in Eye of the Beholder

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
The President insists the economy is recovering. Disbelieving businesses and consumers say the recession never ended. Skittish investors blow hot and cold.
Who is right? It is partly a matter of perspective. But to a rare degree, even the experts who track the economy day by day are deeply divided over what is really happening. Indeed, the normally cocky fraternity of economic forecasters sounds uncharacteristically nervous. "It keeps you awake at night," one said. 
 Calling the shots at economic turning points is always scary. But this time the difficulties are compounded by a rare confluence of contradictory forces and unusually discordant data.
Interest rates and inflation are down and productivity is up, but a wave of restructuring among military contractors, in the computer industry and in service sectors like retailing and banking are keeping a lid on new jobs. And despite numerous signs that the level of economic activity is higher now than in the spring, consumers are gloomier today than in 1982, when unemployment and inflation were in the double digits.
The consensus among economists, published monthly by Blue Chip Economic Indicators of Sedona, Ariz., supports the President's conviction that an anemic recovery has been under way since April or May and will continue at least through the end of next year. That conviction is shared by Roger Brinner, chief economist at DRI/McGraw Hill, and Geoffrey H. Moore, director of the Center for International Business Cycle Research at Columbia University.
But a vocal minority of economists backs the man in the street, who sees no recovery until unemployment starts falling and sales rebound to former levels. Some of the pessimists, including Lacy H. Hunt, chief economist of the Hongkong Bank Group, argue that the recovery never began. Others, like Alan Sinai, president of the Boston Company Economic Advisers, expect a brief recovery to be followed by a second recession.
Indeed, there is valid evidence to support all three outlooks. Here is how economists are reading the data, along with some of the arguments supporting each potential outcome:
 
The School of Malaise
Stuck in a Long Postwar Slump
 Recessions, like recoveries, proceed unevenly. Mr. Hunt of the Hongkong Bank Group, maintains that last summer's flurry of economic activity was just a pause in a prolonged slide. "This economy remains mired in recession," he said, and he predicted that the final record would show one of longest and deepest post-World War II slumps on record.
From this perspective, the economy might rebound early in 1992. But in the view of most economists, it will not be much of a rebound -- certainly nothing like the boom that followed the 1981-82 recession. Tax increases by strapped Federal, state and local governments and cuts in military spending, among other factors, will take money out of the economy and keep the tempo of growth lethargic.
The clearest evidence supporting the premise that the economy has not improved since the spring is the stark fact that companies are not hiring, said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch. In October, supposedly the fifth month of the recovery, major companies continued to lay off thousands of workers, and the overall economy saw a slight decrease in jobs. As of last week, layoffs were continuing at almost the same rate as last March.
Indeed, the Government's tally of 300,000 new jobs created since April may be a mirage. The Government's job count assumes that small businesses create some 60,000 jobs a month -- an assumption that some economists have challenged.
While the Government reported a rise in the number of jobs, the Conference Board's help-wanted index has barely budged. "If no jobs have been created," Mr. Hunt said, "consumer income is also flat."
So are money and credit necessary components for business expansion. The Federal Reserve's key money supply measure has been going nowhere. Despite the burgeoning Federal deficit, Mr. Hunt said, the debt of all nonfinancial institutions has registered the slowest growth in 40 years. In past recoveries, he added, borrowing has turned up with the economy.
The burst of buying in the spring and summer, usually a sign of an upturn, was a more transitory phenomenon this time, said David Ressler, an economist at Nomura Securities. All it really represented, he said, was "a makeup of consumer pruchases postponed from the gulf crisis, when everybody stayed home and watched CNN."
 
The Double-Dip Scenario
Negative Forces Feed on Themselves
 A second school argues that the economy did indeed take off in the spring, but is about to nosedive again. "The monthly data suggest that the economy, if it was out of recession for a time, is dipping back into one," said Mr. Sinai of the Boston Company.
Companies charged ahead with cost cutting, Washington dithered, and consumers, anxious about jobs, panicked. "Another down wave suggests no recovery before the second half of 1992," Mr. Sinai said.
No single blow has knocked the recovery off course, but "actions that might have been taken were not taken because of the belief that the economy was recovering," Mr. Sinai said. Too little stimulus when the economy started to stall, according to this school of thought, has created a situation in which the negative forces began to feed upon themselves.
Like other economists in this camp, Mr. Sinai cites numerous signs that the economy has lost its momentum. Non-farm payroll employment, which had been up, has shrunk in three of the last six months. Personal income, not including Social Security checks and other government transfers, fell in October, after rising in the spring. Industrial production leveled out in August after climbing for five months. And retail sales have been flat since July, after spurting in early summer.
But sagging confidence is seen as the biggest problem.
If business expects consumers to retrench, it might feel the need for another round of steep inventory cuts and even more layoffs, similar to the wave that took place last fall. Detroit has already started to furlough auto workers and the latest inventory report shows a worrisome rise in store stocks.
 
The Slow-Growth Camp
Finding Hope In Fundamentals
 The slow-growth outlook that the majority of economists have in mind is not exactly cheery. But it is slightly more heartening than the first two perspectives. Growth of 2.4 percent next year, the Blue Chip group forecasts, could be enough to keep the wolves, political and otherwise, away from the door.
The strongest reason for expecting that the present flat stretch will not end in another decline is that "the fundamentals are O.K.," said Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Bear Stearns. "Low inflation and low interest rates provide the foundations for economic recovery."
The decline in interest rates, for example, would help explain the rebound in housing starts in October. And that is the sector that usually carries the economy into a recovery period.
 
Two Positive Indexes
 Leading indexes from both the Department of Commerce and the Columbia Univeristy Center for International Business Cycle Research have not only risen much more rapidly than other key measures, but they have recovered completely and are now above their previous peaks. "I regard that as fairly strong evidence, because the leading indexes have a good record," Mr. Moore said.
And while many very visible yardsticks of the economy are still giving weak readings, a variety of other indicators show the economy is indeed in better shape than it was last spring. Exports perked up in September. Manufacturing output and orders also expanded. Department store sales also picked up a bit toward the end of October.
Besides, for the economy to decline, something has to fall sharply, to pull everything else down. But a look at the parts of the economy that would normally contract shows that they are already down so low there is not much room for them to fall. Residential construction and consumer spending, for example, are both still quite depressed.
 
Slow Growth Feels Like None
 "It's a little early to be looking for strong growth," Mr. Moore said. "Though growth has not been rapid, it is in a similar ballpark with other recoveries from relatively shallow recessions."
Yet, it is the slowness of the growth that is apt to make it feel like there is none at all. "Growth has to be above 3 percent for anyone to notice," Mr. Brinner said. "Everybody will say we stayed in recession another nine months."
That is one reason, as a practical matter, that the Bush Administration will keep feeling the heat. "Everybody is waiting for Washington to do something," Mr. Kudlow said.

The Economy
The Government's top auditor says the money provided by Congress to handle the banking crisis may not be enough. Charles Bowsher, the Comptroller General, said the $70 billion in new taxpayer loans approved on Wednesday could be completely used up by the failure of just one of the nation's largest banks. Existing accounting standards have enabled banks to conceal huge amounts of potential liabilities, he said. [Page D1.] When it comes to winning friends in Washington, these are not great days for bankers. [D3.]

HEADLINE: Bush Asks Congress to Prod Economy

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28

 BODY:
With a stern warning to Congress that "hot rhetoric won't fill an empty stomach -- it won't create a job," President Bush called on lawmakers today to "cool off" after the Congressional session and join him in enacting legislation to prod the economy.
In a Thanksgiving address that the White House produced for television and radio stations nationwide, Mr. Bush said he was well aware of the nation's unemployment problems and sought to put blame on Congress. 
 "Congress left town after a particularly bitter session," said the President, who is spending the holiday at Camp David. "We now have a few weeks in which elected officials can cool off and hear from the people they serve. In this time, we can build a foundation for greater prosperity."
 
Criticism of Congress
 Mr. Bush said he had asked Congress to pass a series of incentives that "would create more jobs, good jobs, for American workers."
"Unfortunately, Congress did not send me a comprehensive package of economic growth measures," he said. "But we can't take no for an answer."
Mr. Bush showed no interest in pressing Congress to hold a special session in December to address the nation's economic troubles, as had been suggested by some Congressional leaders.
"When I give the State of the Union speech in January," Mr. Bush said, "I will ask Congress to lay aside election-year politics at least long enough to enact a common-sense series of economic growth measures. I will ask politicians to restrain their personal ambitions at least long enough to get the job done. Afterward, the normal election-year battling can resume."
Perhaps responding to Democrats in Congress who assailed him this week as out of touch and unsympathetic to the unemployed, Mr. Bush said: "Well, I do understand. I am concerned. And I want to help. I know that for a person out of a job, the unemployment rate is 100 percent."
Paying tribute to the military, Mr. Bush also recalled that last Thanksgiving, he and his wife, Barbara, stood with troops in the sands of Saudi Arabia.
"I wondered whether I would have to send those young people into battle," he recalled. "We were a nation on edge, anxious about what lay ahead in the Persian Gulf. No one knew how it would work out. But look at what they did; what we did. We pulled together. We fought for principle. We stood up to aggression. And when our men and women returned home, remember how we felt: proud, excited, confident, even relieved -- all because we knew that we did the right thing."

Chart: "A Look at the Congressional Session"
 
Major legislative work by the House and Senate in 1991.
 
ACTION COMPLETED
 
Gulf War: On Jan. 12, after three days of intense debate, Congress authorized President Bush to go to war. The vote was 52 to 47 in the Senate and 250 to 183 in the House:
 
Military: Congress approved a $291 billion military budget for the 1992 fiscal year that imposes severe limits on spending for the B-2 stealth bomber program but preserves money for a limited anti-missile defense system.
 
Unemployment Benefits:Congress passed a measure to provide up to 20 weeks of additional unemployment benefits to people already out of work at least 26 weeks. Final action on the $5.4 billion bill came after President Bush had vetoed two earlier versions. He is expected to sign this one.
 
Civil Rights: After two years of debate, Congress and the White House reached agreement on a compromise civil rights bill. The new law reverses 1989 Supreme Court rulings that restricted the ability of women and members of nation suits, and it allows punitive damages in sex discrimination cases.
 
Transportation: Congress agreed ona compromise bill to provide $1512 billion over six years and give states more flexibility in using the money. The bill grants transportation and $119 billion for highways.
 
Abortion Counseling: Both Houses passed a spending measure that included a provision to block the Adminstration form enforcing a ban on abortion counseling at family planning clinics receiving Federal money. President Bush vetoed themeasure and the House failed to override the veto.
 
Trade Negotiations: The Administration's "fast-track" aurhority to make trade agreements was renewed so a proposed free-trade agreement with Mexico and a 108-nation pact to lower trade barriers could be negotiated.
 
Banking: Both Houses approved an additional $70 billion in borrowing power for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and in a separate bill, provided up to $25 billion to pay for the savings and loan bailout until April 1, 1992.
 
UNFINISHED BUSINESS
 
Trade With China: Both Houses passed similar bills putting conditions on any renewal next year of China's most-favored-nation trade status, including an end to some arms sales, the release of political prisoners and a halt to exports of goods made with prison labor. The House committee report while the Senate is expected to act early next year.
 
Family Leave: Both Houses passed almost identical measures that would require many employers to grant up to 90 days of unpaid leave for workers to attend to family emergencies like the sickness of an elderly parent or the care of a newborn. A conference committee has not yet resolved the differences. President Bush vetoed a similar bill last year.
 
Campaign Finance: Both Houses passed bills intended to overhaul campaign spending, but the differences must be resolved inconference. The Senate version calls for voluntary spending limits based on state population; the House set a voluntary limit of $600,000 for primary and general elections. President Bush has pledged to veto legislation that includes spending limits and public subsidies.
 
Striker Replacement: The House passed a bill that would prohibit employers from hiring permanent replacements for striking workers if the strike was by union-represented employees. The Senate has not yet acted. The Bush Administration has threatened a veto.
 
Energy: A fight over drilling in the ARctic National Wildlife Refuge effectively killed an energy bill that had the suport of the White House but was opposed by environmental group, small utilities and the automobile industry. The bill also made it easier to drill for offshore oil and required the Government to set new fuel-efficiency standards for cars.
 
Education: Instead of acting on President Bush's "America 2000" education package, the House and Senate drafted their own bills for elementary and secondary schools. The House called for $700 million to be spent throughout the system; the Senate version calls for $850 million. The President had sought $695 million, with a third of the funds spent to permit parents to choose the school they send their children to , whether public, private or parochial.
 
Crime: House and Senate negotiators agreed on a compromise anti-crime package, but Senate Republicans effectively killed it with the threat of a fillibuster. The compromise authorized the death penalty for about 50 Federal crimes and imposed a five-day waiting period for a handgun purchases.
 
"Baby Bells": The Senate passed a measure lifting the ban on making equipment that was imposed under the A.T.&T. break-up order. The House is working ona bill covering both equipment manufacturing and sale of information services by local phone companies.

HEADLINE: Tarnished Congress;
Session Hurt Institution's Reputation As Well as Those of Some Members

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28

 BODY:
Every major flaw of the 102d Congress was on display this week as the lawmakers shambled crankily toward the end of a session that may be best remembered for the Clarence Thomas hearings and the bounce-free checks at the House bank.
The session began, in fact, with the decision to go to war with Iraq, a Congressional act that reasserted a constitutional sense of responsibility that had been abandoned to the executive branch since World War II. Domestically, however, divided government made most problems worse, as the White House and Congress have been in different parties' hands for one of the longest periods in American history. 
 The House of Representatives did exhibit some unaccustomed effectiveness. In its closing 33-hour session, the House completed action on a realistic legislative agenda for the year. That was "probably more than expected," as Speaker Thomas S. Foley acknowledged in an interview.
But those considerations provided little comfort for members at the end of a session that damaged the reputation of their institution, and with it, some of their own.
 
Credible Legislative Record
 An all-night session looks silly, especially when nothing visible happens for hours on end. And even as the senators and representatives finished up a credible legislative record -- passing responsible but politically unappealing measures like the financial bailouts of banks and savings and loans -- they offered fresh embarrassing examples of the very institutional difficulties that have weakened their ability to solve the national problems they constantly decry.
First, the steady fragmentation of Congress was on display on both individual and group levels.
It was not as showy as the tedious speechmaking of the hearings on the nomination of Justice Thomas to the Supreme Court, but the transportation bill's perilous passage was delayed as lawmakers from one state after another demanded that the money formula be adjusted to help their states. That attitude delayed unemployment benefits and Medicaid legislation, too.
Then some House Republicans pressed ahead with an effort to tie tax cuts that they said would promote economic growth to the refinancing effort for the Resolution Trust Company, which handles the savings and loan bailout. Their leader, Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, scoffed at the proposals; their fellow Republicans in the Senate disdained the substance and timing of them, and the White House, though it signed on, did so with obvious reluctance. But the rump movement sounded attractive politically, so the House was kept captive.
Second, the dominance of symbols that can be used in 30-second commercials was at the center of this session: on AIDS, on racial quotas and never more than on the anticrime bill.
Death penalties for rarely committed crimes were the conservatives' symbol of law enforcement in the anticrime measure; liberals seized on handgun control. Each side jockeyed for political advantage in public and conceded to reporters that the bill, whether it passed or not, would do more to help some politicians than it would to hurt criminals.
As Representatuive Henry J. Hyde, an Illinois Republican, said just before dawn Wednesday, "We come here in a spasm of spurious macho, to prove to our constituents that we are not soft on crime."
Third, the frequent weakness of committee leadership was on display dramatically as the session ended. The transportation bill's delays at the end followed a long, slow, stubborn progress in the House, where the Public Works Committee and Mr. Foley unrealistically bet on a gasoline tax that most representatives would not support, and the committee dragged its feet well into the fall before advancing a realistic bill.
But the banking committees seemed even more out of touch, negotiating until daybreak over local issues as they finally accepted the reality that there was neither public, nor even Congressional, acceptance of the idea that banks needed greater powers to prosper. The argument was made all year, first by the Administration, and while the committees accept it generally, there was little leadership to convince anyone else.
Fourth, beyond all else, there were hours of snarling partisanship, especially in the House on the crime bill and on the Republican tax package. They did not match the level of hostility and ill-temper of the House's civil rights debate in June, but they came close.
 
Rarely Displayed Anger
 Even Mr. Foley, often faulted by members of his own party as too agreeable and embarrassingly unsuccessful in the effort to override a veto on abortion counseling, was plainly angry. His anger at Mr. Bush and House Republicans was contagious. Democrats may have accomplished more because of it, but nerves were raw.
The grumpy mood of the last days was more obvious than the legislative record, just as the Thomas hearings and the House bank seemed to erase what Mr. Foley and Mr. Michel call the signal achievement of this session, the decision on the Persian Gulf war.
Mr. Foley argues that the vote to let President Bush go to war with Iraq set this Congress apart, "in a constitutional sense, above all its recent predecessors," and in particular the Congresses that let the nation go to war on purely Presidential authority.
But history books are written after most members have retired or been defeated, and elections are usually won on current domestic issues. There the record is credible but unexciting, and even Democratic boosters pad out the list of accomplishments with talk about bills they might pass next year, on issues like tax cuts and health insurance. Mr. Michel was blunter, saying, "We're just sloshing around."
Democrats blame the President's slender program and his use of vetoes. Mr. Bush, in turn, blames Democrats for rejecting his proposals and seeking measures that are too liberal, including things like job leaves for employees who have family emergencies to letting doctors in federally financed family planning clinics discuss abortion with pregnant patients.
The gloomiest critique of the week was offered by Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, who said the "paralysis of government is making the American people sick of the President, sick of the Congress and sick of the system."
"Sick of the Congress" is the bigger part of that malady, even among the tourists who came to stare and wonder at the Capitol this week. "They get involved in issues that just take too long to get anything done," said Ron Brow, a truck driver from Taylor, Mich. "Congress is too big, too removed from me as an individual."
And Jennifer McKenzie, a high school junior from Erial, N.J., on her way to listen to the House debate tax credits and making a park out of the California desert, said, "There's like 99 homeless people down the block and we're not doing anything." Saying Congress spent too much time on international issues, she added, "No one's doing their job."
To be sure, there were visitors sticking up for Congress, though a minority and without passion. Ann Quigley, who moved here from Tulsa, Okla., last week for a government job, said Congress was trying to do something about the domestic issues that Mr. Bush had bypassed, but added, "There's only so much they can do."
There is a plain difference between this year and last year, and it is not just that a first session of the two-year Congress, like this one, usually does less than the second.
In 1990, a second session, bargains were struck with the White House on major subjects like the budget, child care, air pollution and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The biggest domestic bill of this season was the civil rights act, important but not a landmark even in its own area.
Of course new Presidents come in with new ideas, as Mr. Bush did in 1989, which makes the first year or two more substantive. Then, a President's strength in Congress almost always declines after mid-term elections, as it did in 1990, and when party control of government is divided, as it has been for 11 years. The list of issues that both sides see as soluble problems runs short.
Perhaps the single most telling symbol was the omission of Congress's scheduled final event, the traditional call in which leaders from both parties and both Houses telephone the President to say they have completed their business and are about to adjourn.
It is a measure of the political distance that dwarfs the mere 1.6 miles between the Capitol and the White House that the canceled conversation would have been the first between Mr. Bush and the bipartisan Congressional leadership since Oct. 1, when he briefed them on nuclear arms.

HEADLINE: Critic's Choice/Theater;
Living on the Fringe

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
In one way or another, all the work being presented in the Public Theater's ambitious new two-week performance series starting this weekend, "Moving Beyond the Madness: A Festival of New Voices," concerns people who stand on the fringes of mainstream American culture because of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or low economic status.
Among the performers who will appear are the comedian and performance artist Danitra Vance, whose considerable talents were largely wasted several years ago on "Saturday Night Live" (Dec. 11 and 14), and Pomo Afro Homos, a San Francisco trio that explores the contradictions of black gay life (Dec. 13 and 14). Amy Hill's "Tokyo Bound" (next Friday) is a multi-media, one-woman personal odyssey that examines the complexities of Japanese women. 
 The series, whose curator is the playwright and director George C. Wolfe, who wrote "The Colored Museum," begins Sunday evening with "Spic-o-rama," a new evening-length work in progress by the gifted Hispanic writer, actor and character comic John Leguizamo. Mr. Leguizamo, who gave a memorable performance in the recent film "Hangin' With the Homeboys," is probably the most talented character comic to emerge in New York City since Eric Bogosian. In his widely acclaimed one-man show, "Mambo Mouth," the actor portrayed a cross-section of mostly Hispanic men, from a preening talk show host to an angry transvestite prostitute, with a winning verve and a satirical bite that provoked criticism that he was reinforcing negative ethnic stereotypes. If "Mambo Mouth" had an underlying theme, it was the warping effects of a mindless machismo ethic on Hispanic life. In "Spic-o-rama," Mr. Leguizamo concentrates on a six-member Hispanic family as opposed to unrelated individuals.

HEADLINE: For Businesses, Recycling Of Trash Begins Today

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

 BODY:
The useless memo, the old piece of corrugated cardboard and the file cabinet that no one wants: these and other trash generated by businesses in New York City now have to be recycled, under regulations that take effect today.
The new rules are meant to force city businesses to recycle 5,000 tons of the 10,000 tons of trash they produce each day. Much of that garbage is now being incinerated or shipped at increasingly high rates to Fresh Kills and out-of-state landfills. Sanitation officials say the recycling effort is essential if the city is to address its garbage problem. 
 The dump at Fresh Kills takes in 14,000 to 15,000 tons of refuse a day, a pace that could fill it within a decade, said Anne Canty, a spokeswoman for the city's Sanitation Department. "We have to make rational solid waste disposal arrangements in the next couple of years," she said.
But environmentalists say the city's record on residential recycling is spotty at best. They warn that the new commercial regulations, which place the recycling burden on garbage haulers and transfer stations, rather than on businesses, will be tough to enforce and may do little to change people's behavior.
 
To Separate or Not
 The plan requires the 200,000 businesses in the city, from the tiniest bodega to the largest corporation, to develop plans to recycle part of their trash. For now, the materials included are office paper, corrugated cardboard, metal and construction debris. But businesses can choose not to separate the trash themselves, putting the onus on the private haulers who collect their trash and on the transfer stations where it is taken. Many companies prefer it that way.
"We're discovering that there's an unfortunate trend for businesses to choose postcollection recycling," said Anne Marie Alonso, director of the Office Paper Recycling Plus program at the Council on the Environment of New York City, which has been helping companies develop recycling programs. "It means more labor, more equipment and more facilities for the haulers, and we don't think it's in the spirit of the law."
Sanitation officials say that the city's small businesses can't afford to recycle, and they say that many large businesses and private haulers have already begun to recycle, finding it cheaper than landfilling.
"There are many people who have been recycling for years already," said Jeffrey Elmer, a commercial recycling specialist at the Sanitation Department. "Recycling is costly and it's going to continue to be costly. But in the long run, the question is whether it will be less costly than landfilling, and I think it will."
The regulations take effect as New York's residential recycling program slips further and further behind its goals. Residential recycling began in selected areas two years ago and was to encompass the entire city by now. But the program has been plagued by dramatic cost overruns, budget cuts and uneven compliance. It reaches just half the city's neighborhoods.
Now, just 1,100 tons, or about 6 percent of the city's 17,000 tons of residential waste, is recycled each day, with the rest dumped at Fresh Kills or burned in one of New York's two working incinerators.
"The law wasn't enough to guarantee that the city was ever committed to the program," said John Ruston, an economic analyst for the Environmental Defense Fund, which has been a persistent critic of the city's recycling efforts. "There are some deep institutional issues in the Department of Sanitation that represent a hostility toward recycling."
Because the city's Sanitation Department is responsible for collecting residential trash, it has to pay for the residential recycling program. But commercial trash is picked up by city-regulated private haulers, so the cost of the commercial recycling program will be borne by them and eventually by the city's businesses if the city lets the haulers raise their rates.
Ms. Canty said that the program, which will be expanded during the next 18 months to include newspapers, magazines, plastic containers and glass bottles, will be monitored by the city's 70 recycling enforcers.
All businesses really have to do for the time being, she said, is post a notice explaining what their recycling policy is: whether they are separating their trash or whether their haulers are doing so.
Those who violate the law will be subject to a schedule of fines, starting at $25 and rising to $10,000 for persistent violators.
"We intend to vigorously enforce this law," Ms. Canty said.

HEADLINE: Flip Side in Hoboken

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOBOKEN, N.J.

 BODY:
Patty Dellatorre discovered why her friends talked up Hoboken's nightlife on her first visit here two weeks ago. On a late Friday night, the sidewalks were full, the pubs were packed and the mood was as giddy as a fraternity party. "It's a fun place to hang out," said the 21-year-old, who danced on a bar and won a trophy for her efforts.
Ms. Dellatore, who lives in Ridgefield Park in Bergen County, has since decided to make Hoboken a regular weekend event -- and she has plenty of company. On weekend nights thousands of young people descend by the carload on this mile-square city of 33,000 people, coming from nearby towns and counties, as well as Brooklyn and Queens, and swelling the population by 2,500 to 10,000. 
 The phenomenon is changing this old waterfront city. Thriving restaurants and bars are resuscitating its fragile economy when most cities in the region are still choked by recession. "There are so many new establishments opening," said Mayor Patrick Pasculli, "it bodes well." The night traffic has also made the streets even safer than before. There are street lights on formerly dark corners. Even elderly women walk their dogs later and later.
But the flip side of this prosperity is what the Mayor calls "quality-of-life problems" and the police call "nuisance crimes."
When the bars close -- 3 A.M. on Fridays and Saturdays -- people spill onto the streets, some of them still drinking. Bottles are tossed and fights break out. Men and women sometimes urinate on buildings and bushes. There is massive gridlock.
"It's mayhem," said the police chief, Carmen V. LaBruno, adding that the city is still adjusting to the shock of rapid gentrification over the last 10 years.
 
'Crossroads of Hell'
 "It's taken a long time for the old-time residents to get used to all the cafes, boutiques and professionals," he said. "Now this happens. You put 10,000 people on the streets, and it's assaulting."
In fact, in a city where violent crime is now rare -- there were two reported rapes last year and two murders in the last 18 months -- weekend nuisance crimes now dominate police calls, Chief LaBruno said. Each weekend, the police department increases its street presence by 25 percent. It may make 6 to 20 bar-related arrests and defuse several incidents.
"It's like Fort Lauderdale 10 years ago," said Mary Ann Monteverdi, who lives in a waterfront condominium, the Hudson Mews, surrounded on three sides by new and popular bars. The condominium, half a block from the PATH train terminal, was considered one of the most desirable locations in Hoboken until the bars arrived, she added. "We're smack dab in the crossroads of hell," she said. "Midnight on a Saturday is like the Indy 500. I cannot believe that all these people are 21 and older, the way some act."
Ms. Monteverdi, a Hoboken native, said she remembers when Hoboken "was a harbor town filled with sailor bars."
"But there was never these problems," she said. "Somehow, word has gotten around that Hoboken is the place to come and raise hell."
 
Downside of Success
 Most people say that only a handful of Hoboken's 106 bars, including liquor-serving restaurants, have created this stir. But the situation led some members of the City Council and Planning Board to propose closing all bars at midnight.
That idea, along with zoning changes that would place restrictions on location, size and how the establishments operate, among other things, was shot down after fierce lobbying by the Food and Beverage Association, a year-old organization of 91 restaurant and tavern owners.
Thomas Newman, a City Councilman who presides over a neighborhood that is home to 27 bars and liquor-serving restaurants in the city's central business district, attributes the defeat of the proposals -- many of them his -- on the "tremendous hysteria" of bar owners.
"Hoboken is drowning in its own success," he said. "We have many terrific restaurants, wonderful taverns. But we could close the bars earlier, make them something that would make Hoboken a little less attractive to the young crowds."
But Chris Onieal, who heads the Food and Beverage Association and owns a bar that bears his name, said the tavern owners believe that the solution to the nuisance-crime problem lies in policing and better management of the bars.
"They keep talking about the waterfront here," he said. "Well, no one's built so much as a toothpick on the waterfront. We're making a base here for some incredible development in the future. These problems of prosperity could be worked out."
 
Increased Police Patrols
 The industry is willing to bank on it. In a novel partnership with the police department, the Food and Beverage Association has spent $12,000 on police overtime over the last four weeks -- paying for a special patrol of eight officers stationed in eight "bar zones" throughout Hoboken. While it is too soon to tell whether the experiment will work, on weekends the police have become a conspicuous presence. Besides the bar patrol, the city itself has added community police officers, a five-member "Dawn Patrol," which starts at 8 P.M., and two-officer patrol cars. Along Washington Street, the city's main corridor, police in patrol cars or on foot show up on nearly every other corner. Most bar clients don't seem to mind, Mr. Onieal said.
"If you mind, then you're probably a jerk," he said. "And if you're a jerk, then we don't want you here."
The bar owners have also begun keeping watch themselves. Many stand outside their businesses like bouncers, giving the yea or nay to prospective clients, depending on how crowded the place or how drunk the customer.
Stefan Fabian, is one of those owners. He opened Fabian's Hoboken Brauhaus in 1946, when the bars were smoky, rugged places, Hoboken belonged to the longshoremen and the city was nicknamed "the Barbary Coast." Now, his bar is subtitled "a Gathering Place of the Arts," his crowd is writers and musicians and his idea of a successful night is one without a problem.
"I watch, I make sure everyone coming in is O.K.," he said, standing outside his corner bar at 1:30 on a Saturday morning. He admits that he was closed down twice five years ago for having clients who were too drunk. The experience cured him of the desire for customers at any price. Besides, these days, he can be choosy.
 
'Keeps Getting Trendy'
 "There are enough customers for every bar in Hoboken," he said. "No need to feel you have to rush everybody in."
Mr. Onieal agrees. He and other members of the Food and Beverage Association have instituted a "peer management assistance program," a fancy name for informal advice that the group offers to new bar owners. One piece of advice is to turn away large crowds waiting to get in.
"If there are 20 people standing outside a bar waiting to get in," he said, "what good does that do? If a place is too crowded for them, well, rarely do 20 people leave at once. It doesn't give the bar any business, it doesn't make the customers happy and it doesn't give other bars that potential business."
To Chief LaBruno, a Hoboken native who has seen the city's popularity ebb and flow, the latest phenomenon may die down as suddenly as it started. He remembers how artists came in the 70's. In the 80's it was Manhattan commuters and musicians, who made the city a mecca for underground music. Now, it's post-college "tourists."
Then again, he said, none of those groups have left. "Hoboken has come a long way," he said. "But it's funny how this little city keeps getting trendy."

HEADLINE: Msgr. James A. Healy Dies at 71; Led New York Mediation Board

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Msgr. James A. Healy, a Buffalo priest, economist and one of the country's best known labor mediators, died on Wednesday at Sisters of Charity Hospital in Buffalo after a three-week illness. A lifelong resident of Buffalo, he was 71 years old.
In the course of some four decades, Monsignor Healy was in the middle of countless contract disputes, hundreds of them involving public employees. He also sat on fact-finding panels and, from 1977 until his retirement two years ago, served as chairman of the New York State Mediation Board. 
 He was appointed to the state Public Employment Relations Board as a mediator in 1968, engaging in many tense negotiations whenever local governments and their workers came to an impasse over settlement terms.
In 1982, he was named president of the Association of Labor Relations Agencies, an umbrella organization for private and public agencies at all levels of government engaged in labor-management bargaining.
 
Denounced Hoffa>
 So intense was his commitment to his chosen metier that he became known as Buffalo's "labor priest." The term gained wide currency in 1959 after he angrily denounced James R. Hoffa, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and some of his lieutenants as "parasites" and "outsiders" to the labor movement because they had never served an apprenticeship and knew no craft.
Monsignor Healy took part in a fruitless effort to head off a strike by the United Federation of Teachers in New York City in 1975. Two years later, as the newly appointed head of the mediation board, he guided talks in a dispute between the Metropolitan Opera and its musicians, who were threatening to strike.
He was the chief mediator in a wildcat strike of school-bus drivers that deprived some 133,000 public school students of their usual transportation in 1979. At the same time, he helped head off a simultaneous walkout by custodial workers in the schools.
The monsignor was highly visible in New York City again in 1983 when the orchestra of the City Opera went on strike in a particularly bitter quarrel and stayed out for more than seven weeks. The opera management, then headed by Beverly Sills, responded with a de facto lockout, and the season, scheduled to start on July 7, did not get under way until the third week of September.
One of the last well-publicized disputes entrusted to his skill in the city was the 1985 walkout by 16,000 workers against 53 hotels. Monsignor Healy was called in because the strike was seriously affecting the city's economy.
Asked once about a Papal edict against priests becoming involved in politics, Monsignor Healy said, "I'm not in politics, my job is to be a peacemaker, to settle strikes."
He was born in Buffalo and was ordained in 1944 at St. Bernard's Seminary in Rochester. Pope John XXIII named him a monsignor in 1959.
Over the years, he taught economics at several church-affiliated colleges and, from its beginnings in 1950, was chaplain of the St. Joseph Guild, a lay group dedicated to ethics in labor relations. The Diocese of Buffalo registered him as a priest on "special assignment" for many years.
Monsignor Healy is survived by three sisters, Patricia Corcoran and Mary Alice Powers of Orchard Park, N.Y., and Eileen Brady of Rockville, Md.

HEADLINE: HAITI LEADERS CALL FOR NEW ELECTIONS

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Nov. 28

 BODY:
Defying pressure from Western governments, the interim leadership in Haiti announced today that elections would be held on Jan. 5 to choose a successor to its ousted President.
Jean-Jacques Honorat, who was installed last month as interim Prime Minister, said on state-run radio that an election council would be set up by Dec. 5 to organize the balloting. 
 The decision defies international pressure for the reinstatement of the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was deposed as President on Sept. 30 in a military coup. The exiled leader met last weekend with Haitian lawmakers in Cartagena, Colombia, to negotiate an end to the standoff, but the talks ended in a stalemate.
The 34-nation Organization of American States imposed an embargo and other economic sanctions after the coup to press for Father Aristide's reinstatement. The embargo has crippled the Haitian economy, the most impoverished in the Americas, and led thousands of Haitians to flee in boats.
 
HonoratLeader Cites Constitution
 In setting an election date, Mr. Honorat said the provisional government was abiding by the Constitution. Haiti's 1987 Constitution stipulates that a government set up in the absence of an elected president must call a new election within 90 days. The military installed Mr. Honorat's interim administration on Oct. 8. Officials said Father Aristide would be barred from the election under a constitutional provision preventing a president from succeeding himself.
In the Cartagena talks, he sought an accord naming him as Haiti's only legitimate president. But the lawmakers favored a generally worded pledge to restore democracy.
Father Aristide was deposed eight months after taking office as Haiti's first democratically elected leader.

205 Haitians Are Picked Up
 MIAMI, Nov. 28 (Reuters) -- The United States Coast Guard said today that it had rescued 205 Haitians overnight from overcrowded and ill-equipped sailboats, raising the total picked up in the last month to about 5,380. The United States military said on Wednesday that so many Haitians were fleeing their country by boat that the itmight expand a refugee camp at the Guantanamo Navy base in Cuba to house up to 10,000.

HEADLINE: KREMLIN INDICATES IRRITATION AT BUSH ON UKRAINE STAND

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 28

 BODY:
The Gorbachev Government issued a statement of pained surprise today at the Bush Administration's reported plan to "expeditiously" recognize the Ukraine after its independence referendum on Sunday.
"This report is surprising, the more so as it appeared on the eve of the referendum," the Kremlin declared in a press statement from the office of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has been opposing Ukrainian independence and fighting to revive the crumbling Soviet Union. 
 The two-paragraph comment, with its allusion to past Bush endorsements of the Union in the face of separatist pressures, amounted to a clear complaint that the reported shift in United States policy was premature and an unwelcome comment on what the message called the "internal affairs of the U.S.S.R."
 
'Negative Consequences' Seen
 Mr. Gorbachev's office said the comment was issued "in view of the present level of relations between the two countries and numerous official statements that the U.S. will not be adopting attitudes to such internal affairs of the U.S.S.R. until the republics arrive at the final decision."
At the same time, the Soviet Foreign Ministry warned of the "negative consequences" to the world should a "dramatic unraveling" of the Union occur because other nations "rush ahead" of the uncertain political processes now sweeping this crisis-ridden nation.
[Diplomats in Europe said the American allies there were not likely to recognize Ukrainian independence as quickly as the United States said it would. Officials in Bonn, London and Paris were very reluctant to comment on how their governments might react after a Ukrainian vote for independence. Page A20.]
On Wednesday, Administration officials said President Bush had decided to recognize an independent Ukraine "expeditiously" if the Ukrainians voted for independence Sunday and to time the decision to the speed with which the Ukrainians ease American concerns on human rights, ethnic tensions, disarmament and control over nuclear weapons. There was no formal, official announcement of the move in Washington.
Vitaly A. Churkin, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, insisted at a briefing that the Administration's plan, which would shift policy away from the Union center and toward the 12 now sovereign Soviet republics, was not a grave blow to Mr. Gorbachev's attempt to rebuild the political union.
Mr. Churkin said that in warning of world consequences from further Soviet unraveling, he did not intend any criticism of the Administration's reported policy shift.
"The attitude of the United States has been very responsible," he said, while stressing, in general terms, the need for other nations not to prejudge the "delicate" reorganization of powers that the republics and the Gorbachev Government are pursuing.
As the Ukraine prepared to vote Sunday in what is considered a certain vote in favor of independence, further evidence of the destabilization of the center was at hand.
The union's liquidity-plagued foreign trade bank, Vneshekonombank, suddenly shut its windows today to foreign depositors seeking to make routine hard-currency withdrawals, and said no such transactions would be conducted until Tuesday at the earliest. And at the city's hard-pressed gasoline stations, the de facto rationing of fuel was intensified as daily sales limits were further reduced, even for hard-currency purchases, and lines grew longer.
The Ukraine hailed the Administration's reported decision, although several officials said the White House had left the timing of recognition too vague. "The initial word implies it could happen in a month, a year, 10 years," said Ivan Drach, the leader of the Rukh nationalist movement and a parliamentary deputy.
But Vladimir Chonry, a spokesman for the republic's ministry of foreign affairs, said the officials there had the impression that "this could be soon."
The Bush Administration offered no precise timing, saying it was conditioned on a number of factors, including reassurances about the Ukraine's military and nuclear policies and human rights guarantees.
 
Bush on the Bandwagon
 Mr. Bush's reported decision and its disclosure before the Sunday vote puts him aboard the winning Ukrainian bandwagon early and amounts to a serious revision, if not a reversal, of his pro-Union position of early August, when he personally endorsed Mr. Gorbachev's plan to maintain a central Union and offered little comfort to the Ukraine's independence drive.
Stating that position in a speech during a visit to Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, on Aug. 1, Mr. Bush warned against "suicidal nationalism," a reference widely construed as concern about the separatist fervor of the republic, which had been one of the crucial pieces of the Soviet empire. Less than three weeks later, the Union was shaken to its foundation by an unsuccessful Kremlin coup that ended the Communist monopoly on government and sparked the rapid ersosion of Mr. Gorbachev's power base.
In dealing with the Administration's reported shift toward the republics, Mr. Churkin, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, clearly sought to put the best face on a serious setback for Mr. Gorbachev.
He said Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze actually considered it healthy earlier this week when the remaining Soviet republics balked at Mr. Gorbachev's latest initiative to revive interest in the Union. They retreated from a planned ceremony to initial a tentative pledge to redesign a political union, a step that Mr. Churkin said was creative since it made sense to wait until after the Ukrainians vote Sunday.
 
Ukrainians Adamant
 The fact is, however, that all major politicians in the Ukraine have renounced any intention to compromise the expected independence by rejoining the Union process. The most that the republic, the second largest and richest in the Union, has agreed to is to join the still tentative separate economic pact involving 10 republics that have agreed to focus on creating a free-market economic community. In this, power would remain with the republics, not with the remnants of the center, where Mr. Gorbachev is fighting to maintain his authority.
While the Bush Administration, heading toward an American election year, was reported to have hurried to tell Ukrainian-American lobby groups of its policy shift, American diplomats here were citing some possible qualifications.
One was that the Administration might tie its recognition to a decision by the Russian federated republic to precede it in granting recognition. If the United States imposed such a condition, it could considerably hold off American recognition since Russia, led by President Boris N. Yeltsin, has not yet taken a position and a heated and complicated debate might be involved.
Mr. Yeltsin stirred some ancient Ukrainian-Russian animosities shortly after the coup failed, when he served notice that Russia would not let republics secede and take with them control over areas with heavily Russian populations. Mr. Yeltsin later retreated from the statement when it only fed the Ukrainian independence drive by reviving the image of an imperialist Russia.
 
Some Russian Resistance
 But the Yeltsin statementhas served to encourage some pro-Russian resistance in the Ukraine to the independence drive in the Donets mining region and the Crimea, which have heavily Russian areas. American diplomats here argue, however, that the Russians in these areas, themselves sick of the Union's failure, might show enough support for Ukrainian independence on Sunday to force the Yeltsin government to grant recognition of the Ukraine eventually.
Despite the tense and uncertain relations between the two dominant republics, Mr. Yeltsin and the Ukrainian leader, Leonid M. Kravchuk, have signed a treay to maintain their considerable economic ties. Mr. Kravchuk is the frontrunner in a second Ukrainian ballot qestion, the election of a president.
In curtailing foreign currency withdrawals, the union's Vneshekonombank underlined the uncerainty of its fate in the face of the center's liquidity shortage and the Russian republic's plans to take over control of the ruble and most banking conduits. The bank said the earliest day foreign depositors might withdraw some of their money was Tuesday. The money-freeze is another blow to Soviet fiscal credibility since diplomats and foreign businesses of all sorts are affected.
"The decision not to give cash to the customers until Dec. 3 was dictated by the hard predicament the Vneshekonombank is in," Nikolai Barkovksy, an aide to the bank's chairman, told The Associated Press.

No Comment by U.S.
 WASHINGTON, Nov. 28 (Special to The New York Times) -- When asked about the Kremlin statement today, a White House spokesman, Roman Popadiuk, said the White House had not issued any statement about American policy toward the Ukraine, and would thus have no comment on Mr. Gorbachev's statement. He did not cast doubt on reports published today that President Bush had decided to recognize the Ukraine expeditiously if the republic breaks with Moscow in a referendum Sunday.

HEADLINE: The President's Inept Tax Plan

 BODY:
Desperate. Inept. Unpresidential. Pick your own adjective for Mr. Bush's 24-hour turnabout on tax cuts. Last week he said he would wait until next year's State of the Union address to outline a tax cut plan that would spur the sagging economy. Monday night he gave lukewarm endorsement to tax cuts proposed by Representative Newt Gingrich, the House Republican whip. By Tuesday night, lukewarm had become wholehearted: Mr. Bush called on Congress to pass, hours before it was scheduled to adjourn, a tax cut bill not even written yet.
Mr. Bush's leap to legislative madness invites suspicion that his calculations were driven by politics, not economics. The tax cuts he lauds won't stimulate instant spending but would bury the economy under mountains of future debt. Indeed, the President would be hard pressed to draw up a sillier plan to fight the recession. 
Tax cuts are a crude way to fight recession. The impact is uncertain, the timing devilishly difficult. By the time Congress recognizes a problem, passes legislation and the policy has time to affect the economy, six months to a year goes by and recovery has already begun. Then fiscal stimulus can exacerbate inflationary pressures. According to many economists, the time for action was a year ago when the recession was beginning, not now when it's probably ending.
Despite these reservations, a cautious case can be made for delivering a quick, careful shot of fiscal adrenaline. The economy has been limping along between recession and imperceptible growth. And consumer spending took a chilling nose dive in October, dragged down by the weakest level of consumer confidence in a decade.
But the Gingrich plan isn't what the economic doctor would order. It would reinstate, permanently, tax subsidies for retirement accounts of upper- income families and cut taxes on other types of savings. This would result in lower consumer spending -- the opposite of sane economic policy. And because the cuts would be permanent, they would drive up future deficits, threatening long-term private investment and growth.
A cut in capital gains taxes is equally foolish. Experts can reasonably debate whether the proposal would raise investment spending over time. But only zealots would argue it could ignite spending when it's needed -- right now.
Should Congress enlarge the deficit, temporarily, to fight recession? It's a serious question. If Congress decides yes, it could adopt ideas from Robert Solow, the Nobel laureate from M.I.T., and Francis Bator of Harvard. They propose temporary across-the-board tax cuts and targeted spending hikes that would stimulate the economy quickly, and then self-liquidate.
If Congress finally decides tax cuts are needed, these ideas constitute a careful, targeted response. The President's sudden gesture is a blunder.

HEADLINE: A New Road for Transportation

 BODY:
Some frantic last-minute horse trading was necessary before Congress finally approved a transportation bill. But the result justified the struggle. The bill dramatically, and for the most part sensibly, refocuses national transportation policy for the first time since the Interstate System of highways was launched 35 years ago.
The bill is bigger and better than President Bush wanted, but he has agreed to it. Given the uncertain state of the nation's economy, he had little choice if he hoped to escape blame for slowing the recovery. Prolonged Congressional haggling has already delayed work on dozens of projects. 
 Mr. Bush proposed a $105 billion program for five years. Congress raised it to $151 billion for six years. Most significantly, a bigger share of the Congressional total goes to mass transit and a smaller share to highways.
The bill also continues subsidies for mass transit operating costs, which President Bush wanted to slash. And the highway aid emphasizes maintenance and upgrading, rather than new construction.
In essence, the bill tells state and local governments to make better use of road and transit systems already in place. In the words of its principal architect, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, it instructs them to "think productivity."
As the President proposed, it gives state and local authorities more flexibility in deciding how to spend the money. But Congress rejected his proposal to continue allocating Federal matching aid for highways more generously than for mass transit. Under a new formula, aid for both would be the same in most cases; Washington pays 80 percent of the cost.
The bill includes some unfortunate features, including 460 earmarked projects in 267 Congressional districts whose representatives had enough clout to get them included. Overall, however, the bill is a remarkable achievement. It interrupts Washington's long romance with road-building, and points Federal policy in new directions.

Plain Ukraine

BYLINE: By LEON V. SIGAL

DATELINE: KIEV

 BODY:
The republics of the former Soviet Union, struggling to devise a new form of association, so far can't even agree on a name for it. One Muscovite suggests calling it the U.F.F.R. -- the Union of Fewer and Fewer Republics.
The second-largest republic won't be among them. People here prefer to call it by its plain name, Ukraine, dropping the traditional article, and they are voting Sunday in a referendum on independence. The outcome is a foregone conclusion: Ukraine's parliament has already formally declared independence, and the U.S. is moving abruptly toward diplomatic recognition. 
 Economic conditions are rapidly deteriorating, and most Ukrainians believe that they are being pulled down by the rest of the union -- that they'd be better off on their own.
There's some evidence for that. State stores in Kiev and Lvov have more food on the shelves than those in Moscow -- much of it from Ukraine. And prices on the private markets are much lower. A chicken selling for 100 rubles in Moscow costs 40 in Kiev, 30 in Lvov.
But there are interminable lines for some goods like nylons and gasoline that come from other republics, and prices are rising rapidly. That's a reminder of Ukraine's continuing economic dependence, and the risks of go-it-alone economic nationalism.
Christine Demkowych, a fellow journalist, suggests that I try out my few words of newly acquired Ukrainian on the two young soldiers, just released from the Red Army, who share our train compartment. After I run through the primary numbers and stumble over the word for thank you, one of the young men suggests that I learn the most important phrase in Ukraine today: Khto ostanni? Who's last on line?
National passions are running high. In a cooperative restaurant in Lvov, at the request of some visiting U.S. dentists, the pianist and violinist strike up the Soviet national anthem. In a scene out of "Casablanca," the owner rushes angrily across the floor and slams the piano shut. "After all the millions killed by the system, we don't have to listen to that."
Ukrainians blame Moscow for their plight. Some also blame Moscow's minions in Kiev, still in positions of power. More ominously, other Ukrainians agree with the view of one driver: "Moscow takes our forests and our grain and gives us nothing in return. The Russians and the Jews are the ones who benefit."
The failure to distinguish between Moscow and Russians worries the sizable non-Ukrainian population, about a quarter of the republic's 51 million people. They're concentrated in the Russified east and in the Crimea, which is itself threatening to break away from a breakaway Ukraine.
Sunday's vote will be an important test of the sentiment of the non-Ukrainian population. If they turn out in substantial numbers to back independence for Ukraine, that will be a reassuring sign that this republic can hang together.

HEADLINE: Beijing's Subtle Nuclear Diplomacy

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis; Flora Lewis is Senior Columnist of The New York Times.

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
China does not share the sense of urgency that the U.S., South Korea and Japan feel about heading off a North Korean nuclear weapons program. But despite appearances, both sides are not in dispute over the issue. The gap between them reflects several things: how China's policy is evolving, the dilemma Beijing faces in trying to separate its messages to domestic and foreign audiences, and its attempt to appear to be the Communist world's last great bastion.
Surprisingly, nobody here says China has different information than Washington does on how near North Korea is to producing a bomb. On the contrary, a senior official said Beijing had learned little from Pyongyang directly and that most of what it knows comes from U.S. sources. But that information has been tightly held inside China's officialdom. Those who don't possess that information have not been discouraged from arguing that Washington is exaggerating and trying "to bully, as it usually does" to line up support from others for its stand. Apparently, China's top authorities don't want lower-level officials to know about U.S. cooperation on this sensitive issue. 
 There is no doubt China keenly understands, as the U.S. and Japan do, that its interest lies in making sure North Korea doesn't have the atomic bomb. Nor is there any doubt China is telling the truth when it says it has never given North Korea nuclear help. The Soviet Union did, but that help has been cut off.
Pyongyang possibly has received expertise and components from rich countries that buy North Korean weapons, but North Korea seems to have developed much of its atomic capability on its own. That makes its program all the more dangerous and less susceptible to quarantine.
A better agreement on blocking a North Korean atomic capability emerged from Secretary of State James Baker's talks in Beijing than has been disclosed. The Chinese said they had to deal with the problem in their own way, for they want to remain close friends with North Korea. An agreement is also developing on missile sales, with China prepared to cancel the transfer of newly designed missiles to Syria and Pakistan and to refuse to fulfill requests for them in the future. But it wants U.S. technological help in return and equal status in the right to sell arms. On its nuclear help to Algeria, China claims France sought the same contract but lost the bid to Beijing in fair competition.
These decisions are part of a newly firm policy to pursue economic reform and "opening" to the world. This question provoked closed high-level debate for well over a year after the Tienanmen massacre in 1989. But there is full leadership agreement to maintain strict political control and party power, with repression if necessary.
China's policy divides relations with the U.S. into three categories: basic agreement on international affairs, hard bargaining on "practical bilateral issues" such as trade and flat disagreement on "ideological questions," which includes human rights.
Beijing's campaign against "peaceful evolution" is a way of accusing the U.S. of trying to undermine the Communist system and of fighting foreign influence domestically. But, in conversations with an American, the Chinese talk remarkably little of socialism, and constantly emphasize national interest, national unity and the need for stability. The argument comes down to the need for ideology to mobilize people and keep control so as not to follow the dreaded Soviet example. The line is that stability is essential to make economic reform work and that economic reform must succeed in order to preserve stability.
For the U.S., this means a discriminating policy is best. America should not relent on its insistence on human rights and democratization, but it should separate current strategic issues from longer-term hopes for China. China seems readier to cooperate on urgent foreign problems (there is something here like Mikhail Gorbachev's "new thinking") than it is prepared to admit, for domestic reasons. The subtle Chinese are being subtle, but not inscrutable.

HEADLINE: H.M.O.'s Are Thinking People's Medical Care

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Toby Cohen's "Health Care and the Class Struggle" (Op-Ed, Nov. 17) is long on sarcasm and innuendo, short on fact and analysis, and false in its basic premises. 
 The first false premise is that there is something inferior about medical care in health maintenance organizations, or H.M.O.'s, so that people have to be manipulated or compelled or forced, or have their free choice denied or be driven or herded or goaded to join them. What Richard Kronick and I proposed is informed cost-conscious consumer choice: let people make a choice of health plan (from a menu screened by their sponsor, who can bring bargaining power and expert knowledge to bear to be sure all the choices are of acceptable quality) and keep the savings if they choose a plan that offers to do the job for less money. That is market economics adapted to the medical marketplace.
Mr. Cohen doesn't know anything about who joins H.M.O.'s. The good and successful H.M.O.'s contain many built-in, quality-enhancing features that have made them attractive to such groups as university faculties and staffs, other teachers, scientists and engineers, and civil servants.
H.M.O.'s in California serve a majority of the faculties and staffs of Stanford University and the University of California, as well as state employees, despite employer-contribution and tax policies that favor traditional fee-for-service plans. H.M.O.'s are thinking people's medical care, not poor people's medical care, as Mr. Cohen implies. That's why I just enrolled for another year in the H.M.O. that has served me so well.
Mr. Cohen's second false premise is that there is even a shred of evidence that "a board representing government, insurers, doctors, hospitals, employers, unions, nonunion employees and consumers" could fix and enforce a national health care budget in this large, culturally diverse nation, which was founded on the principle of limited government.
Mr. Cohen would have the Federal Government create an entitlement to free care for all. The idea that the Government could control the costs flies in the face of all our experience: the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund is projected to go broke in about 10 years; the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation went broke, and that mess will cost the taxpayers $500 billion; a similar story is playing out with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which apparently needs $70 billion more in bailout money, and the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation; uncontrolled Medicaid costs are breaking state budgets everywhere.
No wonder Senator Edward M. Kennedy deserted the plan he introduced in 1969 and which Mr. Cohen advocates.

Physician Tax Credits

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The plan submitted by Republican United States senators to provide tax credits to businesses and individuals to cover the cost of health insurance doesn't help the poor and unemployed, for whom a tax credit is meaningless, and it doesn't provide greater access to quality health care for the poor. 
 Instead of working within the failed private-health-insurance system, we should provide tax credits or deductions directly to physicians, hospitals and other health-care facilities that care for the poor and uninsured.
With these tax incentives, we would undoubtedly find our best doctors and medical institutions providing care to our neediest citizens -- at no cost to the patients -- with the Government reimbursing them through tax credits or deductions.
Such a program would also be an improvement on misguided proposals to nationalize our health-care system. National health care would eliminate any financial incentive for the best and brightest to continue in the profession -- and discourage talented young people from entering it. Highly skilled and educated physicians would be replaced by a sort of civil service, providing secure employment for mediocre doctors.
A system of tax incentives would have particular appeal in our cities, where rich and poor live and work in close proximity. In some cases, hospitals in affluent neighborhoods already provide limited services in nearby ghettos, but they cannot afford to do more. Tax credits would provide them with strong financial incentive to fulfill an important social need.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises Against Mark On Worry About the Soviets

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the German mark yesterday in light trading dominated by concerns about the Soviet Union.
Foreign exchange traders said United States dealings were light because many of them took off the day after Thanksgiving, when the domestic market was closed. 
 In New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6243 German marks, up from 1.6155 late Wednesday, gaining strength after the Soviet State Bank said it had stopped all payments to the national budget because it had run out of money.
Market analysts also cited the weekend independence referendum in the Soviet republic of the Ukraine and separatist movement in the Georgian republic as helping to strengthen the dollar in Europe and the United States.
Also, rumors of a pending Soviet coup led traders to sell the German mark and buy the dollar and the Japanese yen.
"It seems as though people are becoming more and more focused on the Russian situation and less focused on the present U.S. economy," said Walter Simon, a vice president at Bank Julius Baer & Company in New York.
Traders often want to own dollars as a hedge against instability in foreign countries. Germany is seen as particularly vulnerable because it is close to the Soviet Union and is owed about a third of the Soviets' $65 billion Western debt.
Other market analysts attributed most of yesterday's gains to technical factors.
In Tokyo, the dollar was unchanged from Thursday's close of 130.07 Japanese yen. Later in London, it fell to 130.05 yen. In New York, the dollar fell to 129.93 yen, from 130.05 yen late Wednesday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.7655, from $1.7680 late Thursday. In New York, the pound closed at $1.7670, slightly cheaper than Wednesday's close of $1.7675.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday, were: 1.4338 Swiss francs, up from 1.4270; 5.5475 French francs, up from 5.5165; 1,223.00 Italian lire, up from 1,218.25, and 1.13455 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1369.
Gold prices were unchanged in New York.
The Republic National Bank quoted gold at $367.50 an ounce as of 4 P.M., unchanged from Wednesday. At the Commodity Exchange in New York, bullion for current delivery fetched $367.90 an ounce, also unchanged.
Silver bullion on New York's Comex, closed at a late bid of $4.057, down from $4.060 late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Notes and Bonds Up in Light Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury notes and bonds rose yesterday, and interest rates moved lower. Traders said prices were lifted by rumors of a possible Soviet coup and expectations that a new round of reports will show that the economy remained weak in November.
Virtually all the price movement occurred during overnight trading in Asia and then later in European financial markets. Activity in the United States was extremely light, as most domestic participants extended their Thanksgiving holiday. Trading in the United States stopped at 1 P.M., New York time. 
 Talk about another Soviet coup attempt had the initial effect of pushing up the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets, and persuaded some investors to seek a haven in short-term Treasury bills.
 
No Economic Recovery Seen

Treasury securities also benefited from the widespread belief that key economic reports expected next week, including November employment data, scheduled to be released on Friday, will offer little evidence to suggest the recovery is gaining momentum. Many analysts anticipate the data will reinforce worries that the recession has returned.
A new round of weak economic statistics will probably heighten anxiety in Washington, but credit market participants will not have to worry about further substantive debate on various proposals to stimulate the economy for six weeks or so.
"The departure of Congress on Wednesday comes as a welcome relief to the market, and may provide some support over the coming week," analysts at MMS International, an economic information and service company, noted in their daily market commentary.
 
Trading in Secondary Market

In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at the close of trading at a price of 100 25/32, up 3/8 point, to yield 7.93 percent, compared with 7.96 percent late Wednesday and 7.97 percent on Nov. 22.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 29/32, up 1/4 point, to yield 7.36 percent. The new 6.50 percent five-year notes sold earlier this week were offered at 100 3/32, up 6/ 32, to yield 6.47 percent. And the new 5.50 percent two-year notes auctioned on Monday were offered at 100 1/4, up 3/ 32, to yield 5.36 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates moved lower.
Three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 4.34 percent, down 3 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 4 basis points, to a late offered rate of 4.38 percent.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended Nov. 18.
The reported gains, particularly the $5.2 billion increase in M-2, the aggregate most closely followed by the Fed, were a bit larger than most analysts had anticipated. But the report had no impact on prices in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: RASH OF SUITS SEEN AFTER RIGHTS ACT

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON Jr.

 BODY:
The civil rights act recently passed by Congress is likely to prompt a rash of new sex discrimination lawsuits, labor experts say, because for the first time it gives employees bringing such lawsuits the right to cash damages and a jury trial.
At the same time, the prospect of more lawsuits -- and more costly ones -- is expected to cause employers to give greater emphasis to workplace programs for resolving disputes before they are brought to court. 
 Much of the debate over the new law, which was signed by President Bush last week, focused on whether the bill involved racial quotas in hiring. The act overturned a 1989 Supreme Court decision that favored employers in disputes over whether a company's work force adequately reflected the racial makeup of its applicant pool.
 
An Emphasis on Sex Bias
 Yet labor law experts say the quarrel over quotas missed the much larger point of the law: the new legal rights it offers to people who file complaints of sex discrimination.
Burke Marshall, professor of law at Yale University, said that apart from reversing the 1989 ruling, the new law's potential for cash damages "puts a bite in that wasn't there before."
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 allowed workers to sue over discrimination based on sex, race or disability but did not provide for jury trials or compensatory or punitive damages. People contending racial discrimination have long been able to sue for damages under a separate law. So it is women complaining of sex discrimination who have gained most under the new act, experts say.
"The biggest impact of this bill is the danger of getting dragged into court by people with sex discrimination cases," said Mark de Bernardo, a Washington lawyer who represents employers. "As a practical matter, that's where the real change is."
The law's passage came shortly after the confirmation hearings for Justice Clarence Thomas of the Supreme Court pierced the nation's consciousness about sexual harassment, which is now widely accepted to be a form of sex discrimination. Lawyers say another likely effect of the hearings is to embolden more women to come forward with claims.
Robert Fitzpatrick, an employment lawyer in Washington, said his firm was already looking at a handful of sex discrimination cases that would not have been filed before the enactment of the bill, and would now probably go forward. He estimated that thousands of cases like these would be brought before Federal courts.
Mr. Fitzpatrick and other labor lawyers agree that the law's provision for jury trials is an advantage for plaintiffs because juries are usually more sympathetic than judges to complaints filed by workers.
He pointed out that the new act did not specify whether it applied to pending or past cases, so that issue will be left for the courts to decide.One
 
Employee's Complaint
 A typical case in which the new law could make a difference is that of Merina Shepard of Dallas. She was dismissed as a debt collector for Credit Management Services, after her supervisor accused her of violating company policy in dealing with a particular debtor. She says that the real reason for her termination is that she is black and a woman, and that a white male co-worker who handled the debtor's case in the same way has remained at the company.
Ms. Shepard took her complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where a case worker told her it would be difficult to prove racism or sexism, and negotiated $1,500 in compensation from the company. Ms. Shepard rejected it as too little for the loss of a job.
Janette Johnson, a civil rights lawyer approached by Ms. Shepard, said that even though she thought the case had merit she decided against taking it because the most that could have been won would have been back pay. But with the incentives provided by the new law, Ms. Johnson said, she would be likely to take on such a case.
Even now, however, Ms. Johnson and others say the potential rewards may not be big enough. The act limits punitive and compensatory damages to $50,000 for companies with fewer than 100 employees, and up to $300,000 for the largest ones. That keeps incentives for lawsuits to a minimum, Ms. Johnson said. Companies with fewer than 14 employees are not covered by the bill.
Other lawyers, however, predict that the limits on damages will be raised in coming years.
States like California, Ohio and Michigan, where existing state laws exceed the scope of the new Federal law, have already seen large numbers of discrimination cases. The new Federal act is likely to have more impact in states like New York and Texas where the laws are weak.
 
More Mediation Seen
 Whatever the potential for lawsuits, lawyers on both sides of labor disputes predict that the bill will accelerate the move toward alternative modes of dispute resolution and a greater role for mediators.
"The upshot" said Wayne Outten, a plaintiff-oriented labor lawyer in New York, "is that there is more incentive than ever for companies to adopt arbitration practices."
How companies will deal with the original intention of the civil rights act, to discourage discrimination from occurring in the first place, remains unclear. In a time of economic retrenchment and cutbacks, companies are unlikely to want to spend much on the kind of training for their managers and employees that experts say is necessary to fight entrenched habits of race and sex discrimination.
"They'll hand out a lot of directives on high," said Steve Ralston of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, referring to senior executives. "But how far down that percolates, we'll have to wait and see."
Companies "all have nice stuff on paper, but the reality can often be far removed," he said.
Some companies have already taken steps to try to improve their internal handling of discrimination complaints. Federal Express, Citicorp, Northrop and Xerox have all been cited by experts for policies that have helped employees feel confident that their complaints would be genuinely and thoroughly investigated.
Federal Express, for example, has had a "guaranteed fair treatment" system since the 1970's that has a review board made up of three employees and two managers who have the authority to hear complaints and interpret company rules. Fred Smith, Federal Express's chief executive, checks the board's work at a weekly meeting.
The system has greatly improved management's understanding of employee needs and concerns, said Walter Kimbrough, managing director of Federal Express's human resources analysis division. He said it had also saved the company litigation costs in two ways: nettlesome disputes have in most cases been solved out of court, and the company is in a stronger position to win cases that do go to court.
"You can believe that because of the internal review, we'd be in an excellent position to defend ourselves," Mr. Kimbrough said.
Yet the obstacles to any wholesale adoption of alternative dispute resolutions are numerous and deep seated. Most bosses, experts warn, are intuitively afraid to compromise their authority and control over how their company is operated.
Employers are also reluctant to be conciliatory on sex and race discrimination cases because they often fear that it would send the wrong message to other employees who might file claims. The employers do not want to be perceived to be admitting wrong where they do not believe it has occurred.
"If you don't take a real tough stand when you know you're right, you just encourage others to come forward," said James Gilbert, general counsel for HBO & Company, a health-services concern in Atlanta. "These are the kinds of claims anyone can make. When you're fired, you never think it's your fault."
Mr. Gilbert said his company would "not hesitate to fry" any manager found discriminating unfairly against employees. Yet he and other lawyers who represent companies believe that the majority of discrimination charges are unfounded and are brought by people who have been dismissed or passed over for other reasons. Lawyers who represent plaintiffs disagree, saying that more than half of the cases they see have merit.
In the past, the difficulty of proving sex or race discrimination in court has often prevented plaintiffs' lawyers from taking on many of those cases, even seemingly clear-cut ones.
 
Exploring Alternatives
 On the other side, the pressure to hold down legal costs, Ms. Johnson added, has led corporate lawyers to explore alternative ways of resolving disputes. "Corporation counsels are getting far more aggressive in cost containment in leasing out work," she said. "The taxi-meter approach to legal costs is going to be replaced in a lot of cases by mediation, arbitration and fixed-price contracts."
Jay Waks, an employment lawyer at Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler in New York, sees even more far-reaching effects of the law. If nothing else, he argues, the long, politically partisan debate over the act has heightened public awareness of the civil rights issues involved. Such attention, he said, should lead to greater efforts to prevent discrimination from occurring.
And that, added Lewis M. Steel, an employment lawyer in New York, is what the law intended. Summing up the various aspects of the act, he said, "It's an incentive to do the right thing."

HEADLINE: In a 90's Quest for Black Identity, Intense Doubts and Disagreement

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS

 BODY:
The ever-changing black experience in America is being assessed with a new intensity. Skin color, how you talk, more specifically what you say and how you live your life are examples of the tests being used to determine what it means to be black in the 1990's.
Not since the tumultuous 1960's has there been such an intense focus on blackness. In past years, such highly sensitive issues were seldom discussed outside some black circles. But they are increasingly being aired in national forums, news articles and books. The topics range from "What's Black, Who's Black, What's Not" to "Black Like Who?" Films like "School Daze," "Livin' Large" and "Strictly Business" have used satire to explore racial conflict and contradiction among blacks.
 
Outlooks, Values, Beliefs
 "These are valid questions in that there are some distinctions in the ethnic sense as to what it means to be black culturally and psychologically," said Dr. Roderick J. Watts of DePaul University, Chicago, a consultant on human diversity and assistant professor of psychology. "Aside from skin color, there is something to being ethnically black in terms of outlook on life, values and beliefs." 
 All this was reflected during the hearings on Judge Clarence Thomas's nomination to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. Some blacks felt that he used his race selectively and played down the importance of race itself until he was accused of sexual harassment; then he made it an issue. Many blacks questioned the "blackness" of a man who embraces a conservative philosophy and is married to a white woman. To still others, his accuser, Anita F. Hill, a law professor at the University of Oklahoma, failed the "blackness" test by betraying another member of her race.
Some blacks say that black Americans cannot afford to waste time on such issues when so many blacks face a multitude of problems like drug abuse, unemployment, prejudice and the disproportion of blacks among crime victims.
The search for identity is, of course, hardly limited to blacks. A similar self-examination occurs among feminists on whether women should receive equal treatment with men or need special protection because of biological and cultural differences. Many Jews have taken personal odysseys to find their Jewish roots and the meaning of religion in their lives.
The conviction that blackness is defined by more than race became popular during the black power movement in the 1960's. The mood is captured in Billy Paul's 1970's hit song, "Am I Black Enough for You?" Then, as now, blackness was often measured by one's militancy, the race of a spouse, style of attire and darkness of skin.
"Even today, there is an icy chill when I walk in the Apollo Theater, until I tell people that I'm black," said Benita Porter, whose skin is light and who wore a "10-foot Afro and Afrocentric clothes 24 hours a day" to feel "accepted" in the black power era. Mrs. Porter, now 40 years old, wrote about intraracial prejudice in her novel, "ColorStruck" (BQ Publishing, 1991).
"It's very difficult to look at me and reconcile my appearance with what I say, since I'm looking white and talking black," she said. "It's very mysterious."
 
Accusations of 'Acting White'
 Some blacks measure blackness by standards that border on the arbitrary and capricious. Black youths, for example, are sometimes accused by their peers of "acting white" simply because they study hard, go to the library or use standard English.
Julius Lester, a professor of Judaic Studies at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, says that being black has evolved into a "form of social fascism" in the past two decades, especially on campuses.
In 1988, 15 members of the university's African-American Studies department, of which Professor Lester was a member, asked that he be reassigned after he made critical remarks about the novelist James Baldwin.
"Is black identity so problematic that one is to be judged as 'anti-Negro Negro' for being critical of Baldwin or Jesse Jackson?" Mr. Lester said in a telephone interview. "Having been involved in the civil rights movement, I didn't fight against whites trying to limit and define me to turn around and have blacks try to limit and define me."
 
Evolving Perceptions
 The "race question" in America has deeply troubled blacks since the days of slavery, when a "single drop of black blood" classified a person as Negro. Today, increasing efforts to define blackness and what many blacks view as internal pressure to "choose sides" dramatize the persistence of the conflict, and the confusion over racial identity.
However, academicians and psychologists are developing a body of new, provocative research; they are seeking to replace old assumptions and perceptions of racial identity with more practical theory.
"The debates within the black community can be understood by applying the black identity theory," said Dr. Robert T. Carter, associate professor of psychology and elementary education at Teacher's College, Columbia University. "Each black person responds differently to their socialization and experience in terms of being black."
The theory of racial identity development was promulgated in 1978 by William Cross, a professor of psychology at Cornell University. He held that racial identity evolved in four stages, each marked by different attitudes and psychological functioning.
In the first stage, the individual attempts to deny membership in a race. Then an experience challenges this individual's anti-black attitudes, causing psychological and emotional turmoil.
Attempts to resolve the conflict are made in the third stage, when a person discovers his or her cultural heritage. The person may develop new, idealized images and intense emotions about being black, and feel hostile toward whites. In the fourth stage, the person assumes a positive black identity and begins to accept a bicultural identity.
"Racial identity is a complex, psychological orientation, which is what makes the debate among blacks so difficult," Dr. Carter said.
 
Troubling Reaction to Hearings
 For Dempsey Travis, a real-estate developer in Chicago, blackness is a "state of mind" in which actions speak louder than words. Blacks who do not measure up may find themselves ostracized or ridiculed. As Mr. Travis watched the Senate hearings involving Justice Thomas and Ms. Hill, he didn't see two black people.
"I saw a black woman and a white man in black skin," he said.
Such snap judgments trouble Itabari Njeri of The Los Angeles Times, author of "Every Goodbye Ain't Gone" (Random House, 1990), winner of the 1990 American Book Award.
"Ideology and identity are different from what is anthropologically the substance of African-Americans' identity," said Ms. Njeri. "Just because Thomas is not ideologically in lock step with the majority of blacks doesn't make him less black genetically. You can't take away his culture."
Today, blacks say, the standards for blackness are even more amorphous than during the civil rights movement, when commitment to the cause was the primary yardstick.
"Every oppressed community, or any community that thinks of itself as a community, has drawn lines and says certain behavior puts you outside the community," said Roger Wilkins, professor of history at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. "For black Americans who live in a society where racism exists, it is legitimate to set parameters. In arguing how best we struggle, there is some political and intellectual behavior in which you engage that keeps you from being a black person."
 
Divisions After Desegregation
 Life style is also a distinguishing factor. What marginal degree of upward mobility some blacks have experienced in the post-segregation era has segregated them from blacks who are poor, undereducated and living in inadequate housing.
"One of the things that is very disconcerting," said Glegg Watson, manager of urban affairs and higher education for the Xerox Corporation, "is the notion that among educated blacks that in order to be accepted by whites they must give up everything that is black; that if they played basketball before, they now have to play golf." Mr. Watson is the author with George Davis of "Blacks in Corporate America -- Swimming in the Mainstream" (Doubleday, 1985).
Olivia L., a 42-year-old lawyer in Cleveland, has become so sensitive about the subject that she asked not to be identified in full. "It's a tender spot in this whole identity discussion," she said. "I drive a Mercedes, live in a predominantly white, upper-class neighborhood and socialize mostly with whites. But I do a lot of pro bono work for blacks, I contribute to the United Negro College Fund and spend every Thanksgiving serving meals to the homeless."
 
Blackness and Challenges
 "Yet I've had black folks come up to me and say I'm not black because of how I live," she added. "It hurts, but I don't argue. In my heart, I'm black."
Members of the nation's growing multiracial population are also feeling unsure where they belong in this new world and under pressure to choose one race.
An element of this anxiety was poignantly played out in an episode of the new ABC-TV series "Civil Wars." The story dealt with a child custody battle between a divorced couple. The father, who was black, wanted custody of his son on the ground that his skin was black and the child was in an unsympathetic environment in Darien, Conn., and would not have a strong black male role model. The white mother argued that the child belonged with her and was in a loving family.
"It's wrong, destructive and very negative to think that those of mixed race are setting themselves apart from any of their ancestral groups, particularly blacks," said Carlos A. Fernandez, president of Interracial Intercultural Pride Inc. in San Francisco. The national group, also known as I-Pride, is lobbying for a census category of "mixed race." But some blacks accuse those involved in the multiracial movement of seeking to avoid the stigma of being black.
"We can't survive without that acceptance of diversity," said Ms. Njeri. "We can have unity without uniformity." She conducted a workshop, "What's Black, Who's Black, What's Not" at the convention of the National Association of Black Journalists last year in Los Angeles.
 
Of Sincerity and Conviction
 In his book "Reflections of an Affirmative Action Baby" (Basic Books, 1991), Stephen L. Carter, a professor of law at Yale University, discusses the sincerity and convictions of blacks who ostracize others.
"They really do believe that there is an important sense in which people of color who hold the wrong views have no right to call themselves people of color," he wrote. "They really do believe that the dissenters are traitors, Uncle Toms, merely biologically black, not bona fide representatives of their people."

HEADLINE: Aides Say Bush Is Shifting Focus To Relations Among the Republics

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
President Bush's move to recognize Ukrainian independence is the first step toward shifting Washington's diplomacy away from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's effort to preserve the Soviet Union and concentrating instead on the new relations among its splintering parts, Administration officials said.
The focus will shift from trying to influence the relationship between Mr. Gorbachev and the republic leaders to trying to influence the relationship between officials like President Leonid M. Kravchuk of the Ukraine and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, which Washington sees as crucial to keeping some kind of peace in the Soviet Union. 
 On Wednesday, Administration officials said Mr. Bush had told a group of Ukrainian-Americans at the White House that he would move "expeditiously" to recognize the Ukraine if people in the republic vote for independence on Sunday as expected.
The policy was intended to bolster relations with the Soviet republics, and the White House withheld a public announcement to avoid ruffling diplomatic feathers. But Washington quickly found itself trying to soothe Mr. Yeltsin, officials said.
The Russian republic's President, they said, learned of the policy move before he had been fully briefed and assured that the United States was prepared to wait for his government to recognize an independent Ukraine before Washington followed suit. The White House expected the Russians to be willing to grant recognition quickly, but may have miscalculated; Mr. Yeltsin strongly repeated his opposition to Ukrainian independence today.
Although Mr. Bush will support Mr. Gorbachev publicly as long as he is the titular head of the unraveling Soviet state, the new policy would seriously dilute the relationship with the Soviet President, narrowing it to the important issue of debt repayment and the increasingly less important question of negotiating treaties.
 
Undercutting the Hub
 In a sense, the United States has dealt with the Soviet Union as if it were a wheel with Mr. Gorbachev at the center and the political structure radiating outward to the individual republics. Focusing on the rim of the wheel would undercut one of the last bases of Mr. Gorbachev's power, his role as the link with the West, especially the United States.
Today, the Soviet newspaper Izvestia published an interview with Mr. Yeltsin in which the Russian President said of the Ukraine, 'Its secession from the union could be a serious blow both for the union and Russia."
Mr. Yeltsin's advisers also seemed concerned that the Bush Administration policy could undermine his position, American officials said. "It's Yeltsin's perception that he's not going to enjoy the same kind of relationship with the United States that Gorbachev did, that we are no longer calculating our own national interest on the basis of Russia," an official said.
 
White House Decision-Making
 Washington's failure to notify Mr. Yeltsin properly seems to reflect the way the Bush Administration does business, with important decisions made by a few officials in the Oval Office who do not always relay word to the professionals who make sure that allies and others are notified.
Officials said Mr. Bush's decision arose from foreign policy considerations and was timed in view of the Ukraine's scheduled vote on Sunday.
But the President also took the chance to score domestic political points by disclosing it to the Ukrainian-Americans, who are not a sizable voting bloc in themselves but are representative of the large number of Americans of Eastern European descent, traditionally a Democratic bloc.
The White House has reason to worry about those voters. In the Pennsylvania governor's race, a Ukrainian-American group informed the Republican candidate, former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, that voters of Eastern European descent were supporting the Democrat, Harris Wofford, because of Mr. Bush's seeming hesitancy in recognizing the Baltic states.
 
Avoiding Vacillation
 At a time when Mr. Bush's decisiveness and leadership are shaping as issues for the 1992 campaign, the White House clearly was anxious that he not seem to be hesitating, or to be following others' lead as he did with the Baltics.
Before informing reporters about the shift in policy, the Bush Administration began consultations with the Western alliance, sending cables to embassies and briefing NATO members in Brussels on Wednesday in hopes of forging a common position and timetable for recognizing the Ukraine.
Despite some statements by European officials on Thursday that Washington was moving too fast, American officials and European diplomats here said the allies are in general accord and that, indeed, Britain had been pressing Washington for about a month to change its policy on the Soviet republics.
Today Mr. Bush played down a Soviet Government statement expressing surprise at his decision. He told reporters during a shopping trip in Maryland that the Soviet leadership had shown "more understanding" about the American policy than press reports from Moscow had indicated.
American policy on the republics has been slowly evolving since the aborted Kremlin coup in August to take more account of the republics and less of Mr. Gorbachev. Indeed, before Mr. Bush went to Madrid last month and met with Mr. Gorbachev, the first point outlined in his briefing materials was that it might be their last meeting, Administration officials said.
But the United States had been doing what it could to slow Soviet disintegration, hoping the republics would agree to a sort of loose federation. When the Ukrainian Environment Minister, Yuri M. Shcherbak, was in Washington just a few weeks ago, he could hardly get the attention of the State Department, which said it could not preempt relations between Washington and the central Soviet Government.
Administration officials said the President and his advisers now believe the political ground has shifted, and that American interests no longer lie in trying to preserve the union but in being "a player" in relations among the republics.
"It's a whole new ballgame," one official said. "We're still tied to Gorbachev and if we had our druthers, a union is still preferable. But this is a recognition that our ideal is no longer in line with reality. If we don't get positioned, we could be hurting in the not-too distant future."
Officials said the Administration has not worked out all the implications of the new policy, including difficult questions about economic aid and military relations.
 
Reworking Aid Plans
 An independent Ukraine could mean reworking American plans for agricultural assistance, which are currently being routed through the central Government in Moscow. The United States also is seeking assurances that the Ukrainians will not try to take control of nuclear weapons on their soil, except to destroy them.
The timing of formal recognition of an independent Ukraine will be influenced by the degree to which Ukrainian officials satisfy American concerns on those issues, as well as their policy on human rights and their treatment of ethnic minorities, including Russians, in the Ukraine, officials said. But they emphasized that these were not "conditions" for recognition.
Officials said Mr. Bush is prepared to move quickly to strengthen bilateral ties with other Soviet republics and that he views the Ukraine as a test case. "We're starting to give some thought to what it will mean to have bilateral relations with countries that once were republics," an official said.
By letting it be known in advance that they are prepared to recognize the Ukraine "expeditiously," while trying not to take sides on political and economic issues between Russia and the Ukraine, the United States hopes to establish itself as the same sort of "honest broker" that it seeks to be in the Middle East peace talks.
 
Not Taking Sides
 Mr. Bush has a large stake in showing Mr. Yeltsin that he is prepared to take Russian concerns into account as the United States prepares to support the national aspirations of other republics. Washington has therefore been careful not to take sides on border disputes between the Ukraine and Russia over the Crimea and other territories.
"What we wanted to do was to get involved early so the Russians and Ukrainians can manage their relationship in a mature fashion, settling their differences in a statesmanlike way as other democratic states settle their differences," an official said.

HEADLINE: In a Specialized School, Young Mothers Thrive

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS

 BODY:
Talaya Goblish, 19 years old, born when her mother was 17, gets off the school bus on the parklike grounds of Honeywell Inc., with her own daughters Tashina, 2, and Takisha, 1.
Then comes Tammy Stofferahn, 17. She says she got in fights in school, dropped out at 15, ran away, got involved with drugs, tried suicide, met a boy and in June had a baby, Shawn. 
 Next is Lisa Drift, 18 and pregnant again, holding Christopher, 8 months.
 
Mothers and Big Business
 Each weekday morning a little after 9, these and 28 other young women and 34 stroller-age children report to the New Vistas high school, just off the lobby of the headquarters of Honeywell Inc., which makes home thermostats and aircraft instruments.
Nearly all the students are teen-agers, single and collecting welfare checks and food stamps or living with relatives who do. Inside, they give their children breakfast and deliver them to a day-care center adjacent to the girls' schoolroom. Classes start at 9:30 and end at 4.
This is a novel venture, a school for young mothers in the lap of big business. Now in its second year, the school is an effort to steer two generations, the mothers and their children, from dependence on welfare. Honeywell proposed the school, supplied the space, largely equipped it and cleans it. The Minneapolis school system runs it, provides the buses, the courses and two teachers. Hennepin County provides child-care workers, and other agencies provide a part-time nurse and volunteer help.
New Vistas is a corporate adaptation of the 20-year-old, much larger New Futures public school that Honeywell contributes to in Albuquerque, N.M., and that serves only teen-age mothers, mothers-to-be and their children.
What makes the school here unique is the students' daily exposure to the business world -- unpaid internships in Honeywell's credit union, paid summer jobs at Honeywell and volunteer mentors.
For some students here, babies that might have been agents of failure and despair have instead become catalysts for growing up fast and getting jobs.
"She's so important," Tiffany Santucci, 18 and a senior, said of her 18-month-old daughter, Amanda. "She shows me how important life is, how important it is to get educated. All the things I didn't do I want to do for her. If it wasn't for this school, I would be at home taking care of her."
Angela Carrier, 17, mother of a year-old son, Davonte, lives on $437 a month in Aid to Families with Dependent Children and $150 in food stamps. "I'm going to college next spring to be a nurse," Ms. Carrier said.
New Vistas is largely the project of the chairman and chief executive of Honeywell, James J. Renier, 61 and a father of eight. He has testified before Congress on Federal aid for children and has headed committees of the nation's biggest businessmen dealing with education. In all, Mr. Renier is probably the business world's leading proponent of building a better school system to accommodate the poor and of bringing early childhood education and social and health services all under one roof.
 
Dollars-and-Cents Decision
 However charitable his feelings for children, Mr. Renier says his corporate interest is purely economic. Welfare is costly for Honeywell and all other taxpayers. For every dollar spent on child care and education, Honeywell officials say, the taxpayer saves $6.
A study of adolescent mothers by the Minneapolis Planning Department five years ago found that 50 percent were on welfare five years after their pregnancy. "To the degree that we can avoid these things, we are helping all industries' bottom line," Mr. Renier said in an interview.
Poor prenatal and child care also restrict the supply of competent future workers available for Honeywell and other employers. And the lower birth rates of the 1970's and 1980's, in restricting the supply still more, give industry an extra incentive to see that children are brought up healthy. "It's one of the most self-serving things in the world for a corporation," Mr. Renier said.
With the help of welfare support and financial aid, two of last year's five seniors have entered the University of Minnesota here, a third will enter in January and a fourth has enrolled in a local community college. The fifth works as a a retail store clerk and is now off welfare.
New Vistas is quite unlike the conventional high school. There are no cliques, proms or sports and none of a high school's bustle. The students seem fiercely focused on just two things -- their babies and graduation.
 
Computers and a Personal Pace
 Students must take the same basic courses required in other city schools, plus courses in family planning and child development and a day each week helping in the day-care rooms. There are no lectures or classes as such. Admission is voluntary, and the school is no more selective than any regular high school. Its calendar follows that of the city's other schools.
The school is a large, quiet room. On one side are small tables where the two teachers and volunteers sit with two or three students and help with textbook work. On the other side students work at computers that lead them through courses at a pace each student sets for herself.
A result is that some students, unimpeded by the slower ones in a classroom, can make up time they lost having children. DeAngela Flournoy, mother of 1-year-old Shaneka, is a junior. "But I'm going to graduate in June," she said, "because I'm a very fast worker."
To get credits toward graduation, students must get a B in each course. And they are earning 50 percent more credits per trimester than they did at their previous schools, said Richard Peterson, one of the two teachers.
Minneapolis public school officials doubted that teen-age mothers would give up the life of conventional high schools, and had to be cajoled into supporting New Vistas. Most of the school system's teen-age mothers and pregnant students -- 1,331 as of a year ago -- go to regular schools, and most prefer them.
"We've always had a model of mainstreaming the kids, helping them keep up with their peers," said Nancy Banchy, coordinator of special services for the school system. But an ever-lengthening waiting list, now at 20 names, has developed for admission to New Vistas. And Ms. Banchy said the students' performance has been impressive enough to persuade the city to urge other companies to copy the Honeywell model.
One of New Vistas's features that appeals most to the young mothers is the school's later starting time, almost two hours after that at regular high schools, which gives them more time to get themselves and their children ready for the day.
 
Costs and Donations
 The Minneapolis school system has not yet analyzed the operating cost of New Vistas -- providing staff, meals, transportation and the like -- in comparison with conventional schools. Ms. Bancy said she did not think that it was significantly greater.
But Honeywell, in providing space it already owned for the school, did save the school system the cost of investing in a new building. The company also spent $200,000 to renovate the space, and the International Business Machines Corporation donated 15 computers worth $15,000.
The school has never had to discipline a student, Mr. Peterson said. The attendance rate is above 75 percent, as against the 50 percent to 60 percent rate of teen-age mothers in the city's other schools.
Since New Vistas opened in September 1990, four or five students have returned to regular high schools; another dropped out of the school system entirely.
 
Criteria for Admission
 To be eligible for New Vistas, students must have completed the ninth grade, live in the low-income South Minneapolis neighborhood around the Honeywell headquarters and have children or be pregnant. Nothing says a young father cannot apply, although none have. Previous grades and behavior are not considered, or people like Ms. Stofferahn would not have been admitted.
A tenth grader, Ms. Stofferahn entered the school in September after a stint in a rehabilitation clinic. ""I liked the teachers," she said. "They talked to me. They made me feel good. They taught me to take care of my baby."
She said her courses were a breeze now. "I've been zipping through everything," she said. For a career, she said, "I kind of want to work with children and errant teen-agers."
Speaking of Ms. Stofferahn, Norma Jeanne Akrivos, the other teacher, said, "When she came, she hardly said a word. She was really withdrawn, depressed. She has made a remarkable turnaround."
Among major companies, Honeywell gets high marks from women's advocacy groups for its involvement in community affairs, but lower marks for its commitment to internal family issues. Even as it provides a school and day care for the neighborhood poor here, the company does nothing to help its own employees with day care except at a plant in Clearwater, Fla.
Richard Green, the company's director of education affairs, said management was exploring ways to set up a day-care center in Minneapolis in collaboration with nearby hospitals.
Men do not figure into the life of New Vistas. When an appeal was made to the youngsters' fathers to join a support group, only five responded. "All I'm always told is they're not interested," Mr. Renier said. "They're not around."
Some New Vista students said they were putting off marriage for economic reasons: to avoid losing welfare checks.
Aimee Stands, 18, a senior, said her daughter's father, who is 23, is taking a course in blackjack dealing. "As soon as he gets a job, we'll tell A.F.D.C about it," she said, and the state will slowly diminish the monthly checks. "That will let my baby have both parents in her home."
Other of the young mothers encourage the fathers' interest in the children, less so in them. "He's my babies' dad, not my boyfriend," said Ms. Goblisch, who plans to go to college and become an accountant. "He visits them and plays with them. We're just friends now."
Much of the opprobrium once attached to unwed motherhood, persuading women to marry or head out of town has faded. Latoya Jefferson, 16, a junior who has a six-week-old boy, Keno, said: "My mom said that when she had me, there were people staring at her. But now it's O.K."
But within some of the students' families, the stigma persists. Quantina Beck, 16, said her cousins started ignoring her as her pregnancy developed. "When I needed somebody to talk to, go places with, nobody was there," she said.
Like the other students, Ms. Beck is hurrying on with her life and intends to collect enough credits to graduate next summer. "I want to a veterinarian," she said. "I want to go to work and help Ebony grow up. We'll just have to finish growing up together."

HEADLINE: Sparta Journal;
Captives of Budget Cuts Yearning for New Prison

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SPARTA, Ga.

 BODY:
Earlier this year, state officials in Georgia were fretting that many of the rural counties due to see new prisons opening this year might not have enough qualified people to staff them.
But at year's end it is the residents of those counties who are fretting, and not about a less-than-adequate labor pool. They are upset because the recession and a state budget freeze have stalled prison openings and in some cases halted construction of some of them. 
 Nowhere has the effect of this budget freeze been more stinging than in this city of 3,000 people about 75 miles southeast of Atlanta. The area's slim hopes of economic development and growth are largely tied up with the prison here, the first of seven new correctional institutions that the state is planning. And the ripple effect of the freeze has stretched from strained city budgets to thwarted private investment to dashed hopes of residents who hope to move up from minimum-wage jobs.
With its grand antebellum courthouse sitting astride Confederate Square, and colonnaded mansions sprinkled throughout the city, Sparta retains a hint of its gracious past, when it was the home of the wealthy cotton planters of Hancock County.
But beneath this veneer, said Betty Hill, chairwoman of the Hancock County Commission, is a troubled community with an unemployment rate of more than 15 percent and a 1989 per capita income of $10,596, which ranks 141st among the state's 159 counties. Nearly 30 percent of the county's personal income comes from Social Security and welfare payments, a percentage exceeded in only four other counties in Georgia.
Nearly 80 percent of the county's 10,000 residents are black, Mrs. Hill said. One of the legacies of the historic dominance of agriculture in the county is that industry was discouraged from moving in and so there are few jobs in the county outside of the school system, which is the largest employer. In all, there are 1,680 jobs in the county, so the 300-plus jobs that would be added by the new prison would go a long way in fighting economic stagnation.
The county and the city lobbied to be the site of a prison, and they dispelled officials' concern about a small pool of workers by producing 1,500 applicants for the the 314 jobs at the new Hancock Correctional Institution, which was to have opened last July. But by late summer, the opening had been put off until next July because of the budget freeze.
"It has kind of taken the wind out of our sails," Mrs. Hill said. Among other things, the delay has halted talks with a company that was considering opening the county's first large supermarket on the basis of the $7 million payroll from the prison.
"They said that without it we just don't have the economic profile to support a store," Mrs. Hill said.
Sparta's Mayor, Sissy Hudson, said the freeze had "wrecked several city budgets," since the city had used Federal grants and borrowed money to put in the public works improvements needed to attract the prison. She said the city had expected to repay the loans for water and sewer lines with fees from the prison once it opened. Other expenses too, like the monthly payments on a new fire truck, had been predicated on an electricity user fee that was expected from the 750-inmate prison, she said.
"It's getting so you can't even depend on state budgets and state jobs," the Mayor said. "We will make our debt service payment due next month by tightening our belts, but we have let the State Department of Corrections know that we will be hurting after January."
The delays have also upset Diane Wiley, a 30-year-old single mother of two, who had been hoping to move up from her low-paying job to a position at the prison, where salaries are to range from $16,500 to $35,000.
"I'm just still hoping and still waiting," said Miss Wiley, who said she had taken the civil service tests and gone to interviews and had been told she stood a good chance of landing a prison job.
Andy Bowen, a spokesman for the Department of Corrections, said the opening had been delayed as part of $26 million in cuts that the agency had to make this year because of the freeze. "Around here it's the economy that is the Grinch who stole Christmas," he said. "We are hoping for a partial opening in January, but as of now the full opening won't be until sometime later next year."
For now, the prison is virtually deserted. Construction crews are completing some work and a small cadre of corrections officers have moved onto the site. But the eight two-story buildings spread over four acres look serene in their muted gray, mauve and teal tones.
The prison lacks guard towers and the only real clue that it is a prison is the double fencing topped with security wire.
"Everybody was looking forward to it opening," said Paulette Robbins, a corrections officer who lives in Hancock County and transferred to the new prison from one in nearby Baldwin County. "But the freeze just stopped everything.
"Now all we keep saying is that it's going to be good, its going to be fantastic when it happens."

HEADLINE: RUSSIA BLOCKS GORBACHEV ON MORE DEFICIT FINANCING; SPENDING BY SOVIETS HALTED

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 29

 BODY:
The Soviet Union, virtually out of money, was forced to stop payments from its Central Bank accounts today after the Russian republic, led by President Boris N. Yeltsin, struck another crippling blow to the central Government of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev by refusing to authorize another round of deficit spending.
Coming two days after President Bush disclosed that the United States was prepared to quickly recognize the Ukraine's independence, the decision by Mr. Yeltsin not to bail out Mr. Gorbachev's foundering Government dramatized the difficulty that Mr. Gorbachev has in getting support for the union even from those inclined in the past to support it. 
 And in another sign of the crumbling center, Mr. Yeltsin's Russian government announced it was taking over temporary control of the Soviet Foreign Ministry building and embassies abroad because the Soviet Government did not have the money to keep them going.
 
Falling Bank Reserves
 The fiscal crisis reached a breaking point over an emergency appropriation, sought by Mr. Gorbachev, that would have authorized a 92 billion ruble deficit to carry the Soviet Government through to the end of the year.
Without permission to print more money, the Soviet State Bank is running out of cash to pay salaries, bills and meet other financial commitments, the bank's chairman said tonight on the main Soviet television news program. As of Thursday, the bank's reserves were down to 3 billion rubles and today, payments had to be halted on central Government accounts, said the bank chairman, Viktor Gerashchenko.
Mr. Gerashchenko, whose bank has been chosen for a takeover by the Russian government, blamed the "sad situation" on political maneuvering by a few Russian delegates, and urged the Parliament -- now adjourned until Tuesday -- to meet Monday and authorize the money. Mr. Yeltsin directs the Russian delegation.
 
Fears of Inflation
 Although the upper chamber of the revamped Supreme Soviet, the nation's Parliament, approved the budget authorization on Thursday, the lower chamber was unable to muster a quorum, leaving the issue in a state of parliamentary confusion.
"For some reason, several deputies -- mainly those representing the Russian federation -- took a position of political manueuvering and twisting and indecision," said Mr. Gerashchenko. "In this connection, the debate on the issue was intentionally broken off. What we have is the torpedoing of important decisions."
But the Russian government is adamently refusing to set off inflation with more freshly minted rubles at a time when prices are already spinning out of control. The Russian government, by far the wealthiest of the republics, has cut off financing to about 80 central Government ministries and has taken control of the money supply, and the Soviet Union's most important commodities, including oil, gold and diamonds.
In the meantime, the Russian government moved elsewhere to take advantage of the Soviet Government's growing weakness. The Russian federation today claimed temporary control over the Foreign Ministry and all Soviet embassies abroad, arguing that without funds, the central Government was not equipped to handle the responsibiltiy.
"The step has been taken to prevent the failure, disintegration of our foreign service, or to be more precise, of its infrastructure," a Russian foreign ministry spokesman, Mikhail Kamynin, told the Associated Press.
Those showdowns illustrated Mr. Yeltsin's power, which looms larger as Mr. Gorbachev's authority continues to shrink. But while opposed on some issues -- like the emergency budget, the two men remained linked in their efforts to prevent the country from a slow slide to ruin.
 
Yeltsin's Advantages
 Earlier this week, the republics refused to initial a proposed union treaty as Mr. Gorbachev had hoped, and this weekend, the Ukraine, the second-most-powerful republic after Russia, is expected to cast its vote for independence, casting a shadow over Mr. Gorbachev's efforts to rescue the union and Mr. Yeltsin's efforts to protect Russia from the pending collapse.
Mr. Yeltsin, whose republic controls most of the Soviet Union's resources and holds a commanding position here in the capital, has not been reluctant to use his advantages. A commentator on Vesti, the Russian television news, today seemed to echo the Russian government's thinking when he said, "If the Soviet Government cannot pay, then it would be logical to hand over its property to those who can."
"If the Russian Parliament declares a war on the union Parliament, it won't be a long one," wrote a correspondent in this evening's Izvestia newspaper, making the point that without the Russians, the Soviet Parliament -- which seats representatives from only 7 of 12 remaining republics -- would simply cease to function.
According to Vesti, 80 percent, or 72 billion, of the requested 92 billion ruble deficit would be financed by the Russian republic which, said the commentator tonight, means "you and I will have to pay this money to the central Government."
The commentator said that although a budget freeze will pose a hardship for millions of state employees, Russia, already flooded by unwanted rubles dumped by other republics, cannot afford more inflation just as its program of radical economic change is about to go into effect.
Starting on Monday, rubles will no longer be exchanged for dollars and other hard currencies at tourist rates fixed by the State Bank. Instead, the value of the ruble will hover closer to current black-market rates. Now, at official tourist ruble rate, one dollar is worth 47 rubles whereas street vendors are offering 80 rubles to the dollar.
Mr. Yeltsin's reform program, which also envisages price liberalization at an unspecified date, has set as its first goal restoring the stability of the ruble, which has become increasingly worthless as inflation rises daily.
In an interview published today in the newspaper Izvestia, Mr. Yeltsin sounded a note of alarm.
"I am greatly concerned over uncontrolled intervention of money into Russia," he said. "Tens of billions of rubles are flowing in the republic."
 
Ukraine's Currency Plan
 The Russian President said he would press the State Council, of which Mr. Gorbachev is chairman, to consider transfering the Soviet State Bank to Russian control "because under the current situation we need some kind of protection."
One of Russia's greatest fears is that the Ukraine is moving inexorably toward setting up its own currency.
"Russia might introduce its own currency only as a response to the same step taken by the big republics -- the Ukraine, for example, which would deal a serious blow to the Russian finance system," he said.
He also said Russia would not sign a political union treaty unless it is joined by the Ukraine.
"The situation for Russia will change radically and as a response measure, we would have to introduce our own currency, do something about the army," he said.

HEADLINE: Change Is 'Natural,' Ukrainian Says

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KIEV, U.S.S.R., Nov. 29

 BODY:
As the Ukraine heads for a crucial referendum on independence and a presidential election on Sunday, the front-runner is someone who has just ended 30 years as a Communist Party functionary in the Soviet Ukrainian hierarchy.
Leonid M. Kravchuk, the likely winner for President, today defended his long career as a Communist leader, saying it was natural for a person to change his views in life. 
 "Right now, it is the goal of the people and I can not be a traitor to the people," the 57-year-old politician declared, defending himself against charges of opportunism as he spoke of the popular fervor for independence.
"My views 15, 20, 30 years ago were different," the Ukrainian leader said at a news conference. "That is natural."
 
A Recent Convert
 But the anti-Communist opposition members running in the six-candidate race have pointed out that Mr. Kravchuk did not announce a change in his views and quit the party until after the attempted coup by Communist hard-liners failed in August.
At that point, Mr. Kravchuk, who had been chosen as the Ukraine's chief executive by its Parliament, headed off criticism by calling for a legislative vote on the question of independence and also a popular referendum.
This enabled him to take the initiative away from Ukrainian separatist groups, which first raised the issue years ago when they found themselves opposed by Mr. Kravchuk as party ideology chief.
One such member of a separatist group is Vyacheslav Chernovil, a political dissident imprisoned for years and now an opposition candidate for President endorsed by Rukh, the popular independence movement.
"I have held to my agenda for 30 years, fighting for Ukrainian independence as my life's goal," Mr. Chernovil said at the news conference, "and Kravchuk started pushing this only three months ago."
While critics have been accusing Mr. Kravchuk of using the nationalist flag to mask his Communist past, the issue does not seem to have registered significantly with the Ukrainian population of 52 million, as many of them prepare to vote on Sunday.
He remains the dominant figure in a campaign being watched worldwide for the effect the expected endorsement of independence will have on the future shape of the Soviet Union.
The Bush Administration has already indicated that it is preparing to recognize the republic's independence, dealing a grave disappointment to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's own campaign to create a new Soviet Union.
Polls now estimate that the independence referendum might win with at least 75 percent of the vote. In the presidential balloting, Mr. Kravchuk is estimated to hold a 40 percent share or better, with many among the 32 million voters undecided.
If no candidate obtains more than 50 percent, a runoff between the two top finishers is to be held in two weeks. Mr. Kravchuk would likely be the front-runner in that vote, too.
 
No Comment on Bush Stance
 Today, he displayed the confidence of a favorite as he thanked foreign correspondents here for focusing on the Ukraine and its history of seeking independence. He did not discuss President Bush's reported intention to recognize the Ukraine "expeditiously."
But he emphasized the republic's willingness to abide by international law, its plan to abolish nuclear weapons on its territory, and its hope to play a role comparable to European nations as they approach their own new political association next year.
On nuclear weapons, Mr. Kravchuk said he endorsed the idea of collective control by the republics to prevent disaster and to see to the weapons' dismantling.
"I would not like to have the black bag," he said of the executive control device for launching nuclear weapons. "I hope Yeltsin does not have it either."
Boris N. Yeltsin, President of the Russian federated republic, the biggest and richest Soviet republic, said in an interview in Moscow today that Ukrainian secession would be a heavy blow to Russia.
Mr. Kravchuk, speaking before the Yeltsin interview became known, said, "I think Yeltsin will recognize the Ukraine's independence, because I would do the same if Russia sought independence."
 
Parliament Remains in Place
 The Ukrainian leader seemed intent on avoiding controversy and projecting a readiness to steer the republic into the future.
"I have no reaction to my opponents. How they treat me is their affair," he said, avoiding detailed answers about his political turnaround as a nationalist.
While the presidency will be voted on Sunday, Parliament, with its now- transmogrified majority of former Communists, is not up for election. The opposition, focusing on this issue, says the old party apparatus has used the independence drive to inoculate itself and that a newly elected body is urgently needed.
But Mr. Kravchuk said the election of a new parliament should await greater economic stability in the Ukraine. He also said it should be elected under a new law to be drafted by the present Parliament.

HEADLINE: BEIJING SETS FREE 2 IN '89 PROTESTS

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 29

 BODY:
The Government today released a student dissident from prison and dropped charges against an unofficial labor leader, the official New China News Agency announced.
The labor leader, Han Dongfang, was one of the key figures in the Tiananmen Square democracy protests in 1989. As head then of a newly formed workers' organization, he mobilized laborers to join student demonstrators. 
 He was held for nearly two years without trial and kept in grim prison conditions despite being ill, apparently with advanced tuberculosis that he contracted in prison. The Chinese authorities, after initially refusing him medical care, released him on bail in April for medical treatment.
Chinese leaders are thought to have advised American officials that Mr. Han, a 29-year-old railroad worker, would be allowed to leave for the United States.
The Government also said it had released Wang Youcai, a graduate student in physics at Beijing University. Mr. Wang was serving a four-year prison sentence for his activity in the democracy movement, and the New China News Agency said he was freed because he had shown signs of repentance.
 
Bouquet to Baker?
 China hinted a week ago, in talks with John Kamm, an American businessman, that it would release Mr. Han and Mr. Wang. The announcement today did not link the action to a visit this month by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, but it was probably intended as a gesture of thanks to him.
Officials here have been indignant that Mr. Baker's visit was regarded by many in the United States as unsuccessful, and while they are reluctant to appear to have been pushed into doing anything, it is possible they will release some other dissidents -- on their own schedule. One official affiliated with the hard-liners said that even the early release of some of the best-known Tiananmen dissidents could not be ruled out, as long as they pledged not to cause further trouble.
While the announcement today seemed to signal a more conciliatory attitude toward leaders of the democracy movement, there were contrary signals as well.
The Associated Press reported Thursday that Zhai Weimin, a student leader who tried to organize an underground democracy movement after the summer 1989 crackdown, has just gone on trial in Beijing. In addition, Wu Jiaxiang, a poet and former Communist Party theorist seized in July 1989, was formally arrested a few months ago -- an indication that a trial is planned.
 
Central Committee Meeting
 The New China News Agency also announced that the Communist Party Central Committee concluded a five-day meeting today with a call to hold the 14th party congress in the last quarter of 1992. The congress, normally conducted every five years, will choose a new national leadership and may set the tone for the crucial transition from octogenarians like Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun to a younger generation.
In addition, a statement was released on agriculture and Communist Party work in rural areas. Its tone was pragmatic in places, emphasizing a need for economic growth and "opening one's thinking," and hard-line phrases about increasing Marxist education seemed to have been rendered secondary.

HEADLINE: Long Unlucky, Rail Bridge Hits $55 Million Repair Jackpot

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
When the Hell Gate Bridge over the devilish waters between Ward's Island and Astoria, Queens, opened almost 75 years ago, it was celebrated as an engineering marvel, a steel symbol of the nation's abiding faith in progress through the power of science and technology.
But in the last 60 years only the only fresh paint that has been applied has been in the form of graffiti. The longest and by far the heaviest and strongest steel-arch bridge in the world when it opened, and the least famous of the eight across the East River, the bridge has become a flaking and crumbling symbol of urban decay and decline. 
 Now Congress has appropriated $55 million to repair and repaint the bridge, which handles only rail traffic. While the sum is a piddling amount in a $151 billion transportation bill, the decision to provide the money symbolizes a philosophical change that promises to help rejuvenate the collapsing urban infrastructure and reduce the gridlock and air pollution choking cities across the country.
"After 60 years of neglect, this treasure will finally be painted and repaired," said Senator Daniel P. Moynihan, the New York Democrat, who included the provision in the transportation bill. "It will not rust. It will not fall into the river."
 
Chunks Fall Onto Homes
 While New York's more famous bridges received facelifts every 10 or so years, the Hell Gate Bridge was neglected, even though spans over salt water should receive fresh paint every seven or eight years. Over the years it became a menace. For the last 20 years, chunks of concrete, steel and other debris from the viaduct have regularly cascaded onto the homes of Astoria residents living below.
The money to repair the bridge, which is officially called the East River Arch Bridge but has always been known as the Hell Gate Bridge after the sweeping stretch of river that it crosses, is among a large number of projects sponsored by Senator Moynihan in the transportation bill, which was passed this week in the hours before Congress adjourned for the year.
The first revision of the nation's highway program in 35 years, it is expected to be the largest public works program in the country until the end of the century and to provide a shot in the arm to the stumbling economy. But the legislation's most pronounced impact may well be its most amorphous.
It ends the era in which superhighways were built to weave together the country's disparate regions and relegates the Federal Government to the role of benevolent banker handing out money to the states, which will be able to choose how to spend it. Supporters of mass transit have long sought such a change.
The Hell Gate Bridge is a key link in the 457-mile northeast corridor between Washington and Boston, the nation's most heavily traveled intercity passenger service. A recent count found that 34 passenger trains traveling between Penn Station and New England stations roll across the bridge's steel girders every weekday, as do two Conrail freight trains.
Peter F. Vallone, speaker of the City Council and a Democrat who represents the neighborhood, ceaselessly nagged Mr. Moynihan and the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, Amtrak, which owns the bridge, to repair it. "Every time he talked with the Senator he'd ask him why can't you fix it," said Richard K. Eaton, chief of staff to Mr. Moynihan.
The Senator had the money put into the transportation bill in the final negotiations between House and Senate Conferees. In breaking a deadlock that threatened to derail the bill, one of the key pieces of legislation this year, Representatives received $3.5 billion for a variety of demonstration projects they were pushing, while Senators received $1 billion for their favorite programs.
Since the appropriation was unexpected, it remains unclear when the work on the three-and-half-mile-long bridge will start or how long it will take to complete. Amtrak officials could not be reached.
"This is going to come as something of a suprise to Amtrak," Mr. Eaton said. "I don't think they ever believed they'd see $55 million to fix it."

HEADLINE: Dole Urges Bush to Act Quickly on Economy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
Only days after House Republicans chided the President by suggesting that he had failed to take charge of the nation's economy, Mr. Bush was warned by the Senate's top Republican today that he was in "rough shape" politically and that he should seek a quick consensus on a program to promote growth.
The advice came from the Senate minority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, who said Mr. Bush would be wrong to stand by his plans to delay announcement of an economic program until his State of the Union Message in January. 
 "With Congress out of town, it's all his," Mr. Dole said. "I think this is a real opportunity for President Bush because he is a single voice in Washington. He's got six weeks to demonstrate leadership."
 
A Call for Collaboration
 Speaking to reporters in a telephone conference call, Mr. Dole was quoted by The Associated Press as saying Mr. Bush should summon Democratic and Republican Congressional leaders to the White House during the current period of adjournment to seek agreement on moves to create jobs and stimulate economic growth.
The President has been torn in recent weeks between his party's conservatives, who have urged him to engage Congress in a political battle over economic policy, and political experts who advised him to let the lawmakers adjourn without taking up -- and probably rejecting -- any White House growth package.
Mr. Bush tried to do both this week and ended up looking to many Republican supporters as if he lacked substantive ideas for reviving the slumping economy or, at least, stealing the issue's political momentum from the Democrats.
Almost half the House's 166 Republicans wrote to Mr. Bush in frustration last weekend, urging him to appoint the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Jack F. Kemp, as a domestic policy czar to push free-market solutions for the economic slump.
 
Another Challenge
 Mr. Bush rejected that proposal out of hand. But when the House Republican whip, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, devised his own program of tax cuts and savings incentives and dared the Democratic leadership to bring it to a vote, Mr. Bush was pushed to line up publicly behind the measure or open himself to the assertion that he was uncaring about Americans' economic distress.
Today Mr. Dole said Mr. Bush had probably erred in endorsing Mr. Gingrich's proposal.
"I think the President probably went too far in enthusiastically supporting it," the Senator said.
"I think the President is in rough shape right now."

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STRATFORD, Conn.

 BODY:
A new drama -- featuring an elusive Englishman, piqued egos and the loss of lots of money -- has come to the American Festival Theater here, but in keeping with the theater's rather sorry recent history, none of the action has been onstage.
The barnlike former Shakespearean theater, which has been closed for most of the last nine years, is -- depending on whom one talks to -- either on the verge of finally giving up the ghost or about to embark on a bright future. 
 The uncertainty hinges on the Connecticut Assembly's withdrawal of about $4 million to repair the theater, and the credibility of a British-born producer, Louis Burke, who has come forth with a tantalizingly grand proposal to redevelop the property into a three-theater complex, with a drama school, and to build a hotel and restaurants nearby.
"This could be one of the great tourist attractions of Connecticut," said Mr. Burke, who operated a theater in Johannesburg for eight years before 1985, when he came to the United States and began producing plays like his 1989 Broadway show, "Meet Me in St. Louis."
He added: "If Connecticut wants this theater to work and if we can fight the small-mindedness of people, we will draw artists, students and audiences from all over the country."
 
Can Burke Raise Money?
 But many Connecticut officials, as well as theater board members, question whether Mr. Burke's proposal is anything more than an elaborate fantasy. They say that he has not provided evidence that he could raise the $40 million that he says is necessary to develop the theaters, much less the $100 million that he estimates the entire complex will cost.
"There have been rumors for about eight months of an English gentleman in town who's very interested in the theater," said Neil Sherman, the vice president of the Bridgeport Regional Business Council, whose purview includes Stratford. "The issue is: Does he truly have the ability to bring the money to the table? If he does, I think he'll find a great deal of support."
The town of Stratford, taking an easy cue from its English namesake, in 1955 opened the American Shakespeare Theater. Over the next quarter century, actors like Katharine Hepburn and James Earl Jones performed on its stage, and countless summer theatergoers enjoyed picnics on its 14-acre grounds on the banks of the Housatonic River. Financial problems forced the theater to close in 1982, and the state took control the next year.
By 1985, William A. O'Neill, who was then governor, bowed to public pressure not to demolish the theater, and approved, in principle, state aid to renovate it. In 1987, a nonprofit group called the American Festival Theater signed a 20-year, $1-a-year lease to operate the 1,477-seat theater as a venue for musicals, concerts and only occasional Shakespeare plays. The group has held regular monthly board meetings, trying to resuscitate the theater, with their most tangible accomplishment being a design plan developed by the architect James Stewart Polshek.
 
Et Tu, Lowell?
 Mr. Burke said that he too has devoted the last four years to developing his proposal. He has also taken options on several nearby properties for his proposed hotel-and-restaurant development. Last week he presented his plan to Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., who "is extremely positive about what we want to do" according to Mr. Burke, who is anything but shy in discussing his achievements, including his portrayals of Iago and Brutus in the days when he was an actor.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Weicker, Avice Meehan, described the meeting as "noncommittal," and said, "We have an existing lease on the property, and are entertaining a number of ideas, including those of the board."
Although Mr. Burke acknowledged that the theater's board of directors does not know about his plans, he suggested that the board might yield control to him. "Maybe they would feel it's time to move on," he said.
Saying many theater celebrities had written him letters of support, Mr. Burke said he had "no doubt he would raise the money." But theater board members say that he has produced no letters of commitment from financial backers.
Mr. Burke bristles at the suggestion that the project may not occur, saying: "My credibility is quite sufficient without letters of credit. I don't have a check for $100 million, but we have friends on Wall Street who are interested and there are many wonderful philanthropists who we'd love to name theaters after."
While board members are perplexed about Mr. Burke, they are more than a little peeved about the Connecticut Assembly.
"The annoying part is that the Assembly rescinded our funds in August, and they never notified us," said Joseph M. Stavola, Stratford's director of community and economic development, and a theater board member. "We went along having our monthly meetings, and were ready to go out to bid" on the renovation, when they learned of the $4.1 million cut from local news reports.
The Assembly reduced the theater's bond authorization from the $5 million that it had approved in 1987 to $855,000, against the backdrop of this summer's budget-cutting process.
"The money has sat there unspent since 1987," he added. "It was the feeling of the Office of Policy and Management that if the board were ready to proceed, there would be plenty of time to go back to the Assembly to get money approved."
Mr. Stavola said that the delays occurred because "the state agonized over agreeing on a fee to pay the architectural consultant."
"We can only throw up our hands" without state money, he added. "We can't raise that kind of money to renovate the theater and start it up."

Deteriorating Schools
America's theological schools are in woeful physical shape, an 18-month study by the Association of Higher Education Facilities Officers and the Lilly Endowment has found. 
 The study, "A Call for Stewardship," estimates that the 202 Protestant, Roman Catholic and Jewish theological schools surveyed have maintenance and rebuilding needs of more than $385 million, 11 percent of their total value of $3.5 billion.
"Many theological institutions have deteriorated to the point where their abilities to fulfill their missions are at risk," said Walter A. Schaw, executive vice president of the higher education association. "But, to our surprise, we found the theological schools to be in better shape than American colleges and universities as a whole."
A 1988 study, "The Decaying American Campus," put a price tag of $60 billion to $70 billion on the physical needs of college and universities, roughly 20 percent of their total value.
But while the theological schools appear to be better off by comparison, that is more an indication "of how bad colleges and universities are" than the health of the theological schools, Mr. Schaw added.
He said the study had also found that theological schools spent less on maintenance per square foot than their secular counterparts. The theological schools suffer less wear and tear by their students, Mr. Schaw explained, and tend to take advantage of cheap labor and volunteers not always available to the colleges and universities.
In the aftermath of the study, the association is holding seminars to educate administrators of theological schools in planning and finance. Mr. Schaw said there was an eagerness, especially among the schools' presidents, to change. "They have a sense of mission," he said.
 
A Warning of Weak Support
 While the buildings at both theological schools and secular colleges are deteriorating, there may also be another danger to the study of religion. James B. Wiggins, the departing executive director of the American Academy of Religion, warned last week that programs in religion were among the most vulnerable at American colleges and universities.
Speaking in Kansas City at the academy's annual meeting, Mr. Wiggins said that while the study of religion had grown quickly in the last decade the field might not be deeply enough rooted to ride out budget cuts brought on by the recession. "It's unthinkable to not have a biology department," he said, "but it is thinkable that a religion department is expendable."
Mr. Wiggins, professor of religion at Syracuse University, noted that religion departments often had only two to four faculty members. "I think we're in a real vulnerable spot," he said.
 
New Prayer for Hanukkah
 Hanukkah, the Feast of Lights, which commemorates the Jews' victory over their enemies in ancient times, is being given new meaning in what many see as the modern-day miracles in the new Soviet Union.
The National Conference on Soviet Jewry is urging that when the eight-day holiday begins with the lighting of the first candle tomorrow night, celebrants take note of the changes that have enabled hundreds of thousands of Jews to emigrate to Israel. In addition to the traditional blessings recited over the candles, the conference is suggesting that the following words be said:
"Tonight let us rededicate ourselves to Soviet Jewry, to expand on the progress made so far and work to resolve the outstanding issues facing over two million Jews remaining in the U.S.S.R. Tonight let us light a candle in solidarity with Soviet Jews, whose determination embodies the spirit of Hanukkah."
 
Minding What Others Believe
 At a meeting at the Vatican this week to open a period of evangelization in Europe, Vatican officials went out of their way to note the contribution of Jews to European culture. The assembled Roman Catholic bishops were also told that in their efforts to spread Christianity they should "encourage dialogue and collaboration with respect for religious freedoms," particularly of Muslims and Jews.
Similar expressions of sensitivity came this week from England, where the Archbishop of Canterbury tried to calm Muslim fears about the Church of Church's plans for an evangelistic campaign known as Spearhead.
According to a report by the Religious News Service, the Archbishop, George Carey, said that any efforts to spread the Christian gospel should be undertaken with great sensitivity to avoid confrontation among people of different faiths. Bishop Michael Baughen of Chester, one of the chairmen of Spearhead, was even more explicit. He said the primary purpose of the campaign would be to bring lapsed Christians back to the faith, not to convert people of other faiths.

HEADLINE: Shops Fill With Thrifty Shoppers As Economy Dims Season's Spirit

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
The Christmas lights were twinkling, the doors were open for early-bird specials, the store clerks seemed unusually helpful and the Santas had their laps ready. But despite shopkeepers' intensified efforts to create holiday cheer, many shoppers in and around New York City seemed determined to keep a tight grip on their pocketbooks yesterday, on what is normally one of the busiest shopping days of the Christmas and Hanukkah season.
People were still buying, of course. But interviews with three dozen shoppers and sales clerks in stores and malls throughout the region found that many customers were sharply reducing the number of people they were buying for, spending less on each gift and substituting homemade presents for purchases that they would normally make. 
 The overriding reason for their caution, they said, was concern about the gloomy state of the economy and their own job security.
"People have to think of the basic expenses, like mortgages and car payments," said Barbara Ross, who manages real estate, as she made her way into Bloomingdale's. "I have a job right now, but who knows what will happen?"
Several shoppers expressed resentment toward President Bush, who they said was not concerned enough about the weak economy and was not doing enough to turn things around.
 
Crucial to the Economy
 In a bid to promote the holiday shopping spirit, the President and his wife, Barbara, paid a highly publicized visit to a J. C. Penney department store near Camp David, Md. Trailed by a host of television cameras, Mr. Bush bought four pairs of white athletic socks and a child's sweatsuit, for a total bill of about $28. Mrs. Bush visited nearby toy and record stores, where she bought Christmas presents for her grandchildren and a compact disk.
Holiday shopping habits have become the focus of unusual attention this year because they mean so much to the overall economy.
Isaac Lagnado, president of Tactical Retail Solutions, a New York-based consulting firm, said the day after Thanksgiving typically generates 3 to 4 percent of the Christmas season's sales. The season, in turn, generates about 50 percent of sales for the year and as much as 65 percent of annual store profits. And since consumer spending is responsible for generating about two-thirds of the gross national product, shopping activity in this period is crucial if the economy is to rebound.
"This is what I call 'white-knuckle time,' " Mr. Lagnado said. This year, timing is also working against many retailers because Thanksgiving fell late in November. Hanukkah starts tomorrow night and there are less than four weeks until Christmas, compared with years when there are five.
In other parts of the country, shoppers also said they were buying more cautiously and conservatively than they had in the past. But stores in the South, Midwest and Pacific Northwest reported a stronger start to the holiday season than did their counterparts in the Northeast.
Not surprisingly, many store managers in the New York area were trying to put a brave face on yesterday's subdued activity. "There's beginning to be some bustle out there," said Joseph Picini, an assistant manager at Jean Country at the Smithaven Mall in Lake Grove, L.I. But by noon traffic seemed only moderate, as it was at many other stores.
"It's been a little bit slow and I've noticed that people will compare prices, walk around a bit and then finally decide what to buy," said Jacklin Nesheiwat, who runs a leather goods pushcart called New Collections at the Paramus Park mall in Paramus, N.J.
Still, not every store was doing poorly. Linda Rice, the manager of a pet store in Paramus reported that her recent sales were up by about 15 percent over last year. She thinks people are buying more pets because they are spending more time at home.
And the Sears store in the Smithaven Mall was reporting a brisk business in electronic appliances and computers. "I know it's supposed to be all gloom and doom, but we're having the best month here we've had in two years," said Stephen G. Ryan, the Sears district business manager.
But few store managers were so upbeat as Mr. Ryan, and comments from shoppers suggest that his experiences were the exception. Many of those interviewed said they simply did not feel the same pressure to make purchases as they had in the past. Some, like Evie Leon, were relying more on their own skills, like baking, or making arts and crafts presents. Ms. Leon said she is growing bulbs, making jars of potpourri and creating dried-flower arrangements with big bows.
A number of shoppers said the pressure was off because of agreements that they had made with relatives and colleagues either not to exchange gifts at all or to limit their numbers sharply.
"We're doing the Kris Kringle-type of thing this year where we put everybody's name in a bucket, and we all drew once," said Sarah Cortes, who was shopping yesterday in the Galleria mall in White Plains. Instead of having to buy presents for 30 relatives, she said this year she would buy only one gift and that would be limited to $25.
"It's gotten to the point where none of us can afford to do all this," said her husband, Frank Cortes, a payroll administrator for a municipal bond insurance company in Manhattan.
A number of shoppers said that while they were cutting back on their spending on adults, the children in their lives would not be shortchanged. But many parents said they would concentrate more on educational gifts and those that were truly useful, instead of on toys or strictly commercial items.
Catherine Aloi, who also was shopping in the White Plains Galleria, said she intended to take her two college-age children shopping for things that they truly wanted and needed, instead of buying them presents that struck her fancy.
"Before, we just went out and bought indiscriminately," said her husband, Ernest Aloi, a partner in a White Plains insurance company. But now the bleak economy is weighing on him, and they are using a budget to guide their Christmas buying for the first time.
Just last week, he noted, a Tarrytown firm that his company does business with had to let more than 30 people go. "I've been in business 31 years, and this is the worst year I have ever seen," he said. In these somber times, the Alois said they were also curtailing spending on presents for their 42 immediate relatives. Instead of buying individual gifts that cost $50 or more, Mrs. Aloi said they would put a $30 ceiling on their purchases. "Twenty-five dollars," Mr. Aloi said, firmly.
For some families, economic realities at this holiday time are simply too painful to discuss. "We're cutting back because one of us is unemployed, that's why," said a man who refused to give his name as he and a woman entered a White Plains sporting goods store.
Several shoppers seemed nostalgic for the days when Christmas and Hanukkah shopping provided license to indulge in a little whimsy. Yesterday, the overwhelming sentiment was one of obligation and pragmatism.
"You don't see the holiday cheer in people's faces going shopping that you used to see five years ago," said Debbie Mockrish, a 32-year-old hair stylist who lives on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. "It's more like a depressed look. It's just not as fun as it used to be."

HEADLINE: Mole Returns to His Hole Without a Movie Deal but With Love

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
A year ago, as some of New York's more famous squatters sat under the West Side Highway cooking a turkey and a pumpkin pie in an oven made from an old metal file drawer, they feared that their homes below Riverside Park would not survive to the next Thanksgiving. This year it looks as if they were almost correct.
Since last year most of the squatters -- who variously called themselves the Mole People, the Rotunda Gang and the Tenants of the Tunnel -- have undergone well-publicized evictions from their homes under the highway and inside a long railroad tunnel. The most celebrated departure was made by John Joseph Kovacs. After living alone in the tunnel for nearly 17 years, he headed upstate in March to become the first student in a program training the homeless to become organic farmers. 
 He and his dog, Mama, were promptly besieged by reporters and television cameras, interviewed on the Sally Jessy Raphael talk show and celebrated in at least one folk song. The film company of Barry Levinson, who directed "Diner" and "Rain Man," offered to buy rights to his story for $5,000 up front and $50,000 when filming began. Mr. Kovacs, who had left the tunnel with $151 in his pocket, soon had an agent on both coasts.
Today, though, Mr. Kovacs has no money, no movie, no farm, no job. He gave up farming in September and took his dog back to their old home, a bunker inside the two-and-a-half-mile-long railroad tunnel beneath Riverside Park. His life today is pretty much what it was a year ago, with one exception.
 
5 or 6 Letters a Day
 "The only good thing this Thanksgiving," Mr. Kovacs said, "is that I've got a young lady friend who I met through correspondence. I'm still living like a bum, and when the holidays come sometimes I want to crawl in a corner and cry, but at least I got her. I love her and I know she loves me. It's the best thing that ever happened to me. The last time I had a girlfriend I was 19 years old."
Mr. Kovacs's luck turned just before his 49th birthday in March, when an article in The New York Times about his exit from the tunnel mentioned his coming birthday and his hopes of finding a wife. It was read by a Sri Lankan woman working as a housekeeper on Long Island. She sent him a birthday card at his new home near Syracuse.
"Pretty soon I was writing her five or six letters a day, and then she came upstate to visit," Mr. Kovacs said. He refused to give his girlfriend's name, saying, "What would her boss say to her if he found out she was hanging out with a bum?" He did, however, produce her photograph from his wallet and arrange for a telephone interview Wednesday afternoon while he was making plans to see her this weekend.
"In every way John's good to me," she said. "He's sincere, he's kind, he's punctual. I don't why he has failed all these years. I feel very, very sorry he can't get a job, because I would like him to move out of the tunnel. The kind of life he's leading, I wouldn't recommend to any human being."
 
Problems With Program
 It is difficult to say precisely why Mr. Kovacs doesn't have a job or why he didn't last at the farm training program near Syracuse. During his years in the tunnel he habitually breakfasted on vodka, but on the job upstate he kept his pledge to abstain, according to the supervisors and other workers there. Both he and they blame other factors for his exit.
One problem was the novelty of the program, which was started on a farm near Camden, 40 miles northeast of Syracuse, by the Earthwise Education Center. It is a nonprofit group formed by several people with many ideals -- turning "homeless into homesteaders," making New York State self-sufficient in food, "bringing the people back home" -- but with little money.
The group had promised room and board and organic-farm jobs paying $5 an hour, but there were problems training the men and finding them jobs at that wage, and most of the eight homeless men brought there this year eventually left. Mr. Kovacs was placed at a nearby buffalo ranch, where he fed the animals and helped build fences in return for a weekly wage of $60 in cash and $100 in buffalo meat.
"He was a hard-working son of a gun," said Rod Batte, the manager of the ranch. "There were a couple of little problems -- he ran the tractor into the gate one day -- but I'd be glad to hire him again. He's a good guy. It's just that he's been alone so much of his life that he has a hard time trusting other people."
Mr. Kovacs said that he enjoyed working at the ranch and selling its buffalo burgers at the state fair, but he didn't like going back each night to the communal living arrangements at the Earthwise program. He had problems from the start, when he arrived fresh from the isolation of the tunnel and was given a room to share with two men.
 
'I Do Things My Way'
 There was a little tension over his habit of getting up hours before dawn, a carryover from his days of scavenging in the garbage of the Upper West Side. ("I always did my street shopping before dawn, because I didn't like to be going through garbage in broad daylight.") The major disagreement concerned the smell of his dog. Rather than wash Mama often enough to please his roommates, Mr. Kovacs moved out of the farmhouse with her and slept in a shed.
"I do things my way," Mr. Kovacs said. "I really wasn't liked. I didn't get along with nobody up there except when they wanted me to give them my money or buy them food." He especially did not get along with the president of the program, Winston Gordon.
"John was always being John," Mr. Gordon said. "We tried to stress four principles among the men, the four C's -- communication, consideration, cooperation, contribution -- but John didn't want to participate. He had an inability to communicate and follow instructions. He also got distracted from the program by his new girlfriend and all that media attention."
The media attention included a national television appearance by Mr. Kovacs and some of his former neighbors in the tunnel, who answered questions from Sally Jessy Raphael like: "Animals are very important to people who live under the earth, right?" After the interest from publishers and movie producers in his story, Mr. Kovacs signed on with agents at International Creative Management.
 
Back to the Bunker
 I.C.M. negotiated the $5,000 offer from Baltimore Pictures, the company run by Mr. Levinson and his partner, Mark Johnson. But after Mr. Kovacs discussed the offer with Mr. Gordon, who worried about Hollywood's exploiting the story, they decided to ask for $50,000 up front and $250,000 when the movie was made. That ended the negotiations. Mr. Kovacs and Mr. Gordon now blame each other for the idea to reject the original offer.
Mr. Kovacs said that he had $22 to his name when he returned in September to his bunker, one of several built for railroad crews when freight trains used the tunnel. Some bunkers are still occupied by his former neighbors, but many squatters left the area voluntarily or were evicted this year when Amtrak started sending passenger trains through the tunnel and construction crews began repairing the nearby West Side Highway below 72d Street.
Mr. Kovacs, a Brooklyn native who grew up in local foster-care institutions, said that he had not missed New York on the farm. He liked the country air and was sorry to return to the tunnel and its rats, he said, but he was trying to make the best of it. As the occasional train roared by 25 feet away, Mr. Kovacs sat on a sofa adjusting his kerosene lamps and pointing out improvements around the 30-by-14-foot room.
"I was up half the night fixing it up so the young lady can spend the weekend. I put up that curtain to give some privacy for the bedroom. This is the living room here, and the other couch over there is for her when she wants to lay down. I want her to be comfortable. My study is going to go over there -- I've got a desk and a chair to put there. I just got that portable toilet there for her. I spent my last $30 on it."
 
'I Want a Job'
 There have been personal improvements for her as well. "I'm not drinking so much, and I'm trying to quit smoking. I used to smoke six packs a day; now a pack will last me a day and a half. And now she wants me to have a suit for our dates. Last time I had a tie on, I was about 25, but what can I say? I love her. If she says get a suit, I'll get a suit."
Mr. Kovacs said that his girlfriend could not understand his unemployment when she and so many of her immigrant friends were working. "She doesn't realize how hard it is for an American to get a job," he said, complaining that he had been repeatedly rebuffed by businesses who preferred foreigners. He allowed that his brusque distrustfulness might have something to do with his job-seeking problems, but he insisted that after decades without steady work he was finally ready to apply himself.
"A lot of people in New York, they want to stand around with their hand out looking for a nickel or a dime. I won't. I want a job. I'll mop floors, scrub dishes, empty garbage, anything. My young lady has been supplying me with change in my pocket and clothes, and a woman is not supposed to be doing this for a man. I need a job so I can pay for her and get an apartment. I want us to get married. But if I don't get a job, I'm afraid I'm going to lose her."

Commemorating Pearl Harbor: Books That Analyze and Revise

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG

 BODY:
If you ask Martin Gilbert what's new about some of the books pegged to the 50th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor debacle, and how they differ from histories that appeared after World War II or in recent years, he offers a one-word answer: "Signals."
Mr. Gilbert, a fellow at Merton College, Oxford, is Winston Churchill's official biographer, an expert on the Holocaust and author of a score of books, including a newly updated edition of his authoritative "Second World War" (Henry Holt). The book includes fresh information about the interception and decoding of enemy signals, which helped to defeat the Axis in the Pacific and European theaters of war. 
 Knowledge of the enemy's signals -- the diplomatic and military messages used by the Japanese and the Germans -- was an important factor in command decisions made in Washington, London and on the battlefields. The deciphering of codes by Allied cryptologists remained for years the war's greatest secret. But more information has appeared about it in the memoirs of military leaders and intelligence operatives who were once restricted under Government secrecy laws.
The United States actually broke Japan's "Magic" code several years before Dec. 7, 1941. The most secret Japanese diplomatic cipher, "Purple," was cracked in 1940. Several days before the Pearl Harbor attack, a Navy cryptographer in Washington translated a secret diplomatic message sent from Tokyo to its consulate in Honolulu, specifically asking for the positions of ships and torpedo netting at Pearl Harbor. But the real meaning of this information was overlooked, and alarms failed to go off in the minds of the Navy high command in Washington and Hawaii.
The controversy over the attack on Pearl Harbor, whether it might have been avoided and who was responsible for the lack of preparedness, continues in books and publications. Conspiracy theories abound, including the one positing that Roosevelt and Churchill knew when and where the Japanese would strike. The accusation goes that one or both of these leaders did nothing about the intercepted signals so that the United States would be drawn into the war. If one buys that theory, then it's necessary to accept its concomitant, that Roosevelt deliberately allowed a large part of his Pacific fleet to be destroyed at anchor.
In the autumn issue of MHQ, the quarterly journal of military history, David Kahn says that it's time to put aside the theories that vital Japanese messages were overlooked, misinterpreted or deliberately withheld before Pearl Harbor. Mr. Kahn, the leading American expert in the field, is author of "The Code Breakers" (Macmillan) and "Seizing the Enigma" (Houghton Mifflin).
"The fact is that code-breaking intelligence did not prevent and could not have prevented Pearl Harbor, because Japan never sent any message to anybody saying anything like, 'We shall attack Pearl Harbor,' " Mr. Kahn writes in MHQ. He went on: "The Ambassadors in Washington were never told of the plan. Nor were any other Japanese diplomats or consular officials. The ships of the strike force were never radioed any message mentioning Pearl Harbor. It was therefore impossible for the cryptanalysts to have discovered the plan. Despite the American code breakers, Japan kept her secret."
A damning accusation against Churchill appears in "Betrayal at Pearl Harbor" (Summit Books), by James Rusbridger, a former British intelligence agent, and Eric Nave, a retired Australian code breaker and intelligence agent. Their book's subtitle baldly states: "How Churchill Lured Roosevelt Into World War II."
The authors declare that had Britain shared its knowledge of Japanese naval codes with the United States throughout 1941, the Japanese task force might have been overwhelmed by well-prepared defenses. . "The denial of this information was no accident," they assert, "but the deliberate policy of Churchill himself to achieve his aim of dragging America into the war." The book finds Roosevelt innocent, saying that he had been deceived by Churchill, an assertion not borne out by their secret wartime correspondence.
A number of other books discuss aspects of Pearl Harbor. Several have been re-issued to coincide with the 50th anniversary. "A Time for War" (Prentice-Hall) by Robert Smith Thompson challenges the belief that the United States entered the war because of the Pearl Harbor attack. Instead, the author argues, the Roosevelt Administration covertly assisted China in its war against Japan. He also contends that Pearl Harbor was Japan's pre-emptive response to American provocation. Stanley Weintraub's "Long Day's Journey Into War: Dec. 7, 1941" (Dutton) presents an hour-by-hour record of what was happening on that day all over the world. "Pearl Harbor" by Edwin P. Hoyt (Avon Books) describes Japan's planning and details of the attack. In "Visions of Infamy" (St. Martin's Press) William H. Honan of The New York Times tells how a journalist, Hector C. Bywater, forecast the plans in a prophetic 1925 novel that was known to the Japanese Admiralty and presumably served almost as a blueprint.
John Toland's "Infamy: Pearl Harbor and Its Aftermath" (Berkley) also argues that Roosevelt had prior knowledge of the attack. Gordon W. Prange's "At Dawn We Slept: The Untold Story of Pearl Harbor" (Penguin) and its sequel, "Pearl Harbor: The Verdict of History" (Penguin), present a rounded view of the minds and actions of all the major Japanese and American participants. Mr. Prange's verdict: the successful Japanese attack was made possible by American mistakes in judgment and preparation. He rejects the revisionist theory that places blame on President Roosevelt, however.
Thurston Clarke's "Pearl Harbor Ghosts" (Morrow) examines the attack through the lens of present-day Hawaii, making the point that the American military establishment still fails to admit its own errors and to recognize Japan's brilliantly conceived and executed strategy. "MacArthur's Ultra" (University Press of Kansas) by Edward J. Drea tells how the interception of Japanese radio traffic aided Gen. Douglas MacArthur in his island victories. In "The Pacific Campaign" (Simon & Schuster), Dan van der Vat writes that Pearl Harbor happened because the United States, after intercepting a coded Japanese message and deciding that a war was imminent, imposed economic sanctions on Japan. As a result, Japan made a pre-emptive strike, an interpretation that blames the victim.
A high-ranking Japanese Naval officer's view of Pearl Harbor appears in "Fading Victory" (University of Pittsburgh Press), the diary of Vice Adm. Matome Ugaki. He served as chief of staff to Fleet Adm. Isoroku Yamamoto , who, though he conceived the Pearl Harbor operation, argued against war with the United States. On Dec. 6, Admiral Ugaki recorded in his diary: "Hawaii is just like a rat in a trap. Enjoy your dream of peace just one more day!" As a professional, he expected the war to last 5 to 10 years, and worried that the Japanese people could not sustain such a long ordeal.

HEADLINE: Toward a Fair Fare

 BODY:
No one's going to like it, but New York City's transit fare is about to rise. How high? The Transit Authority says it needs $1.40, a 25-cent increase. Although some increase is inevitable and necessary, that would be a painful jump for many poor riders. Gov. Mario Cuomo and the Legislature could help by revising state subsidy formulas that now favor suburban and upstate communities at the city's expense.
The Transit Authority needs to plug a deficit in its operating budget and continue its rebuilding and modernization program. Fares pay for about half the operating budget, support capital bonds and directly finance some improvement projects. 
 Dwindling tax revenues have made it impossible for the Transit Authority to balance its operating budget. This time it isn't crying wolf, nor has it been profligate. Mr. Cuomo suggests that the T.A. cut fat, always a fine idea. But it's a distortion for him to imply that this could mean a smaller fare increase. Nowhere near. The recession has hurt deeply. Indeed, Deputy State Comptroller Elinor Bachrach finds that had tax revenues come in as expected, the T.A. could have closed its budget gap without raising the fare a penny.
As for the capital plan, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the T.A.'s parent, is short $4 billion from its $10 billion improvement program. If capital spending gets shortchanged, New York risks repeating the 1970's, when the fiscal crisis drove the system close to collapse.
Fortunately, there's a way Albany can help the capital plan and keep the fare increase down too. State subsidy formulas are unfair to New York City's mass transit riders. Although the M.T.A. carries 96 percent of the mass transit riders in the state, the M.T.A. region gets only 55 percent of state mass transit operating assistance.
And within the metropolitan region, the Transit Authority's buses and subways get less than their proportionate share, while commuter railroads get more. Although the T.A. accounts for 91 percent of the ridership and the railroads 9 percent, the T.A. gets only 55 percent of bridge and tunnel surpluses. It would also help if the Legislature equitably divided increases in the petroleum business tax between highways and transit.
The many disparities cry out for correction. Unfortunately, suburban legislators have no incentive. In the past, fares were linked, so subsidies to the metropolitan region also held down commuter rail fares. But the railroads don't need a fare increase now, removing pressure on suburban lawmakers to help the T.A.
Ignoring the city would be shortsighted. Though suburban lines may be healthy in terms of day-to-day operations, they too will suffer if capital spending declines. The Legislature would do well to help the M.T.A. find the money it needs to keep the subways running smoothly -- without unduly burdening the people who ride them.

HEADLINE: Chicken Kiev, the Sequel

 BODY:
Why is President Bush in such a rush to signal willingness to recognize an independent Ukraine, even before that Soviet republic votes on independence tomorrow?
Putting out word of "expeditious" recognition might placate right-wing critics. They chafed at Mr. Bush's "Chicken Kiev" speech in August condemning "suicidal nationalism," calling it ill-advised support for a disappearing center. But a rush to grant recognition risks squandering America's chance to promote a Ukraine that is both independent and democratic. 
 Before granting recognition, Mr. Bush would be wise to obtain commitments from the new government on minority rights and economic and military policy.
Tomorrow's vote on independence will only ratify what the Ukrainian parliament has already decided. Independence is a foregone conclusion; what remains to be seen is whether residents who are not ethnic Ukrainians support it strongly. If not, that could spell trouble and suggest that Ukraine is subject to further fragmentation.
The election does not assure democracy. The odds-on favorite to win the presidency is Leonid Kravchuk, onetime chief ideologist of the Communist Party. Local power remains in Communist hands except in Kiev and Lvov. The Council of Ministers, which runs the government, refuses to take direction from the elected parliament, as if still under party discipline.
Minority rights are also far from secure. Ukrainians justly hold Moscow responsible for their predicament, but too many associate Moscow with Russians, as if no Ukrainians served in the higher reaches of the party or the army. That narrow nationalism makes the many Russian residents of Ukraine fear for their rights.
Nationalism and a ruble shortage are spurring the government to pay hard cash to print its own currency, called the hryvnia. But introducing it without first bringing the budget under control would throw good money after bad. Too many Ukrainians also advocate beggar-thy-neighbor economic nationalism that can only accelerate mutual economic decline.
Nationalist-minded Ukrainians are planning for a 400,000-man army -- twice the size of neighboring Poland's, larger than united Germany's and far larger than Ukraine's economy can afford. And some Ukrainians prefer to share control over nuclear arms instead of getting rid of them.
Americans want a Ukraine that respects the rights of all who live within its borders, avoids economic nationalism and maintains an army its neighbors can live with -- in short, a Ukraine truly free of its past. Hasty recognition forfeits the power to encourage that kind of new country.

HEADLINE: Errors Hurt Global Warming Theories

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Tom Wicker, in "Time for Action," an Oct. 24 column on global warming theories, states that Richard Lindzen "told a group of scientists in Washington that he had 'withdrawn' the complex hypothesis that was an important element of his skepticism." Mr. Wicker's conclusion that my "changed position" seems to "justify a heightened urgency in responding to threatening atmospheric developments" is unwarranted. 
 The technical issue referred to was never an important element in my scientific objections to suggestions of pronounced anomalous greenhouse warming. Senator Albert Gore claimed it was and apparently released extracts of hearings that purported to indicate I had withdrawn my scientific objections. Mr. Wicker was misled. The full hearings indicate my objections to the warming scenario and the Senator's views.
My main points: (1) No current model would predict large warming in response to increasing carbon dioxide without strong positive (destabilizing) feedback from water vapor; (2) such feedback depends crucially on the behavior of water vapor from 6 to 16 kilometers; (3) in current models, the behavior of water vapor in this altitude range is largely determined by identifiable computational errors, and (4) even if these computational errors were corrected, we do not adequately know the physical processes that must be incorporated for the models to determine water vapor at these levels.
These are technical points. But computation errors hardly constitute a sound basis for economically profound policy.

HEADLINE: Ann Taylor Seeks Its Lost Niche
BYL>By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
When the retailing legend Joseph E. Brooks came aboard at Ann Taylor in late 1988, he was greeted as Prince Charming come to rescue a fair damsel in distress.
 Now, it looks as if the man who once saved the Lord & Taylor department store chain from eternal dowdiness has failed to define the Ann Taylor chain as anything more than just another women's clothing store. His method of adding stores at a 30-a-year clip increased sales and generated cash but did little to give Ann Taylor any special offering for the sophisticated career women who have patronized the store for its 37 years. 
He went after the big numbers trying to breathe life back into a store chain, and I find it hard to criticize him for that," said Cynthia Cohen Turk, president of Marketplace 2000, a retail consulting firm. "The merchandise they chose is the only type that will complement the type expansion they have planned, but some people are going to miss the uniqueness the stores had when the company was smaller."
 
A Shopper's View
 Amy Solas, a telecommunications consultant in Manhattan who buys many of her clothes at designer discount stores, said she used to shop for something special at Ann Taylor. But she has not bought anything there in more than a year, she said.
 "Their clothes used to be special; they were kind of elegant and classy and expensive looking," Ms. Solas, 31 years old, said. "Now they look more trendy and the quality isn't so good, not like things you could wear for five years anymore."
 For a while, the pell-mell corporate growth was impressive enough to hide all the merchandising mistakes, When Ann Taylor issued stock publicly in May it began trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $26 a share, and climbed to more than $36 a share by July.
 Then, trouble signs hit. Sales started falling, and the stock price lost altitude. It closed yesterday at $13.125 a share, up 50 cents.
 In October, Mr. Brooks's 37-year-old son, Thomas H. K. Brooks, abruptly quitas company president and the elder Mr. Brooks, 64, announced unexpectedly this month that he would retire as chairman and chief executive. The next week word spread that the younger Mr. Brooks had been stopped at Kennedy International Airport last month by the Customs Service for trying to sneak wristwatches into the country -- his second such run-in with the agency.
 Geri Savidge, an Ann Taylor spokeswomen, said father and son would not answer questions. That has left retailers, garment makers and trade publications all guessing that Ann Taylor's board had had enough of the two Brookses and had seized an opportunity to sever ties.
 The elder Mr. Brooks had an arrogant manner that often grated and seemed out of place at the more cozily managed Ann Taylor. (When he traveled for Lord & Taylor, he required his staff to send ahead 100 percent cotton bed linens to hotels where he planned to stay and include a toilet seat in packages headed for more rugged outposts, according to Alan G. Millstein, who publishes a garment industry newsletter.)
 Shortly after Mr. Brooks took over, he moved Ann Taylor's executive offices from atop the East 57th Street store, a location the company had used for years, up the street to fancier digs that were more than twice the size and twice the rent.
 
A Top Salary
 Mr. Brooks also earned one of retailing's most lucrative incomes, almost $2 million in salary and bonus last year. That put him in a league with Leslie Wexner, founder, chairman and chief executive of the Limited, a company more than 10 times the size of Ann Taylor, said Graef S. Crystal, a leading expert on executive compensation.
 "It looks like the virus is spreading from Wall Street to Fifth Avenue and Mr. Brooks has tested G-R-E-E-D positive," he added.
 Now, Ann Taylor, which has annual sales of slightly more than $400 million, is being run by a committee and is searching for new leadership to help it regain its niche. But some retail analysts think the company has so completely ignored the needs and fancies of its customers that it may never regain the lock it once had on the valuable career-woman niche of the apparel market.
 "Every specialty store and even some department stores have benefited from Ann Taylor's misstep, and once you lose market share, it's very difficult to win it back," said Kurt Barnard, publisher of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report, a trade newsletter.
 Joan Ryan, Ann Taylor's vice chairman and director of merchandising, said the company had reacted as quickly as possible to complaints about the quality and styling of its merchandise, by allowing regional buyers to have greater influence in stocking stores and by upgrading the materials used in its clothing.
 And, indeed, the company has incorporated spangled buttons, quirky trims and plaid and print fabrics into some of its latest fashions.
 Mr. Brooks, who ran Lord & Taylor for 11 years before he retired in 1987, joined up with Merrill Lynch & Company's leveraged buyout group to buy the Ann Taylor Stores Corporation in late 1988 from Robert Campeau's Allied Stores Corporation for $430 million.
 What they got was a franchise badly suffering from multiple personality disorder. Since 1983, the company had had a new president every two years, each determined to stamp the store chain with his or her own imprimatur.
 Mr. Brooks arrived with his ambitious plan to expand the chain from its 121 stores as a means to generate cash and profits.
 
Paying Interest on Debt
 To sustain that growth, the company had to control costs and increase sales. The best way to achieve that was by increasing the amount of private-label clothes and lowering prices. Such a strategy would also help the company generate money to pay interest on about $370 million worth of long-term loans used to buy the company.
 The company pressed its suppliers to keep their prices low, forcing them to substitute synthetic fabrics and blends for more expensive natural fibers to hold down costs. With less investment in quality materials and design, Ann Taylor clothes began to look like uniforms instead of unique fashion items.
 At one point, Ann Taylor asked Nicole Miller, a maker of stylish women's apparel that supplies some of the chain's trendier clothes, to replace its labels with Ann Taylor labels to help refurbish its image.
 By the next order though, Ann Taylor buyers reversed themselves and asked Nicole Miller to stitch Nicole Miller labels into the clothes. Even though the garments were the same, they sold better with a Nicole Miller label in them.
 Ann Taylor thought it "owned their customer" simply because she shopped in its stores, said Bud Konheim, president of Nicole Miller. "They missed their target," he added.
 And in its pursuit of profits, Ann Taylor ousted Joan & David Helpern Inc., the shoe manufacturer that had leased, stocked and operated the shoe departments in Ann Taylor stores for 24 years. After a lawsuit accusing Joan & David of breaching its licensing agreement, the case was settled and Joan & David took its business elsewhere so Ann Taylor could introduce its own line of shoes.
 Over all, the strategy did result in a 45 percent increase in sales from late 1988, and the initial public offering of stock raised nearly $167 million, which the company used to pay down its debt and reduce its interest bills. The stock offering should also improve cash flows, which decreased substantially when the company started paying interest on its debt.
 But the store expansion cannibalized the business of some existing stores by opening new stores nearby. That cut into the sales of stores open more than one year, a statistic that analysts consider a good indicator of how a retail company is doing.
 When same-store sales dropped 5 percent in August for Ann Taylor, two Wall Street retail analysts recommended that investors sell Ann Taylor shares. Other analysts say they are not concerned by the Ann Taylor slump because it reflects the expansion in the midst of the recession.
 "The future growth of the company will come," said Jeffrey B. Edelman, a retailing analyst at C. J. Lawrence Inc. "If anything, the management shake-up could eventually have a positive effect on the company and its stock. The company was trying to sell the consumer what management wanted to buy rather than offering her what she wanted to buy."
