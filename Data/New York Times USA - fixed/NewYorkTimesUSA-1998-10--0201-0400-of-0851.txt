HEADLINE: PRODUCTIVITY;
Cyberagencies Match Families With Modern Mary Poppinses

BYLINE: By BONNIE ROTHMAN MORRIS 

 BODY:
TERESA JOHNSON never wanted to be a nanny. After graduating from Oral Roberts University, she spent four years teaching band at a Christian school in Madison, Wis. When she wanted a new teaching job, possibly one that would take her overseas, she began her job hunt on the Internet.
"Somehow through my searching, nannies just came up," said Ms. Johnson, 30. The site she discovered, I Love My Nanny, advertised nanny jobs in Europe (www.ilovemynanny. com). Ms. Johnson began to rechart her future and eventually applied for work through another agency on line, Apple Pie, U.S.A (www.nanny.com). 
 There are other nanny-related sites, like www.nannynetwork.com, which bills itself as a listing of every agency nationwide and lets families and nannies find phone numbers, addresses and, where available, Web sites for agencies in their area. To help families with tax and payroll work, there is www.nannytaxes.com.
Today Ms. Johnson works as a nanny in East Hills, N.Y., on the North Shore of Long Island, caring for two school-age children. She has her own room, her own phone line and her own computer. Her French horn, which she has played for 18 years, is tucked away for now. She is a new breed of live-in nanny, the kind coveted by many families and, because of the Internet, increasingly available: college educated, at least 25 years old and accustomed to being away from home. She was lured to the profession by the prospect of a job in a glamorous location.
"It turned out that the overseas positions were filled already, but I thought even if I didn't go overseas, maybe I could be on the East Coast," said Ms. Johnson, who is thrilled to be in affluent East Hills, a place almost as foreign to her as Europe would be.
In the olden days of the nanny business -- that's about two years ago -- nanny employment agencies placed classified advertisements in local and college newspapers in the Midwest, trolling for prospective workers. That needle-in-a-haystack approach was expensive and inefficient. Many applicants were too young or too inexperienced or had sketchy, uncheckable backgrounds. But the Web is effecting some fundamental changes in nannydom.
About 5 percent of all preschool-age children are cared for by live-in nannies, governesses and au pairs. That's about one million child-care workers, 125,000 of whom are placed by approximately 500 nanny employment agencies, said Mary O'Connor, president of the International Nanny Association (www.nanny.org). Though that represents a slim slice of the child-care pie, there are still fewer qualified candidates than jobs. For would-be nannies and the families who hire them, the Web may help put more employable candidates into the mix.
Mary Clurman, who runs Apple Pie, U.S.A., a 14-year-old agency, put her business completely on the Web two years ago. Ms. Clurman, who places nannies directly with families and recruits them for other agencies, said she had more qualified nannies today than she could place. Leigh Billingsley, a mother of two in Tustin, Calif., who just hired her second nanny from the Net (her first returned home), said: "I've had so much luck with Internet nannies. There's an abundance of young women who are highly qualified and highly educated."
Web-based agencies are increasingly functioning as clearinghouses for many of the smaller nanny employment agencies nationwide who rely on them for candidates. These smaller agencies may have E-mail or simple billboard-type Web sites but many can't receive applications from candidates and families on line.
The Web-based agencies say they are standardizing the industry by codifying job descriptions and raising salaries, which average $350 a week nationwide, according to a survey of 300 readers in Nanny News, published by Apple Pie for nannies and their employers. Salaries in the New York metropolitan area and in other major cities can reach $800 to $1,000 weekly.
Salaries and job standards are well advertised on the more sophisticated sites, which attract college graduates who, like Ms. Johnson, may never have considered the career before. Many candidates view a nanny position as a stop on the way to "real life," allowing them to pay off student loans and figure out what's next.
Recruiting on line does have a downside: it's a little too easy. "Right around college graduation, we get tons of applications from women who don't have jobs yet, and after hours of going through the process with us, decide they don't want to be a nanny after all," said Jackie Williams, owner of I Love My Nanny. Once her agency decides that a candidate is serious, the matching process begins. The nannies, and the families seeking them, are screened.
The Web makes it easier for agencies to do background checks, too. Digging deeply -- tracing a phone number or address of a reference or verifying a college degree or the length of previous employment -- is simplified. The International Nanny Association warns, however, that background checks of criminal records are limited by state and Federal laws and may not show the whole picture.
"Finding nannies on the Internet is the very beginning," said Carol Solomon, owner of the New York Nanny Center (www.nynanny.com). Rigorous screening still involves person-to-person contact, Ms. Solomon said.
For qualified candidates, the process doesn't take long. Jennifer Staszewski, a 25-year-old graduate of the University of Wisconsin at Lacrosse, applied with Midwest Nannies (www.mwnanny.com). Her job search lasted one month. Now she works for a family in Short Hills, N.J.; she plans to be with them for a year, then go to graduate school.
While many agency owners say most of their clients learn of them by word of mouth, families in need of nannies are also using the Web. Some families are from remote areas where nannies and nanny agencies are nonexistent.
Ed Stansfield, the manager of the Merrill Lynch office in Hanover, N.H., and his wife, Amy, administrative director of Dartmouth's Hitchcock Medical Center, started searching for a nanny to care for their 6-year-old son through I Love My Nanny. Mr. Stansfield likes to use the Internet, so using it to find a nanny was natural for him. He was directed to the site by his sister-in-law, Ms. Billingsley in California. The Stansfields live on a mountaintop on 60 acres; their driveway is a mile long. They wanted their nanny to be athletic and not afraid of isolation.
"I give a lot of credit to the technology edge for making the quicker match," said Mr. Stansfield, whose college-educated nanny, Tara Olcott, applied through the Internet. She grew up in Vermont, where her nearest neighbor lived a half-mile away. Isolation isn't a problem.
"The Web is attracting people who are better able to communicate with their employers, and families are looking for people who are more economically and educationally like themselves," said Kathleen Webb of Home/Work Solutions in Sterling, Va. Home/Work Solutions runs three Web nanny sites; one site carries classified listings for families and nannies who want to avoid agency fees, which range from $800 to $3,000 per placement (www.4nannies.com).
But the heads of Web-based agencies concede that their focus on the Internet might make them miss out on some qualified candidates.
"You can be an outstanding caregiver and not have any of the attributes needed to get on the Internet," Ms. Webb said. "Think of 'The Brady Bunch.' Do you think Alice was on the Net?"
And Ms. Williams said, "You don't need a Ph.D. to give a hug."

HEADLINE: For Whom the Sell Tolls? It Tolls For Thee

BYLINE: By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
PAPA'S got a brand new bag.
On Oct. 15, Ernest Hemingway will become a home furnishings brand. The Ernest Hemingway Collection -- 96 pieces of living, dining and bedroom furniture and accessories -- will be introduced at the International Home Furnishings Market in High Point, N.C., the wholesale furniture exposition. 
 Matthew J. Bruccoli, a Hemingway scholar, isn't surprised. "Hemingway was the most astute self-publicist that America has ever known," he said. "His brand name has outlived him by 37 years. People who have never read a book recognize him. "
"Branding" -- attaching a name or trademark to a product to give it an aura of value and a sales hook -- is a familiar strategy in fashion, luxury goods and entertainment. But it is about to hit consumers where they sit. And the pitch has an odd new roll call, with famous names from the four corners of the pop cultural map, Coca-Cola to Greta Garbo.
Bob Mackie, the Hollywood costume designer, will be at High Point, too, with his own spin, as will the Central Park Conservancy and the Professional Golfers' Association. Mr. Mackie will bring to seating the glamour he brought to Barbie. Central Park hopes to hit pay dirt, initially with rugs from a "casual age of innocence." For the PGA Tour, "styling which we hope will be popular with 26.5 million golfers" could be straight fairway or pure sand pit.
The Cole Porter Memories collection -- including $1,900 copies of zebra-cloth chairs from Porter's Paris apartment and a $142,000 replica of the Steinway piano he played at the Waldorf-Astoria -- is being introduced today by the J. Peterman Company at the opening of its Grand Central Terminal store.
Source Perrier furnishings arrived at Pierre Deux stores in August. The company has restocked twice.
With a strong economy producing a record $59 billion in sales in the year ended in July for the furniture industry, a gold rush of unlikely licensing agreements is now under way. Ralph Lauren, the Moses of cross-merchandising, was just the beginning. He moved into furnishings 15 years ago. Retail sales are now $700 million annually. Next year could be the year when the way furniture is marketed changes forever.
For spring, expect the Faith Popcorn Cocooning collection. Ms. Popcorn, the trend forecaster, is negotiating with Barcalounger on the initial product: a recliner for women that will include features for nursing mothers and aromatherapy.
For fall 1999, meet the Beatles. The Yellow Submarine, a franchise being launched next year by the three surviving band members, will include inflatable children's furniture. ("We all live . . . ") "The Beatles said fine," said Del Furano, the president of Sony Signature, the Beatles' merchandising representative. "I wouldn't rule out lamps and sofas. We encouraged them in home furnishings -- it's an exploding category. Everyone's nesting, and they want images from their past."
Home furnishings, humble stay-at-homes, are one of the last, wide frontiers for the hard celebrity sell.
"It's a big, uncharted territory for branding," said Juliet Schor, a Harvard economist and the author of "The Overspent American: Upscaling, Downshifting and the New Consumer" (Basic Books, 1998). "Home furnishings don't yet have the level of brand identification that so many industries do, like cars and soft drinks."
Licensed branded products, including apparel, cosmetics and toys account for $80 billion annually in retail sales in the United States, according to the Licensing Industry Manufacturers Association. Home furnishings now represent $1 billion of that. "It's one of the hottest segments of licensing," said Charles Riotto, the executive director.
Working with living celebrities, the estates of deceased celebrities (or "living legends," as licensing agents prefer to call them) and big trademarks like Coca-Cola, which introduced its bedding at a trade show this month, the furnishings industry is banking on the hope that branding will help sales to its core customers. Baby boomers, notorious for refusing to grow old, will be encouraged to buy middle-aged merchandise like furniture by identifying it with the eternal youth of popular culture.
"We don't have many heroes today, as the millennium approaches," said Marla A. Metzner, president of Fashion Licensing of America. She created the Ernest Hemingway brand with Hemingway's three sons, Jack, Gregory and Patrick. "We're going back to the great icons of the century, as heroic brands." Ms. Metzner also represents F. Scott Fitzgerald's grandchildren, who have asked for a Fitzgerald brand.
"I see a line that would be a mix -- from Art Deco to Ivy League," she said. " 'The Great Gatsby' is America's favorite novel -- and there's going to be a made-for-television movie next year."
Marilyn Monroe, Amelia Earhart and Greta Garbo -- an early cocooner -- are under serious review, too. "Symbols like brands have become a part of reality, a halo," said Dr. Richard Shweder, a cultural anthropologist at the University of Chicago. "In India, where I work, people believe water from the Ganges has a potent positive power."
Does star power really give furniture sales a boost? The Arnold Palmer furniture collection, introduced in 1996, is doing well. So is Eddie Bauer's. Alexander Julian, the fashion designer, is a hit, with $70 million to $90 million in wholesale business.
But Bill Blass's stripped-down interpretations of his own antiques have been labeled lemons by the industry. And Norman Rockwell painted himself out of the picture with licensed designs that didn't sell.
"The failure rate's pretty high," said Warren Shoulberg, editor of Home Textiles Today, an industry publication. "For every successful Ralph Lauren program, there are two or three who fall flat on their faces." The losers' circle is more crowded than the winners' circle.
Cher, the actress and singer, lost her tattooed skin four years ago with "Sanctuary," a direct-mail catalogue that included Gothic-style home furnishings.
"I was ahead of my time," she said of the self-financed effort, which was brought down, she said, by mismanagement and order-fulfillment problems. The collection will be reintroduced on the Internet in November at www.cher.com. But Cher has no illusions about the allure of a name in the furniture business. "I don't think that has much to do with furniture,"' she said. "People look at something that's going to come into their home and it either touches them or it doesn't."
Her friend and colleague Bob Mackie agreed. "I'm not going to pretend I'm this closet furniture designer," he said. Sketches of the Louis XV-style furniture for his collection were presented by the manufacturer, American Drew, a division of the Ladd Furniture Company. A five-piece bedroom suite will sell for a suggested $5,000 to $6,000 when it arrives in stores next spring.
"I hope people will be buying the collection for the furniture," Mr. Mackie said. "Buying it because somebody's name is attached -- that's a bad idea."
With the success of "life style" home furnishing retailers like Pottery Barn and Crate and Barrel, celebrity life-style retailing may not be an awkward reach; it is familiar ground to an adult population used to cultural souvenirs like T-shirts and baseball caps. Maureen Horn, director of home furnishings for Walt Disney Consumer Products, will be at High Point this month, shopping for licensees for a Disney home collection. "Guests staying at the theme hotels want to be able to buy the sofas and tables, so they can couple their memories with the furniture around them at home," she said.
How dear are your memories? And at what price fame, for furnishings manufacturers?
The typical royalty rate is 1 to 5 percent, depending on the power of your pull. "Living legends" like Marilyn Monroe can go as high as 15 percent.
Does the consumer get something original? More or less. Most celebrity collections are much like the rest of the companies' furniture, often at the higher end. The actual cost of developing a medium-size celebrity collection like Mr. Mackie's is largely the same as it would be for a group of unbranded furniture, which is generally $200,000 to $400,000. The "brand name" -- living, dead or incorporated -- has a veto on designs presented by the company, and a voice to suggest or change. It is rarely exercised.
"PGA Tour had a consultant who looked at our ideas," said Shelby Pulino-Pigot, the vice president of merchandising at Vanguard Furniture and a designer of the PGA Tour collection. "They never changed a thing."
What is one getting, then, at the end of the day, as one settles into one's identity?
"Confidence and passion, and a romance mixed with life and death," Ms. Metzner, the licensing agent for Hemingway Ltd., said of the new brand that will have its premiere at High Point. Thomasville Furniture Industries, the manufacturer, is introducing four theme collections: Kenya, Key West, Ketchum and Havana. There is no farewell to armoires: two are being offered. Sturdy but not unstable.
Thomasville conducted a focus group to gauge the market for the brand.
"Negativity came up from about 5 percent," said James Adams, senior vice president for sales and marketing. "He married four times -- this is Hemingway. He was a handsome guy. But there's an edge to this that kind of blows the bad stuff away.
"No one ever asked about what the furniture looked like. That's a great collection."
Brian Carroll, an editor at Furniture Today, said: "The industry has been chastened. No matter whose name you have, you're going to have to pay careful attention to the product. If the product's not exquisite, it's going to fail."
In other words, the sun also sets.

HEADLINE: Pace of U.S. Consumer Borrowing Slows

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Borrowing by United States consumers increased at a slower pace in August, Federal Reserve figures showed today.
Consumer borrowing rose $4.6 billion for the month, to $1.27 trillion, after rising a revised $5.5 billion in July. Previously, the Fed said July borrowing increased $5.3 billion. Before today's report, analysts had expected an increase of $4.7 billion. 
 Economists watch the Fed's consumer credit statistics because it helps them gauge consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overall economic activity. Consumer credit growth has been more subdued than just a few years ago, reflecting an abundance of jobs, low interest rates and low inflation.
In July, consumer credit increased a revised $5.5 billion, previously reported as an increase of $5.3 billion, according to the Federal Reserve's statistics.
Revolving loans, which include credit cards, increased $2.2 billion in August, erasing a July decline of the same amount. Auto loans rose $3.9 billion after increasing $2.2 billion in July. Other types of installment loans decreased $1.4 billion after rising $6.5 billion.
The pace of consumer credit was rising at a 4.4 percent annual rate in August. That was down from the pace of borrowing of 5.2 percent in July.

HEADLINE: College Tuition Rises 4%, Outpacing Inflation

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER 

 BODY:
The cost of a college education rose by about 4 percent this year, two and a half times the current rate of inflation, 1.6 percent, maintaining a pattern of the last few years.
"The cost of attending college presents a steadily rising challenge to many Americans, particularly the most financially disadvantaged," said Donald M. Stewart, president of the College Board, a national nonprofit association, which released its annual survey of college fees. 
 But Mr. Stewart said disproportionate attention to the small number of elite colleges in the $30,000-a-year range obscured the fact that most students at four-year colleges and universities paid less than $4,000 a year for tuition and fees.
The new data show that this year at four-year private institutions students are paying an average of $14,508, up 5 percent, while those at four-year public institutions are paying an average of $3,243, a 4 percent increase. At two-year private institutions, prices rose 4 percent, to $7,333 and 4 percent at two-year public institutions, to $1,633 on average.
College administrators made much of the fact that after double-digit increases for tuition in the 1980's and early 1990's, this was the fourth year in a row with an increase of 4 percent to 5 percent.
But Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, said he was amazed that the price of college continued to outstrip inflation.
"I'm surprised by this, especially among the more modest institutions, given the evidence that people in their 20's find it so much easier to find jobs," Mr. Burtless said. "You'd have thought that with some people deciding not to go to college that would increase pressure on colleges to reduce costs."
Lawrence Gladieux, executive director for policy analysis at the College Board, said he was "pretty sure a couple years ago that consumer pressure would pull the cost of private colleges down."
"But it hasn't," Mr. Gladieux said. "The market for higher education is so robust. People know that the best life chances and jobs come through college education."
He and others pointed out that children of the baby boom generation were coming of college age and that college applications were up.
George Rupp, president of Columbia University, said one of the biggest costs for him and other administrators was updating dormitories and dining halls to keep up with the demands of students and their parents for standards that increasingly seek to match those of hotels and restaurants.
The College Board data show costs for room and board to have increased 3 percent to 5 percent this year. Slightly more than one-quarter of full-time four-year undergraduate students live on campus.
"It was nice to go for 100 years at a stretch without having to change the infrastructure," L. Jay Oliva, president of New York University, said of the conditions offered for generations by many universities.
David L. Warren, president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, said colleges and universities were looking at ways to reduce fees further but were worried about affecting quality by increasing student-faculty ratios and reducing laboratory use.
Among the steps these institutions are using or considering, Mr. Warren said, is hiring contractors for dining services, grounds maintenance and bookstores. While this approach can be cost-effective, the resulting job loss disrupts the sense of community that many colleges consider vital.
Peter McPherson, president of Michigan State University in East Lansing, said fees there were up 2.3 percent, the fifth year that his institution has kept its increases at or near the rate of inflation.
This achievement has been possible partly through state aid that has surpassed the inflation rate but also, Mr. McPherson said, because of changes like selling the bookstore to an outside company -- the store used to lose $500,000 a year but now earns that amount -- and improving its campus hotel and convention center to attract more business.
The College Board survey shows significant regional differences in private college costs, with the highest average, $19,211, in New England and the lowest, at $10,701, in the Southwest. These differences were largely matters of the cost of heating and the age of the institutions.
Financial aid to students is now at a record $60 billion, a 6 percent increase over the previous year after adjusting for inflation, but most of the increase is in the form of loans rather than grants and most of the increased borrowing is unsubsidized. Loans now represent 60 percent of aid, compared with just over 40 percent in 1980-81.
President Clinton yesterday signed into law a rate cut for student loans, bringing it to 7.46 percent, down from more than 8 percent last year and its lowest level in 17 years. Under the new law, a typical student borrower at a four-year college, graduating with $13,000 in debt, would save about $700 over a 10-year repayment period.

HEADLINE: Wrangling Over I.M.F. Bill at Fever Pitch

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Alarmed that their foot-dragging could drive international financial markets into still deeper turmoil, the Clinton Administration and Congressional Republicans said they were working frantically today to agree on legislation to provide $18 billion in new funding to the International Monetary Fund.
While both sides insisted that a deal was still not a sure thing, White House officials and Congressional leaders agreed on the urgency of additional funds for the I.M.F. as it attempts to avert a global financial meltdown. 
 The most important remaining question, they said, is what sort of restrictions -- if any -- should be put on future lending by the fund, which has been harshly criticized by both Republicans and Democrats for mismanaging the global economic crisis.
The issue of I.M.F. funds is central to negotiations intended to avert a shutdown of the Federal Government this weekend, when funding for most of the Government is scheduled to run out.
"We still have some distance to go but I think we're making some progress," said Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, when asked about the negotiations over the I.M.F. funds. "I think there remain some stumbling blocks."
After meeting today with White House budget officials, Representative Bob Livingston, the Louisiana Republican who is the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said that "the tough drafting is over" on compromise legislation to provide the additional money to the I.M.F.
But the top Congressional Democrat in the negotiations, Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, warned that the negotiations with the White House could still break down and that "we're a long way from signing anything."
Earlier this week, President Clinton criticized Congress for delaying approval of the new funds to the I.M.F., saying that failure to provide the money was like "refusing to supply the fire department with water while the fire is burning," given the precarious state of the world economy.
The Senate has already approved the full $18 billion line of credit for the I.M.F. that was requested by the Clinton Administration to replenish reserve accounts that were emptied as the Fund attempted to bail out the economies of Russia and Southeast Asia.
The House, though, has approved only $3.4 billion of the requested funding. House Republican leaders, facing pressure from conservative members of their party who wonder whether the international economic crisis is proof that the Fund does more harm than good, say they will approve the rest of the money only if strict new conditions are imposed on future loans by the I.M.F.
The Republicans have demanded less secrecy in I.M.F.lending decisions, an end to below-market loans to foreign governments and shorter-repayment terms, with perhaps a one-year maximum.
"The I.M.F. has the Midas touch in reverse -- virtually every country it tried to help has become worse off from the experience," said Representative Richard Armey of Texas, the House Majority Leader, who led efforts earlier this year to block the full $18 billion in funding. "Full funding of an unreformed I.M.F. would be recklessly irresponsible."
The White House has resisted the so-called reform measures, saying it is improper for the United States to attempt to dictate policy to a multinational agency like the I.M.F.
White House and Congressional officials said that under a likely compromise, the I.M.F. would face some restrictions on its lending, with the Treasury Department required to certify progress by the fund in implementing a variety of loan reforms. But they said the conditions would not be nearly as onerous as those initially demanded by House Republicans.
Congressional officials say the House leadership has shown a new willingness to resolve the I.M.F issue -- and to end a variety of other funding disputes with the White House -- in hopes of preventing a Government shutdown this weekend that might distract from the impeachment investigation of President Clinton.
Other nations that lend money to the I.M.F. have warned that if the United States failed to provide the full $18 billion, they might well reduce their own contributions, which could leave the fund short of the $90 billion that it says it needs to deal with economic crises sweeping across the developing world.

HEADLINE: Global Computer Chip Sales Rose 1.5% in August

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct. 7

 BODY:
Global sales of computer chips rose 1.5 percent in August in the first month-to-month increase this year, the Semiconductor Industry Association said today.
The rise in global sales came despite a slump in Japan, where single-month revenues were 30 percent below August 1997 levels, according to the trade group's global sales report. 
 Total sales rose $147 million, to $9.81 billion, from $9.66 billion in July. The rise was the first month-to-month gain since November, a spokesman for the trade group said.
"Given all of the volatility in the global markets, these numbers are a positive sign for the semiconductor industry," said George Scalise, the semiconductor association president. "We are cautiously optimistic about the industry's prospects for additional gains in the fourth quarter, because it's traditionally the most active chip quarter of the year."
The report showed modest month-to-month gains of 3.4 percent in the Americas, seventh-tenths of 1 percent in Europe and 3.1 percent in Asia-Pacific markets.
On a year-to-year comparison, global sales for August were 15.7 percent lower than the $11.63 billion recorded in August 1997. Sales in Asia-Pacific, which were severely hurt by the region's economic crises, showed a 12.6 percent decline from a year earlier, while sales in the Americas fell 14.3 percent.
Sales in Europe, which have exhibited strength throughout 1998, were only 2 percent below August 1997 sales.

HEADLINE: Mortgages Are Much in Demand

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Applications for United States mortgages jumped last week to an all-time high, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said today. Applications to refinance mortgages also surged to a record, as mortgage rates continued to decline.
The association's mortgage applications index increased 15.9 percent, to 736.6, in the week that ended last Friday, from 635.5 the previous week. The group's refinancing index surged 21.3 percent last week, to 3,253.1, from 2,682.7 the previous week. Those are the highest levels for both the overall and refinancing indexes since the association began its survey Jan. 5, 1990. 
 The purchase index, which gauges demand for new houses, increased 7.2 percent, to 304.0 -- just below the all-time high set in late January.
The association's report showed the average contract rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a 20 percent down payment dropped 15 basis points, to 6.36 percent.

HEADLINE: Raytheon Widens Layoffs; Lower EarningsForeseen

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Continuing to struggle in its construction operation and in its attempts to build a lean, integrated military electronics business, the Raytheon Company said yesterday that it would expand layoffs and would not meet Wall Street's expectations for third-quarter earnings.
The company said earlier this year that it would shed about 8,700 jobs by the end of 1999. Yesterday, the company raised that figure to about 14,000 jobs, or roughly 16 percent of its work force. 
 Raytheon spent almost $13 billion last year to acquire the military units of Hughes Electronics and Texas Instruments, and the company has been trying to squeeze costs from the combined operation ever since.
As the jobs disappear, Raytheon, the No. 3 military contractor, intends to close operations in Texas, Washington, South Carolina, Massachusetts and California.
Raytheon also said that its beleaguered engineering and construction business, which some analysts have urged the company to sell, had dragged down earnings for the third quarter. Analysts had predicted that the company would earn 90 cents a share, but in a statement Raytheon said its earnings would be "slightly below" that figure.
In the statement, the company also said the weakness in the construction operation would lead it to take an after-tax charge of $284 million, or 83 cents a share.
"The good news is they are facing the problems square on and they are going to get rid of them," said Howard A. Rubel, who follows Raytheon for Goldman, Sachs.
Referring to scheduled meetings today between analysts and Raytheon's top management, he added, "The bad news is the earnings are a little bit light and the valuation is probably based on earnings, so the run-up in the shares on expectations of some very good strategic direction tomorrow will probably be over for a short while."
Yesterday's announcement was a coming out of sorts for Daniel P. Burnham, Raytheon's president and chief operating officer. Mr. Burnham joined the company 100 days ago after serving as vice chairman of Allied Signal Inc. His conference call yesterday with reporters was his first since joining Raytheon. He is to take over as chief executive in December from Dennis J. Picard.

HEADLINE: Meeting of World Finance Leaders Ends, With No Grand Strategy but Many Ideas

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
The world's finance ministers and central bankers ended five days of debate today with nothing approaching a strategy to lift the global markets out of their downward spiral, but a with a plethora of new ideas that some officials insisted would ultimately bear fruit.
All week the mood was so pessimistic that one European finance minister left Washington insisting, "I've had more fun at funerals." 
 At times the officials politely sparred with President Clinton and Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund. They argued over which European countries should cut interest rates and how much, and whether too much austerity imposed by the West would lead to the breakup of Russia or more bloodshed in Indonesia.
But they agreed repeatedly and publicly that the chief villain in this drama is Japan, with a supporting cast of avaricious hedge fund managers and currency speculators.
Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, the Thai Finance Minister, said "not much" had been accomplished. He was treated as something of a cult hero because his country's economy has hit bottom and now seems to be crawling back. "I'm afraid the markets will be disappointed," he said
Finance Minister Yannos Papantoniou of Greece agreed with the sentiment, bemoaning "the lack of clear political will to move in any direction."
Those who did not expect much progress nonetheless said they saw glimmers of hope. Weary from days of meetings and nights of glittering receptions that seemed oddly out of sync with the mood of gloom, they talked about Britain's proposal to establish what would amount to a Ministry of the Global Economy -- a standing committee on global financial regulation that would try to get the International Monetary Fund, financial regulators and private industry marching in a single direction.
Many said the world now understood the dangers of financial secrecy, though they were bickering about just what kind of closely held data countries and financial institutions should publish.
A few said President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, in confidential asides, had given assurances that they would pull $18 billion for the I.M.F. out of Congress, an amount they have requested.
What was missing was a parting message: that in tough times a strategy was emerging. "What this whole thing is about is finding a catalyst that will restore confidence," said John R. H. Bond, the group chairman of HSBC Holdings P.L.C., whose Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank has done business in Asia for a century. "But in this crisis there are so many players, so many different agendas, that turning it around will be very, very difficult."
In an interview today, Mr. Rubin suggested that anyone who thought a meeting of 182 countries would come to hard and fast conclusions did not have realistic expectations. "It was never going to come out with some highly momentous individual proposal," he insisted. "The question was, would it energize international action and a coalescence of views. And I think it unquestionably did."
"There are no magic wands," he added. "These problems developed over many years, and it will take time to work them through."
Mr. Rubin also made the case that there was now a consensus that there needed to be "some private sector involvement" in packages to aid affected countries -- financial code words meaning that big banks, investment houses and hedge funds that help drive countries to the brink ought to pay to clean up the mess.
One of the biggest accomplishments, he said, was that "everyone came out of the G-7 meeting with a shared sense of concern." He was referring to the huge gap between European and American views of the severity of the global downturn.
Some members of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries, France and Germany in particular, argued until last week that Mr. Clinton's repeated references to the "greatest financial challenges in a half-century" were overdramatizing the problem.
A senior European diplomat agreed with Mr. Rubin today, saying his delegation of officials and bankers had "left a lot more depressed than they arrived."
Finance ministers spent part of the week trying to assess President Clinton's political difficulties. Over breakfasts and lunches, ministers would ask reporters to put away their notebooks and then pepper them with questions about whether Mr. Clinton would survive the impeachment inquiry that was gathering steam two miles away.
France proposed giving developing countries and the European Union more authority over the monetary fund, a plan that seemed to be aimed at diminishing America's near domination of the institution.
Mr. Rubin politely dismissed the French plan with the suggestion that it should be studied at length -- the longer the better, he seemed to be saying -- but on Tuesday Mr. Camdessus endorsed it, saying he offered his "full support of the French suggestion."
President Clinton's suggestion on Friday that the I.M.F. change its strategy and develop a way to inoculate fundamentally healthy countries from economic contagion with pre-emptive aid packages led to public and private suggestions that it was time for Washington to come up with more cash before offering ideas on how to spend it. It seemed likely that Mr. Clinton's idea would eventually be accepted, but a top official of the monetary fund, Jack Boorman, said figuring out how it would work would take several months.
Most of the other talk about creating a "new international financial architecture" involved plans that most of those attending said would require years to be enacted.
The first may be new rules on what the financial community calls "transparency" -- requirements that countries divulge far more information about their finances to investors, making it harder to hide evidence of imminent economic disaster. Still, that is no guarantee. Investors ignored a good deal of data about impending trouble in Thailand and South Korea.
The other key suggestions to emerge from these meetings will take even longer. Establishing rules for common financial accounting rules and for renegotiating bad debts when countries and their banks cannot pay may make sense, but they impinge on the sovereignty of individual nations.
Giving broader powers to the I.M.F. to cajole, and sometimes order, countries to lower their budget deficits or raise their taxes also would impinge on their sovereignty.
"This is the basic dilemma of globalization," Mr. Papantoniou said. "Where do you draw the line between intervention and non-intervention?"

HEADLINE: Communists and Workers March to Denounce Yeltsin

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Red banners flapping in the breeze, Communists and trade unionists led a nationwide strike today to protest President Boris N. Yeltsin's rule.
In Moscow, thousands of protesters marched toward the Kremlin during a brilliantly sunny day to demand that Mr. Yeltsin resign. In Vladivostok, the improverished port city on Russia's Pacific Coast, strikers briefly blocked a road. 
 But the marches drew only a small fraction of the ten million demonstrators the Communists had expected. And while thousands of factories and companies conducted short, symbolic work stoppages, life basically went on as usual.
The Moscow subway operated normally and stores were open for business. Traffic was light, as many Moscovites took advantage of the demonstrations to turn the day of national protest into a holiday.
Today's tepid protests were in stark contrast to the anxiety early this week. Overheated rhetoric by Communist Party leaders about "civil war," and the economic shocks of past weeks prompted fears that this could be difficult, even dangerous, week for the Kremlin.
Braced for trouble, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov promised earlier in the week to pay back wages. Moscow schools were closed today as a security precaution. The American Chamber of Commerce went so far as to warn foreigners to avoid the city center and to disguise their nationality.
The Kremlin also arranged for the marches to take place far from the White House, the spot where tanks loyal to President Yeltsin fired on the rebellious Parliament in 1993, and an emotionally charged symbol for the left.
In fact, today's protest march seemed like more like a casual city stroll than a parade of revolutionaries. The crowd, which tended to be elderly, was made up of trade unionsist, workers and pensioners.
The protesters gathered across the river from the Kremlin and trudged peacefully toward St. Basil's Cathedral, while a loudspeaker played revolutionary songs from the Russian Civil War, like the ballad of Commander Shchors, a legendary Red Army Commander.
Holding a banner that read, "No to Private Property," the vanguard marched by the billboards for Nescafe coffee, Renault cars, Casio watches and Samsung televisions.
At a rally near St. Basil's, there were fiery calls for Mr. Yeltsin to quit, but no real expectation that he would actually do so.
Some of the labor officials tried to turn the protest into a campaign for Moscow's mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, who has sought to postion himself as the leader of a new center-left coalition in the next Presidential election.
But they drew catcalls and boos from the hard-core Communists. And after an hour or so of speech-making, most of the crowd drifted away.
Mr. Yeltsin, for his part, came to the Kremlin early today and monitored the situation, telephoning security officials and militia across the country. Mr. Yeltsin's spokesman said that the President had received "absolutely complete information, both pleasant and unpleasant."
Today's strikes, in fact, were as much a referendum on the Communists' ability to tap the vein of national discontent, as a test of Mr. Yeltsin's dwindling popularity.
The Communists had planned to mobilize some 200,000 demonstrators in Moscow, but the Kremlin insisted that no more than 50,000 turned out. The actual number seemed to be closer to the lower end of the spectrum.
Relatively low turnouts were also reported in other parts of the nation. Police estimated that 70,000 had protested in the Vladivostok region, not the 300,000 the Communists claimed.
Still, the Kremlin insisted that no more than 1 million participated in the marches or strikes, one-tenth the number projected by the Communists. In the Siberian region of Krasnoyarsk, Aleksandr Lebed, the governor and Presidential hopeful, egged on the protesters, telling them that Mr. Yeltsin was alone and isolated.
There are several reasons why today's protests were only a pale reflection of what had been advertised. Mr. Primakov was able to partially defuse the protest by promising to pay back wages and by naming Communists to top positions in his Cabinet.
Many Russians have also become deeply cynical about politics and no longer have any expectation that the Government will help them.
When Russians were asked in a recent poll who they relied on in a crisis, only 12 per cent said they counted on the state. In contrast, 61 per cent said they rely "only on myself," according to the survey, conducted by the Center for International Sociological Studies.
Further, many Russians who are unhappy with Russia's version of capitalism do not think that the Communist Party, which is led by the uncharismatic Gennady Zuganov, is capable of leading the nation out of its economic crisis.
The national mood seemed to be captured during the recent mayoral election in Vladivostok where a majority voted against all the candidates.
"It's absurd to demonstrate now," said Vladimir Speransky, a sociologist who said he came to watch the demonstration. "It's not clear whom to protest against."
Some of the fringe groups had even less successful than the mainstream Communists in mobilizing their supporters. Viktor Anpilov, the vituperative leader of the far-left faction Working Russia, had expected to mobilize thousands of his supporters. But no more than 300 showed up.
The event also attracted the usual complement of Cossacks, Monarchists and fascist extremists, who, by and large, mingled peacefully with the crowd.
Still, dedicated Communists insisted the demonstrations were an important way for Russians to show that they want Mr. Yeltsin to resign and make way for a new president.
Vasily L. Shishkaryov, a 48-year-old worker at the Zil truck factory, said he joined the Moscow protest but many of his coworkers stayed away. He said he only received 2,500 rubles a month, about $156. Because prices have soared and imports have dried up with the fall of the rouble, he spends almost all of it on food.
Most of his fellow workers, he said, gathered potatoes and vegetables in the countryside to scrape by. Some have virtually given up eating meat since the factory's subsidized sausage store shut down.
Most of his fellow workers were more resigned than angry, and that they would not be ready to take to the streets until things got much worse.
"We got paid in August," he said. "I don't think people will take any real action until they have gone eight months without wages."

HEADLINE: Korean Leader, Visiting Japan, Urges Healing of Old Wounds

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 7

 BODY:
President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea arrived in Japan today for a long-awaited state visit and immediately called for a closer partnership and an end to the longstanding tensions between the neighbors.
At a state dinner tonight, Mr. Kim stood up to toast Emperor Akihito, whose father, Hirohito, presided over Japan for much of its brutal occupation of the Korean peninsula until the end of World War II. Avoiding the comments that past South Korean leaders always made on such occasions about the "unfortunate past," Mr. Kim urged a "forward-looking partnership." 
 "The situation surrounding the two countries demands a closer partnership," Mr. Kim said. He later added, "The Korean people and my administration are willing, open-minded and fully prepared to exchange and cooperate with our neighbor."
President Kim has called for reconciliation of every kind since he took office in February, and he has urged for lifting the ban in Korea on Japanese music, comics, movies and television programs. That ban is a measure of the deep hostility to all things Japanese that remains widespread among Koreans, although the black market in Seoul for Japanese tapes suggests a bittersweet fascination with Japanese culture.
Japanese officials, apparently seeing a rare opportunity to heal ties with their neighbor, seem ready to reciprocate by making an unusually humble apology for the colonial past.
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi is expected to offer the most contrite formulation yet for a Japanese apology to Korea. The wording has been under negotiation between the sides for weeks, which means that it comes as much from committees as from the heart, but the result apparently will be a more direct official apology than Japan was ever prepared to make in the past.
Japan and Korea have a long and intertwined history, but Koreans are still haunted by the Japanese annexation and occupation of the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945. Japan built roads, schools and factories, but Koreans were harshly governed and forced to take Japanese names.
Mr. Kim can speak fluent Japanese, but like most Koreans he is reluctant to use it because of the bitter memories that it evokes. Although in the United States in June Mr. Kim addressed Congress in English, which he does not speak as well as Japanese, Mr. Kim is using Korean for all his addresses throughout his Japan trip.
Still, in any language, a president could scarcely have been more gracious than Mr. Kim was in his toast to Emperor Akihito. Mr. Kim warmly thanked Japan for helping during South Korea's economic crisis over the last year, and his only suggestions that Japan face its past were veiled in several layers of silk.
"If our two nations are to succeed in cooperative efforts, we must first respect each other and open our hearts," Mr. Kim urged.
Delicately reminding his hosts that many Koreans believe that Japanese society has not yet acknowledged the truth about its past, Mr. Kim added, "Let us forge a neighborly relationship based on truthfulness and a cooperative spirit."
Emperor Akihito responded with his own expression of regret about the occupation -- a reference carefully crafted by Japanese officials.
"The history of close exchange had a reverse side at one period when Japan brought great suffering on the people of the Korean Peninsula," Emperor Akihito said. "The deep sorrow that I feel over this never leaves my memory."

HEADLINE: A Quick Turnaround;
In Only 4 Months, Greenspan Changes Economic Tune

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Testifying before Congress in June, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, called the American economy the best he had ever seen. Less than four months later he is trying to avert a slowdown that some economists now fear could easily turn into a recession.
Speaking before a group of economists here, Mr. Greenspan said today that the outlook for the United States had "weakened measurably" and hinted that the Fed was ready to reduce interest rates further if the financial turmoil that began last year in Asia continued to spread. 
 Mr. Greenspan still marveled at the continuing combination of low inflation, low unemployment and steady American growth, which have sustained what is about to become the nation's longest peacetime expansion. But he fretted about the "somewhat scary psychology" afflicting financial markets and focused on the expectation that consumers would sharply cut back their spending because of the steep drop in stock prices.
And on a day when one of the nation's largest banks forecast that the United States will slip into recession next year, Mr. Greenspan suggested that the confusing and countervailing forces buffeting the economy had left policy makers without a clear idea of how serious a slowdown might be in the offing.
"The economy has remained in reasonable shape, with good growth and low, if not declining, inflation," Mr. Greenspan said in remarks here to the National Association for Business Economics.
"But we are clearly facing a set of forces that should be dampening demand going forward to an unknown extent. We do not know how far it will go or how much it will affect consumer and business spending here at home."
Mr. Greenspan went on to say that this is "a time for monetary policy to be especially alert." Investors took that phrase to mean the Federal Reserve is prepared to follow up its quarter-point cut in the Federal funds target rate last week, to 5.25 percent, with further reductions in coming months.
A few hours after Mr. Greenspan spoke, economists at J. P. Morgan in New York became the first from a major institution to forecast a recession next year.
Morgan said it expects no growth in the first quarter of 1999, a decline in economic output of 2 percent in the second quarter and 1 percent in the third quarter, followed by a return to growth of 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter. Morgan had previously projected growth of about 1 percent over the next year.
"The extra weakness has been triggered by the further deterioration in domestic financial markets in recent weeks," said a report from James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at Morgan. "Although a downturn could still be avoided, it would likely take a prompt reversal of recent financial market deterioration, or particularly quick and aggressive support from policy easing. Neither are anticipated."
While not ready yet to predict an end to the current expansion, which began in March 1991, other economists said they increasingly saw the economy as fragile and vulnerable to further shocks.
"My sense is that recession risks have risen dramatically, that recession is just as likely as a normal slowdown now," said James Glassman, an economist at Chase Securities in New York. "It wouldn't make sense for a Fed chairman to make that case, but if you read between the lines of his speech you can see a heightened concern about developments in the financial markets and tightening credit conditions."
In his remarks today, delivered from notes rather than from his usual rigorously prepared text, Mr. Greenspan often seemed to be pondering how the United States had suddenly been put at risk by the forces that have sent Asia into a deep recession and spread through Russia into much of the rest of the world.
"I've never seen anything like this," Mr. Greenspan said at one point, referring to the flight of investors out of any instrument perceived to have some risk and into the haven of Treasury bonds, which are guaranteed by the United States Government and are always easy to buy and sell.
As usual, Mr. Greenspan presented both the positive and negative elements of the outlook, but analysts said his emphasis was on the risks to the economy, which he has laid out in increasingly explicit terms lately.
Mr. Greenspan said the economy still had "a fairly significant continued momentum." Its performance, he said, is "really still quite an impressive sight," with job growth remaining healthy and inflation pressures muted.
While he acknowledged that it was becoming more difficult and expensive for businesses to borrow money in the debt markets and from banks, Mr. Greenspan said that "we are far short of anything that could resemble a credit crunch in the United States."
So far, Mr. Greenspan said, there is not much evidence of a slowdown in capital investment by business or on spending by consumers.
"In fact, if you look at the physical aspects of the economy as a whole, it is very difficult to find any real variable impact as yet," he said. While job growth slowed last month, unemployment claims remain low, "and anecdotal evidence still indicates that we are confronted with fairly tight labor markets and labor markets which are still putting some pressure, if perhaps not accelerating, on the overall wage structure," he said.
But Mr. Greenspan dwelled at length on the risks to the economy from the latest round of turmoil in the global markets, set off in August when Russia effectively defaulted on its debt, sending investors fleeing not just from other emerging markets, but also from high-yield junk bonds and other investments that suddenly seemed risky.
Mr. Greenspan, who saw one of the underlying causes of the 1990-91 recession as a credit crunch stemming from problems in the banking business, said the problems facing the economy now would be exacerbated if lenders and investors continued to pull back.
"What is occurring is a broad area of uncertainty or fear," he said. "And when human beings are confronted with uncertainty, meaning they do not understand the rules of the terms of particular types of engagement they're having in the real world, they disengage."
The Fed chairman noted that exports were declining, hurting manufacturers and farmers. But he soon returned to the potential psychological shocks from the global turmoil, especially the effects on consumers of the stock market's downturn.
He estimated that $1.5 trillion in wealth had been wiped out since the stock market's peak in July.
"It's got to show up somewhere," Mr. Greenspan said, adding that "we're bound to see the major impact in personal consumption expenditures and housing," two sectors that have driven the economy for the past several years.
William Dudley, an economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company in New York, said Mr. Greenspan's comments were "very much slanted towards the risks to the economy" and that his characterization of the economy as weakening measurably was "a fairly strong statement from a Fed chairman known for being opaque."
That Mr. Greenspan is acutely aware of how quickly the economy can slide into recession is understandable in light of his experience with the 1990-91 recession, when he, like most economists, failed to see at first that the economy had tipped from sluggish growth into economic contraction.
"We have not tilted down," Mr. Greenspan said in September 1990 -- two months after the recession later was shown to have started.

To Be . . .
Despite turmoil abroad, shakiness in the stock market, and fears of a credit crunch, many economic indicators remain remarkably positive. With inflation extremely low, real wages are rising at a healthy clip, the job market is strong, and banks are continuing to lend plenty of money to business.

. . . Or Not To Be?
Even though the current economy generally looks good, conditions are starting to deteriorate on a number of fronts. Fear of risk-taking has suddenly made it a lot more expensive for many companies to borrow from the credit market. Export markets for American goods are drying up and managers in other business sectors are becoming increasingly pessimistic.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Price Plunge On Nasdaq Hits 15-Month Low

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Prices on the Nasdaq stock market declined to their lowest level in 15 months yesterday and have fallen 17.25 percent in just the last eight days of trading. Other market gauges also continued to slump.
Analysts continued to cite nervousness over financial and economic turmoil in many parts of the world and unmistakable evidence that the United States economy is being affected. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, testified yesterday that he was trying to avert a slowdown that many economists now fear could easily turn into a recession. 
Nasdaq stocks fell 3.2 percent, or 48.28 points, yesterday to 1,462.61, a level not seen since July of last year. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 1.41 percent, or 13.91 points, to 970.68, and avoided a new low with a modest late-session rebound. The Dow Jones industrial average moved up in the morning but then faded to close with a loss of 1.29 points at 7,741.69.
European markets were also mostly lower. Stocks fell 2.90 percent on the main German index, 1.24 percent in France and 52/100 of 1 percent in Britain. Brazil's market closed 2.84 percent lower and the Nikkei index of 225 issues jumped 6.17 percent, the biggest gain of the year, while the Hong Kong market rose 2.38 percent.
Amid the general drubbing, however, analysts found some grounds for encouragement. One was that the march to lower interest rates, normally the stock investor's friend, stopped.
"This was one of the few days when stocks went down and the bond market didn't go up," said Christine A. Callies, chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. "Possibly the capital flight into the U.S. dollar may be winding down."
Investors around the world have been piling into Treasury securities as a haven so yesterday's contrary action may suggest diminished worry about what has been described as the worst financial crisis since World War II.
Analysts also pointed to some further signs that corporate profits in the third quarter may be a bit better than the market has been led to expect. Some multinational companies with sizable overseas earnings posted hefty market gains yesterday, benefiting from the decline in the dollar on currency markets -- 2.3 percent on a trade-weighted basis. McDonald's, for example, rose 2 13/16 , to 61 1/16 , while Procter & Gamble rose 3 1/8, to 77 3/8.
Banks and brokers, on the other hand, were pummeled again. Citicorp dropped 5 3/16 , to 79 13/16 , more than $100 a share less than the peak of $182 set April 6. Merrill Lynch fell 4 3/16 , to 37 3/4, barely one-third the stock's value of 109 1/8 set four days before the Dow hit its record high of 9,337.97 on July 17.
Bankers Trust, which traded as high as 136 7/16 in April, lost another 4 1/8 yesterday to close at 49 3/16 .
The financial sector is exposed to meltdowns overseas and to hedge fund and other borrowers here whose ability to repay is in doubt.
"We have a tug of war going on between those who think international efforts to stem the financial crisis are working and those who think they're not doing enough," said Andy Brooks, head of stock trading at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. He said it seemed of late that "all the forces at work in the market seem to be causing investors be scared about staying in."
Daniel Knight, portfolio manager at Columbine Asset Management in Colorado Springs, expressed frustration that several of the factors that have traditionally proved good predictors of stock valuations are no longer working.
For example, he said stocks with high price-earnings ratios have "dramatically" outperformed stocks with low p-e's in recent months, reflecting investors' focus on big-name companies with growth stories at the expense of lesser companies with greater intrinsic value.
He said this "overreaction" reflected shaken confidence on the part of investors, who in addition to favoring "feel good" stocks are also paying more attention than in the past to companies with solid dividends.
The Nasdaq's drop was marked by sizable losses in technology, its dominant category. Dell Computer fell 4 3/4, to 50 9/16 ; Microsoft was down 3 1/2, to 94 1/8; Yahoo plunged 10 7/16 , to 114 3/8, and eBay fell 5 5/8, to 30 7/8, after trading as high as 54 1/4 when it first reached the market two weeks ago.
On the New York Stock Exchange, new lows swamped new highs by 535 to 66 while declines outpaced advances by 2,136 to 1,012. Volume was heavy at 977.1 million shares.

Treasury Issues Post Loss
 (By Bloomberg News) -- The price of Treasury bonds posted the biggest loss in more than a year as expectations that Japan will bolster its ailing economy sent the dollar tumbling, lessening the appeal of Treasuries as a refuge.
"We might be beginning to see some of the flight to quality money being unwound" as the dollar falls amid signs of progress toward reform in Japan, said Ken Anderson, who helps manage $14.5 billion at Evergreen Asset Management in Purchase, N.Y. "We could be facing a major turn in the market."
The 30-year Treasury bond fell 2 3/32 , to 110 3/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.86 percent, from 4.73 percent on Tuesday.
Investors flocked to Treasury securities in recent months as a haven from turmoil in overseas markets and amid speculation the recession in many Asian economies may spread to the United States.
Yesterday, though, the dollar tumbled by the largest amount in 25 years on expectations Japan's bank rescue plan will become law and the Government will introduce a spending package to bolster the economy.

Dollar Drops 8% in Day Against Yen

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The dollar plunged 8.1 percent against the Japanese yen yesterday, its biggest one-day decline in 25 years.
But this spectacular drop in the foreign-exchange market was not touched off by a new belief among investors that Japan was on the verge of turning its troubled economy around, traders and analysts said. If that were the case, the fall of the dollar could be seen as positive, as the end of the recession in Japan would help lead the rest of Asia out of its slump. 
 Instead, the traders and analysts said, the selloff seemed to be set off by a new rush of hedge funds and other investors to get out of bets against the Japanese currency that had been very profitable until two months ago. Much of this selling reflects an unwillingness among hedge funds and other investors to take much risk -- or stick with relatively small losses for long -- in the current global financial crisis, even if they think the dollar will rebound from this plunge.
"In this risk-averse environment, people are just getting out," said Avinash Persaud, the global head of currency research at J. P. Morgan Securities in London. "All the people selling today believe the dollar should go up against the yen but they can't tolerate the loss."
Most of the selloff happened during the trading day in Europe, rather than in Tokyo, where the yen got no boost even though the Government neared approval of a plan to rescue the country's banking system and the stock market rallied. Traders and analysts said much of the selling was reinforced by talk of major selling by two hedge funds -- Long-Term Capital Management L.P., which had to be rescued last month with an infusion of $3.6 billion, and Tiger Management L.L.C., which is run by Julian Robertson, a noted hedge-fund manager.
A spokesman for Long-Term Capital denied that it was selling dollars for yen. A spokesman for Tiger Management would not comment. But it is generally known that Mr. Robertson has made major bets that the yen would continue to weaken and that Japanese bank stocks would fall. And traders said they did see Tiger selling yesterday, as Japanese bank stocks rebounded and the yen rallied.
Traders also said there was a lot of selling after the dollar fell below 130 yen, 128 yen and 127 yen, levels where many derivatives based on a dollar-yen trade forced selling. The recent cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve and the prospect of more are also weighing on the dollar.
In late trading in New York, the dollar cost 120.25 yen, down from 130.85 yen Tuesday, its steepest one-day fall since 1973, according to Bloomberg News. The dollar also fell against other currencies but not nearly as much. Against the German mark, the dollar was down 1 percent, to 1.6138 marks, from 1.63 marks Tuesday.
While the dollar is off 18.3 percent against the yen since Aug. 11 and 11.7 percent against the mark since July 9, it had held up well against other currencies, including the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar, the currencies of two of America's largest trading partners. But the trade-weighted dollar, which reflects the dollar's value adjusted for the amount of trade with each country, dropped 2.3 percent yesterday, according to the index kept by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and is down 5.4 percent since Aug. 28.
Analysts said that the aversion to taking even minimal risk in the current financial climate -- in which investors are bringing their money home and banks are less willing to make loans -- could be the catalyst that slows the world economy even more and pushes the American economy into a recession. Even though Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said yesterday that there was not a credit crunch, analysts and economists are talking about it more every day.
"There is no good reason to change our mind that the risks for the global economy remain on the downside," John Lipsky, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank, said.
In less turbulent circumstances, the fall of the dollar could be positive for the American economy and countries abroad. A weaker dollar would make American exports cheaper, helping reverse the sharp slide in this sector since the demand from Asia dried up with the economic crisis that erupted 15 months ago.
In addition, a weaker dollar could help make commodities more attractive by lowering their price to consumers in the rest of the world. Because most commodities are priced in dollars, a weaker dollar makes them less expensive in other currencies. Stronger commodity prices could help many of the world's troubled economies, like Russia, that are major exporters of commodities.
But analysts are worried that the current slide of the dollar will have little benefit if the American economy is slowing sharply and, in turn, makes things more difficult for countries abroad. In this circumstance, demand both for American exports and commodities would be likely to fall in a worldwide slowdown, even if a weaker dollar makes the prices cheaper.

The StrongPound Weakens Britain's Export Economy

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, England, Oct. 7

 BODY:
When the Bank of England's secretive Monetary Policy Committee decides on Thursday whether to lower interest rates, its members may not be thinking too much about Hugh Morgan Williams. But he will most certainly be thinking about them.
"If rates don't move down at all, then my view of the Monetary Policy Committee is unprintable, absolutely unprintable," said Mr. Morgan Williams, whose company, Canford Audio P.L.C., makes products ranging from the devices used by the police to record witnesses' testimony to radio station control consoles. 
 In the last year, he said, export earnings by his modest company in this blustery factory park in northeastern England have fallen because the strong British pound makes his products more expensive for foreign buyers. For every German pfennig added to the price of sterling, he said, his earnings in Germany shrink by $100,000 a year.
Such tribulations have created a clamor from British business for lower rates and a weaker pound. Indeed, after Spain cut its benchmark rates half a point, to 3.75 percent, on Tuesday, there was a crescendo of demands for a cut in Britain's 7.5 percent benchmark.
Even the Government -- which last year handed over responsibility for setting rates to the Bank of England -- has acknowledged that the outlook has changed from the heady days earlier this year when Britain seemed to be emulating the United States' coupling of low unemployment and surging growth.
Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, told the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Washington on Tuesday, "Slower world growth makes it inevitable that growth in Britain next year will be more moderate."
Across the land, signs of a slowdown are apparent. The Ford Motor Company's British subsidiary last month put the 4,400 workers in its Dagenham plant on a four-day week. This month, Rover Group, owned by BMW A.G., said it would temporarily halt production of its 200 and 400 models in December, after announcing 1,500 layoffs in July.
The signs are all too familiar here, in a region where bust has followed boom with metronomic predictability -- from the gradual demise of coal mining and shipbuilding, beginning in the 1970's, to the Thatcherite 1980's, which marked Britain's decline as a manufacturing nation.
The pound's rise during the last three years -- caused partly by investors' search for a hedge against the Euro, the single European currency set to be introduced next January -- has compounded other woes in a region that once looked to foreign investment as a panacea. The collapse of the global semiconductor industry contributed directly to the closing in August and September of two big plants by Siemens A.G. and Fujitsu, at a cost of 1,700 jobs.
Almost every week, in a region stretching to Scotland, foreign companies have slashed work forces. National Semiconductor said just this week that it would shed 600 jobs at Greenock in western Scotland.
The job losses have left few options for policy makers, who have relied on foreign investment to create 75,000 jobs since 1986. "Can anyone seriously suggest," said Sir George Russell, chairman of the Northern Development Company, a Government agency, "that this approach should be abandoned and something else put in its place?"
The fruits of those investments are clear. But with 9.1 percent unemployment -- almost twice the figure in the southeast -- and an economy that draws 44 percent of its output from exports, those chill winds are blowing again.
"We are much more vulnerable than most other regions," said Mr. Morgan Williams, who is also regional chairman of the Confederation of British Industries, the main employers' association. And though the pound has fallen 11 percent against the German mark in six months, any sustained fall, he said, "would take 18 to 24 months to have an impact on manufacturing."
In this region alone in recent months, 4,500 manufacturing jobs have been lost -- but 6,000 have been created in businesses like telephone call-centers, which provide fewer full-time jobs and contribute less to local suppliers.
Those companies that survive do so on leaner profits. While Siemens and Fujitsu are departing, the giant Nissan Motor auto factory near here has pledged not only to stay but also to expand. But profits will be down, reflecting the shock of the strong pound on a plant that produces 60 percent of the Nissans marketed in continental Europe.
Mr. Morgan Williams's factory is much smaller, but the pressures are similar. This year, his company expects profits to be up, meaning that his 179 employees have not been threatened with layoffs.
But expectations are lower. "We managed to increase market share in Europe," he said, "by accepting that we are not going to make a lot of money doing it."

HEADLINE: Aid to Russia for Space Station Is Defended

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Members of Congress expressed doubts today about Russia's continued role in the international space station as NASA officials defended plans to help Russia finish important components of the program and reduce future dependence on the cash-strapped nation in completing the orbiting outpost.
Daniel S. Goldin, Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said that plans to pay Russia $660 million over four years for equipment and services connected with the space station were necessary to save the multinational project and that more money would be needed to pay other added costs, most of them caused by Russia's financial problems. 
 Mr. Goldin told the House Science Committee hearing that Russia was a valuable partner in the space station program, but that the agency shared the concerns of many members of Congress that the collapse of the economy in Russia threatened its major contributions to the project.
"Our reliance on Russian capabilities has to be reduced, not by eliminating their involvement but by adding layers of protection," he said.
The bailout money, $60 million of which is needed immediately, is necessary to insure that the Russian-built service module, the crucial third component of the modular space station, is completed and ready for launching in July 1999, three months after an April 1999 date set earlier this year.
Mr. Goldin said the $60 million was not a gift to Russia and would buy the United States added storage space and research time on Russian components of the station.
Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., the Wisconsin Republican who heads the Science Committee, criticized NASA for making Russia a partner in the project and letting the troubled nation have such a crucial role. Mr. Sensenbrenner said NASA had assured Congress for years that it was taking steps to insure that Russia would not be in such a critical position in the station project that its problems would endanger completion of the station.
"The White House does not want to admit that its management of our relationship with Russia is fundamentally flawed," Mr. Sensenbrenner said, "The President promised me in writing in 1994 that we would not be dependent on the Russians to build the international space station. And now the Administration wants to stick the American taxpayer with the costs of its mistakes, just to hide the fact that it made them."
Representative Tim Roemer, an Indiana Democrat and a longtime critic of the space station, repeated his call to cancel it. Mr. Roemer noted that a recent NASA audit estimated that each month's delay in the project cost United States taxpayers at least $130 million, and predicted more delays because of Russia's money problems.
Judyth Twigg, an expert in Russian affairs at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond told the hearing that Russia's problems ran deeper than just a lack of money. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, Russia has not been conducting meaningful research and development in space and its industrial capacity has declined.
Neal F. Lane, the White House science adviser, said after the hearing that Russia was experiencing more financial problems than anyone had anticipated.
"We want to work with them on the problems," Mr. Lane said, adding that the administration was examining requests from NASA for more money in future budgets to cover increased project costs.
Mr. Goldin said partners in the $40 billion space station project, including the European Space Agency, Japan and Canada, agreed last week to stay on schedule for launching the first two parts of the station. Critics have questioned the wisdom of putting the first two elements of the project into orbit this year and then having to wait months for the much-delayed Russian service module.
Russian Space Agency officials announced today that they had started launching preparations for the first element, an unmanned maneuver and storage unit named Zarya. The module, built in Russia but paid for by the United States, is to be launched on Nov. 20 aboard a Russian rocket. It is to be followed on Dec. 3 by the launching of the space shuttle Endeavour carrying the first United States element, a connecting module called Unity.
James Oberg of Houston, an expert on the Russian space program, told the hearing that it would be a mistake to begin launching parts of the space laboratory before reevaluating options for the program, including one that excludes Russia.

HEADLINE: For a Judge, Yankee Call Just Another In a Blizzard

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

 BODY:
The Mayor was deriding him as a Democratic Party hack. His admirers were praising his judicial acumen and savoring the familiar populist tone in his latest decision.
For Justice Douglas E. McKeon of State Supreme Court in the Bronx, who ruled against the Mayor yesterday and said a referendum should be held in November on the fate of Yankee Stadium, it was another day at the center of a whirlwind, his telephone alive with calls from reporters, judges and other public officials. 
 For the last eight years, Justice McKeon has heard nearly every high-profile civil case in the borough, including most recently the lawsuits over the death of Anthony Baez during a struggle with a police officer, Francis X. Livoti, in 1994.
But the judge, who came up in the Bronx Democratic organization during the reign of Stanley Friedman, is likely to find himself in the spotlight far less often from now on. He has been transferred to a less-prestigious assignment hearing routine civil trials in the wake of a state judicial panel's decision last month to censure him for misconduct.
The panel, the Commission on Judicial Conduct, rebuked Justice McKeon for discussing a pending case with a reporter for The New York Times, appearing on television to comment on the civil case against O.J. Simpson and asking the city's Law Department to speed its hiring of a woman who once worked for him. The panel said Justice McKeon also lobbied on behalf of the woman, with whom he had a personal relationship, when the Law Department sought to dismiss her several months later.
The rebuke, and the reassignment by Chief Administrative Judge Jonathan Lippman, swiftly put an end to widespread speculation that Justice McKeon, 50, would succeed Burton B. Roberts, 76, the longtime Administrative Judge in the Bronx, who is to retire in December.
Now, after years in which he managed the largest caseload of any jurist in the state, at times juggling pretrial motions and trial work in up to 8,000 lawsuits at once, Justice McKeon will hear only trials, one at a time. "From 8,000 cases down to one," he said ruefully, during an interview in his chambers yesterday.
Moments later, Justice McKeon was informed that Mayor Giuliani had denounced his decision in the Yankee Stadium case, calling it the work of "a judge who is the product of the Democratic machine" and saying its legal merit was nonexistent.
The judge pointedly declined to defend or discuss his reasoning in the case. He said only that he had indeed been a Democratic regular -- "I'm proud of it," he added -- but that he was elected to his first judgeship after a hard-fought primary, not anointed by the party's leadership.
Justice McKeon devoted a page and a half in his ruling to an essay on Yankee Stadium's place in the hearts of New Yorkers. "The decision to abandon an athletic stadium involves emotional and economic factors," he wrote. "Ebbets Field, the Polo Grounds -- shouldn't the public have the right to say whether Yankee Stadium meets that same fate?"
It was not the first time Justice McKeon sounded like a populist in a black robe. In 1996, when city and state officials sought his help in keeping a Farberware plant on Bruckner Boulevard from shutting down, Justice McKeon, who was born in Woodlawn and lives near Pelham Parkway, made his sympathies clear, saying his priority was to preserve 700 jobs. "There are families with real problems and real concerns who are impacted by this," he said. "I am most interested in trying to restore hope to these people."
Since his censure, however, Justice McKeon's high profile has subjected him to more scrutiny. Hours after Justice McKeon released his decision, the gist of which was reported in The Daily News yesterday, he was called by an official in the Office of Court Administration, inquiring about how the newspaper had learned of his ruling in advance.
Justice McKeon said he had filed the document with the clerk Tuesday afternoon. If someone had leaked it to the newspaper, he said, he was unaware of it. "I didn't," he said, after hanging up the phone.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Iraq Talks Fail to End Stalemate on Arms

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 7

 BODY:
After 10 days of talks, Iraq and the United Nations said today that they had failed to break a two-month impasse that prevented spot searches for weapons of mass destruction.
But both sides said they intended to pursue a search for a peaceful way out that might allow Iraq to have some idea when economic sanctions might be eased and satisfy the Security Council that Baghdad has disbanded its nuclear, biological and chemical weapons systems as well as missiles to deliver them. 
 Senior diplomats here emphasized that Iraq and the United States, as well as other key members of the Security Council, were eager to avoid another confrontation like the one that nearly led the United States to bomb Iraq in February.
"Nobody wants a fight," said a senior Arab diplomat.
"The Iraqis want a way to climb down from their ban on inspections in return for a little gain, as they have done in every confrontation over the past few months," the diplomat said. "And the Americans are in no position to wage an attack on Iraq right now, given the domestic situation in this country."
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq said, "We are going to weigh the situation in its entirety in Baghdad." He led an unusually large delegation to New York that included the Foreign Minister, several senior diplomats and top scientists in the attempt to lobby for a new approach to the weapons inspection system and ease economic sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
A statement issued by Secretary General Kofi Annan's office simply said "both sides agreed that the process of dialogue would continue."
Both sides now seem to put their hopes on a so-called "comprehensive review," a compromise proposed by Mr. Annan. It would examine Iraq's compliance so far with all aspects of the elimination of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction and propose a timetable for easing the sanctions.
A senior United Nations official who insisted on anonymity said the "beauty of a 'comprehensive review' is that everybody can put everything they want in it. It's workable."
A benefit of the review, from Iraq's standpoint, is that if it can prove that it has complied sufficiently, it can expect a schedule for lifting some of the economic sanctions. Those sanctions are crippling the country's economy and impoverishing its 20 million people.
In return, the Security Council would obtain the immediate return of the United Nations Special Commission inspectors banned by Iraq from spot checks since Aug. 5.
In his talk with reporters today after meeting Mr. Annan, Mr. Aziz denied a report in The New York Times today that French tests appear to have found traces of chemicals linked to the nerve gas VX on Iraqi warheads, but are refraining from making the announcement.
Mr. Aziz said the report was politically motivated and "timed to sow confusion and suspicion" as Iraq pursued its quest to lift sanctions.

HEADLINE: Pataki's Economic Adviser Is Subpoenaed in Contract Inquiry

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Federal prosecutors have subpoenaed Gov. George E. Pataki's senior economic adviser, Charles A. Gargano, in their inquiry into the awarding of a $97 million state contract to a Long Island company owned by a major Republican political contributor, officials said yesterday.
The prosecutors are investigating whether the contracting process was influenced by a total of $100,000 that donors linked to the company, Silverite Construction, had given to the New York Republican State Committee in the days just before and after the company received the contract to repair the Queens Midtown Tunnel in May 1997. 
 Mr. Gargano's office declined to comment, but other Pataki aides said that in the past week Mr. Gargano had received the subpoena to testify before a grand jury.
The United States Attorney's office in Brooklyn has declined to discuss the inquiry.
Mr. Gargano was the chief fund-raiser for the Pataki campaign in 1994, after which Mr. Pataki appointed him to oversee the state's economic development agencies.
Since then, Mr. Gargano has said he no longer raises money for the Pataki campaign.
Silverite's owner, Angelo J. Silveri, said in an interview in March that he was a friend of Mr. Gargano and talked to him often. Mr. Silveri said he might have spoken about the tunnel project with Mr. Gargano.
Aides to Mr. Gargano have said there could have been such a discussion, but they said Mr. Gargano had no role in the project, which is supervised by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
The authority had originally determined that Silverite and its partner in the venture lacked the experience for the four-year project, one of the largest state contracts in recent years. But Silverite then altered its application and got the contract.
The authority and Mr. Silveri have both said that the donations had nothing to do with the contract. But after The New York Times disclosed the timing of the donations in March, Federal prosecutors began their investigation and the authority undertook an internal investigation.
The prosecutors have already issued subpoenas to officials at the transportation authority, Mr. Silveri and executives of the companies that lost the bidding and contended that the process was biased toward Silverite.
Mr. Silveri has been one of the biggest financial backers of the Pataki campaign and the Republican State Committee. He and donors connected to him have given roughly $335,000 to the Republican State Committee and the Pataki campaign since October 1994, according to campaign finance records.

Nikkei Soars After Japan Edges Closer to a Bank Bailout

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 7

 BODY:
The governing party edged closer today to injecting massive amounts of money into the Japanese banking system, and that prospect sent investors rushing into markets with greater hopes of an economic recovery.
The Liberal Democratic Party introduced legislation to enhance the capital base of banks that are sound, but weakly capitalized. The legislation, which would add to bank-organization bills agreed to last week, provides 10 trillion yen, or nearly $80 billion, in taxpayers' money to recapitalize the Japanese banks, with an option to provide more. 
 "We realized we should hurry, though it doesn't mean that we can pass any bill no matter what its content," said Chikara Sakaguchi, deputy head of the New Peace Party, a newly pivotal player in the opposition group. That party and another small one now seem close to pooling their votes with those of the Liberal Democrats to support the measure, insuring passage.
Encouraged by the prospects of the Liberal Democrats' greater influence, the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues soared 803.97 points today, or 6.2 percent, to 13,825.61, with the index logging its second-largest single-day gain of the year in a rally that helped push markets higher throughout Asia. At the midday break Thursday, the Nikkei was down 3.32 percent, to 13,366.74.
Just last week, the stock market tumbled to its lowest level in nearly 13 years. Over the weekend, Japan's financial leaders painted a picture of gloom for American and foreign officials in Washington. In one of his most outspoken remarks, Masaru Hayami, the governor of the Bank of Japan, told the United States Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, that Japan's top banks are short of capital and that taxpayers' money would be necessary to strengthen them.
Mr. Hayami was criticized by Japanese bankers, including Satoru Kiishi, head of the nation's banking association, who said that he was "deeply worried" that the remarks could "further erode confidence" in Japan's banking system. But many analysts say that increasing the capital of the banking system is crucial to financial stability and, ultimately, economic recovery.
"First and foremost, the policy priority is to recapitalize the banking system," James P. Fiorillo, an analyst at ING Barings in Tokyo, said. "They can worry about the pure market principle later."
Many analysts, politicians and bankers say that Mr. Hayami's remarks, along with those by the Finance Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, appear to have been cleverly staged to inspire worry among the opposition parties and force them to buckle to the demands of the Liberal Democratic Party.
Analysts also say that even if the remarks by Mr. Hayami were scripted, they may reflect a new sense of urgency among Government and central bank officials. Though the Government has warned about the severity of Japan's recession -- it now forecasts the economy will shrink by 1.8 percent in the fiscal year ending in March -- politicians bickered for months over what to do about it.
But last week, when the Nikkei average plunged below 13,000, banking officials appear to have gotten nervous because of the impact that lower stock prices have on the capital bases of Japanese banks. As of the end of March, the most recent statistics offered by the Bank of Japan, all Japanese banks technically met the capital adequacy requirements set forth by the Bank for International Settlements.
Under Bank for International Settlements guidelines, the falling stock prices did not have an impact on the Japanese banks, which are still suitably capitalized. But that is reassuring only for those who focus on accounting rules that permit the banks to value stock portfolios at cost, and in reality the declining stock market clearly meant that banks had less padding. That seems to be the concern that Mr. Hayami tried to raise in Washington, and it is also of concern to investors.
"The markets were worried about bank failures, about a massive banking crisis that would envelop all the banks and sink the market," said Craig O. Chudler, a strategist at Salomon Smith Barney in Tokyo.

Greenspan's New Worry
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said the outlook for the United States had "weakened measurably" and hinted that the Fed was ready to reduce interest rates further if the financial turmoil that began last year in Asia continued to spread. Mr. Greenspan still marveled at the continuing combination of low inflation, low unemployment and steady American growth, but he fretted about the "somewhat scary psychology" afflicting financial markets and he focused on the expectation that consumers would sharply cut back their spending because of the steep drop in stock prices. A few hours after Mr. Greenspan spoke, economists at J. P. Morgan became the first from a major institution to forecast a recession next year. C1

Hong Kong's Chief Offers No Economic Initiatives

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

 BODY:
Hong Kong's chief executive, in his second annual policy address, offered little to immediately lift the beleaguered domestic economy. The executive, Tung Chee-hwa, covered familiar ground in his address, reiterating that the government remained committed to free-market principles and to maintaining the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the United States currency. 
 Mr. Tung said that the economy, hit by regional financial turmoil and in its first recession in 13 years, will be in a hard situation "well into 1999." The government will thus run a budget deficit significantly higher than the shortfall of 21 billion Hong Kong dollars that was forecast in June, Mr. Tung said.

HEADLINE: Economic Turmoil's Latest Turns Raise the Level of Anxiety in U.S.

 BODY:
The world economic crisis spread a nervousness in America yesterday that played out in odd ways.
The mood was decidedly downbeat in the United States. The International Monetary Fund's annual meeting ended in Washington without agreement from the ministers in attendance on a plan to resolve the crisis. Page A6. And Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve's once upbeat chairman, said the likelihood of continued good times in America had "weakened measurably." Page C1. 
 His blunt statement was taken as a hint that the Fed would again lower interest rates, and the Dow Jones industrial average, perhaps in response, recovered from a 100-point fall to finish almost unchanged. But Nasdaq tumbled to 15-month low.
In the spirit of the day, the powerful dollar fell suddenly in value against the yen. That should be good news in America. A cheaper dollar makes American exports less expensive. And selling more goods abroad is a national goal. But many experts, persistent in their pessimism, offered a negative reason for the dollar's fall: they blamed panicky American investors who picked yesterday to sell off millions of dollars invested in hedge funds, worried that another fund might fail, and then convert their redeemed dollars into yen to repay Japanese banks that had loaned them the money.
Japan was strangely optimistic. Its economy is in disastrous, recessionary shape, but Americans awoke yesterday morning to learn that Japanese stock prices had gone straight up -- one of the best days in weeks. Grasping at straws, perhaps, investors in Japan had focused on good news -- the possibility of a big infusion of government money into the nation's cash-short banks. Page C4.
The banks would have money to lend again, which they have not been doing lately, at least not inside Japan. More lending at home should, in theory, revive economic activity. Encouraged by this prospect, people rushed out and bought stocks -- a striking reversal from last week.

HEADLINE: Republicans Agree to New Limits On Consumer Bankruptcy Filings

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
House and Senate Republicans agreed today on a vast overhaul of the bankruptcy system, making it more difficult for consumers to walk away from their debts and handing the banking and credit-card industries a major victory.
The agreement was reached without the consent of Congressional Democrats or the White House, and Administration officials said they would recommend that President Clinton veto the bill because of its treatment of low-income consumers. 
 Under the Republican agreement, only consumers with relatively low incomes could declare bankruptcy under the rules that wipe out many debts. But the agreement would give bankruptcy judges some discretion in determining whether debtors could file under Chapter 7, which wipes out many debts, or under Chapter 13, which requires the repayment of most debts.
Debtors who earn more than the median income -- $17,900 for single people and $51,000 for a family of four -- would be moved into Chapter 13. Also sent into Chapter 13 would be debtors who could repay 25 percent of their unsecured debts, like credit cards, or $5,000 over five years.
The negotiated bill weakens a requirement approved by the Senate that credit card companies disclose on each monthly bill how much consumers will owe and for how long if they make only the minimum payment.
It also drops a Senate provision that sets a $100,000 limit on the value of homes that could be kept by those declaring bankruptcy. This means that people could still move to certain states, like Florida and Texas, buy expensive homes, declare bankruptcy and keep the entire worth of their homes. But the compromise bill requires these people to live in the adopted state for at least two years before they can claim the homestead exemption.
With the perception that low-income Americans -- primarily women and minorities, who are among Mr. Clinton's most reliable political allies -- would be hurt most by the bill, Hillary Rodham Clinton has argued against the House version, toward which the compromise tilts.
Mrs. Clinton's concern is that credit-card companies will have a stronger claim than women and children on debtors -- usually ex-husbands -- who file for bankruptcy but who owe child support and alimony.
Republicans say alimony and child support will be the priorities in any bankruptcy liquidation under this agreement, but Democrats say the language is far from that clear.
The industry supported the bill passed by the House, which was guided by a concern that filing for bankruptcy had become too easy and that thousands of Americans were abusing the system. The Senate bill started from the premise that easily available credit was also responsible for the increase in bankruptcies and that the credit-card industry needed to be held accountable along with consumers.
The House and Senate approved vastly different bills, and negotiators have been scrambling to iron out the differences before Congress recesses this weekend. The Republican agreement was sent to the House for a vote, which could come as early as Thursday.
Republicans said today that they were happy with the compromise and that it was fair, but Democrats were furious, none more so than Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois.
Mr. Durbin had joined Republicans in seeking an overhaul of the bankruptcy system, and his name gave the process bipartisan credibility. But he said he was shut out of the final negotiations.
The Senate bill, which had passed 97 to 1, "has been devastated in a closed-door Republican conference," Mr. Durbin said.
"Republican conferees stripped out every significant consumer protection in the Senate bill," he said. "The President will not sign this bill in its present form."
Today's agreement represents a huge success for banks, credit-card companies and retailers. The lending industry spent more than $40 million to lobby for the changes, which could help it recoup an estimated $4 billion a year.
Bankruptcy filings reached a record 1.42 million over the 12 months ending on June 30, continuing a three-year trend that has persisted despite the robust economy. More than one million of these bankruptcies were filed under Chapter 7, which erases all debt except taxes, mortgages, student loans, child support, alimony and, in some cases, loans on a car needed to get to work.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who led the negotiations for the Senate, said the compromise protected honest consumers from those who abused the bankruptcy rules.
"Consumers across the country who work hard and pay their own way should not be forced to subsidize the abusive spending practices of those who exploit the Federal bankruptcy code for personal gain or convenience," Mr. Grassley said.
William P. Binzel, a lobbyist for MasterCard International, said complaints of a bill that let the industry off the hook were unfounded.
 "If a lender makes credit available to someone who can't afford to repay it, the lender loses the principal and interest," Mr. Binzel said. "The bill addresses the fundamental flaw in the law that allows a debtor who can repay a portion of his debts to use the system to walk away from those debts."

Re "More Military Waste" (letter, Oct. 4): Military spending is so far out of control that it harms the United States economy. Last year more than 40 percent of the Federal income taxes that New Yorkers paid went to the military, compared with 5.7 percent for social services, 2.5 percent for education, 2.9 percent for nutrition and 0.9 percent for the environment. 
 Total military spending removes tremendous monetary resources from local economies, increasing job downsizing and exacerbating poverty.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Needs Reform, Not Money;
The Poor Suffer

 BODY:

To the Editor:
An Oct. 5 editorial on the International Monetary Fund overlooked an important aspect of the institution: the poor people in developing countries shortchanged by its policies. Congress owes the world something more than the $18 million for the monetary fund: the demand that its policies do not result in countries' slashing their health and education budgets. 
 In addition to disrupting health and education programs, monetary fund policies have encouraged some countries to reduce or eliminate minimum-wage levels, and have also resulted in developing countries' shifting more of their agriculture to cash crops for export rather than food crops for domestic consumption.
The I.M.F. has plenty of resources to weather its crises. We have a rare opportunity to leverage meaningful reform that will help the poor. But that opportunity will be lost if we give the I.M.F. the money without demanding change.

Cityscape Chapter 11 Plan

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

 BODY:
Cityscape Financial Corporation and its Cityscape Corporation unit filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy code.
Cityscape Financial, which is based in Elmsford, N.Y., in Westchester County, said it expected confirmation of its reorganization plan by United States Bankruptcy court, although the plan was rejected by holders of its Series B preferred shares. Other holders of shares and debt approved the reorganization, the company said. 
 Cityscape is a sub-prime mortgage lender, making mortgage loans to individuals with spotty credit histories, usually at high interest rates. The filing comes after the company sold its profitable British lending unit and a loan-servicing business in the United States.
The company has put itself up for sale but has yet to find a buyer.
Cityscape Financial and its unit will continue to operate. The company plans to ask the court to set a hearing for confirmation of the reorganization plan, expected to take place in one or two months.

HEADLINE: AT HOME WITH: JON JERDE;
The Global Village Goes Pop Baroque

BYLINE: By FRANCES ANDERTON

 BODY:
"JON JERDE," Steve Wynn declared grandly, "is the Bernini of our time." He continued: "These are the cathedrals of our time. This is the future of architecture."
The "cathedrals" touted by Mr. Wynn -- a pontiff of the material world -- are Disneyland, the Mall of America and his own casino extravaganza, Bellagio, due to open next week in Las Vegas, Nev. All three are landmarks of the trend for fusing architecture, commerce and fantasy, of which Mr. Jerde is a pioneer. Mr. Jerde, a self-described "experiential architect" in Los Angeles, designed the Mall of America and (with Mr. Wynn's in-house team, Atlandia Design) Bellagio. 
 Bernini, the master of Roman Baroque, might enjoy Mr. Jerde's modern American variant, employing exaggerated color, spatial tricks and theatricality. Bellagio is one of the few casinos in Las Vegas that actually looks good in daylight. Solid, three-dimensional, dripping with landscaped patios and balustraded terraces, it is as charming and persuasive an Italian idyll as is possible in the shadow of a looming 36-story, 3,000-room hotel whose gargantuan presence no amount of scale-reducing applied moldings and friezes can diminish.
At Bellagio, Mr. Wynn wanted elegance and romance. Drawing on Lake Como in Italy and its shore-side town of Bellagio for inspiration, Mr. Jerde's firm, the Jerde Partnership International, planned and designed a painterly composition of Italianate buildings surrounding an artificial lake, so richly detailed they could actually pass for authentic. (Atlandia designed the interiors.)
With Bellagio, Mr. Wynn moves his casinos another notch toward the bourgeois respectability that began with family-friendly glitz at Treasure Island and the Mirage and that is now culminating in fine art and architecture at the polite, softly pretty, neon-free new hotel. Yet, Mr. Jerde is surprisingly low-key about the project, despite the fact that his firm spent four years on it.
At his home in Los Angeles, a rustic dwelling in the Santa Monica Mountains, he explained that Bellagio was "Steve's vision." It is small fry compared to his Big Idea: the remaking of cities with entertainment as the core.
Early on, Mr. Jerde, now 58, recognized that "the consumption addiction is what will bring people out and together," and he has made a career of feeding it with his controversial brand of pop public space.
People who love the messy urbanism of traditional cities may feel profound discomfort at this apparent repackaging of the urban realm.
"Architecture as packaging or playacting, as disengagement from reality, is a notion whose time, alas, seems to have come," Ada Louise Huxtable mourned in her 1997 book, "The Unreal America: Architecture and Illusion" (New Press).
In 1985, Mr. Jerde pushed his career forward with Horton Plaza in San Diego, which wed the conventional suburban mall -- department stores, shops and movie houses -- with the specialty shops, food courts and party ambiance of the quaint festival centers popularized by the Rouse marketplaces in the 1970's. This six-block profusion of cheap and cheerful buildings and public spaces helped turn around the fortunes of downtown San Diego. It also helped to spawn the now ubiquitous "urban entertainment center," promoted by many developers and city planners as the panacea for declining downtowns, from Times Square to Tokyo.
In 1993, Mr. Jerde (pronounced JER-dee) and a team of Los Angeles designers and architects created Citywalk, an upbeat distillation of Los Angeles's architectural and graphic landmarks into an artificial street at the Universal City studios and theme park. Herbert Muschamp, The New York Times's architecture critic, wrote at its opening soon after the Los Angeles riots that with its "zippy collage of signs and storefronts," Citywalk "is a shiny new wheel in the pop machine that boosts the city's rhythm." Its view "of harmonized diversity is a hokey Hollywood ending," he continued, adding, "Would a sad ending be better?"
Soon after, at the invitation of Mr. Wynn, the Jerde firm designed the "Fremont Street Experience," a transformation of Las Vegas's downtown main street into a covered "destination."
Two years ago, Mr. Jerde completed Canal City, a futuristic mall with hotels, shops and explosive fountains in a canyon of buildings snaking along a newly created canal in a disused industrial area in Fukuoka, Japan.
While conceptually ambitious, these projects are essentially privately owned pedestrian shopping malls. Next stop is real city-making: 24-hour, multi-block, private and public developments comprising shops, entertainment, houses, offices and, in some cases, traffic. The Jerde group has such projects under way in Japan, Taiwan and Warsaw as well as in Kansas City, Mo., and Salt Lake City. "We've got some lulus," Mr. Jerde said, with childlike excitement. "All of these middle American cities need it," he added, referring to his brand of urban renewal, "because they are the ones with the least to do."
MR. JERDE was sitting in the garden of his home, the Stone House, eagerly awaiting the return from school of his son, Oliver, the child of his fourth marriage. The house where he lives with his wife, Janice Ambry, a residential architect, is dark, eccentric, suffused with the odor of wood floors and paneling.
Built over two decades with raw stone quarried from the property, it is part Tyrolean hut, part cave, more somber than Mr. Jerde's trademark festive malls, and less high-tech -- materials are all natural, fireplaces are the only source of heat and there isn't a computer in sight. But in other ways, it reflects his work, with its textured surfaces, decorative furnishings and potpourri of objects -- Buddha's heads, a silk mandala, a Maori mask, intricate carved wood columns from Nepal, an Eames chair -- all cast in high relief by theatrical lighting.
In the garden, behind Mr. Jerde, was a stone fireplace he built -- the "spite wall" he cheerfully calls it -- to separate himself from his third wife, who, on leaving him, took up residence in a house they owned next door. Like the house, the fireplace appears to have emerged from the ground; together they embody Mr. Jerde's paradoxical architectural goal: to imbue commercial, modern environments with a sense of the organic, of having accreted over time.
Both gregarious and a loner, Mr. Jerde considers himself a creature of the globe: "I have never had any particular allegiance to any place, state, town or neighborhood," he said. He is the only child of peripatetic parents, his father a migrant oil-field worker. "Our family was called oil-field trash," he remembers. "We just blew into town and we blew out of town."
On moving to Southern California, he says, he found "a wonderful warmness and sense of belonging amongst anonymous folks" at the Long Beach Pike, an early theme park in Long Beach. He went on to train as an architect, winning a travel scholarship to Europe, where he discovered the Italian hill towns, "an architecture by nobody and everybody at the same time."
To simulate this architecture of anonymous communality, Mr. Jerde works "co-creatively" on projects with multi-disciplinary teams, layering on references to local and global, man-made and natural sources. His projects are not themed, he contends, but rather capture the "essence" of their environments.
Mr. Jerde is a trim man with a ruddy complexion, sandy hair and sharp eyes, who can be an extremely engaging advocate for his mission. But not everyone is sold.
Scott Cantrell, the architectural writer at The Kansas City Star, last year attacked Mr. Jerde's proposal for reinvigorating the Kansas City downtown with streetscapes made of existing facades and what he calls "synchronous" new buildings. "For all the lofty verbiage," Mr. Cantrell wrote, "Mr. Jerde is proposing not real architecture but a collage of facadectomies." He continued, "It's a synthetic jumble, heavy on circa-1900 nostalgia, with an overlay of shopping-mall glitz."
Where critics bemoan the commercialization and privatization of civic space that his work represents, Mr. Jerde argues that "the public sector stopped making public space a long time ago."
His admirers include the Los Angeles architect Craig Hodgetts. "Jon Jerde," Mr. Hodgetts writes in a forthcoming book, "is one of that breed of innovative architects whose contagious vision redefines an era." He adds, "His designs would, quite frankly, be unthinkable in a world without television, modems, global brands."
With movie houses anchoring retail developments, and tricks of movie-making informing his undeniably successful designs, Mr. Jerde has become impossible to ignore. The Pritzker Prize-winning architect Arata Isozaki has said that Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, and Jon Jerde's Canal City in Fukuoka, Mr. Isozaki's birthplace, are the two most important buildings created in the last two years.
Norman Klein, a cultural critic and professor at the California Institute of the Arts, believes that Mr. Jerde's work is significant because it represents "a transition from one notion of urban space to another" -- what he calls the "metropolitan suburb."
Given a disappearing tax base, these kinds of malls may be a necessity to city managers, Mr. Klein said, arguing that these cityscapes are reflections of a latter-day Baroque mercantile civilization, with corporations rather than popes and aristocrats for clients.
With his cinematic environments, Mr. Jerde's creations "provide a kind of camouflage under which large franchise companies can pretend to be local," Mr. Klein said.
So perhaps the Bernini comparison is apt, in another way. Mr. Jerde's work may just express the reality of the global economy, of a shrunken public sector, from which people may want to run. But they cannot hide.

Bank of England Lowers Rate a Quarter-Point

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
The Bank of England cut its benchmark interest rate by one-quarter of a percentage point today, reflecting concern about global financial turmoil and fears of recession among British exporters and manufacturers.
It was the bank's first such action since June 1996. The general response to the reduction, to 7.25 percent from 7.5 percent, however, was that it would make little immediate difference to Britain's economic slowdown. "What makes a difference is the signal that rates are coming down," said Holger Schmieding, an economist at Merrill Lynch & Company. "It was important in that those expectations were not disappointed." 
 The reduction had little effect on currency trading and did nothing to halt the slide of British equity markets. London's Financial Times 100 index slumped 2.7 percent today, to 4,698.90 points.
The British rate cut matched a similar quarter-point reduction by the Federal Reserve in the United States last week and coincided with indications that interest rates internationally are falling. Japan, Canada and Spain have also cut rates; Portugal and Ireland are expected to drop their higher rates to the average among the nine other nations preparing to introduce the single European currency on Jan. 1.
The Bank of England's nine-member Monetary Policy Committee -- which is responsible for setting interest rates -- said it had taken the action because the worsening international climate had damaged business and consumer confidence.
The bank's guidelines are primarily to hold down inflation to a target of 2.5 percent. Despite indications this week that British paychecks are soaring, the bank said today that inflation might fall to less than 2.5 percent, making it "appropriate" to cut interest rates.
The modest reduction disappointed analysts who had hoped for a cut of half a percentage point.
"It's obviously a move in the right direction, and it's obviously part of what's necessary," said David Mackie, an economist at J. P. Morgan. "But the Bank of England has a lot more to do. The economy is going to be very weak next year, and they'll need to react to that by cutting rates aggressively."
Today's rate cut came after projections by Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that growth would be far slower next year than the Government had first forecast -- possibly as low as 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Slight Drop Found in North America's Pollution

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Oct. 8

 BODY:
One of the first detailed studies of environmental pollution across North America shows a slight decrease in the amount of hazardous substances being released into the air, water and soil, but the improving record of American industry was largely offset by hefty increases in pollution by Canadian companies.
The report, released on Wednesday in Montreal, does not include conditions in Mexico because usable information still is not widely collected, nearly five years after implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement required such environmental monitoring. 
 The continental study was conducted by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, which includes representatives from the United States, Canada and Mexico. It estimates that in 1995 about 20,000 manufacturing plants reported that they had produced more than 2.8 billion pounds of hazardous substances, including known carcinogens, that were released directly into the air or water, or were transferred to landfills.
That amount represents a decline of 1.5 percent across North America, and is considered an important step toward slowing the spread of dangerous substances across international boundaries.
But when broken down by country, the figures give a slightly different picture of North America. Pollution produced by industries in the United States declined 2.1 percent in 1995 from 1994, while in Canada the amount of pollution released or transferred increased 3.9 percent.
Methanol, ammonia, zinc, nitric acid and toluene made up almost half of the pollutants released in 1995.
The report also indicates that while the United States has far more industrial sites, Canadian plants, on average, emit almost twice as much pollution. Lisa Nichols, a program manager for technical cooperation at the environmental commission, said it was not clear why Canadian plants produced higher average pollution.
Although the report is not expected to cause much controversy in the United States, it is likely to raise environmental concerns in Canada about the weakness of the system of provincial environmental standards.
"Essentially there has been an assumption that the Canadian performance is as strong as the U.S., but part of what makes this report so significant is the extent to which it shatters that national myth," said David S. Winfield, research director at the Canadian Institute for Environmental Law and Policy, a nonprofit organization in Toronto.
When the commission released similar results in its first report last year, local governments and industries in Canada said it was unfair to compare general statistics on pollution among unrelated industries in different states or provinces.
This year's report is also expected to focus attention on the lack of progress Mexico has made toward meeting the requirements of the environmental side agreement that President Clinton tacked onto the Nafta legislation in 1993 to get it approved by Congress.
Mexican officials said they had started collecting information on industrial pollutants last year but still had a long way to go before they compiled a list comparable to those monitored in the other two countries.
Arturo Morales, an official with the National Institute of Technology in Mexico, said some Mexican industries had objected to the inclusion of certain hazardous substances on the list of about 200 pollutants that will be tracked. Since Nafta took effect in 1994, the Mexican Government has feared that environmental regulations could be used in a way that harms domestic industries.
Peter M. Emerson, senior economist for the Environmental Defense Fund, said he was disturbed by the lack of progress in Mexico.

HEADLINE: France Seeks Talks on Iraqi Chemical Tests

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 8

 BODY:
France asked today for a meeting of technical experts at the United Nations to "clarify" the results of tests its scientists carried out on Iraqi warheads. Earlier American tests had found traces of chemicals linked to VX, a deadly nerve gas .
Iraq denied that it put VX on warheads, and called for additional tests, which were conducted over the summer in France and Switzerland. Preliminary results from these tests did not find VX. 
 But several weapons experts said that final French tests apparently found traces of VX components. Some diplomats also charged that France had withheld these results because it did not want to embarrass Iraq while it lobbied this week at the United Nations to lift sanctions imposed after it invaded Kuwait in 1990.
Although French diplomats have denied withholding results, and said they expected that the final French tests would show no traces of VX, today's statement by the French Foreign Ministry neither confirmed nor denied the reports.
Instead, a French Foreign Ministry spokesman said that French experts would make a presentation at the meeting, now scheduled for Oct. 22 and 23, that "would allow an appreciation of the scientific methods used by the three laboratories" of the United States, France and Switzerland. That language suggested France's scientific findings as well as those of the Swiss may have differed in methodology from the American procedures.
Some diplomats here said, however, this may set the scene for an inconclusive result in which no one gets blamed.
Before sanctions are lifted, Iraq's weapons of mass destruction must be destroyed, and the United Nations Special Commission, charged with overseeing that process, must be confident that Iraq cannot rebuild them. Iraq has often accused the United States of making misleading charges aimed at delaying any lifting of the punishing economic sanctions. But if tests find traces of VX, Iraqi credibility would be further weakened.
Iraq officially suspended all inspections by the special commission on Aug. 5 and refused again on Wednesday to reopen the way for a resumption of these forays. The United Nations said it would not consider any action on lifting sanctions until the inspections resumed.
Ewen Buchanan, a spokesman for the special commission, said the group had planned to call for a new meeting of experts even before the French controversy arose. "There is the matter of sampling to discuss and then the whole issue of VX," and how much of it Iraq had produced.
Iraq and the United Nations have also clashed about one of the special commission's chief inspectors, Scott Ritter, who quit in protest recently, charging that the United Nations and the United States were easing up on inspections, seeking to avoid further confrontations with Iraq. Richard Butler, who heads the commission, accused Mr. Ritter of divulging secrets about the commission's work.
Today, in a letter released to the press, Mr. Ritter's lawyers asserted he has a constitutional right to speak his mind and will continue to do so despite a threat of prosecution. The lawyers asked Mr. Butler to "retract" a statement charging Mr. Ritter with breaking the law.

HEADLINE: Lyman Ford, 89, Who Headed A Precursor to the United Way

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Lyman S. Ford, who in the 1960's was president of what became United Way of America and who pushed the old Community Chests to become a financing channel for President Lyndon B. Johnson's war on poverty, died Monday of pneumonia at a hospice in Hillsborough, N.C., United Way of America said. He was 89.
When the war on poverty began in late 1964, its leader, Sargent Shriver, rushed to get Federal funds out to about 1,000 hastily created community action agencies. In many cities Mr. Ford pressed the local Community Chests to step forward and receive the funds, arguing that since they already had legal status as public charities and networks of social service agencies under their umbrella, they could best handle the money. 
 The tactic, which infuriated some advocates for the poor who wanted organizations outside the local power structures to control the funds, set the stage for the rapid growth of Government funds to social service charities. Today, nonprofit social service agencies rely on Government money for more than half of their revenue, said Lester M. Salamon, a Johns Hopkins University economist who studies nonprofit agencies.
During the decade that Mr. Ford headed what was then called United Community Funds and Councils of America, he dealt with the mergers in many cities of competing social service charity fund drives, an efficiency move urged by corporate leaders who wanted to simplify payroll giving into a single unified drive.
"In some communities it was a very positive merger and in others it was a shotgun wedding," recalled Dick Aft, a protege of Mr. Ford who is now president of the United Way and Community Chest of Greater Cincinnati. "But everywhere Lyman worked with tact and diplomacy to make it work."
Mr. Ford also resisted efforts to expand United Way into financing the arts and other fields, sticking close to the core interest in helping children, troubled people and the elderly.
Lyman Sedgwick Ford was born in Baldwinsville, N.Y., the son of a minister. He graduated from Denison University and earned a master's degree at Ohio State University, which also gave him an honorary doctorate.
In 1931, he started out as publicity director for the Community Chest in Columbus, Ohio. He later headed the Community Chests in Evanston, Ill., and Kansas City, Mo., and then joined the Community Chest national staff in 1942. He became associate executive director in 1950 and executive director in 1960, retiring in 1970.
Mr. Ford was a trustee of Denison and served on the boards of the National Charities Information Bureau, the National Council on Social Work Education and the National Conference of Lawyers and Social Workers.
He is survived by his wife, Mary Elizabeth Nist Ford; a daughter, Barbara Ford Thelen of Denver; a son, James Lyman Ford of Mequon, Wis.; seven grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: U.S. Said to Face Brunt of Economic Crisis

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank wound up their annual meetings today saying that the United States will bear most of the burden of helping Asia and the rest of the developing world get out of a recession.
America's relatively strong economy will draw in the exports of crisis-stricken countries at the same time that foreign demand for American goods is weakened. As a result, the United States balance of payments deficit will soar, with I.M.F. forecasts showing the American deficit rising sharply from $155 billion in 1997 to $236 billion this year and $290 billion in 1999. 
 One implication of that rising deficit is that a steady increase in competitively priced imports can, over time, lead to an erosion of American market share and jobs.
By contrast, the 15 member countries of the European Union and Japan will continue running substantial payment surpluses with exports far in excess of imports.
On Wednesday, Japan's Finance Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, struck a note of quiet desperation when he described his country's failure to recover economically, saying at the annual meeting that, "despite steady implementation of the latest economic policy package, the largest ever, our economic situation is still extremely severe."
Japan seems set to remain in deep recession this year with only a minute recovery next year. Its already massive payments surplus of $94 billion last year is expected to reach $131 billion this year and $135 billion next.
In his final address and press conference today, Michel Camdessus, managing director of the I.M.F., said the world was making progress toward resolving the crisis that has gripped much of the global economy since the collapse of some of Asia's leading economies last year.
"Nothing could have happened more than has happened," he said. "We are dealing with a monumental task."
The 182 countries represented at the meetings endorsed his proposals for tackling five "major shortcomings" in the international financial system, he said.
These included a lack of transparency about economic details throughout the world that impeded sound policy making; weak financial systems; unrestricted and volatile flows of capital around the globe; a reluctance to make private banks and other financial institutions pay part of the costs of the crisis; and better regulation of world financial markets.
He said he is now "confident" agreement will be reached between the Clinton Administration and Congress to give the I.M.F. about $18 billion in new funds as part of a $90 billion effort by several countries to recapitalize the fund.
The meeting also endorsed President Clinton's call for a new standby loan fund linked to the I.M.F. that would bolster the financial defenses of some countries before they came under attack from investors.
Agreement is also close, he said, on new steps to shore up Brazil's shaky economy that would include an announcement by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso later this month of new austerity measures in return for a new a package of loans from the fund and other donors. Finally, while the world economy was still sailing "stormy, uncharted waters," Mr. Camdessus said the recent cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, and Europe's low interest rates, showed that central bankers are striving to preserve economic growth. "Growth must be sustained. Inflation is not a danger," Mr. Camdessus said. Early today, the Bank of England cut a key interest rate by a quarter point.
Nevertheless, while this year's annual meeting undoubtedly produced a plethora of ideas on mending the world's damaged monetary system and a positive avalanche of pledges to do so, it has not yet resulted in any concrete action.
The leaders of both institutions put the best possible face on the outcome despite the lack of specific action and the vagueness of many of the pledges made by their governments.
"We have undoubtedly moved a long way forward in identifying the steps needed to establish a more durable global economic system and for addressing the crisis," Mr. Camdessus said.
With millions of people being pushed back into abject poverty throughout the developing world by the economic downturn, the World Bank President, James D. Wolfensohn, expressed satisfaction that governments now recognized that more must be done to protect people from the social costs of the crisis.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Clear Channel toBuy Jacor For $2.8 Billion in Stock

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

 BODY:
Clear Channel Communications agreed yesterday to pay $2.8 billion in stock for Jacor Communications, the broadcaster that brings Rush Limbaugh, Dr. Laura Schlessinger and other radio personalities to the nation.
The combined company would rank third in radio revenues, behind CBS and the Chancellor Broadcasting Company, and second in number of stations. 
 Jacor's chairman is Sam Zell, a personality in his own right whose Zell/Chilmark Fund holds 26 percent of the company's shares. Analysts and others on Wall Street said that he had chosen Clear Channel in part because its founder and chief executive, L. Lowry Mays, had agreed to keep Jacor management and because he had confidence in Clear Channel and its stock.
"When someone as savvy as Zell looks at someone as savvy as Lowry Mays, I think he takes a lot of comfort from that," said Thomas A. Vanderslice, a managing director in investment banking for the CIBC Oppenheimer Corporation.
Mr. Mays said in an interview that the deal, which also includes the assumption of $1.5 billion in Jacor's debt, would pay off through growth rather than cutbacks and economies. Having clusters of radio stations in many markets where he also has billboards, and programs to send everywhere, will help in attracting advertisers, he said.
Jacor has about 40 percent of its radio station revenues in cities where Clear Channel has forests of billboards. But the Clear Channel radio stations are mostly in different markets, Mr. Mays said, making it easy to win Government approval for the deal without having to sell many stations off.
The combined company would have 2 or more radio stations in 6 of the nation's 12 largest markets, but not New York City. There, Clear Channel, the nation's largest billboard company, has more than 1,000 billboards. In a rapidly consolidating business, analysts praised the Jacor acquisition as complementary and fairly priced. "It's a very good fit," said Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, confirming the company's prediction that 1999's earnings per share would benefit.
Analysts also agreed, however, that Jacor would have fetched more before stock market reversals that have hit media companies especially hard. In another rough day for the markets, Clear Channel shares fell 37.5 cents, to $36.625, while Jacor rose 43.75 cents, to $40.5625. Standard & Poor's said it was considering downgrading Clear Chanel's debt and upgrading Jacor's.
Since Congress eased the limits on radio station ownership, buyers have built large companies able to offer advertisers the sort of broad coverage, within a market or across the nation, that newspapers and television have boasted.
Analysts said that CBS was the most serious rival Jacor bidder, with Chancellor, controlled by the Hicks, Muse leveraged buyout firm, also having shown an interest.
Clear Channel, based in San Antonio, has 625 radio stations, 19 television stations and about 220,000 billboards in 25 countries. Mr. Mays founded the company with Red McCombs, a flamboyant San Antonio car dealer who now owns the Minnesota Vikings, 26 years ago when they bought a local FM station for $130,000.
Mr. Mays is about as modest in discussing his company's performance since then as Mr. Limbaugh is in discussing the virtues of his political doctrines. "A stellar growth performance history," Mr. Mays said.
Based in Covington, Ky., Jacor, including pending acquisitions, has 230 radio stations and one television station, as well as Premiere Radio Networks, which syndicates radio shows. Mr. Zell, said to be out of the country, could not be reached for comment.

HEADLINE: Republicans List Terms for I.M.F. Payout

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
Republican Congressional leaders presented the Clinton Administration today with a list of lending conditions that they want imposed on the International Monetary Fund in order for Congress to approve $18 billion in new money for the I.M.F.
Administration and Congressional officials said that they were hopeful that they could soon agree on compromise legislation to provide the money to the I.M.F. to refill reserve accounts depleted by the fund's attempts to bail out the economies of Russia and three Asian nations. 
 But they said they were still without a timetable for an agreement. Citing the turmoil in international financial markets, the White House has insisted that the legislation be approved and sent to the President before Congress adjourns for the year, which could happen this weekend.
While the list of conditions being sought by the Republicans was not made public, Congressional officials said that it included a demand that the I.M.F. open its books for public scrutiny, that it end the practice of lending to foreign governments at below-market interest rates, and that it shorten the lending period on most loans.
The list was presented to Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin during a meeting today on Capitol Hill with the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, and the House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia.
After the meeting, Mr. Rubin told reporters that it had gone well. "It was a good meeting," he said. "It was very constructive and we're just going to keep working forward."
Administration officials say the White House is reluctant to accept any legislation that imposes onerous lending conditions on the I.M.F., especially at a time when the fund needs flexibility to avert a global financial meltdown.
The Senate has already approved the full $18 billion in new fund financing requested by the Clinton Administration. But the House has balked at the request and has so far approved only $3.4 billion.
The talks this week are aimed at satisfying House Republican leaders, who are being pressed by conservatives within their party who have questioned whether the economic crisis that has swept the third world is evidence that the monetary fund has outlived its usefulness.
"I have been as critical about the I.M.F. as many, but given the crisis we have around the world, the U.S. needs to provide leadership," said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, a key Republican in the talks.
He said that given the chaos in international financial markets, the United States was left with no option but to provide the money to the fund. "The only real avenue is the I.M.F.," he said.
Congressional officials say the House leadership has shown a new willingness to resolve the monetary fund issue -- and to end a variety of other financing disputes with the White House -- in hopes of preventing a Government shutdown that might distract public attention away from the impeachment investigation of President Clinton.
Moreover, if the United States fails to provide the money other nations might reduce their contributions, leaving the fund short of the $90 billion its says is needed to deal with the current financial world crisis.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Yield for 30-Year Rises to 4.99% In a Mixed Session for Treasuries

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities ended sharply mixed yesterday, with selling by hedge funds battering the long end of the market even as shorter maturities were bolstered by weakness in equities.
Several analysts said shorter maturities were up on expectations of slower growth and further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Some others said a widely publicized decision by Greg Smith, a Prudential Securities strategist, to raise cash allocations in investment portfolios might have helped the shorter-bill sector. 
 The 30-year bond fell 2 3/32 , more than two points for a second consecutive day, to a price of 107 23/32 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 4.99 percent, from 4.86 percent on Wednesday. Bills and shorter-term notes also gained, with the bond-equivalent yield on a one-year bill down to 3.92 percent. Among other long-term issues, the yield on the 10-year note rose to 4.57 percent, from 4.39 percent the previous day.
Dennis C. Hynes, chief market strategist at R. W. Pressprich & Company, said that yesterday's trade in bonds was certainly tied to hedge funds liquidating speculative investments in Japanese yen, as the yen gained on the dollar.
"The unwinding by hedge funds has now overtaken the flight-to-quality bid in Treasuries," Mr. Hynes said. "The need to unwind yen trades is the most dominant thing in the market right now."
He said that because the yen had rallied, it put severe pressure on those investors who had bet on a weaker yen, a higher dollar and a stronger Treasury market. "When the yen rallied, the short yen positions became unprofitable and that forced the unwinding of the trade, which now goes in reverse, starting with the sale of Treasuries," he said.

HEADLINE: G.E. Profit Rise Meets Estimates

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: FAIRFIELD, Conn., Oct. 8

 BODY:
The General Electric Company said today that its third-quarter profit rose 13 percent, matching expectations, even as delayed shipments of power-generating equipment were partly responsible for disappointing sales growth.
Net income at G.E., owner of the world's largest nonbank finance company and the top-rated NBC television network, rose to $2.28 billion, or 69 cents a diluted share, from $2.01 billion, or 60 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 9.8 percent, to $24.14 billion from $21.99 billion, less than the 15 to 20 percent increase that G.E. predicted in early September. 
 Shipments of some turbines to Indonesia were pushed into the fourth quarter, raising concern that G.E. is not immune to global economic turmoil, analysts said. While several multinational companies like Coca-Cola and Gillette have warned that profits will slump because of the Asian economic crisis, G.E. gets only a small part of its revenue and profit from that region.
G.E., the most valuable United States company, fell $3.4375 a share, to $71.5625, as 15.6 million of its shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Sales Gains At Retailers In September

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 8

 BODY:
The nation's discount retailers today reported strong September sales gains at stores open at least a year, while department stores and others, hit by unseasonably warm weather early in the month and Hurricane Georges, had only slim gains.
"Discounters performed exceedingly well and department stores exceedingly weak," said Michael Niemira, an economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. in New York. 
 Sales in stores open at least a year, known as same-store sales, rose 4.5 percent in September compared with the month a year earlier, according to the Goldman, Sachs retail composite index.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailer, tipped off the month's trend by reporting a 9.5 percent gain. Sales at the discount store Dollar General rose 8 percent. Family Dollar Stores reported a 12.3 percent increase and Target, a unit of the Dayton Hudson Corporation, posted a 6.1 percent gain.
The Kmart Corporation, the largest discounter after Wal-Mart, said same-store sales rose 5.6 percent.
Among department stores Sears, Roebuck & Company, the No. 2 United States retailer, said domestic same-store sales fell 1.7 percent in September and J. C. Penney Company, the No. 4 retailer, said sales fell 6.6 percent. Federated Department Stores Inc., which owns Bloomingdale's and Macy's, said sales fell seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Luxury retailers also posted sales declines. Neiman Marcus Group, a unit of Harcourt General Inc., for example, said sales fell 7.1 percent.
"There's a clear shift in consumer spending from the upper scale to the discounters," said Kurt Barnard, retail consultant and president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report, in Upper Montclair, N.J.
The bright spot among department stores was the May Department Stores Company, which operates Lord & Taylor, Filene's and Hecht's. Its sales rose 4.3 percent.
Clothing sales met or surpassed expectations at several specialty apparel retailers. Sales at Ann Taylor Stores, which revamped its women's career clothing line after it lost customers to unpopular fashions last year, rose 8.5 percent, which was better than expected. Sales at Gap Inc., which has heavily advertised its jeans and slacks, rose 14 percent. The retailer also benefited from strong sales at its Old Navy casual-clothing chain, analysts said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES;
Dollar Hits111.73 Yen Before Staging Comeback

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Foreign-exchange traders battered the dollar into what looked like a second consecutive free fall yesterday before the currency abruptly reversed course, ending only slightly lower against the Japanese yen in extraordinarily volatile dealings.
On Wednesday, the dollar registered its biggest one-day drop against the yen in a quarter century, losing more than 8 percent of its value. 
 There was little movement between the currencies during overnight trading in Tokyo, but when European markets opened the dollar again came under attack, plunging as much as 7 percent, to a low of 111.73 yen, a level last seen in early June 1997.
Selling slowed and then turned during the afternoon in New York, and by late in the day the dollar was quoted at 119.05 yen, down from 120.25 yen late Wednesday.
"This has been about the craziest day my colleagues and I have ever seen," said Jeremy Fand, senior foreign exchange strategist at BankBoston. "But in spite of this we are optimistic, because we seem to have gotten rid of the speculative excess that was in the system."
As on Wednesday, traders said much of the selling was done by large speculative hedge funds unwinding positions they had taken based on a bet that the yen would remain weak. And the impact of those sales was magnified because trading volume was quite light yesterday, Mr. Fand and others said.
"The market has been very quiet," said Michael Rosenberg, manager of currency and international fixed-income research at Merrill Lynch & Company. "There is no liquidity in this market, and no appetite for risk in this sort of a chaotic situation."
Traders said the dollar's slide slowed and then reversed after the trading desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began calling currency dealers to ask about conditions in the market.
The New York Fed, which has operational control of the Government's day-to-day dealings in the foreign exchange market, makes such calls when conditions appear unsettled. But some traders interpreted the inquiries as a possible sign that the Fed might be preparing to buy dollars to send a message that the United States wants the dollar to stabilize.
In addition, Mr. Fand said traders were encouraged by news bulletins suggesting that a rescue package for Brazil was in the process of being assembled, and that Congress, after much delay, may be close to approving an $18 billion increase in funds for the International Monetary Fund.
Perhaps most important, there was a recognition that the dollar had fallen much too steeply and much too fast against the yen, especially considering recent predictions that the dollar could reach 160 yen by the end of the year.
"Enough is enough," Mr. Fand said. "What had happened was an obscene level of a correction for a two-day period. There are clearly buyers of dollars with the dollar between 110 yen and 115 yen."
Mr. Rosenberg seemed to share the view that the dollar's wild gyrations against the yen were effectively over. Over the coming weeks and months, he said he expected the dollar to move higher against the yen.
"We need to build a base where the dollar trades between 115 yen and 125 yen," he said. "I think that will be the range for the next few weeks. After that, we think the dollar will gradually appreciate against the yen," perhaps to as high as 170.
News that a financial rescue package for Brazil was being assembled also helped push the dollar up against the German mark and other major currencies.
Late yesterday, the dollar was trading at 1.6375 German marks, up from 1.6138 marks on Wednesday.
"Without any doubt, this last week was a turning point for financial markets," Mr. Fand said.
"The message has been conveyed that a line has been drawn in the sand, and that emerging markets will not be allowed to bleed any more. If Brazil is going to be saved and the I.M.F. is going to get its funding, the world has to have some renewed confidence that this is the end of the financial crisis."

HEADLINE: Proposed Cigarette Deal Doesn't Force Rise in Price

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER 

 BODY:
Under a national settlement being negotiated by the tobacco industry, cigarette makers would not be required to pass along to consumers the cost of the deal, a price increase that many anti-smoking advocates have said is critical to reducing under-age tobacco use.
As part of Federal legislation that failed earlier this year, cigarette producers would have been required to pass along the cost -- about $1.10 a package -- to consumers. Though there is disagreement over the precise impact of price increases on teen-age cigarette use, many public health experts have held that such increases are a major weapon in reducing smoking by young people. 
 But the $198 billion national settlement being negotiated by lawyers for the industry and eight states would allow cigarette makers to absorb part or all of its costs, several lawyers briefed on the proposal said.
That means that producers may choose for competitive reasons to hold down cigarette prices or decide the pace of how they will pass along the settlement's cost. The plan would cost producers 35 to 40 cents a pack over the next five years, industry officials and an analyst estimated.
"I think they will increase cigarette prices slowly to get consumers used to the higher price increases," said Bonnie Zoller, a tobacco industry analyst with the Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation. "A sharp increase in prices could cause a drop in consumption."
Opponents of smoking and some economists have argued that a sharp, significant increase in cigarette prices could provide the most effective way to reduce teen-age smoking.
In May, for example, Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, testified before Congress that the Clinton Administration believed that the "best way to combat youth smoking is to raise the price."
Mr. Summers testified that studies showed that every 10 percent increase in cigarette prices could produce up to a 7 percent decrease in the number of children who smoked. But other economists have called those projections overly optimistic.
The structure of the settlement proposal, which has not been completed, is fundamentally different than the failed Federal tobacco legislation because it leaves the timing of any cigarette price increases up to the producers.
Regulators briefed on the current talks said they did not have the legal authority to require cigarette makers to pass along a settlement's cost because the negotiators are resolving lawsuits, not passing legislation.
Since last year, tobacco companies have reached settlements with four states -- Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas -- that have brought lawsuits against the industry to recover smoking-related health costs, agreeing to pay those states some $40 billion over the next 25 years.
To reflect the cost of those settlements, producers have announced increases in the wholesale price of cigarettes amounting to 25 cents a pack. But the national average retail price of a pack has remained at about $2.
Ms. Zoller, the analyst, said that the prices being paid by smokers had not increased because cigarette makers were deeply discounting prices on the wholesale level and absorbing settlement costs as they battled for market share.
She said that she expected the pattern of discounting to continue for a time if a new national settlement is reached. She said she believed that the Philip Morris Companies, the nation's largest cigarette maker, could absorb settlement costs longer than other producers because it was financially the strongest.
Ms. Zoller said she believed that if the settlement's cost were passed along to consumers, cigarette use among smokers of all ages would fall 15 percent.
Scott Williams, a spokesman for the tobacco industry, declined to comment on the settlement talks.
Lawyers involved in the talks said that a final plan is not likely to emerge for at least 10 days and may be delayed further. The new proposal is intended to cover the 46 states that either had lawsuits pending against the industry or had not sued it.
Along with Philip Morris, the tobacco companies involved are the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, a unit of the R.J.R. Nabisco Holdings Corporation; Brown & Williamson Tobacco, a subsidiary of B.A.T. Industries; Lorillard Tobacco, a subsidiary of the Loews Corporation, and the smokeless tobacco producer U.S. Tobacco, a subsidiary of UST Inc.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Politicians Seek Wider Role In European Central Bank

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 8

 BODY:
As financial gloom grew across Europe today, political leaders were running into deepening conflicts with European central banks over the best way to respond.
With less than three months before 11 countries adopt the euro as a new European currency, the bankers who govern the new European Central Bank are holding to a conservative policy designed to establish the euro's credibility. But political leaders, particularly in Germany and France, have begun bluntly attacking those policies and are pushing for easier money as a way to spur economic growth and jobs. 
 The dispute has intensified in the last few days after the Social Democratic Party's victory in German elections on Sept. 27. While the United States Federal Reserve has begun to cut rates, many of Europe's politically independent bankers have been reluctant to follow suit, and politicians are beginning to complain.
"I find it wrong that the Bundesbank conducts its monetary policy as if these problematic developments in global finance weren't there," said Oskar Lafontaine, the chairman of the Social Democratic Party who is expected to be named Finance Minister in the new German Government. "It's not a holy institution with a doctrine of papal infallibility."
Most central bankers are refusing to bend. European currencies have surged against the dollar in recent days after Hans Tietmeyer, the president of Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, made it clear on Wednesday that he would not cut rates in the near future.
But the pressure is increasing. European stock markets plunged today, largely on expectations that stronger European currencies hurt exports and slow growth. In Germany, Europe's biggest economy and heaviest exporter, the benchmark DAX index plunged 4.98 percent.
In another sign of pressure, the Bank of England announced today that it would cut a key short-term interest rate by a quarter-point, to 7.25 percent. For Britain, which has decided not to join the European currency union and follows a separate monetary policy, it was the first rate cut since June 1996.
In continental Europe, leaders are battling over fundamental economic policy. With the Social Democrats' victory, Europe's biggest countries are or will soon be controlled by center-left governments. A growing number of those governments now favor an easier monetary policy and would like to exert more political control over the European Central Bank. Mr. Lafontaine has been an adamant critic of hawkish monetary policies. Representing the Social Democrats' orthodox left wing, he has argued for years that such policies are the biggest culprits behind the nation's high unemployment.
French political leaders share those views. the Socialist Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, has long advocated lower interest rates to spur job creation. He has also bristled at the political independence given to the Bank of France and the new European Central Bank, calling for stronger political controls.
All of that runs counter to core principles of the European Central Bank and of individual national banks. Because the euro will have its debut in January, the central banks of each member country have already locked their policies together into what amounts to a single framework.
By law, the new European Central Bank is allowed only to focus on the question of price stability and inflation. Government leaders are not allowed to interfere or to influence any of its decisions.
"What we are seeing is indeed very significant," said Thomas Mayer, an economist at Goldman, Sachs in Frankfurt. "We aren't used to having a government trying to influence monetary policy. In the strategy of the new German Government, the role of monetary policy is obviously to spur economic growth and the creation of jobs. That is obviously an approach that the central bankers of the European Central Bank do not share."
Many economists argue that Europe is already following an expansionary monetary policy and does not need to change course.
Germany's basic short-term rate is 3.3 percent, and the average rate across the 11 countries in the "euro zone" is 3.7 percent -- significantly lower than in the United States, where rates are more than 5 percent.
Indeed, Mr. Tietmeyer and many private sector economists argue that Europe is already loosening monetary policy as it prepares for the euro. That is because countries with traditionally high interest rates, like Spain and Italy, have to align their rates with those of Germany and France before the debut of the euro.
Until recently, most economists assumed that Germany would help close the gap by nudging its rates upward. Instead, the central bankers appear determined to keep their rates low and let the other countries drop down to their level.
Despite the global financial turbulence, Dresdner Bank and many other institutions still predict that European economic growth will remain well above 2 percent next year and will exceed that of the United States. That is because the United States is likely to be more affected by a slowdown in Latin America.
"The central bankers are confident that monetary policy in euroland is expansionary at the moment and will remain expansionary," said Stefan Bergheim, an economist at Merrill Lynch in Frankfurt. "We don't need to be lectured by central bankers who are running interest rates that are 20 percent higher than ours."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Fears of a Spreading Recession Send Markets Tumbling

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Sparing only a couple of major markets, stock prices tumbled around the world yesterday in emotional and often panicky trading, reflecting investor fear that recession might be spreading from the Far East to Europe and might eventually grip the United States. But then Wall Street suddenly reversed course and produced a late-session comeback in the third-heaviest trading session on record.
Soon after the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks slumped 20 percent from its mid-July peak -- the amount that has come to define a bear market -- it bounced back to halve its loss, which amounted to a moderate 1.16 percent. The rally also lifted the index back above the low it set in the Aug. 31 market wipeout. 
The recovery of the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average was also strong, ending with a decline of just 9.78 points after having fallen 274.20 at midday. Nasdaq stocks, battered for much of the year, also improved during the afternoon, but the chief index still lost another 2.97 percent for the day to make a 16-month low. The Nasdaq has fallen 12 percent in the last four trading days.
Stocks had dropped sharply in Japan and Europe, with Tokyo's Nikkei down 5.8 percent, erasing Wednesday's advance. Major indexes fell 4.98 percent in Germany, 4.45 percent in France and 2.69 percent in Britain. Brazil's exchange, which finished marginally higher, and Hong Kong's, which rose 2.5 percent, were the only markets that escaped damage. "Today you can cut the fear with a knife," said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist for A. G. Edwards in St. Louis. Some of the selling, he added, was with little consideration of price.
Some of the depressed mood this morning was attributed to Abby Joseph Cohen, the widely followed Goldman, Sachs strategist, who trimmed her profit estimates for S.& P. companies by $1.50, to $49, for this year and by $2.50, to $52.50, for 1999.
Nonetheless, she said her lowered expectations would have "little direct impact" on stock returns because of the lowered profits would be offset by lower interest rates and lower inflation.
At Prudential Securities, Greg Smith, its chief investment strategist, recommended that investors quadruple cash allotments to 20 percent of their portfolios, while Ralph Acampora, the firm's technical analyst, sharply reduced his target ranges for the S.& P. and the Dow.
About 2 P.M., however, investors seemed to decide that emotional selling had made many stocks seem like bargains.
"We could be at a pretty important turning point," suggested Richard T. McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch. He said it was typical of the final stages of a downturn for dispirited investors to try to wring some profit from shrinking portfolios by selling stocks that had resisted the decline, such as drug companies.
After what Mr. McCabe called this final "capitulation," the market tends to come back, as seemed to happen during the afternoon. Merck traded as low as 121 5/8 before rallying to close at 127, up 1 3/16 .
Financial companies had remarkably sharp reversals, with J. P. Morgan up 5 3/8, to 79 7/8, after trading as low as 72 1/8; Merrill Lynch up 4 3/4 at 42 1/2, after being as low as 35 3/4, and Bankers Trust recovering from 45 to finish at 54 1/2, up 5 5/16 .
Citigroup, the newly minted product of the Citibank-Travelers merger, finished at 32 1/2, up 3/4, after trading at 28 1/2. "We need a big, hard down day to sort of clear the selling pressure," Richard Cripps, chief strategist at Legg Mason in Baltimore, said during the morning shortly after canceling a business trip in light of further declines overseas.
In the end, 13 of the 30 Dow industrials managed gains yesterday, with Kodak up 2 7/16 , to 80 1/16 , right behind J. P. Morgan. The biggest Dow loser -- without which the index would have risen -- was General Electric, down 3 7/16 , to 71 9/16 , as third-quarter sales were lower than expected.
Among Nasdaq stocks, Dell Computer swung wildly before losing 2 1/8, to 48 7/16 ; Microsoft shed 2 15/16 , to 91 3/16 , and Yahoo dropped 9 9/16 , to 104 13/16 .
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 1.11 billion shares, with 2,651 stocks closing lower and 615 higher. A total of 933 issues made new lows for the year compared with only 45 new highs.
The S.& P. index drop was 11.24, to 959.44, barely above the 957.28 Aug. 31 low. At its worst yesterday, however, the index stood at 923.32, 22.2 percent below its high on July 17.

HEADLINE: THE TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: THE PARTIES;
In Area Around New York, Only 2 Break Party Ranks

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
After much wringing of hands, reading of the Constitution and consulting of priests and pollsters, almost every member of the House of Representatives from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut did what party leaders asked today on the vote to begin an impeachment inquiry.
Only 2 of the 50 members from the three states broke party ranks in voting on the Republican-sponsored measure, which passed by a vote of 258 to 176. Both were Democrats: Carolyn McCarthy of Long Island and Jim Maloney of Connecticut. 
 Ms. McCarthy, a former Republican who joined the Democratic Party just months before winning her seat in 1996, called her vote the hardest she had taken in Congress. She said she agreed with Democratic leaders in wanting some limits set on the inquiry, but felt that an open-ended investigation was better than none.
"The only way we are going to bring this whole investigation to a close and to get the truth is to move the process forward," she said in a statement.
Mr. Maloney is facing one of the toughest re-election fights of any House member, against a Republican who had vowed to attack him if he opposed the inquiry.
In explaining his vote, Mr. Maloney, a first-term Congressman, said, "This is a very serious matter that has to be dealt with, and this is a way to move the process along so we can get back to the issues that affect the people."
Several Democratic fence straddlers, including Representatives Louise M. Slaughter of New York and Bill Pascrell Jr. and Robert E. Andrews, both of New Jersey, made up their minds late Wednesday after what they said was much anguish and more than a little pressure from the House Democratic leadership.
"Hamilton's words struck me," said Mr. Pascrell, before loosely paraphrasing Alexander Hamilton, a founder of the City of Paterson, which he represents. "If we have an inquiry and it's all over the place, the country will suffer and we will only divide the nation more and more."
Most Democrats echoed the position of President Clinton and other House Democratic leaders in saying that the nation wanted Congress to focus less on investigating the President and more on important issues like crowded schools and the global economic crisis.
"We need to get back to work on the issues affecting the people," Mr. Andrews said.
Several Democrats from the region had already made their opposition to the inquiry known before today's vote, including Representatives Charles E. Schumer, Nita M. Lowey and Charles B. Rangel, all of New York. But that did not stop them from delivering fiery floor speeches attacking the Republican measure.
"We have become a modern-day kangaroo court," said Representative Gregory W. Meeks of Queens.
Among the only Republicans from the region to speak in support of the measure was Representative Vito J. Fossella Jr. of Staten Island. Mr. Fossella, a first-term Congressman, said he hoped future generations would view today's vote as "our finest hour, upholding what our founding fathers and every generation since has looked for and yearned for: the notion of freedom, the notion of liberty, the notion of the rule of law."

HEADLINE: $23 Million Expansion Planned for Staten Island Freight Center

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki announced a $23 million expansion project yesterday for the Howland Hook Marine Terminal, a 187-acre Staten Island freight-handling complex that was reopened two years ago by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
The expansion comes amid intense competition between New York and other East Coast ports for commercial shipping. It will create the first rail link to the terminal, which lies along the Arthur Kill on the northwest part of Staten Island across from Elizabeth, N.J. 
 Officials said the rail link, budgeted at $15 million, would sharply increase access to the Howland Hook complex, connecting it to freight trains running through the heavily industrialized chemical manufacturing area of northern New Jersey and beyond.
The rail link, stretching from the complex across Union County, N.J., to a Conrail freight line, would provide the first freight train access to New York City from New Jersey. It appeared to be jeopardized in recent months when the Manager of Union County, Michael J. Lapolla, recommended that his Board of Freeholders withdraw its support of the project, saying its economic benefits would flow almost entirely to New York.
That provoked angry protests from officials in New York City, which has already rebuilt track and refurbished a bridge for the link.
And yesterday, Charles Millard, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, said that any objections in Union County had been overridden by the board of the Port Authority. The rights of way for the new track are owned by the State of New Jersey and the Port Authority is granted jurisdiction over New York harbor and its waterfront areas by the Governors of New York and New Jersey.
In addition to the rail link, the terminal will get more than 15,000 new freight-handling containers and a refurbished crane. Officials said the project would be completed by late 2000.
"A little more than two years ago, Howland Hook Marine Terminal was literally dead in the water," said Governor Pataki at a news conference at the terminal, which had been abandoned in 1986 when its only shipping tenant, U.S. Lines, went out of business. The terminal's closing contributed to a steady erosion of shipping business in the New York harbor for the next decade.
Since 1996, when Howland Hook was reopened and began taking on a growing share of port business, the tonnage of goods shipped through the harbor has gradually increased. Port Authority records show that it is now holding steady or gaining ground against other major East Coast ports in Baltimore; Halifax, Nova Scotia; Norfolk, Va., and elsewhere.
"Now we are seeing the fruits of our work," Mr. Pataki said. The expansion project announced yesterday comes in the aftermath of $50 million in investments by the Port Authority to modernize and reopen the Howland Hook terminal.
Robert E. Boyle, executive director of the Port Authority, said the amount of cargo handled in New York harbor would continue to grow rapidly. He estimated that cargo volumes handled at Howland Hook and the two other major container terminals operated by the Port Authority -- the huge Port Newark-Elizabeth complex in New Jersey and the Red Hook Terminal in Brooklyn -- would double in the next 15 years.
But while officials said yesterday that Howland Hook's expansion would contribute considerably to the growth of the Port of New York and New Jersey, other major projects remain.
The largest involve extensive dredging of both the Arthur Kill and the Kill Van Kull, a larger channel that ships must navigate to get to the port's container terminals in Staten Island and New Jersey. Both channels are now 40 feet deep, and must be dredged to at least 45 feet to accommodate a new generation of cargo ships that are expected to dominate the shipping business.
A $670 million project to dredge the Kill Van Kull, with $231 million of the costs paid by the Port Authority, is to begin this fall. Federal financing for the project, which is to cover all costs not paid by the Port Authority, was authorized by Congress this year but must be reauthorized each year if the work is to be completed by its projected deadline in 2003.
Dredging of the Arthur Kill has been delayed, if not prevented, because Congress this year voted down $165 million in Federal financing for that project even though the Port Authority has authorized its contribution of an additional $88.7 million. Port Authority officials said yesterday that they expected a new request for the Federal funds to be made in Congress next year.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place -- Growling, butfor How Long?;
Assessing the Fallout From a Season of Lower Earnings

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Is it time for investors to sober up?
As the reporting season for corporate earnings begins, Wall Street analysts seem to agree that profits will decline a few percentage points in the third quarter, ending an almost seven-year run of intoxicating profit gains. 
 The bigger question is what happens next. Will this be just a brief headache or are earnings going to turn into a real hangover? "It is the great issue for the market now," Thomas Doerflinger, an investment strategist at Paine Webber, said.
What's worse, even if earnings growth resumes next year, will that be enough to put the stock market back on track? The fall in semiconductor stocks the last two days, despite indications that the industry is turning around, may mean that even moderate gains in profits won't be enough to satisfy the crowd.
And while the Dow Jones industrial average recovered most of its losses by the end of trading yesterday, the Nasdaq composite index, the market yardstick that measures the performance of many of the fastest-growing and most popular technology stocks, absorbed another sharp blow.
Until recently, investors could almost count on pleasant surprises from companies reporting earnings that consistently exceeded expectations. That hope now seems to be vanishing and many investors are tuning out those strategists who continue to sing even a mildly positive tune.
"We're still looking for up earnings," said Byron R. Wien, the United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "And in almost every conversation I have with clients, they challenge me. 'There is no way earnings will go up,' they say."
The reaction yesterday to a new report from Abby Joseph Cohen, the closely followed market strategist for Goldman, Sachs & Company who has been a longtime bull, showed just how touchy investors are.
In a note to Goldman clients before the stock market opened, Ms. Cohen said that she was lowering her forecast for operating earnings -- which are adjusted to remove the impact of one-time write-offs and other charges -- for the stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 index. That announcement helped send Wall Street sharply lower when the market opened.
Still, her outlook remains quite positive in a climate where pessimism seems to be growing. She predicted that earnings for this year would end up about 5 percent above 1997 results and she forecast another 7 percent gain in 1999. That's down, but only a bit, from her earlier forecast of 8 percent growth for 1998 and 8.9 percent for 1999.
Indeed, as Mr. Wien's and Ms. Cohen's forecasts show, a lot of big names on Wall Street continue to bet that any profit dip in the third quarter will be little more than a hiccup.
While they are not expecting the percentile growth in earnings to roar back to the bullish double-digit pace of the mid-1990's, they are still counting on profits to keep improving. Douglas R. Cliggott, the United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities, is forecasting 2 percent earnings growth in 1999 even though his firm's economists predict a mild recession next year.
Two forces drove the stock market forward during the incredible bull run that began in 1991. One was rapid earnings growth. The other was the flow of billions of dollars from ordinary investors out of other assets into stocks, powering Wall Street to record highs this summer even as earnings growth was really slowing down.
With the bull market in retreat, strategists are looking for something to spur the market to climb again, to encourage investors to gaze over the valley. A return to steady earnings growth could fit the bill.
But the performance this week of Advanced Micro Devices and other semiconductor stocks shows that even good earnings news may be easily overwhelmed by uncertainty about the current economic outlook.
On Tuesday, Advanced Micro reported that strong sales of its K6-2 computer microprocessor had returned the company, unexpectedly, to profitability in the third quarter. Following better-than-expected earnings from Motorola the day before, it was a signal that the industry, which includes the chip giant Intel, might be turning around.
But Advanced Micro's stock plunged, falling 20.8 percent Wednesday and 11.1 percent yesterday. The Philadelphia semiconductor index, which tracks 16 companies in the industry, dropped 3.4 percent Wednesday and another nine-tenths of 1 percent yesterday.
According to several analysts, the chance for an overall earnings rebound requires several diverse elements to fall into place. The economy must avoid a recession, chip makers must make a comeback next year, energy prices need to stabilize near their current levels and the dollar has to come down to levels that help American exporters sell more abroad.
All that is possible. But the price of oil, which had jumped 27 percent, to $16.14 a barrel from Aug. 12 to the end of September, has dropped back this month to $14.42 a barrel. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, says the prospects for economic growth are worsening. And while the dollar is down sharply against the German mark and the Japanese yen from its highs this summer, it remains relatively strong against the currencies of America's other major trading partners.
Ms. Cohen, Mr. Doerflinger and Mr. Wein are all expecting the economy to stay out of a recession. Mr. Doerfliner is forecasting earnings growth of almost 7 percent next year and Mr. Wien is predicting 2 percent earnings growth.
Ms. Cohen does acknowledge that Asia has still not bottomed out and that Latin America is showing "unexpected weakness."
Mr. Wien said that "the momentum of the economy is still good, consumer confidence is still good and the Fed is easing."
Apart from the overall economy, these strategists argue that the hardest-hit industries, like semiconductors and energy, do not need to return to robust earnings growth but merely stop this year's slide to push 1999 earnings higher.
According to Mr. Doerflinger, earnings from the energy industry plunged 29 percent in the first nine months of this year compared with the period in 1997. "If energy earnings are just flat, that would be an improvement," he said.
The recent dollar decline will also add to the bottom line of a lot of American companies next year if its exchange rates just stay where they are. A lower dollar means that earnings from abroad will increase when they are translated back into cheaper dollars.
But not all strategists share this measured optimism about earnings. Marshall Acuff, the equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, and Mitchell J. Held, the firm's chief economist, are predicting a 1.1 percent decline in earnings next year. Mr. Held's forecast is based on a weaker economy, a rally in the dollar, continued poor performance from financial companies and downward pressure on profit margins -- because prices cannot rise much and may even fall.
For investors, this range of forecasts by market strategists may not be all that comforting. But it is clearly more in line with the current outlook and, thus, less likely to lead to the kind of profit disappointments that have sent stocks lower.
The same cannot be said for the earnings forecasts assembled by the hordes of analysts who predict earnings for individual companies in the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks. These forecasters, according to First Call, are expecting an 18.1 percent surge in earnings next year.
"I would be happier if they were much lower," Mr. Acuff said. "Then I could say that stock market prices reflect the worst."

While all major stock market indexes have fallen in recent months, the traditional focus on the most well-known measure --the Dow industrial average -- has obscured the true ferocity of the bear market in the much larger number of stocks included in the Nasdaq composite index, which tracks mostly technology stocks, and the Russell 2000 index of small stocks. Graphs plot closing prices of the Dow Jones industrial average, the Russell 2000 index, the Nasdaq composite index and the S.& P. 500 index, from 1997 through yesterday.

HEADLINE: THE TESTING OF A PRESIDENT;
Excerpts From President's Remarks at Meeting on Budget Matters

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's remarks today before a meeting with his economic team, as transcribed by the Federal News Service, a private transcription company. Mr. Clinton was asked a question by reporters.
PRESIDENT CLINTON. We are about to start a meeting with the economic and budget team about the unfinished work in the budget that has to be done in the next few days. But before we start, I'd like to make just a very brief comment on today's vote. 
 First of all, I hope that we can now move forward with this process in a way that is fair, that is constitutional and that is timely. The American people have been through a lot on this, and I think that everyone deserves that.
Beyond that, I have nothing to say. It is not in my hands, it is in the hands of Congress and the people of this country. -- ultimately, in the hands of God. There is nothing I can do.
But there are things I can do something about, and the most important thing I can do now is to work in the next few days to reach across party lines to do the work that we have to do here. We have got to pass a budget that protects the surplus until we save Social Security, that keeps the American economy going amid all this economic turmoil in the world, that protects instead of damages the environment and that gives the kind of priority to our elementary and secondary education that it so clearly needs. Those are my priorities. I think those are the priorities of the American people. It will require us to put progress ahead of partisanship, but it clearly will strengthen our country. And that's what we're going to work on, and I hope we can do it.
Q. Sir, you could speed the pace of this up if you were to volunteer to testify and decide whether or not now you would challenge Monica Lewinsky's account of your relationship. Have you made any decisions on that front?
A. Let me say again. On that, I will do what I can to help to insure this is constitutional, fair and timely. Ultimately, it is in the hands of Congress. I don't think it's appropriate to comment further today.
Q. Mr. President, have you talked to other world leaders today? And how are you feeling personally about the vote?
A. I have ----. Well, today I spoke with President Chirac of France. And I am meeting tomorrow with the man who will be the next German Chancellor, Mr. Schroder. We talked about Kosovo. And I have been working, as you know, all week long with people from all over the world on the international financial crisis. Personally, I am, I am fine. I have, I have surrendered this. This is beyond my control. I have to work on what I can do.
What I can do is to do my job for the American people. I trust the American people; they almost always get it right, and have for 220 years. And I'm working in a way that I hope will restore their trust in me by working for the things that our country needs. These -- these things we're going to discuss at this budget meeting, that's what I can have some impact on, and that's what I intend to do.

HEADLINE: Study Says Emissions Cut Will Raise Fuel Costs

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
The Energy Department's official forecasting arm has produced an extraordinarily pessimistic forecast of steeply rising energy prices if the United States fights global warming by clamping down on emissions of heat-trapping gases that come from burning fossil fuels.
Under various outcomes, the forecasting arm, the Energy Information Administration, projected gasoline prices would rise to $1.39 to $1.91 a gallon, and electricity prices would rise 20 percent to 86 percent by 2010. Natural gas prices would rise significantly, and coal prices would soar, the forecast said. 
 Under an international agreement negotiated last year in Kyoto, Japan, the United States would have to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases significantly in 10 to 15 years. But the treaty is in trouble in Congress, where opponents often say it would wreck the economy.
The Energy Department's forecast is sharply at odds with the Clinton Administration's previous assertions that the United States can meet the targets set by the treaty without significant economic disruption. The forecast is to be presented on Friday at a Congressional hearing.
The new study plays directly into the hands of treaty opponents, but those who favor the treaty said it is deeply flawed.
Energy conservation advocates said the forecast, produced using the Energy Information Administration's standard economic models, had relied on absurd assumptions and improper analysis to reach ridiculous conclusions.
"This is one of the most flawed, biased, intellectually dishonest analyses ever produced by an supposedly unbiased analytical organization," said Joseph J. Romm, a former Assistant Energy Secretary. Mr. Romm is an expert on energy technologies like solar power and conservation that would help control greenhouse gas emissions.
He and other critics said the study discounted many of the policies, like tax incentives and research subsidies, that the Administration had proposed for enforcing the treaty if the Senate approved it. They said it used computer models that were unreliable for long-term forecasting.
They said it did not account for the lower costs that would result from a key feature of the Administration's climate change policy: international emissions trading, which would allow the United States to meet the treaty's targets largely by paying other countries to reduce their output of greenhouse gases.
Critics also said the forecast assumed that businesses would be slow to adopt new energy technologies although, under the forecast's own projections, the costs of not acting would be high.
Many such computer models have been used for projecting the costs of the Kyoto agreement protocol on climate change. Because so much depends on the assumptions of the models, their predictions may not be reliable. And critics noted that the Energy Department had a long track record of making bad predictions about long-range trends in energy prices and pollution control costs.
Even so, the new study is certain to fuel criticism of the treaty. The study is scheduled to be presented on Friday at a hearing of the House Science Committee, whose chairman, Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., a Wisconsin Republican, is a leading critic of the treaty.
The study's projections of the costs of controlling the emissions of greenhouse gases are significantly greater than the predictions of several similar studies, even the gloomy forecasts paid for by industry opponents of the treaty that predicted extraordinary costs.
And it predicts that the costs would be much higher than predicted by Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, in a study released in July.
Eileen Claussen, a former senior State Department official who helped negotiate the Kyoto agreement, said that just as Dr. Yellen's analysis was wildly optimistic, this one was wildly pessimistic.
"Both of these forecasts are totally unrealistic," Ms. Claussen said. "It is the most bizarre thing. They haven't put out a single bit of analytical work on the costs that has any credibility at all."
Ms. Claussen now directs the Pew Center on Climate Change, which has drawn together major corporations pledging early actions to cut their emissions of greenhouse gases.
Mr. Romm, who now consults with businesses on how to cut greenhouse gas emissions, criticized the report's assertions that emerging technologies like solar power and fuel cells would gain little over 20 years although costs of traditional fuels were likely to rise.
He ridiculed the study's finding that even with coal prices soaring, power plants would not install any measurable cogeneration equipment, which uses waste heat to generate extra electricity from coal.
Although the new study predicts slowing economic growth as a result of higher energy costs, over the long run this amounts to just tens of billions of dollars in an economy that grows to more than $10 trillion.

HEADLINE: THE TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: THE PRESIDENT;
Routine Business, but No Routine Day

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
President Clinton maintained an ordinary schedule and an air of absorption today in routine public business as the House approved an impeachment investigation that may shorten his term in office and will certainly affect his place in history.
Mr. Clinton announced measures to protect Medicare recipients dropped from their health plans, warned of a looming refugee catastrophe in Kosovo, lunched with Vice President Gore, signed a bill to publish records of Nazi war criminals and met with his economic advisers on the 1999 budget. 
 In his only remarks on the impeachment vote, Mr. Clinton told reporters in a brief picture-taking session late this afternoon that his future "is not in my hands."
"Ultimately it is in the hands of the Congress," Mr. Clinton said. "I don't think it's appropriate to comment further today."
This morning, as the House was engaged in its wrenching debate over the impeachment inquiry, Mr. Clinton was before a friendly audience in the Roosevelt Room of the White House discussing Medicare and health maintenance organizations.
As he completed his remarks, reporters tried to shout questions about the impeachment debate and the hearings that are likely to begin shortly after the Nov. 3 election.
Their entreaties were drowned out by applause from a carefully selected audience of Democratic lawmakers, Administration officials and senior citizens.
The end of the official transcript of the event reads:
"Mr. President, will you voluntarily testify?"
(No response as the President leaves the Roosevelt Room.)
The President's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said Mr. Clinton had not watched any of the House debate on the impeachment inquiry, unless he caught glimpses of it on one of the dozens of television sets in the West Wing tuned to the proceedings.
"I don't believe he's watched any of it, unless he's watched it in passing, walking through a hallway," Mr. Lockhart said. "He is surely interested in the outcome; but he's got a job to do here and that's what he's focused on."
Mr. Lockhart added: "We don't have the luxury of being distracted or being anyplace else. We have the people's business to do here, and in fact, that's what's happening over the next few days."
A senior White House official said the only suspense about today's impeachment vote was the number of Democrats who would vote for the Republican impeachment resolution, and even that number was pretty well known on Wednesday night.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, told the White House on the eve of the vote that he expected about 30 Democrats, some in tight re-election races, to defect and join the Republicans. Thirty-one Democrats voted for the Republican resolution.
The President's apparent nonchalance today was the result of this early intelligence, the White House official said. He was not terribly concerned about the vote because he knew how it would turn out.
"This thing got built up bigger than it needed or should have been," the official said. "We're talking about a process that we kind of knew the outcome of for a long time."
Mr. Lockhart said throughout his regular briefing this afternoon that the President remained focused on important matters of state -- the Federal budget, the crisis in Kosovo, the future of Social Security -- a refrain that has left White House spokesmen hoarse.
Mr. Lockhart was asked whether there would ever come a time when the President would shift his focus from these matters to his personal survival. "I don't know how to answer that," he replied.

As part of a broader corporate cost-cutting effort at CBS Inc., the network's news division yesterday laid off about 7 percent of its staff, but closed no bureaus and dismissed no correspondents.
The savings to the company will amount to close to $40 million, or about 10 percent of the CBS News budget, according to people familiar with the budget who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
 CBS News issued pink slips to about 120 people, most of them in administrative or support positions, from a staff of about 1,600. Executives took pains to describe the reductions as a reorganization rather than across-the-board cutbacks. Several producers and correspondents said that this appeared to be true.
Andrew Heyward, president of CBS News, had been researching ways to save money since midsummer, under a directive from CBS corporate executives to all division heads to move CBS toward profitability. All the networks except NBC lost money last year, and are expected to do so again this year, largely as a result of higher prices they have had to pay for entertainment shows and for football games.
ABC News and NBC News have laid off some people, too, but have not announced how many.
"We are consolidating management functions in our hubs in New York, Washington, Los Angeles, London and Tokyo," Mr. Heyward wrote in a memorandum to the news division yesterday. "This means fewer people in Dallas, Miami, Tel Aviv and Moscow, but our core news gathering strength in those places remains intact and is expected to increase elsewhere as this system evolves."
The new system, as Mr. Heyward described it in an interview, relies upon advanced satellite, cell phone and computer technology to link correspondents and producers in the field to supervisors in the hub cities mentioned in the memorandum.
Supervisors in the hub cities will coordinate assignments. Most reports will be transmitted to those cities and edited there, as well, rather than by editors sent, with equipment, to locations where a news event is happening.
The smaller CBS News bureaus, in Dallas or Miami, for example, will lose management staff -- such as a bureau chief, deputy bureau chief and clerical staff. Instead, the bureau will have at least one three-member "coverage team," consisting of a correspondent, camera person and producer.
In addition, many producers in the larger bureaus such as Washington (whose staff was virtually untouched) will now be expected to work for any CBS News program, as the news cycle requires, rather than to work for only one program, such as "The CBS Evening News" or "CBS This Morning," as had been done in the past.
Also, separate assignment desks for the Northeast United States, the national desk and the foreign desk will be consolidated into one assignment desk, responsible for dealing with all requests for reports or elements for reports from CBS news programs.
Al Ortiz, the executive producer of "The CBS Evening News," said, "It puts a greater burden on producers of stories to plan a bit more, since you won't be in the edit room to look over every decision."
Similarly, he said, those in the field "have to use their laptops -- send scripts faster and provide more detailed instruction about how to organize or cut a story" to colleagues assembling stories in the hub-city operation.
About six weeks ago CBS Inc. said it would cut between 200 and 300 jobs by the end of 1998, including those in the news division that were cut yesterday. No layoffs in other divisions were made yesterday.

Japan Apologizes to Korea
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi offered Koreans an unusually forthright apology for Japanese colonial occupation of the Korean peninsula early in this century. In the complex politics of apology that play an important role in Japan's relations with its East Asian neighbors, the statement marked one more step toward greater public contrition for World War II, and South Korea seemed pleased.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
A Volatile Day Turns Wall St. To Uneasy St.

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Over the last six weeks, investors have held onto the hope that the United States might be able to avoid the full effect of the economic downturn that has struck so many far-flung parts of the world. And while the financial markets remain in turmoil, many investors thought that the prices of stocks, bonds and other financial assets had largely taken the bad news into account.
Those illusions cracked yesterday as the value of the dollar fell further, the bond market dropped and the prices of hundreds of stocks plunged even as the main stock market gauges showed minimal losses. One after another, the pilings that have lent a measure of stability to the markets over the last several weeks have been swept away. Page C1. 
 On the surface, things might not look so bad: the Dow Jones industrial average, the market bellwether, finished the day a mere 9.78 points lower, at 7,731.91. But beneath that relatively calm result was a day of turmoil during which the Dow fell as much as 274 points before climbing back in the last two hours of trading.
Even greater damage occurred in the Nasdaq composite index, which measures the performance of many of the fastest-growing technology companies. The index dropped 43.49 points, or nearly 3 percent, to 1,419.12 -- its lowest closing price in 16 months. Over the last two weeks alone, the Nasdaq index has fallen nearly 20 percent -- a spectacular implosion in such a short time.
That greater upheaval reflects a significant shift in the mood of many investors on Wall Street and around the globe. Gone are the expectations, analysts said, that the United States can avoid the economic slowdown that has already gripped much of the world. While many economists on Wall Street still call a recession unlikely, the fact that they are including its potential in their forecasts means that most bets of continued unbridled expansion are off.
Also washing away are some of the last remaining expectations of brisk growth in corporate profits, of companies using much of their excess cash to buy back their own shares, and of individual investors riding to the rescue to buy more stocks each time the market dips.
"There's more confusion in the marketplace now than I've ever seen in my career," said Henry Herrmann, president and chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed Financial, a mutual fund company based in Overland Park, Kan.
"The level of confusion has just got the vast majority of portfolio managers cross-eyed," said Mr. Herrmann, who has worked in the investment business since 1963.
Chief among the confusing situations is the "flight to quality" that has taken place among stock and bond investors. The shift has left blue-chip stocks and United States Treasury bonds performing relatively well while every other category of assets has been hammered.
The latest victims have been the highly visible Nasdaq stocks, posting steep drops stemming in large part from heavy selling by foreign investors. Those investors have been some of the biggest buyers of American stocks over the last two years as the value of the dollar appreciated.
Now, however, with the dollar reversing its course and becoming cheaper in relation to the yen, the mark and other foreign currencies, overseas investors are finding that not only are their American stocks worth less, but they also get less of their home currency for each dollar when they convert their investments.
In addition, those Americans who have come to expect a United States recession have begun to measure its possible effect on technology companies. Those manufacturers that sell equipment to businesses in America and around the world are more likely to be hurt by an economic slowdown than are the large consumer product companies that make up much of the Dow industrial index.
"If there is a slowdown in the purchase of capital goods by companies, the technology companies will be affected more dramatically than a lot of the blue chips," said Robert Freedman, chief investment officer at the John Hancock funds. "At the same time, people will still be eating and drinking and going to the movies."
Several specific events also led traders to take a decidedly dimmer view of things yesterday. First, the Bank of England cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point, to 7.25 percent. But much as with the quarter-point cut in rates by the Federal Reserve last week, equity traders and analysts judged the move to be too little to aid slowing economies around the world, particularly in Europe. Financial markets in Europe fell sharply, with the major stock indexes down 2.7 percent in Britain and 5 percent in Germany.
Long-term interest rates generally rose yesterday, with the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond climbing to just below 5 percent, up from 4.72 percent on Monday. In addition, short-term rates have fallen in the days since the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rate, and the level of short-term rates generally indicates that bond traders expect further cuts by the Federal Reserve.
Two influential American analysts adjusted their outlooks yesterday, further adding to the gloom. Abby Joseph Cohen, the investment analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company who has been the market's most voluble cheerleader over the last three years, made comments about corporate earnings growth that to many listeners had a slightly negative tone.
If Ms. Cohen did not throw in the towel on her relentlessly optimistic forecast, she at least threw in a washcloth, cutting her estimates of 1998 and 1999 earnings for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, implying that the current economic squeeze will extend well into next year.
And Ralph J. Acampora, who tracks statistical market measures at Prudential Securities, lowered his estimate of how low the Dow might fall. It was Mr. Acampora's prediction of a bear market that caused a stampede out of stocks in early August, when the Dow industrials were still above 8,700. Yesterday, he said he thought the Dow would go as low as 6,700, well below his previous floor of 7,400. To reach 6,700, the Dow would have to fall more than 13 percent from yesterday's close.
Also, Greg Smith, Prudential's chief investment strategist, recommended that aggressive investors increase cash holdings to 20 percent of assets from 5 percent. Most of that cash, he said, should be raised by lowering bond investments to 25 percent of a portfolio from 35 percent, with stock investments falling to 55 percent from 60 percent.
Two other stabilizing factors also appear to be gone from beneath the relatively calm surface of the stock market. Mutual fund investors, who have been a source of stability for stocks in the last four years, demonstrated in August -- the last time the market fell sharply -- that they would withdraw money from funds when performance turned down.
Now, with small stocks continuing a sharp fall, analysts say that funds specializing in shares of small companies are experiencing growing levels of investor withdrawals.
Also, traders speak of fears that one more remaining source of liquidity for the stock market is drying up: corporate stock repurchases. With credit becoming harder to come by, corporations that have been buying back shares to finance option packages and for other uses might be less likely to spend any spare cash they have, at least over the short run.
That leaves many traders fearful that the market will get more choppy, with big swings during the day, like yesterday's, becoming even more common. Investors, they say, should be ready for more rough seas.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "AT A GLANCE: Financial Jitters: A Summary"
 
MARKETS GYRATE. Stocks tumbled in nearly every market, reflecting growing investor nervousness about a possible global recession. The selling dragged the Dow Jones industrial average nearly 300 points lower before it recovered and ended little changed in some of the heaviest trading ever. But the Nasdaq market, home to many of America's growth stocks, skidded again and is now at its lowest level in 16 months. Long-term bond yields, which had fallen to 31-year lows last week, shot up. The dollar, which tumbled more than 8 percent on Wednesday, skidded again in Europe before it rebounded to close slightly lower against the yen.
 
HOPE FOR I.M.F. FUNDING. Republican leaders in Congress and the Clinton Administration moved toward an agreement that would provide $18 billion in new United States money for the International Monetary Fund, considered an important step in containing the financial crisis.
 
EUROPE GROWS MORE NERVOUS. Britain's central bank cut interest rates on concern about the turmoil's effect on British businesses, the first such cut in more than two years. But the move did nothing to stop the slide in British stocks. Across the English Channel, European Union politicians openly worried about keeping interest rates relatively high, fearing that would hurt Europe's economy, the one area of the world where growth has been rising.

HEADLINE: Deals Near on Manhattan Sites for 3 Stock Markets

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Working against deadlines imposed by New York's financial markets, city and state officials are scrambling to complete a series of complex deals in the coming weeks that would create new headquarters for the New York, American and Nasdaq Stock Exchanges in Manhattan.
Taken together, the deals could cost the city and state more than $700 million, mainly in cash. 
 The search for new homes for the financial industry has become a high-stakes real estate version of musical chairs, as the exchanges, which are also being wooed by New Jersey, try to extract huge subsidy packages and New York developers maneuver to get a lucrative piece of the business.
To keep the New York Stock Exchange downtown, officials are optimistic that they can cobble together an agreement to buy five parcels, diagonally across Broad Street from the New York Stock Exchange, where a new trading floor and a billion-dollar headquarters would be built. The outline of a deal must be in place in time for the Nov. 4 board meeting of the exchange, which has said it would consider a move to Battery Park City or New Jersey if the city is unable to secure a location in the financial district.
At the same time, city and state officials are trying to forge an agreement this week with the National Association of Securities Dealers, which owns Nasdaq and is acquiring the American Stock Exchange, for a new headquarters for those exchanges on an empty lot in TriBeCa, in Battery Park City or at 42d Street and the Avenue of the Americas. The N.A.S.D., which met yesterday in New York, is also considering two waterfront projects in Jersey City.
"It's been a game of musical chairs," said Mary Ann Tighe, executive managing director of the Insignia/Edward S. Gordon real estate company, "but now it looks like everybody is going to find a place to sit down."
The exchanges are bargaining for a lot more than cuts in sales taxes or property taxes. The markets, particularly the New York Stock Exchange, are also pushing the state and the city to provide cash to offset the cost of constructing a modern trading operation. The money would be diverted from state and city capital budgets.
To clinch the deals, the city and state may have to provide $700 million in cash, tax breaks and low-cost electricity, an immense sum but less than half the estimated cost to taxpayers of the proposed baseball stadiums for the Yankees and the Mets, taken together.
Officials contend that the city cannot afford to lose the New York Stock Exchange, and that a deal with Nasdaq and the American Exchange would involve a coup for New York: moving the N.A.S.D. headquarters and several hundred employees from Washington to Manhattan.
Fearing the flight of the financial industry in New York and with New Jersey trying to lure the exchanges,during the last 15 years city and state officials have granted nearly a billion dollars in tax breaks and other incentives to investment banks and other financial institutions. The financial industry accounts for only 5 percent of the jobs in New York, but tax revenues linked to the industry generated most of the city's $2.1 billion budget surplus last year.
Although Jersey City officials are still talking to the exchanges, New York officials expect to strike a deal with the New York, American and Nasdaq exchanges in the coming weeks, say people involved on all sides of the negotiations, all of whom would speak only on the condition of anonymity. But the situation is fluid, they say, and anything can happen.
"I think it's going to get done," said one person involved in the talks. "But it's going to be big numbers on both of them."
Officials at the New York Stock Exchange believe that there are still obstacles to clinching the deal, says one person working for the exchange who is involved in the negotiations.
Richard Grasso, chairman of the exchange, has said only that he favors building at Battery Park City.
The financial exchanges have been casting about Manhattan, and occasionally threatening to move to New Jersey, for nearly 30 years. The New York Stock Exchange considered moving to a site on the East River from its historic home on Wall Street in the early 1970's, and the American Stock Exchange nearly moved to Battery Park City in the 1980's. In 1991, both the American and New York exchanges worked on a proposal to build a billion-dollar combined exchange in lower Manhattan, but the deal fizzled in the recession.
But the effort to retain the stock exchanges may undermine efforts on another front: finding homes for commodity exchanges. The TriBeCa site being considered for the headquarters of the N.A.S.D. was originally earmarked as a new home for the Cotton Exchange and the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange. Not only that, state officials say that a $98.5 million incentive package for those commodity exchanges, collectively known as the Board of Trade, expired last month.
As a result, the Board of Trade is negotiating to extend its current lease at 4 World Trade Center. Real estate experts say the board is also trying to preserve a claim on the old $98.5 million subsidy package.
While the city wants the N.A.S.D. to move its headquarters, along with Nasdaq and the American exchange, to the TriBeCa site, that move may not be a sure bet. Frank Zarb, N.A.S.D. chairman, has also talked to the developer Douglas Durst about building a new headquarters on 42d Street, near Times Square, that would give the exchanges the prominent location Mr. Zarb wants.
Not only that, Mr. Zarb and his real estate advisers, Cushman & Wakefield, have also talked to John Zuccotti, chairman of World Financial Properties, about building on a vacant parcel at the northern end of Battery Park City.
The only problem is that the Battery Park City site is the backup location for the New York Stock Exchange if the city fails to buy the properties on Broad Street. While the Battery Park City Authority maintains that Mr. Zuccotti has no rights to the parcel, Mr. Zuccotti and World Financial Properties say that they have veto rights over any development at the site by virtue of their having built the four office towers known as World Financial Center.
"They don't have any claim of substance" to the site, said James Gill, chairman of the Battery Park City Authority. "He may want to build there himself. But he's not in a position to block us from having the New York Stock Exchange or anyone else from coming."

HEADLINE: Poll Finds Broad Statewide Support for Pataki's Re-election

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA with MARJORIE CONNELLY 

 BODY:
After four years as Governor, George E. Pataki has forged a strikingly broad appeal, propelling him to a 2-to-1 lead for re-election over his Democratic opponent, Peter F. Vallone, who has barely registered in voters' minds, a statewide New York Times/CBS News Poll has found.
Mr. Pataki, the poll also shows, has thoroughly overcome the view of him, once widely held, as an uncaring, ideological conservative out of step with the state, and the stigma of his having risen to power as the protege of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, whose integrity many voters still seriously question. The Governor, who won office as the candidate of conservatives upstate and on Long Island, now enjoys robust support across regional and party boundaries. 
 A month before the Nov. 3 election, 50 percent of voters surveyed favored Mr. Pataki, a Republican, against 22 percent for Mr. Vallone and 6 percent each for B. Thomas Golisano, the Independence Party candidate, and Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, the Liberal Party nominee. Among likely voters, the Governor's lead was 54 percent to 24 percent for Mr. Vallone, the New York City Council Speaker.
The race for attorney general is in a dead heat. The Republican incumbent, Dennis C. Vacco, has 38 percent to the 37 percent for the Democratic candidate, Eliot G. Spitzer. State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat, has a wide lead over his Republican challenger, Bruce Blakeman, 41 percent to 19 percent. One-third of voters remain undecided.
The poll, based on interviews conducted Oct. 1 to Oct. 6 with 1,066 registered voters, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
So far, Mr. Vallone has been utterly unable to galvanize support, even among Democrats and New York City residents. Just a month before the election, a large number of voters polled simply did not know enough to express any opinion about him, good or bad, though he has been a leading figure in city politics for more than a decade. And the support Mr. Vallone has is much weaker than Mr. Pataki's.
Even with such gloomy news, Mr. Vallone can take some solace in that 35 percent of voters said they might change their minds, and that even seemingly runaway races tend to tighten by Election Day.
One of the few bright spots for Mr. Vallone was the finding that many voters are not yet paying much attention to this race, suggesting that some bold stroke, however unlikely, might galvanize their interest and tip the balance.
Another was the continuing high popularity of President Clinton in New York: despite his troubles, 73 percent of registered voters approve of his job performance. In recent days, Mr. Vallone has made an avid defense of Mr. Clinton a centerpiece of his campaign, making him one of the few candidates for high office anywhere in the country to try to gain by embracing the President.
But Mr. Vallone has little money left for that or any other message. His campaign treasury reported having less than $250,000 last week, compared with more than $9 million for Mr. Pataki.
The poll suggests the possibility of a landslide for Mr. Pataki, which he and his aides hope might propel him into contention for national office in 2000. They are acutely aware that a lopsided victory in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans 3 to 2, or carrying New York City, would raise Mr. Pataki's stature within the national Republican Party. Only 1 in 5 New Yorkers said they would like to see him run for President or Vice President, however.
In the city, usually the safest of havens for Democrats, the Governor is running virtually even with his challenger, at 36 percent to 39 percent for Mr. Vallone. Four years ago, he got just 27 percent of the city vote against Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
In the downstate suburbs, which have been the swing vote in recent elections, Mr. Pataki holds a 5-to-2 lead. And upstate, the core of his support, he outpolls the Democrat by 5 to 1. Upstate, Mr. Golisano runs even with Mr. Vallone, at 11 percent apiece, while Ms. McCaughey Ross has 4 percent.
The attorney general's race falls along more traditional regional lines that shape statewide races in New York. Mr. Vacco holds a 2-to-1 lead upstate, he and Mr. Spitzer are roughly even in the suburbs, and Mr. Spitzer has a 3-to-1 lead in New York City.
Mr. McCall, the first black official elected statewide, is comfortably ahead of Mr. Blakeman, the leader of the Nassau County Legislature, over all in the comptroller's race, and has a commanding lead in New York City. But a third of the voters said they had not decided whom they would vote for.
In 1994, Mr. Pataki, a State Senator, ran as the anti-Cuomo, revealing little about himself other than his intention to cut taxes and enact the death penalty, and relying on voters' disaffection with Mr. Cuomo after 12 years.
Even as he was winning the race for govrnor, many people had little impression of the Republican, or a negative one. His image suffered from his close association with Mr. D'Amato, who had plucked him out of obscurity to be the Republican candidate.
In his first year in office -- and, to a lesser degree, his second -- Mr. Pataki pushed through unpopular budget cuts in areas like health care, education and mass transit. Unions and Democrats waged an intense public-relations campaign against him, including broadcast advertisements likening him to Speaker Newt Gingrich.
But since then, Mr. Pataki has done a remarkable job of washing away those impressions. He has replaced them with a warmer image of himself, built on the 1996 environmental bond act, tax cuts, large increases in state spending in the last two years and a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign this year that has portrayed him as likable, nonpartisan and trustworthy.
The poll found that nearly as many New Yorkers now judge Mr. Pataki to be moderate as consider him conservative, and 1 in 8 actually regards him as liberal.
In October 1994, two weeks before he was elected, just 18 percent of registered voters had a favorable impression of Mr. Pataki. In April 1995, three months after he took office, 27 percent did.
But in this most recent poll, 46 percent viewed him favorably and, perhaps more striking, just 18 percent viewed him unfavorably. Sixty-three percent of registered voters said they approved of Mr. Pataki's performance as Governor, well above the 50 percent mark that usually spells job security for incumbents.
He even trumps Mr. Vallone on a polling question on which Democrats nearly always prevail. Sixty-one percent of voters said Mr. Pataki "cares about the needs and problems of people" like them, up from 40 percent in April 1995, compared with 37 percent who said Mr. Vallone cares about them.
Mr. Vallone's troubles are reflected by Mary Hossman, 60, of Woodside, Queens, one of the people surveyed. She has friends in common with Mr. Vallone and praises the work he has done in city government. A Democrat, she plans to vote for her party's nominee for the United States Senate, Representative Charles E. Schumer, in his bid to unseat Mr. D'Amato.
But she also intends to vote for Mr. Pataki. "Originally I was voting for him because of the death penalty," she said in a follow-up interview. "That made me take interest in him in 1994. Then I just think he did a really good job. The economy is better and the general quality of life is better."
The challengers in the gubernatorial race point to evidence that beyond Wall Street, the state's economy lags well behind the national boom, and complain that Mr. Pataki has somehow fooled people into believing that New York is doing better than it is.
The poll suggest that New Yorkers know their state's problems, but do not blame the Governor. While two-thirds of New Yorkers described the state's economy at "fairly good," just 9 percent rated the it as "very good." Twenty-two percent of New Yorkers judged the state's economy as "fairly bad" or "very bad." That compared with a Times/CBS News national poll taken in August that showed 61 percent of Americans rate the national economy as "fairly good," 25 percent said it was "very good" and 12 percent said it was fairly or very bad.
Mr. Pataki's experience mirrors that of Mr. Cuomo, who was first elected Governor in 1982 and won re-election in a landslide in 1986. Each man was first elected in a tight contest that reflected stark regional divisions, took office in the aftermath of a recession, and then benefited from a strong economy and greatly broadened his base of support in his first terms.
Throughout this campaign, Mr. Vallone has been hamstrung by being relatively unknown outside the city, and he has lacked the campaign treasury to spread his message the way the Governor has done. What broadcast advertising he has done has been mostly drowned out by the far larger campaigns of Mr. Pataki and the two contestants for the Senate, Senator D'Amato and Representative Schumer.
After a year of active campaigning, Mr. Vallone is so little known that three-quarters of voters have no overall opinion of him, and nearly half could not say whether he had the honesty to be Governor, or if he cared about people like them.
Only 1 in 4 Vallone supporters said they favored him strongly, while more than half the Pataki supporters were strongly in favor of their candidate. And the poll provides evidence of a widespread Democratic defection; for now, fewer than half of Democratic voters said they intended to vote for Mr. Vallone.

HEADLINE: THE TESTING OF A PRESIDENT;
Excerpts From Debate on Plan to Begin an Impeachment Inquiry

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from comments by members of the House today during its debate on a resolution to begin an impeachment inquiry against President Clinton, as recorded by the Federal News Service, a private transcription service, and The New York Times:
 
Representative Rick Boucher
Democrat of Virginia
At the conclusion of this debate, I will offer a motion to recommit the resolution offered by the gentleman from Illinois to the Committee on the Judiciary with the instruction that the committee immediately report back that resolution to the House with instructions that it contain our Democratic alternative. . . . 
 The Democratic amendment is a resolution for a full and complete review by the Judiciary Committee of the material that has been presented to the House by the Office of Independent Counsel. The Republican resolution also provides for that full and complete review.
The difference between the Democratic and the Republican approaches is only over the scope of the review, only over the time that the review will take and only over our insistence that the Judiciary Committee in conducting its process pay deference and become aware of the historical Constitutional standard for impeachment that has evolved to us over the centuries and was recognized most recently by the Judiciary Committee in 1974 and then recognized by the full House of Representatives.
The public interest requires a fair and deliberate inquiry in this matter. Our resolution provides for that fair and deliberate inquiry. But the public interest also requires an appropriate boundary on the scope of the inquiry. It should not become an invitation for a free-ranging fishing expedition subjecting to a formal impeachment inquiry matters that are not before the Congress today.
The potential for such a venture should be strictly limited by the resolution adopted today by the House and our Democratic proposal contains those appropriate limits. It would subject to the inquiry the material presented to us by the Office of Independent Counsel, which is the only material before the House today.
The public interest also requires that the matter be brought to conclusion at the earliest possible time that is consistent with a thorough and a complete review. The country has already undergone substantial trauma. If the committee carries this work beyond the time that is reasonably needed to conduct its complete and thorough review, that injury to the nation will only deepen.
We should be thorough, but we should also be prompt. Given that the facts of this matter are generally well-known, given that there are only a handful of witnesses who have relevant information that can be addressed in this inquiry, and given the further fact that all of those witnesses have already been the subject of extensive review by the grand jury and their testimony is available, this inquiry can, in fact, be prompt.
The committee's work should not extend into next year. A careful and a thorough review can be accomplished between now and the end of this year, and our Democratic resolution provides that appropriate limitation on time. The resolution requires that the committee hold hearings on the Constitutional standard for impeachment which was clearly stated in the conclusion of the committee's report in the Watergate years of 1974. Our substitute then directs that the committee compare the facts that are stated in the referral of the Independent Counsel to that historical Constitutional standard. And if any facts rise to the level of impeachable conduct, that material would then be subjected to the thorough inquiry and review process. . . .
Under the resolution that we are putting forth, the committee will begin its work on the 12th day of October -- that's next Monday -- and will conclude all proceedings, including the consideration of recommendations during the month of December. There would then be ample time for the House of Representatives to consider those recommendations and conclude its work by the end of this year. The procedure we're recommending is fair. It is thorough. It is prompt. It is a recommendation for an inquiry. It would assure an appropriate scope. It would give deference to the historical Constitutional standard for impeachment and it would assure that this matter is put behind us so the nation can proceed with its very important business by the end of this year.
 
Representative Charles E. Schumer
Democrat of Brooklyn
Mr. Speaker, this is a serious and solemn day. And after a careful reading of the Starr report and other materials submitted by the Office of the Independent Counsel, as well as a study of the origins and history of the Impeachment Clause of the Constitution, I have come to the conclusion that given the evidence before us, while the President deserves significant punishment, there is no basis for impeachment of the President and it is time to move on and solve the problems facing the American people like health care, education and protecting seniors' retirement.
To me, Mr. Speaker, it is clear that the President lied when he testified before the grand jury, not to cover a crime, but to cover embarrassing personal behavior. While it is true that in ordinary circumstances and in most instances an ordinary person would not be punished for lying about an extramarital affair, the President has to be held to a higher standard and must be held accountable.
But high crimes and misdemeanors as defined in the Constitution and as amplified by the Federalist Papers and Justice Story, have always been intended to apply to public actions relating to or affecting the operation of the Government, not to personal or private conduct.
That said, the punishment for lying about an improper sexual relationship should fit the crime. Censure or rebuke is the appropriate punishment. Impeachment is not.
It is time to move forward and not have the Congress and American people endure the specter of what could be a yearlong focus on a tawdry but not impeachable affair. Today the world economy is in crisis and cries out for American leadership, without which worldwide turmoil is a grave possibility. The American people cry out for us to solve the problems facing them.
This investigation, now in its fifth year, has run its course. It is time to move on.
 
Representative Paul McHale
Democrat of Pennsylvania
I want my strong criticism of President Clinton to be placed in context. I voted for President Clinton in 1992 and 1996. I believed him to be the man from Hope as he was depicted in his 1992 campaign video. I have voted for more than three-fourths of the President's legislative agenda, and I would do so again.
My blunt criticism of the President has nothing to do with policy. Moreover, the President has always treated me with courtesy and respect, and he has been more than responsive to the concerns of my constituents.
Unfortunately, the President's misconduct has now made immaterial my past support or agreement with him on issues. Last Jan. 17 the President of the United States attempted to cover up a sordid and irresponsible relationship by repeated deceit under oath in a Federal civil rights suit.
Contrary to his later public statement, his answers were not legally accurate. They were intentionally and blatantly false. He allowed his lawyer to make arguments to the court based on an affidavit that the President knew to be false. The President later deceived the American people and belatedly admitted the truth only when confronted some seven months later by a mountain of irrefutable evidence.
I am convinced that the President would otherwise have allowed his false testimony to stand in perpetuity. . . .
The question is whether or not we will say to all of our citizens, including the President of the United States: When you take an oath, you must keep it. . . .
And if in disgust or dismay, we were to sweep aside the President's immoral and illegal conduct, what dangerous precedent would we set for the abuse of power by some future President of the United States?
We cannot define the President's character, but we must define the nation's. I urge an affirmative vote on the resolution.
 
Representative Robert Wexler
Democrat of Florida
God help this nation if today we become a Congress of endless investigation, accomplices to this un-American inquisition that would destroy the Presidency over an extramarital affair. The global economy is crumbling, and we're talking about Monica Lewinsky. Saddam Hussein hides weapons, and we're talking about Monica Lewinsky. Genocide racks Kosovo, and we're talking about Monica Lewinsky. Children cram into packed classrooms, and we're talking about Monica Lewinsky. Families can't pay their medical bills, and we're talking about Monica Lewinsky. God help this nation if we trivialize the Constitution of the United States and reject the conviction of our founding fathers that impeachment is about no less than the subversion of the government. The President betrayed his wife. He did not betray the country. God help this nation if we fail to recognize the difference.
 
Representative Asa Hutchinson
Republican of Arkansas
Today we are considering a resolution of inquiry in the conduct of the President of the United States. It is not about a person, but it is about the rule of law. Each of us took a simple oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States. The Constitution provides a path to follow in these circumstances, the path may not be well worn, but it is well marked, and we would be wise to follow it, rather than to concoct our own ideas on how to proceed.
The gentleman from New York indicated that, concluded that the President has lied under oath, that he should be punished but he should not be impeached. The gentleman is way ahead in his conclusion of where this process should be and where I am. I would say that this process is not about punishment. The purpose of this process is to examine the public trust and if it is breached, to repair it. We have been referred serious charges of perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse of power. The President and his lawyers have denied each of these charges as is his right to do. Our response should be that we need to examine these facts to determine the truth and to weigh the evidence, and it is our highest duty today to vote for this inquiry so that if the result is there are no impeachable offenses, we could move on. But if there is more to be done, then we can assure that the rule of law will not be suspended or ignored by this Congress.
The Watergate model was chosen because that was what was demanded by my friends from across the aisle. This resolution does not direct the committee to go into any additional areas, but it does give the committee the authority to carry out its responsibility and to bring this matter to a conclusion without further delay . . .
Did the President participate in a scheme to obstruct justice? Did the President commit perjury? Do these allegations, if proven, constitute impeachable offenses? We can answer these questions in a fair and bipartisan manner and that is my commitment. People say this is not Watergate. That's true. Every case is different. But the rule of law and our obligation to it does not change. They do not change because of position, personalities or power. The rule of law and justice depends upon this truth. I ask my colleagues to support the resolution.
 
Representative Zoe Lofgren
Democrat of California
Many of us have labored very hard to craft a plan that would allow us to deal with the referral of the independent counsel in a way that is focused, in a way that is fair, in a way that's prompt and efficient and most of all, in a way that puts our Constitution first.
I am very distressed to say that I do not see that that is going to happen today in these chambers. I fear that what Hamilton warned against, Alexander Hamilton warned against in 65 Federalist Paper, that there will always be the greatest danger that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of the parties than the real demonstration of innocence or guilt. That prophesy, that fear is about to be realized.
I believe that the majority has used its raw voting power to create a proposal that could result in a wide ranging and lengthy impeachment inquiry. The Judiciary Committee may become the standing committee on impeachments, and a further fear is that the rules in the Constitution may never be applied to the referral that has been sent to us. Or even worse, we may end up as happened Monday with the majority counsel creating entirely new rules for high crimes and misdemeanors, which will have a very serious distorting effect on our constitutional system of Government.
When we are lost, the best thing to do is to look to our Constitution as a beacon of light and a guideline to get us through trying times. Impeachment historically was to be used for when the misconduct of the executive was so severe that it threatened the very constitutional system of government itself. Ben Franklin described it as the alternative to assassination.
It is that standard that needs to be applied in this case. The question is not whether the President's misconduct was bad. We all know that the President's misconduct was bad. The question is, Are we going to punish America instead of him for his misconduct?
 
Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
Republican of Florida
Our laws promise a remedy against sexual harassment. But if we say that lying about sex in court is acceptable or even expected, then we have made our sexual harassment laws nothing more than a false promise, a fraud upon our society, upon our legal system and upon women.
Lying under oath and obstruction of justice are ancient crimes of great weight because they shield other offenses, blocking the light of truth in human affairs. They are a dagger in the heart of our legal system and our democracy. They cannot and must not be tolerated. The office of the Presidency is due great respect, but the President is a citizen with the same duty to follow the laws as all other citizens. The world marvels that our President is not above the law, and my vote today helps assure that this rule continues.
 
Representative Bill McCollum
Republican of Florida
The question for us today is not whether or not the President committed impeachable offenses or whether or not we're here to impeach. The question is, Do the allegations that have been presented to us by Kenneth Starr and his report merit further consideration?
Some would have you believe today that even if all of those allegations were proven to be true that the answer is 'no.' They're wrong. The issue before us when we consider this matter is not Monica Lewinsky. The issue is not sex, the issue is not whether the President committed adultery or betrayed his wife.
The issue is, Did the President of the United States commit the felony crime of perjury by lying under oath in a deposition in a sexual harassment case? The issue is, Did the President of the United States commit the felony crime of perjury by lying under oath to a grand jury? The issue is, Did the President of the United States commit a felony crime of obstructing justice or the felony crime of witness tampering? And if he did, are these high crimes and misdemeanors that deserve impeachment? . . .
If he is judged to have committed a high crime and misdemeanor for committing these other crimes of perjury, we will have determined that indeed he is no longer the legal officer at the highest pinnacle of this country. Because to leave him sitting there is to undermine the very judicial system we have. It is to convey the message that perjury is O.K. Certainly at least perjury in certain matters and under certain circumstances.
It is not O.K. It is a very serious crime. Obstructing justice is, witness tampering is . . .
What do we say in the future to all of those people who take the oath of office who say, I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth . . . If we leave this President alone, if he committed these crimes, then we have undermined our Constitution and we have undermined our system of justice.
 
Representative Bob Barr
Republican of Georgia
The step we are taking today is one I first urged nearly a year ago. All we are doing today is taking the constitutionally equivalent step of impaneling a grand jury to inquire into whether or not the evidence shall sustain that offenses have, in fact, occurred.
The passage of H.Res. 581 will mark the dawn of a new era in American Government. We are sending the American people a clear message that truth is more important than partisanship and that the Constitution cannot be sacrificed on the altar of political expediency, that no longer will we turn a blind eye to clear evidence of obstruction of justice, perjury and abuse of power.
We will be sending a message to this and all future Presidents that if, in fact, the evidence establishes that you or any future President have committed perjury, obstruction of justice, subversion of our judicial system, then we will be saying, No, sir, Mr. President, these things you cannot do.
It is our job as legislators to diagnose threats to our democracy and eliminate them. By the time the damage to our system is so great that everyone can see it, the wounds will be too deep to heal. We have already waited too long to address this issue. We must move forward quickly, courageously, fairly and most importantly, constitutionally along the one and the one and only path charted for us in the Constitution: the impeachment process.
We must do this, Mr. Speaker, so that tomorrow morning, as we in this chamber, as teachers all across America lead their students in the Pledge of Allegiance, we can look America in the eye and say, Yes, at least for today, the Constitution is alive and well.
 
Representative Maxine Waters
Democrat of California
The decision of the Republicans to limit the debate on this very important resolution to decide whether this body will move with an inquiry to impeach is a continuation of the partisan, unfair, inconsiderate actions that have dictated the management of this impeachment crisis since independent counsel Ken Starr dumped his referral in the laps of this Congress and in the laps of the public. This continuous, shameless and reckless disregard for the Constitution, basic civil rights and the citizens of this country cannot be tolerated.
This is a sad and painful time for all of us. The least we can do is handle this matter with dignity and fairness for everyone involved. Four and one-half years, $40 million, unnecessary subpoenas of uninvolved individuals and Mr. Starr's close relationships with groups and individuals with demonstrated hatred for the President taints the independent counsel's investigation. This Congress does not need a protracted, open-ended witch hunt of intimidation, embarrassment and harassment.
The tawdry and trashy thousands of pages of hearsay, accusations, gossips and stupid telephone chatter does not meet the standard of high crimes and misdemeanors.
The President's actions in this matter are disappointing and unacceptable but not impeachable.
Mr. Schippers, the general counsel for the Republicans, extended the allegations in search of something, anything, that may meet the Constitutional standards. Even the extended and added allegations do not comport with the Constitution.
It's time to move on. Reprimand the President. Condemn him. But let's move on. These grossly unfair procedures will only tear this Congress and this nation apart. . . .
Let us be wise enough to move forward and spend our precious time working on the issues of education, health care, senior citizens, children and in the final analysis, Mr. Speaker and ministers, justice and opportunity for all Americans.
 
Representative Bob Inglis
Republican of South Carolina
Of course, we do want to move along to important issues facing the country. We do want to restore freedom and health care. We do want to secure the future of Medicare and Social Security. And we do want to continue the progress toward balancing the budget. All of those things we want to do.
But I would ask my colleagues to consider this: Really, this is the crucial business of the country. This is the crucial business.
As we go into the next century, the question is, Does the truth even matter?
Now, some would say, Let's just move along. It doesn't matter. Just move along.
But if you move along, what you're leaving aside is serious allegations of serious crimes.
 
Representative Chet Edwards
Democrat of Texas
I'm deeply disappointed that the Republican leadership has placed an incredibly unfair gag rule on a constitutional debate of historic proportions. If this gag rule is the first test of the Republicans' fairness in this inquiry, they have failed that test.
The most important issue today, Mr. Speaker, before us is not the Nov. 3 elections or even the fate of President Clinton. The most important issue before us is the historical precedent we set in beginning the process of undoing an election for the most important office of our land.
The right to vote is the foundation of our entire democracy. To override the votes of millions of Americans in a Presidential election is an extraordinary action. It is a radical action. And, in effect, it is allowing the votes of 535 citizens to override the votes of tens of millions of citizens.
In its rush to begin an impeachment inquiry, just days before a crucial election, this Congress will have lowered the threshold for future Presidential impeachment inquiries in such a way that compromises the independence of the Presidency as a co-equal branch of Government.
 
Representative Dennis J. Kucinich
Democrat of Ohio
I rise today, not on behalf of Democrats or Republicans but as an American who is deeply concerned that our country bring closure to the charges against the President.
A vote for an inquiry is not the same as a vote for impeachment. This vote is neither a vote to impeach nor a license to conduct a partisan witch hunt . . .
I believe there will be no resolution without an open hearing. And there will be no accountability without an open hearing. And there will be no closure for this country, for this Congress or for our President without an open hearing. . . .
The American people expect it to proceed fairly, expeditiously and then they expect it to end. The people want us to get this over with. And they will be watching.
Let the President make his case. Give him a chance to clear his name and get back to his job. Bring everything out in the open. Bring forward the accusers and subject them to the light of day.
Settle this and then move forward to do the business of the people, the business for which the people elected us: To further economic growth, to protect Social Security, to improve health care and to meet all the other pressing needs of the American people.
 
Representative Charles B. Rangel
Democrat of Manhattan
My colleagues, I had the privilege of serving on the Watergate Judiciary Committee. And one difference then, as opposed to now, is that we worked together as Republicans and Democrats to search for the facts and report to the House of Representatives for them to make a determination.
Now we don't have any question of trying to impeach the President of the United States or protecting the integrity of the Congress or the Constitution.
The Republicans don't want to impeach and wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot political pole. They know at the end of this year that this Congress is over.
And they even want to carry this over for the next two years to attempt to hound this President, who's been elected twice, out of office. And the reason for it is because it's the only thing that they have to take to the American people before this election.
What else are they going to take? Their legislative record?
You know, the fact that you have re-named National Airport after Ronald Reagan. You have deep-sixed the tax code to the year 2002.
On the question of Social Security, what have you done? Tried to rape the reserve.
What have you done as it relates to minimum wage and providing jobs? What have you done for education? What have you done for the health of the people of this nation?
Well, you're not just going to get elected by hounding the President of the United States because as you judge the President of the United States the voters will be judging you on Nov. 3.
 
Representative Lamar Smith
Republican of Texas
Others continue to argue or continue to imply that this inquiry is only about a personal relationship. But that's like saying Watergate was only about picking a lock or that the Boston Tea Party is only about tea. During a similar investigation of President Nixon 24 years ago, there was little focus on the burglary. The Judiciary Committee and the Special Prosecutor rightly wanted to know as we should today, whether the President lied to the American people, obstructed justice, or abused his office.
While some try to describe this scandal as private, the President's own Attorney General found that there existed credible evidence of criminal wrongdoing. This is not a decision to go forward with an inquiry into a personal relationship. It is about examining the most public of relationships between a witness and the courts, between the President and the American people. It is about respect for the law, respect for the office of the presidency, respect for the American people, respect for the officers of the court. Respect for women and ultimately about self-respect.
 
Representative Nancy Pelosi
Democrat of California
I rise in opposition to the Hyde Resolution and in doing so point out the inconsistency of the Republican majority. At the start of this Congress the Republican majority gave you, Mr. Speaker, the highest honor this House can bestow, the Speakership. For the freshmen Republicans this was the first vote that they cast in this House. The Republican majority did this after you, Mr. Speaker, were charged with and admitted to lying under oath to the Ethics Committee about the conduct of your political affairs.
How inconsistent then, Mr. Speaker, for this same Republican majority to move to an impeachment inquiry of the President for lying about his personal life. Our Republican majority have said lying under oath is a dagger in the heart of the legal system. We all agree that lying is wrong. But why the double standard? I urge my colleagues to reject this Republican double standard which exalts the Speaker and moves to impeach the President. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Hyde Resolution.
 
Representative Lloyd Doggett
Democrat of Texas
The real question here today is not whether to begin an inquiry, but whether it will ever end. Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate, it's really rabbit trail-gate that I'm concerned about. We do not need Ken Starr squared in this chamber. The only way to force this Congress to get back to the real concerns of American families like tax reform and Social Security reform is to bring this matter to a prompt conclusion.
As a former Supreme Court Justice, I will not defend the indefensible, but, by golly, there is a way to punish the lying without punishing the American people who have clearly had enough of this and then some. . . . The Democratic amendment assures that that will happen.
 
Representative Vito J. Fossella
Republican of Staten Island
Earlier today one of my colleagues said that this would be the most divisive issue . . . since the Vietnam War. And while he may believe that to be true, I take strong exception with that and I'll tell you why. Men and women were sent overseas like every war and military conflict since our nation's birth to defend the rule of law, the notions of personal freedom and individual liberty. And in the case before us today we're asking a simple question, did the President of the United States violate any of those rules of law that we cherish and that so many men and women have died for and are willing to die for at every point around the globe.
 
Representative John Conyers Jr.
Senior Democrat on Judiciary Committee
Gerald Ford has said that we must take the path back to dignity; and I want that to weigh on your hearts for this next hour, because more is at stake than the President's fate.
Moving with dispatch, Gerald Ford said, the House Judiciary Committee should be able to conclude a preliminary inquiry into possible grounds for impeachment before the end of the year.
I think that we can do it. Our resolution calls for it. I've talked incessantly in private meetings with Chairman Hyde toward this end. And I hope that all of us will commit ourselves to that goal.
I . . . just want you to know that in my view, the American people have a deep sense of right and wrong, of fairness and privacy. And I believe that the Kenneth W. Starr investigation may have offended those sensibilities. Who are we in the Congress and what is it that we stand for? . . .
Do we want to have prosecutors with unlimited powers, accountable to no one, who will spend millions of dollars investigating a person's sex life? Is that the precedent we're setting? Who then haul them before grand juries -- every person that they've known . . . of the opposite sex, a person that they had contact with, and then record and release videos to the public of the grand jury questioning the most private aspects of one's personal life? Please, I beg you not to denigrate this very important process in Article II, Section 4.
 
 Representative Barney Frank
Democrat of Massachusetts
Someone inaccurately -- well-intended, but inaccurately -- said the Democrats were agreeing there should be an inquiry. No. Let me define what we say. We accept the fact that the statutorially designated independent counsel sent us a referral and we are obligated to look at it.
But what our resolution says is, let's first look at what he has alleged, and assuming that it is true, decide whether or not those things are impeachable. There's a very real question. If you look at the dismissal of the charge that Richard Nixon didn't pay his income tax, because it was a personal matter, that would suggest some of these are not impeachable. If you get to the question of lying -- in fact, both the Speaker and I have been reprimanded by this House for lying before official proceedings. That has not kept either of us from continuing to do our duty to our best possible.
We will have to look at whether or not these are impeachable issues, but the question is, do we look at those or do we look at a whole range of other things? And I think my Republican colleagues fear that there is not enough in those accusations to meet the impeachment standard, and that's why they refuse and refuse and refuse to limit it, not to get into the -- not just a fishing expedition, but the deep-sea fishing expedition of Whitewater and the other matters.
And scope affects time. It is because they are holding out the hope that something will turn up, after four years, about Whitewater and the F.B.I. files and the Travel Office and all of these other accusations that have to date proven to be dry holes for those trying to get Bill Clinton, they want to not limit the time because they need to keep it open.
But here's what that means in terms of time. Under our resolution, which calls for a Dec. 31 deadline, we would begin work right away on our time. This Congress is about to adjourn. And on our time, which would otherwise be not dealing with the public's business, we're ready to get into it. Under their resolution, let me make it very clear to you, they have no real plans to do anything during October. We've read about that. They're not going to start till after the election; they're not going to start till two months after we got Kenneth Starr's report because they think it won't play out well in the election.
So vote for their resolution and you will find that the American people's time will be taken up again next year. We're ready to do it now on our time and get it out of the way. They are asking you to give them a mandate to stretch it out, wait till after the election, and let it dominate next year, to our detriment, just as it has so far.
 
Representative James E. Rogan
Republican of California
I want to say, as a Republican, that as we begin this procedure, I start with the presumption that the President is deemed innocent of any allegation of wrongdoing unless and until the contrary is shown. And every reasonable inference that can be given to the President must be given to the President.
It's unfortunate that some of today's rhetoric would suggest that this resolution seeks nothing more than to have carte blanche opportunity for Congress to inquire into the President's personal life style. Nothing could be further from the truth. However, it is our purpose, it is our legal obligation to review any President's potentially constitutional misconduct within the framework of the Constitution and the rule of law.
When serious and credible allegations have been raised against any President, the Constitution obliges us to determine whether such conduct violated that President's obligation to faithfully execute the law. We must make this determination, or else forever sacrifice our heritage that no person is above the law. This Congress must decide whether we as a nation will turn a blind eye to allegations respecting both the subversion of the courts and the search for truth.
Mr. Speaker, I fear for my country when conduct such as perjury and obstruction of justice is no longer viewed with opprobrium but instead is viewed as a sign of legal finesse or personal sophistication. This House has an obligation to embrace the words of one of our predecessors, Abraham Lincoln, who called on every American lover of liberty not to violate the rule of law nor show toleration for those who do.
Mr. Speaker, there's a difference between knowing the truth and doing the truth. We have an obligation to both. And we have that obligation despite whatever personal or political discomfort it might bring. For as Justice Holmes once said, "If justice requires the truth to be known, the difficulty in knowing it is no excuse not to try."
Let our body be faithful to this search, and in doing so we will be faithful both to our founders and to our heirs.
 
Representative David E. Bonior
Minority whip
We gather today to make a serious decision. What the President did is wrong. And he should be held accountable.
Today, we have an obligation to proceed in a manner that is fair, that upholds our constitutional duties and allows us to get this matter over with so we can get on with the business of the American people.
Unfortunately, the Republican proposal meets none of these standards. It is unfair; it is unlimited and it prolongs this process indefinitely. Under the Republican plan, Congress will spend the next two years mired in hearings, tangled in testimony and grinding its gears in partisan stalemate. And today is just another example of that partisanship, that unbridled partisanship.
There are 435 members that serve in this body, more on the floor today than I've seen in a long time, representing each about a half a million people. And what has happened in this proceeding today? Two hours of debate. Two hours. Members having to go and beg for 20 seconds to talk to their constituency about one of the most important votes they will ever have to cast.
Mr. Speaker, you just said it a few minutes ago, that this is one of the most important debates that we will have. Why are hundreds of members of this body being denied the opportunity to express themselves? This is a charade of justice. The American people, through this truncated debate, are being railroaded. Today's proceedings are a hit and run.
The Republican leadership's long-term strategy is very, very clear. Drag this thing out, week after week; month after month and, yes, year after year, not for the good of the country, but for their own partisan advantage.
The Democratic amendment guarantees that any inquiry will be fair, that it will be limited and that we will complete our work by the end of the year.
Mr. Speaker, the American people already have had all the sordid details they need, more than they ever wanted. Do we really want two more years of Monica Lewinsky? Two more years of Linda Tripp? Two more years of parents having to mute their TV sets so they could watch the 6 o'clock news? We in this chamber have the power to stop this daily mudslide into the nation's living rooms.
If the Republicans spend two years dragging this investigation out, when will they deal with education? If you spend two years dragging this investigation out, when will you deal with H.M.O. reform? If you spend two years dragging this investigation out, when will you strengthen Social Security?
I urge my colleagues, let us put a limit, a limit on this investigation. Let's end it this year. This year. Let's get back to working for our children and our families and for our communities.
 
Representative Henry J. Hyde
Judiciary Committee chairman
I'm very sorry that you feel you were shortchanged on the debate. As you know, under the rule, and under the Rodino format, you were entitled to one hour. We doubled that. I didn't think that was fair. But we could have gone on and on and much of the same thing said over and over again. But it would be too much for me to expect appreciation for doubling the time, but the hostility ----.
Let me suggest to you who think this is going to go on, like Tennyson's brook, just on and on and on, the 22d Amendment to the Constitution says the Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meetings shall begin at noon on the third day of January. We're out of business at the end of the year. Our money runs out. And if we're to continue, if there's anything to continue, we would have to reconstitute ourself. I don't want this to go one day longer than it has to. Believe me, this is very painful, and I want it ended. We're not going to go on and on and on.
But Mr. Rodino faced up to the problem of time limits, and here's what he said. And why do you reject Mr. Rodino, time and again, in all of these issues? He's our model. He's the one we're following. And here's what he said:
"The chairman recognizes, as the committee does, that to be locked into such a date would be totally irresponsible and unwise. The committee would be in no position to state at this time whether our inquiry would be completed, would be thorough, so that we can make a fair and responsible judgment." . . .
As far as standards are concerned, something that you have repeatedly brought up, let me quote from the wonderful report by the Rodino committee concerning the Nixon impeachment, on the question of standards. Listen to Mr. Rodino:
"Similarly, the House does not engage in abstract, advisory or hypothetical debates about the precise nature of conduct that calls for the exercise of its constitutional powers. Rather it must await full development of the facts and understanding of the events to which those facts relate." That's what we want to do, develop the facts through an inquiry.
On with Mr. Rodino: "This memorandum offers no fixed standards for determining whether grounds for impeachment exist. The framers did not write a fixed standard. Instead, they adopted from English history a standard sufficiently general and flexible to meet future circumstances and events."
Thus spake Peter Rodino, and that is our model for this adventure, this excursion, this journey that we're on.
Now look, this is not about sexual misconduct any more than Watergate was about a third-rate burglary. It was about the reaction of the chief executive to that event. Nixon covered it up and got in the direst of trouble. The problem with President Clinton's situation is a reaction, which -- we believe and we want to find out, and if we don't get the information, we'll reject it -- caused him to lie under oath.
Now, lying under oath is either important, or it isn't. If some people can lie under oath and others can't, let's find out. If some subjects are "lie-able" -- that is, you can lie about them -- and others are not, let's fine-tune our jurisprudence that way. But if the same law applies to everybody equally, that's the American tradition. And that's what we're looking at.
This has not anything to do with sex; it has a lot to do with suborning perjury, tampering with witnesses, obstructing justice and perjury, all of which impact on our Constitution and our system of justice and the kind of country we are.
The President of the United States is the trustee of the nation's conscience. We are entitled to explore fairly, fully and expeditiously the circumstances that have been alleged to compromise that position. We'll do it quickly. We'll do it fairly. We want to get this behind our -- behind us and behind the country and move on. But it's our duty. It's an onerous, miserable, rotten duty, but we have to do it, or we break faith with the people who sent us here.
 
Representative Richard Gephardt
Minority leader
Mr. Speaker and members of the House, it's almost a month to the day that we stood here and debated whether or not to release the materials that Ken Starr had sent to the Congress. And I tried to say at that time that this was a time of utmost importance to us as a House of Representatives and to all of us as a people.
I said then, and I repeat today, that we are engaged now in what I believe to be a sacred process. We are considering whether or not to ultimately, if we get that far, overturn an election voted on by millions of Americans to decide who should be the chief executive officer of this country. . . .
I said the other day that this is a time to be bigger than we really are. We're all human. We all make mistakes. We all give in to pettiness and pride. We all give in to doing things wrong for the wrong reasons. But this is a time when our Constitution and our people ask each of us to reach inside of ourselves, to be bigger and better than we really are.
In my view, we shouldn't have two resolutions, or a resolution and amendment, out here today. I believe if we had succeeded in what we should be doing, we would have one resolution, agreed to by all 435 members, today. The question, you see, is not whether to have an inquiry. The question today is what kind of inquiry will this be?
Our amendment is simple and I think it's common sense. First, it says it must be focused. We operate under a statute that we passed, from the independent counsel, that said there could be referrals from the independent counsel on possible issues of impeachment, and we should take that up. And that's what's before us. Our resolution says stick with those referrals. . . .
Second, it must be fair. Last time we had Watergate, the committee spent a good deal of time considering the standards and the history of impeachment so that all the members of the committee and on the floor would understand the historic process that we're involved in. None of us do this very often; we don't think about this very often. So it's vital and important that we all know what it is we're doing, and whether or not the facts that are out there rise as a prima facie case. That has not been done in this case.
Third time, we say let's get it over by December the 31st, before the new Congress comes into session. Why do we say that? We say that because we believe deeply that for the good of the country and the good of our people, this must be done by the end of this year, before there's a new Congress.
And why do we say that? We say it because we live in a dangerous world; the world economy is in a shambles, our own economy is threatened. Issues like education and health care and economics need to be on the front burner of this Congress. That's what we must be working on. If we stay here for 3, 6, 9, 12 months, two years in suspended animation, while we go over every charge that's out there, we will hurt our country and our people and our children.
Now, Mr. Hyde has said, and I believe Mr. Hyde, that we should do this by the end of the year. But he also said New Year's promises sometimes get broken.
Mr. Hyde has said that we should not be on a fishing expedition. But others in the party I've heard, even leaders in the party, the Republican Party, have said, "Well, we've got to look at Travelgate; and we've got to look at Filegate; and we've got to look at campaign finance, and we've got to look at the Chinese rocket sales." And you say it again.
I've really thought a lot about this. I've really thought a lot about it. I've tried to think to myself, What is our problem? And I think I've identified it. Our problem is we don't trust one another.
 
Representative Charles T. Canady
Republican of Florida
As we consider the motion to recommit, I would ask that the members of the House on both sides of the aisle step back and consider the fact that what is proposed in the motion to recommit is without any precedent.
There is no case in the 200-year history of the impeachment process in this country in which a process similar to the process which is proposed here has been followed -- none at all. And I believe that's something that we should take very seriously.
I believe we also have to be aware that if we adopt the motion to recommit, we are setting a precedent today, and I believe it would be a terrible precedent, a precedent that would be fraught with the potential for harm stretching far into the future of our country.
Now consider the process that this motion sets up. First we are required to assume the truth of allegations which the President and his lawyers vigorously deny. I don't think that's the right thing to do. We should find out what the truth is. But while we're following this process, we put aside the weighing and the balancing of the facts and the judging of the credibility of witnesses.
Having put aside our duty to weigh the facts and find the truth, we are then called on to make a solemn determination concerning whether impeachable offenses were committed, if the assumed facts, which are denied by the President, are at some later point determined to be true.
This simply does not make sense. It will only cause delay. It has never been done before, and it shouldn't be done now. . . . We should support the resolution recommended by the Judiciary Committee.

ZIFF-DAVIS TO SHUT 3 MAGAZINES AND CUT 350 JOBS

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

 BODY:
Ziff-Davis Inc., a major publisher of computing magazines, said yesterday that it would discontinue three publications and cut 350 jobs, or 10 percent of its United States work force. The New York-based company will stop publishing Internet Business, Equip and Windows Pro. Instead it will focus on stronger products like PC Magazine, PC Week, the Comdex trade show and its ZDNet technology Web site. Costs associated with the restructuring will lower fourth-quarter earnings by $50 million to $60 million, before taxes, the company said. Shares of Ziff-Davis fell 28 percent, falling $1.6875 each, to $4.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: THE TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: THE SCENE -- CAPITOL SKETCHBOOK;
In Partisan Debate, the Sublime and the Surreal

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
Only in America could the House debate authorizing an impeachment investigation of President Clinton juxtapose quotations of the founding fathers with those of the wayward daughter Monica S. Lewinsky.
"No one ever asked me to lie!" Ms. Lewinsky's grand jury testimony rang out in the debating chamber, read loudly by a Clinton supporter in a warning of woeful things to come as Republicans pushed through their resolution for an open-ended impeachment investigation. 
 There was a hush of exasperation in some corners of the House at the very mention of the name of Ms. Lewinsky, the former White House intern whom, even before the vote, Republicans were vowing to call to Capitol Hill to re-tell her tale of an intimate affair with the President and their failed cover-up.
"Do we really want two more years of Monica Lewinsky?" asked David E. Bonior of Michigan, the Democratic whip, drawing instant groans from his partisans as he excoriated "this daily mudslide into the nation's living rooms."
"Two more years of Linda Tripp?" he asked and, even in the citizens' gallery, up above the agonizing Democrats and the triumphant Republicans, a few head-shaking "no's" could be seen.
"The American people don't want this," Joy Fugazi, a tourist from Lexington, Ky., fervidly insisted minutes later outside the gallery, still mesmerized by the wide-eyed spectacle of self-government she and the nation had just witnessed -- the House of Representatives targeting the President himself for investigation and possible removal from office.
"Ben Franklin described it as an alternative to assassination," Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat, said ominously even as Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida, exulted: "The world marvels that our President is not above the law!"
Republicans stressed that it was Mr. Clinton himself who put the Democrats in their predicament of having to denounce his behavior even as they argued that it does not merit impeachment.
"The President is the trustee of the nation's conscience," said Henry J. Hyde, the Illinois Republican who led the debate as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.
Lawyerly citations abounded amid the partisan cut-and-thrust. Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican dedicated for more than a year to the President's impeachment, sounded gleeful in citing "no less a constitutional scholar than William Jefferson Clinton" as having argued as a law professor in the Watergate era that any "willful reckless behavior in office" was impeachable.
It was a rugged, at times scathing, two hours of debate, with Democrats emboldened to upbraid Speaker Newt Gingrich, up in the chair presiding. Last year he was reprimanded and treated far more gently by House Republicans for his own ethical transgressions, Democrats complained, in comparison to the trauma Mr. Clinton faces in the looming struggle.
"Reject this double Republican standard which exalts the Speaker and moves to impeach the President," said Nancy Pelosi of California, drawing cheers from the Democrats.
"Who has not sinned?" came the cry at one point as the Democrats argued that the issue was more about sex than perjury.
"Regular order!" responded the Republicans, demanding a tight gavel and driving the impeachment motion to a vote. The tally included 31 Democrats wary of facing the voters next month without some cover after the Democratic alternative for a limited impeachment inquiry had failed.
"Beware the wrath of the American public!" growled John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, glaring at the Republicans.
Off the floor, Lindsey O. Graham, a South Carolina Republican on the Judiciary Committee, easily conceded, "Yeah, we've all got a tiger by the tail." But he added that only a full factual investigation, not some mere rubber stamping of the allegations of the Office of the Independent Counsel, can certify the inquiry as fair in the eyes of future generations.
The debate at least established that there is no longer much argument left in the Republicans about whether President Richard M. Nixon was, after all, guilty. One Republican warned that failing to confront Mr. Clinton for lying under oath "will be a return to the imperial Presidency of the Nixon era, where the White House felt that the laws did not apply to them."
Underlying the debate, the mood was almost casual on the Republican sidelines, with predictions offered that charges of impeachment will surely be voted next year. "I think it's headed to the Senate," said Senator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican who wandered over to the House in a mood of quiet expectation.
The Democrats, even as they voted for a limited inquiry, could only warn about the public's intolerance of further doses of Ms. Lewinsky, uttering her name as if it were a imprecation and envisioning torpid weeks of the civic agenda filled with her "stupid telephone chatter."
"The global economy is crumbling and we're talking about Monica Lewinsky!" keened Robert Wexler, a Florida Democrat.
Attempting belittlement, James A. Traficant Jr., Democrat of Ohio, tailored the great Watergate question to Mr. Clinton's Lewinsky affair. But Mr. Traficant touched off one of the few bipartisan touches of the debate, general laughter, as his surreal query hung in the air: "What did the President do with an intern, and when did he know that he did it?"

HEADLINE: THE TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: THE OVERVIEW;
HOUSE, IN A PARTISAN 258-176 VOTE, APPROVES A BROAD, OPEN-ENDED IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
After a civil if sometimes harshly phrased debate that lasted more than three hours, the House of Representatives voted largely along party lines this afternoon to begin a full-scale, open-ended inquiry into possible grounds for the impeachment of President Clinton.
The inquiry, which could lead to another House vote to decide whether Mr. Clinton should stand trial in the Senate, was authorized by a vote of 258 to 176, with 31 Democrats breaking ranks with the President. Some at the White House had feared wholesale defections. Roll-calls, page A22. 
 They did not materialize, and from that Mr. Clinton could snatch some shred of consolation, but today's developments nonetheless deepened the crisis shrouding his Presidency.
It was only the third time in the Republic's 222-year history that the House had voted such a step, and the founding fathers, the Constitution and the long shadow of precedent were cited by both sides as the debate unfolded.
Democratic representatives complained bitterly that today's proceeding was unfair because they were given too little time to speak, and Joe Lockhart, Mr. Clinton's spokesman, said the whole process had been "injected with politics."
But Mr. Clinton himself was less confrontational. At a late-afternoon photo session, he said of his fate: "It is not in my hands. It is in the hands of Congress and the people of this country -- ultimately in the hands of God. There is nothing I can do."
After imploring his fellow members to pay heed to "that still, small voice that whispers in our ear, 'duty, duty, duty,' " Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, opened the debate by reminding everyone, "Today, we don't make any judgments. We don't make any charges. We simply begin the search for truth." Excerpts, pages A23-24.
What lies ahead, he added later, "is an onerous, miserable, rotten job."
Speaking for the Democrats, the House minority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, said that President Clinton had "deeply disappointed the American people," and that "he's let us all down."
But Congress "must not compound the hurt," Mr. Gephardt said, urging his colleagues to opt for a shorter, narrower investigative process so the American Government could deal with the economic and political problems of "a dangerous world."
Otherwise, Mr. Gephardt said, the country may spend "3, 6, 9, 12 months, two years, in suspended animation."
His colleague in the Democratic leadership, Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, raised the specter of a Congress "mired in hearings, tangled in testimony and grinding its gears in partisan stalemate."
Congress is expected to recess this weekend for the next three weeks. During that time, the Judiciary Committee and its staff will decide a number of strategic questions, like whether to call Mr. Clinton and Monica S. Lewinsky as witnesses. After the midterm elections on Nov. 3, Mr. Hyde said, the hearings will begin.
The elections will send a political signal to Capitol Hill. According to opinion surveys, the public wants Congress to put the Clinton controversy behind it. But if the Republicans should gain 4 to 6 seats in the Senate and 6 to 10 seats in the House, as electoral analysts think possible, that might give a strong new impetus to the investigation of the accusations against Mr. Clinton by the independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr.
Mr. Clinton has only seven states on his campaign schedule so far, an indication of his diminished influence as a leader of his party.
Some Democrats who voted today with the Republicans clearly did so because they were locked in close election races and feared seeming blindly supportive of the President. Among them were Representatives Leonard L. Boswell of Iowa, Jim Maloney of Connecticut and Ellen O. Tauscher of California.
Others were conservative Southern Democrats, like Representatives Charles W. Stenholm of Texas, Robert E. (Bud) Cramer of Alabama and Gene Taylor of Mississippi. Some of them face difficult re-election fights, as well.
No votes were necessarily indicative of how members will vote when the House comes to consider articles of impeachment. Indeed, that question may not even come before the House as now constituted. It goes out of existence on Jan. 3, 1999, to be replaced by the new body that is to be elected next month.
Mr. Hyde said again today that he hoped to finish the House's work by year-end, but he has always been careful not to make any promises.
Only one Democrat, Representative Paul McHale of Pennsylvania, spoke on the floor in explicit support of the Republican resolution. The first Congressional Democrat to call for President Clinton's resignation, Mr. McHale cited Franklin D. Roosevelt's maxim that "the Presidency is primarily a place of moral leadership." Mr. Clinton, he said, had repeatedly lied and would still be lying had he not been confronted "by a mountain of irrefutable evidence."
Challenging the President's statement that his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was "inappropriate," Mr. McHale said it was in fact "predatory, reckless and breathtakingly arrogant for a man already a defendant in a sexual harassment suit."
Two Floridians summed up the sharply differing arguments of the two sides.
Representative Charles T. Canady, a Republican from Lakeland, said that any conduct by a President that "undercuts the integrity of office" constitutes an impeachable offense. Then he asked: "If perjury and obstruction of justice do not undermine the integrity of office, what offense would?"
Speaking next, Representative Robert Wexler, a Democrat from Boca Raton, said Congress needed to talk about Kosovo and Saddam Hussein and overcrowded classrooms and the "crumbling" global economy, not Monica Lewinsky.
"The President betrayed his wife," Mr. Wexler said. "He did not betray the country. God help this nation if we fail to recognize the difference."
In fact, no one spoke in defense of Mr. Clinton's sexual conduct.
But some Democrats, notably members of the Black Caucus, who have been among the President's staunchest advocates from the start, spoke passionately against the Republicans' investigatory methods and proposals.
Representative Maxine Waters of California denounced the release of "tawdry and trashy thousands of pages of hearsay, accusations, gossip and telephone chatter" that came nowhere close, she said, to proving impeachable offenses. Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, deploying his characteristic growl, warned the Republicans that they would not win the November election "by hounding the President."
And Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a hero of the civil rights movement of the 1960's, accused the Republicans of trying to defeat Mr. Clinton through impeachment because they had failed to do so at the ballot box.
"The American people are watching," Mr. Lewis said angrily, his voice rising to a shout. "Beware the wrath of the American people, Mr. Speaker. Beware!"
But black members were not the only hard-hitters. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California attacked Republicans for seeking to impeach Mr. Clinton after allowing the Speaker, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, to survive with a mere reprimand for giving false information to the ethics committee.
During most of the debate, the House chamber was about a quarter full, with perhaps 110 members present at any one time. That is more than attend routine debates, but surprisingly few, considering the momentousness of the occasion. Staff members milled in the aisles, chattering, and Mr. Gingrich, who was presiding, several times appealed for order and asked people to sit down.
Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, intervened to suggest that leaders of both parties "send out messages to the members that whatever they're doing they ought to drop it and get their tails in here."
Decorum never quite collapsed, but there was whistling and cheering, as well as applause, after some speakers finished their presentations. Among those in the galleries were the country singer Charley Pride and former Representative Tom Railsback, an Illinois Republican who played a central role on the Judiciary Committee when it recommended the impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon.
That inquiry was begun in a considerably more bipartisan spirit than today's. The vote at that time, in February 1974, was 410 to 4.
Although Republicans allotted to the Democrats twice as much time as they would normally have been allowed under House rules -- an hour that in the event stretched to an hour and a half and more -- they complained furiously about many of their number being denied time on the floor (and on television).
To squeeze in as many people as possible, Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, gave some as little as 20 seconds.
A stream of invective poured for hours from Democratic orators' mouths. The debate was described as "a travesty"; the "beginning of an evidentiary farce"; "a stampede to justice"; "an extended soap opera"; "a kangaroo court"; a "gag-rule joke" and as "this charade."
Quoting Laurence Tribe, the Harvard constitutional scholar, Representative Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island said Congress was "twisting impeachment into something else" and setting a precedent for driving future Presidents from office for private conduct. Representative Peter Deutsch of Florida said that under their rules the Republicans "could impeach a ham sandwich."
Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts said that the Republicans were about to embark not merely on a fishing expedition but a "deep-sea fishing expedition"; neither he nor other Democrats seemed ready to accept Mr. Hyde's assurances that he had no intention of letting the investigation go on and on "like Tennyson's brook."
A Democratic alternative to the resolution would have halted the investigation on Dec. 31 unless the House authorized an extension; in any event, the new House will have to reauthorize the inquiry if it runs past Jan. 3, so the argument on time was mostly symbolic and profoundly partisan.
Representative Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said after the debate that today would mark "the end of the noise and shouting."
But his Judiciary Committee colleague Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, had more doubts. Like others, Ms. Lofgren cited Federalist 65, in which Alexander Hamilton warned that where impeachment is concerned, "there will always be the greatest danger that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt."

Merrill Lynch Incentives

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Merrill Lynch & Co. will get almost $20 million in economic incentives from New Jersey in return for a commitment to build new offices and keep thousands of jobs in the state.
New Jersey will give Merrill an $8.3 million sales tax break, and grants of $8.3 million for job creation and $3 million for training. Merrill will send 3,000 employees from other offices in New Jersey and 500 from Pennsylvania to a new complex it plans to build in Hopewell Township. 
 Merrill, which is based in New York, wants to move the staff from New Jersey offices where its leases are due to expire. The company, like many in the New York metropolitan area, considered moving jobs to other states that offered inducements.
Moving to Florida or Colorado "has always been a back-up possibility," Harry Ferguson, a Merrill Lynch vice president of corporate real estate, said yesterday. "Our preference is to have a second location in central New Jersey."
The company plans to hire 1,400 to 1,500 employees for the new complex, bringing its work force in Hopewell to 5,000. It will also keep 3,000 workers at its main New Jersey office, in Plainsboro.

HEADLINE: New Citigroup Is Getting Off To Rocky Start

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
Citigroup Inc., the financial services giant formed by the newly combined Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc., said yesterday that it would report an estimated $700 million of net income for the three months ended on Sept. 30 after being hit by about $1 billion in losses from the recent turmoil in financial markets.
That estimate for third-quarter earnings compares with $1.5 billion in combined net income for the two independent companies in the period a year earlier, or $2.1 billion of combined net income before allowing for a reorganization charge. 
 Since the two huge financial companies announced their intention to merge in April to form the nation's biggest banking, insurance and investment conglomerate, the combined value of Citigroup has fallen more than 50 percent, to an estimated $72 billion, as financial markets have been roiled by Russia's default, Japan's continuing economic problems, President Clinton's troubles and most recently by the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, the big hedge fund in Greenwich, Conn.
Citigroup said yesterday that Salomon Smith Barney, its investment bank, would report a net loss of about $325 million for the third quarter. These losses, it said, were caused by a $700 million loss in the firm's global arbitrage business and from credit losses related to Russia. Salomon, which said on Aug. 31 that its losses for July and August totaled $150 million, was one of the first financial companies to warn investors of the growing losses caused by volatile market conditions since mid-July.
In addition, Citigroup said yesterday that its Citibank subsidiary would report a $130 million loss in its corporate banking business because of about $240 million of after-tax losses related to Russia and about $100 million in after-tax losses related to the decline in the value of its bond holdings. Despite these losses, the company said its consumer banking and insurance businesses continued to do well.
After the stream of bad news from financial companies in recent weeks, analysts seemed to take Citigroup's announcement in stride, as did the market: shares of Citigroup rose 75 cents, to $32.50.
"The earnings were a little lower than we expected," said Ronald I. Mandle, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein & Company. "The real shift is that they are moving to reduce risk throughout the company. The consumer business is performing very well. I think earnings will be considerably better in the fourth quarter."
John Keefe, an analyst at Keefe Worldwide Financial Services, a New York consulting firm, said: "It's not atypical to use a combining quarter like this to do the wash. Unfortunately in this quarter there's plenty of laundry to do."
Citigroup is expected to report third-quarter earnings in the next few weeks.
Richard K. Strauss, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company, who recently cut his estimates for the company, said: "Definitely the weakness at Salomon was meaningfully worse than anticipated. What we are more likely to see in the third quarter is downside and not upside."
Nevertheless, Citigroup's two co-chairmen and co-chief executives, John S. Reed and Sanford I. Weill, tried in an interview yesterday -- the first day of trading for the stock of Citigroup -- to put a brave face on their future together, stressing that this was a merger with good long-term prospects whatever recent market volatility might have done to their company's stock price. They also said they did not envision making layoffs.
Mr. Weill maintained that despite the current uncertainties in financial markets there were "incredible opportunities to grow one's business," even though "every now and again" the financial markets might be upset by "vicious cycles." Ticking off the travails the markets face: falling stock values, Russia, Long-Term Capital and other difficulties, Mr. Weill said, "We have the ability to withstand that."
The financial leaders defended their combined company's part in the recent $3.65 billion rescue of Long-Term Capital. "I believe that the industry coming together with a private-sector investment in Long-Term Capital was in the long-term interests of the capital markets," Mr. Weill said. Travelers, which put up $300 million as part of that rescue, has an executive on the team overseeing Long-Term Capital as it tries to work itself out of its multibillion-dollar difficulties. That may take some time. "What's happened to our investment? I don't know, but I don't think it's up," Mr. Weill said with a laugh. Both men said they did not have any of their own money in the fund.
They also seemed concerned about Brazil's economic and financial difficulties and gave some insight into how they work together. "I'm quite interested with how we're going to deal with the pressure on Brazil," Mr. Reed said. "Mexico was dealt with in one way, Russia in another. The market is confused. What the market is looking for is for a pattern to emerge." He wondered "as to how this pressure on Brazil will be dissipated," saying, "You can't have a developing country with interest rates at 50 percent," for a long period.
"Just remember. Anything you say, on Wednesday I'll have to defend it," Mr. Weill interjected with a smile, referring to his forthcoming trip to Brazil. That's how things have to work at a company with two chairmen.
 
 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 10, 1998, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about Citigroup's third-quarter results misstated the two chief executives' plans for their work force. While they still plan to eliminate several thousand jobs, as was announced on Sept. 17, they said yesterday that they planned no further job cuts beyond that.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Oh, By the Way ...

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Ah, excuse me. I don't mean to interrupt the fun Congress is having with its impeachment hearings and all. But, well, there's just this little problem going on in the rest of the world. It has to do with economics. You see, the world's first truly global economy is going through its first truly serious global crisis. If you follow the global credit crunch and market declines as they are displayed on graphs on a Bloomberg machine, they each look like an EKG tracking a massive heart attack. So, you know, we might want to talk about it. I mean, not all the time. Maybe just in between the impeachment hearings and the release of the next Tripp tapes. Like I said, I don't mean to interrupt ...
BUT HAVE WE GONE NUTS??? 
 We are not just heading for lower growth, and possibly a recession. We are seeing at minimum a slowdown and at a maximum a breakdown in the whole progression toward free-market capitalism. That progression has enormously benefited Americans and millions of people in emerging markets, where $350 billion has been invested over the past decade.
Yes, some of that investing was done without proper regard to the risks, as banks, mutual funds and individuals indiscriminately chased higher and higher yields anywhere in the world. Unfortunately, what is happening now is that those same investors are, without any distinctions between good and bad countries, pulling their money out in pursuit of lower and lower risks, putting all their money into T-bills or a mattress. The net result is to choke off credit to everyone, from bad Russian banks to good Brazilian factories to promising American start-up companies, in a way that can only lead to misery and unemployment. As the vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, Robert Hormats, says, "We have not seen a withdrawal of liquidity this big from the third world since the Good Lord parted the Red Sea to let the children of Israel walk through."
Meanwhile, the Republican-led Congress is having a grand time, recklessly dragging out the impeachment of the President until Christmas -- and it's not even clear which Christmas.
This is not to say that because of this financial crisis we must ignore President Clinton's horrendous personal behavior. But it is to say we've got to recognize that the global context that existed when this affair first erupted has fundamentally changed. You may not know that from watching CNN or MSNBC, with their 24-hour-a-day impeach-a-tainment shows. But it has. And it has changed into a global crisis that requires enormous political leadership in general and U.S. leadership in particular. It is time, therefore, to take Gerald Ford's advice and work out a censure plea bargain between Mr. Clinton, Kenneth Starr and Congress and be done with this affair -- now.
Last week the dollar fell by 20 Japanese yen in two days. That is the sort of volatility you expect in the Mexican peso. It just doesn't happen with the dollar. It is like seeing a cat fly. When panicked markets overshoot this badly, you have to overshoot them right back. What is needed now are some holy-cow, in-your-face, stick-this-in-your-portfolio-and-smoke-it, confidence-building measures by the U.S., Europe and Japan to break the negative psychology of the markets and stoke up some real worldwide demand. That requires, among other things, a U.S. President able to galvanize the process, explain it and press it forward.
It also requires a steep drop in the key interest rate by the Federal Reserve from the current level of 5.25 percent; an incremental drop won't do it. And it may require using some of the budget surplus for a tax cut. It also requires a cut in German-European interest rates. And it certainly requires an emergency cleanup of the bankrupt Japanese banking system. The real systemic threat to the global economy today is the continuing risk of large-scale bank failures in Japan.
This is not a test, folks. If this credit crunch continues it will have enormously destabilizing effects. Because on the one hand the world is telling developing countries to reform their economies, clean up their banks and get their financial software up to Western standards. And on the other hand, it is telling them that they are going to have to do this with much, much less capital from the developed countries, or with much, much higher interest rates at home. That is a prescription for political explosions all over the world.
Like I said, I didn't mean to interrupt ...

HEADLINE: Where's the Romance of the Open Road?;
In the Past, Homeless Meant Footloose; Today, It's Just Misery

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
Stuck in the streets of high-rent downtowns and depressed inner cities like abandoned wreckage at the rim of the highway, today's homeless seem to be the least mobile of Americans.
Yet nothing could be further from the image of homelessness that prevailed 100 years ago, when footloose armies of homeless created a network of rowdy "hobohemias" across the country, made the first protest march on Washington and captured the public imagination as a rugged vanguard of radical unionism. 
 To scholars investigating this almost-forgotten history, it suggests how much the very idea of homelessness -- and our response to it -- is linked to the large economic and social changes that underlie dislocations of the poor.
Kenneth L. Kusmer, a historian at Temple University whose book on homelessness, "Down and Out, On the Road: Tramps and Vagrants in American Society 1865-1940," is to be published by Oxford University Press next year, contends that for all their differences, the homeless of our own era and those of the past are fundamentally similar. Just as homelessness in the 19th and early 20th centuries was a product of the wrenching transition from an agricultural to an industrial society, he says, today's homeless are the result of an incomplete transition to a post-industrial society.
Many people assume this country's first real experience with homelessness was the Great Depression; in fact, homelessness began to surge in the last half of the 19th century. But public attitudes toward the homeless shifted dramatically between the Civil War and the 1930's, from fear and condemnation to a kind of romanticism that turned the hobo into an American folk hero.
"Homelessness is at best an odd-job word, pressed into service to impose order on a hodgepodge of social dislocation, extreme poverty, seasonal or itinerant work, and unconventional ways of life," Kim Hopper and Jim Baumohl, two veteran researchers on homelessness, cautioned in a 1996 essay, "Redefining the Cursed Word: A Historical Interpretation of American Homelessness."
In the colonial period, runaway slaves and servants were among those who joined the itinerant indigents known as "the strolling poor." In the mid-19th century, a mix of the inebriated and the unlucky slept stacked in lodging rooms at the police station that quickly went from one-night holding places for transients to a network of de facto homeless shelters. As early as 1789, the New York Common Council was worried that its almshouse had become "too much a common receptable for idle, intemperate vagrants, many of whom have no lawful residence" and who displaced more worthy objects of charity. Such complaints recurred across the country over the next 150 years, observed Mr. Hopper, who is a researcher at the Nathan S. Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research in Orangeburg, N.Y., and Mr. Baumohl, an associate professor of social welfare at Bryn Mawr.
Tramps became more prominent in the early 1870's, when the end of the Civil War, the rise of wage labor and the boom-and-bust cycles of industrialization-in-the-raw sent thousands if not millions of the unemployed roaming in search of work or a handout.
Over the next several decades, these mainly white, native-born, rootless young men -- and some women -- created an increasingly politicized subculture of hobo encampments near railroad arteries and hard-drinking lodging house neighborhoods in western gateway cities like Chicago, Seattle and Minneapolis. Successive generations of reformers and policy makers saw their existence as evidence of social and moral crisis in America, says Todd Depastino, a young social and cultural historian who has been researching the history of homelessness on a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities.
In the mid-1890's, in the depths of a Gilded Age depression, the "Industrial Armies of the Unemployed" began recruiting homeless men from Western skid row neighborhoods for a cross-country "petition in boots" to demand a program of public works from lawmakers in Washington. Dozens of copycat marches were organized from Chicago, San Francisco, and the Pacific Northwest during this period of widening inequality and brutal strike-breaking. Hobo armies hijacked freight trains, often with the help of railroad workers sympathetic to their cause. By 1908, the Industrial Workers of the World, known as the Wobblies, had cast hobos as a muscular advance guard of the American class struggle.
In retrospect it seems obvious to historians that the nation's expansion and modernization inevitably uprooted workers. But mid- to late-19th-century Americans conditioned by a more settled artisan and agrarian society saw the resulting "homelessness" as a threat to social cohesion, the work ethic and family values. Even without the specter of anarchism or class warfare, sprawling male communities of native-born whites were considered dangerous to the nation's health, Mr. DePastino adds, especially in the eyes of eugenics-inspired reformers worried that "inferior" immigrant races were out-reproducing "better" Anglo-Saxon stock.
Mr. Kusmer traces the rise of a more sympathetic image of homelessness in the early 20th century to the growing acceptance of rootless underemployment as a feature of a capitalist industrial economy rather than as a sign of bad character or social decay. Most jobs were temporary or seasonal, and with European immigrants flooding the labor market, even full-time year-round work was usually too low-paid to cushion families against illness, industrial accidents and the business cycles of that pre-welfare era. By the same token, the Ford Motor Company's factories, which paid the best industrial wages, experienced 100 percent turnover on the assembly line in 1905 as workers quit to drift on to something else. In this context, Mr. DePastino argues, the hobo came to represent a kind of manly embrace of insecurity and a last-ditch rebellion against the discipline of the factory floor.
World War I and the mechanization of pivotal Western agricultural, railroad and mining operations substantially reduced the size and viability of hobohemias tied to seasonal labor. The 1920's saw the beginnings of a corporate welfare that used benefits to stabilize their work force. Still, until World War II, the "homeless" were considered a permanent feature of American life. During the Great Depression of the 1930's, a new generation of jobless young people rode the rails, but the era's migrant poverty was increasingly shaped by the automobile, which could carry whole families in search of work, like the Joads in the "Grapes of Wrath," their worldly goods lashed to a Model T. Migrant families, too, were increasingly preferred by farm employers as a more docile work force than their unattached male counterparts, Mr. DePastino adds.
Yet in 1932, he says, when as many as 60,000 unemployed World War I veterans converged on Washington by rail and road to demand their "bonuses," they were clearly the heirs of the first hobo armies, and Herbert Hoover had them routed from their tent cities by real Army troops, led by Gen. Douglas MacArthur.
Only World War II, with an unlimited demand for labor, routed homelessness itself from the United States. In late 1942, for example, The San Francisco Chronicle reported that even a busload of 74 "skid road sherry winos" from the Los Angeles County Jail had been accepted by the Kaiser shipyards to be trained as welders in lieu of their 90-day sentences.
Mr. DePastino argues that postwar policies like the G.I. Bill and "the mass hypersubsidization of suburbia" (through highway construction, for example) were part of an explicit Federal effort to prevent the return of the volatile hobo armies. But African-Americans were largely left out of the benefits, he says. And by the 1960's, when the Northern cities of black migration were de-industrializing and the last of the skid-row housing faced the wrecking ball, the stage was set for the rise of the new homelessness.
Christopher Jencks, in his unsentimental book "The Homeless," about modern-day homelessness, says the economy in the last 25 years, just as in the nation's period of nascent industrialization, has increasingly demanded a flexible labor market, "one in which labor unions are weak, employers can hire and fire at will, and new workers are easy to find." Such flexibility is often cited by economists as the main reason the United States has created more jobs and adapted better to globalization than Europe. But the dark side, Mr. Jencks points out, is that it guarantees some workers will never find steady employment.
In the past, residence in skid-row housing was precisely what defined such people as homeless. Yet Dennis Culhane, who does data analysis for the homeless shelters of New York City and Philadelphia, notes that today, when "homeless" means either to be without shelter or to live in a shelter, the leading remedies for homelessness are, in effect, modern versions of the old flophouse.
"If you take the historic view of this," he said, "what we're calling solutions to homelessness today are really what we called homelessness in the past."

HEADLINE: William E. Griffith, 78, Expert on Communism

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
William E. Griffith, a historian and political scientist who was an authority on Communism, the cold war and Central and Eastern Europe, died on Sept. 28 at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was 78 and lived in Lexington, Mass.
The cause was a stroke, said Robert J. Sales of the news office at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which announced Professor Griffith's death on Monday. 
 Professor Griffith spent 31 years in teaching and other posts at M.I.T. and was the Ford International Professor of Political Science when he retired in 1990.
"He foresaw the first thaws in the cold war while it was at its height," and he realized early on that the Sino-Soviet split was occurring, said Lucian W. Pye, a retired M.I.T. political science professor.
"He often could spot things just as they were beginning to bud," Professor Pye added, and he said that when Zbigniew Brzezinski was national security adviser in the Carter Administration, Dr. Brzezinski had Professor Griffith as a part-time consultant and "found him very helpful."
Professor Griffith, who collaborated with Dr. Brzezinski on several books and commuted to Washington once a week from Cambridge, was called "Zbig's idea man" by a White House aide in 1979.
"Bill Griffith was a very dedicated anti-Communist and understood Communism better than most people," said Lincoln P. Bloomfield, a retired M.I.T. professor of political science who was director of global issues at the National Security Council in the Carter Administration. Mr. Griffith wrote in his book "The Superpowers and Regional Tensions" (1982), "Bolshevik ideology gave to Soviet expansionism a conviction of legitimacy and of inevitable success and, paradoxically, the imperative to push history forward faster."
Professor Griffith's writing and editing in his field won applause. He edited the book "Central and Eastern Europe: The Opening Curtain?" (1989), consisting of chapters by various specialists. The book was praised by John C. Whitehead, a former Deputy Secretary of State, as "a major contribution to the analysis of political and economic developments in this very important part of the world."
Other books Professor Griffith wrote included "Albania and the Sino-Soviet Rift" (1963), which Harry Schwartz praised in The New York Times Book Review. Mr. Schwartz, also an expert on the East Bloc, wrote: "Almost two years have passed since Premier Khrushchev first denounced the Communist leaders of Albania as murderers and traitors, but the leaders of that tiny primitive country continue in power. How this David and Goliath struggle arose, what forces brought together Albania and the colossus of China, the result of the quarrel on other Communist nations are all matters admirably discussed in Mr. Griffith's book."
Before moving to M.I.T., Professor Griffith was the chief political adviser at Radio Free Europe in Munich when it was still operated by the Central Intelligence Agency from 1950 to 1958.
He was born in Remsen, N.Y., and received a bachelor's degree in liberal arts in 1940 from Hamilton College and a master's degree in 1941 and a doctorate in 1950, both in history from Harvard. He was an Army officer in France and Germany during World War II and later was a high military government official in Bavaria.
He is survived by his wife of 50 years, the former Ingeborg Maria Ehrhardt; two daughters, Evelyn and Dorothy, both of Munich; a son, Oliver, of Paris, and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Richard M. Cyert Dies at 77; President of Carnegie Mellon

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
Richard M. Cyert, a management professor and former president of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, whose half century at the university encompassed its growth from a small regional institute to a national center of higher learning with a global reputation in computer technology and education research, died on Wednesday night at his home in Fox Chapel, Pa. He was 77.
The cause was cancer, said Donald A. Hale, Carnegie Mellon's vice president for university relations. 
 Dr. Cyert was born in Winona, Minn., the son of two orphans. He worked his way through the University of Minnesota as a page in the library and earned a doctorate at Columbia University under the G. I. Bill of Rights, after serving as a Navy officer in World War II.
He joined the faculty at Carnegie Mellon, then called the Carnegie Institute of Technology, as an instructor of economics in 1948 and rose to the rank of professor of economics and industrial administration before being appointed dean of the William Larimer Mellon Graduate School of Industrial Administration in 1962.
There, under Dr. Cyert's direction, the "management game" for business education was developed and expanded, and is now used as a model for many other schools; simply put, the game consists of students simulating the operation of a corporation.
Dr. Cyert, who became the sixth president of the 98-year-old university in 1972, was also a pioneer in computerizing colleges. In the mid-1980's, he linked all the computers on campus to a single network, a system that is as common today as it was unheard of 15 years ago.
"A lot of people refer to this place as 'Computer U.,' and Dick should be credited with that," Mr. Hale said.
Dr. Cyert, who also shored up the university's finances during his tenure, retired from the president's post in 1990, but served as a professor emeritus and continued to teach courses until last spring.
During his career, he was the author or co-author of 12 books and more than 100 articles for professional journals in the fields of economics, behavioral science, management and statistics. In the early 1990's, he also headed the Carnegie Bosch Institute, endowed by the German company Robert Bosch, to study and improve international management.
He was also a consultant in economics and management science in Belgium, Germany and Australia.
He was awarded several honorary doctorates, too, and was elected a fellow of the Econometric Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Statistical Association. He received a Ford Foundation research fellowship and a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation fellowship, as well.
Dr. Cyert was also a director and consultant for numerous businesses. In 1980, he headed Gov. Dick Thornburgh's commission to review and make recommendations for Pennsylvania's tax laws.
He was active in numerous efforts to revitalize western Pennsylvania, and, just as he watched Carnegie Mellon grow, he saw the region's economy evolve from one with a steel and manufacturing base to one with growing reliance on high technology.
Dr. Cyert is survived by his wife, Margaret Shadick Cyert; three daughters, Lynn Anne Cyert of Tahlequah, Okla.; Lucinda Cyert Steffes of Seattle and Martha Cyert of Palo Alto, Calif.; two sisters, Constance Conradi of Brainerd, Minn., and Charlotte Wilson of Ottawa, and three grandsons.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Dow and Nasdaq Rally to End Turbulent Week on Wall Street

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The stock market rallied yesterday, with the technology-heavy Nasdaq index jumping 5.2 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average climbing 2.2 percent.
But that rebound only added to the lore of the week that was, five days of trading frenzies in stocks, bonds and dollars that will be the talk of Wall Street for years to come. 
 Indeed, what was so striking was that it was not just one market that went wild this week: The dollar plunged 13.8 percent against the Japanese yen, its biggest decline in 27 years; the yield on the 30-year bond, after falling to a 31-year low of 4.72 percent on Monday, hammered bonds by surging back to 5.12 percent. And then there was the stock market. The Nasdaq dropped 7.6 percent despite yesterday's rally. The Dow moved in a 450-point trading range during the turbulent week.
"I sit in awe at it," said Charles I. Clough Jr., chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch & Company, of the week's volatility. "We've never had moves like this."
And Abby Joseph Cohen, the market strategist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, acknowledged that the volatility added to the jitters that had left many on Wall Street walking on eggshells. When prices "jump around quite a bit and jump out of their normal pattern, people get nervous," she said.
There are always winners and losers in markets, but the focus in this time of global financial uncertainty is going to be on the losers.
One, according to people familiar with the fund, is Tiger Management L.L.C., the hedge fund run by Julian Robertson, which is said to have lost nearly $2 billion when the yen rallied against the dollar and the Tokyo stock market rose. Tiger Management had a large bet that both the Japanese yen and some Japanese stocks would fall. But his fund is still up about 10 percent for the year.
Another loser may be the American economy. It is clear already that this volatility is contributing to the decisions of thousands of investors to cut back on riskier companies. Bankers are also talking about becoming more cautious, making it harder for businesses to grow.
In trading yesterday, the Dow rose 167.61 points, to 7,899.52, finishing the week up almost 115 points, or 1.5 percent. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 24.95 points, or 2.6 percent, to 984.39, down 1.8 percent for the week. The Nasdaq index jumped 73.37 points, to 1,492.49.
The rally was led by the stocks that had been pummeled earlier in the week and were now seen as bargains to many investors.
Foreign stock markets also rallied, with the Financial Times 100 index up 2.7 percent in London, the CAC 40 index up 4.5 percent in Paris and the DAX 30 index up 2.3 percent in Frankfurt.
In the American bond market, Government securities sold off for the fourth consecutive day, with the yield on the 30-year bond jumping from 4.99 percent on Thursday to 5.12 percent. The price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 1 29/32 , to 105 23/32 .
In the foreign exchange market, the dollar continued to fall against the yen, dropping 1.8 percent, to 116.95 yen from 119.05 yen. That was a big drop for a normal day but almost stabilizing after the 8.1 percent plunge on Wednesday. The dollar was little changed against the German mark, slipping to 1.6363 marks from 1.6375.
The stock market was led higher yesterday by Microsoft, up 5 11/16 , to 96 7/8; Intel, up 5 3/8, to 83 13/16 ; Dell Computer, up 4 3/8, to 52 13/16 , and Cisco Systems, up 3 3/8, to 50 1/16 . The four stocks accounted for about half of the rise in the Nasdaq index.
Money center banks rose for the second day. That sector has been among the hardest hit since the stock market reached its peak in July. Despite the cumulative 8 percent rally in the last two days, the S.& P. index of big banks is off 40 percent since July 17. J. P. Morgan, which was one of the Dow leaders, rose 4 3/4, to 84 5/8.
Hugh Johnson, the chief investment officer of the First Albany Corporation, said the rally yesterday, after all the volatility, added up to "a modestly positive week." But he quickly checked his optimism: "It may be a head fake," he said. "We have had so many before."
The selloff in the foreign exchange market, traders said, was caused by hedge funds and other institutions as they reversed trades that had been originally based on the idea of borrowing money cheaply in Japan to put at work at higher rates in the United States. That unwinding, spurred by fears that a higher yen would make many of those deals unprofitable, accelerated this week as the dollar fell through the 130 level and turned a lot of positions into losses.
That helter-skelter rush for the exits also pushed bond prices down. To pay off their yen loans, traders had to sell American bonds, pushing both bond prices and the value of the dollar lower.
Another factor in the bond market was the reversal of trades by funds owning mortgage-backed securities. For several weeks, as interest rates fell, managers of funds owning mortgages abandoned those securities because they feared that lots of homeowners would refinance at lower rates. When that happens, fund managers rush to buy 10-year Treasury notes to keep their cash invested.
But when interest rates began to rise this week, fund managers reversed those positions, selling 10-year Treasuries to buy higher-yielding mortgage-backed securities.
Given all the wild swings, it is no surprise that some investors just threw up their hands and put their money in three- and six-month Treasury bills. "Everyone is shifting into the short end," said Michael Cloherty, market strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. That's "where the real haven is."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Yen's RiseAgainst Dollar Is Threatening Japanese Exports

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 9

 BODY:
The yen's sudden jump against the dollar this past week threatens to take the momentum out of Japan's exports by making it more costly for America and other foreign markets to buy Japanese products.
If the yen's new-found strength lasts, economists say, it could even prolong Japan's worst postwar recession. 
 Big corporate exporters such as the Sony Corporation, the Honda Motor Company, the Fuji Photo Film Company and the NEC Corporation have been caught off-guard by the yen's abrupt about-face. The yen's higher exchange value makes their products more expensive abroad and lowers the value of their foreign earnings when converted back into yen.
"If the high yen trend continues, we will see the influence on our sales and profits within several months," Tamotsu Iba, vice president of Sony, said in a statement. "The current rapid rise in the yen does not reflect the fundamentals of the Japanese economy."
Up until this week, the yen had been weakening for months, a reflection of the litany of economic problems confronting Japan: debt-laden banks, rising bankruptcies, falling domestic sales, plummeting business confidence and a stock market that has continued to flirt with 12-year lows. Asia's economic crisis put further downward pressure on the yen.
But the yen's weakness has also been regarded as a benefit to Japan because it has helped stimulate exports, the one area of Japan's economy that has continued to maintain relative health.
Now, the abrupt change to a stronger yen, combined with signs of economic weakness appearing in Japan's most important market, the United States, has raised doubts about Japanese exporters as well.
Share prices of companies heavily dependent on exports have been falling recently. Many of those companies are the bluest of Japan's blue chips, the industrial elite of the nation.
Honda shares, for example, fell 470 yen yesterday, to close at 2,900 yen, while Sony's shares declined 380, to 7,770 yen. Honda is now trading at about 9 times earnings, while Sony trades at 16 times earnings. In comparison, shares of the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, which is less dependent on exports to the United States than Honda and Sony, trade at 27 times earnings.
"It's hard to say in any definitive way what the exact impact could be without knowing each company's hedging ratios, the final demand for their products and where they are produced," said Kathy Matsui, chief strategist at Goldman Sachs (Japan) Ltd. "But I still think that, net-net, it's hard to say it's positive for the exporters."
Some companies did offer rudimentary snapshots of the potential impact of the yen's swing.
A one yen move in the dollar-yen exchange rate makes a 5-billion-yen difference in Sony's profits. Thus, the recent seesaw of the rate from 135.35 yen to the dollar when trading opened this week to 116.95 yen in late New York trading today caused a slide of more than $780 million in potential earnings from Sony's operating profits. The Toyota Motor Corporation, Japan's largest car company, sees a 10-billion-yen swing in operating profits every time the dollar-yen exchange rate fluctuates by one yen.
The yen's rise is not necessarily viewed as a bad development elsewhere in Asia -- in fact, other weakened Asian economies could benefit from a rising yen because it would make their exports more competitive. Stock markets in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand rose today because of that prospect.
But Japan has been counting on its mighty car and electronics manufacturers with their vast global sales networks to generate the cash needed to keep its gross domestic product from slumping further than the 1.8 percent decline the Government has projected. With much of Asia still stuck in an economic rut and the domestic market in a funk, the Japanese exporters are regarded as increasingly important to Japan's still- elusive recovery.
If the United States economy slows further, as many believe it will, and the yen maintains its current strength, corporate Japan will face an unprecedented jump in excess capacity and inventories, which are already at levels that are pressuring prices. While the long-term impact of the drop in the dollar could become moot overnight should sentiment turn again, sudden swings in the exchange rate can hurt day-to-day corporate decision-making.
"The movement affects short-term business conditions, too, in terms of competitiveness," said Aston J. Bridgman, a spokesman for NEC, the world's second-largest semiconductor manufacturer. "If we're bidding on projects, we can quickly become uncompetitive when exchange rates swing like they have today and yesterday."

HEADLINE: Facing Severe Shortage of Food, Russia Seeks Foreign Relief Aid

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 9

 BODY:
Rocked by its worst harvest in 45 years and a plummeting ruble, Russia appealed today for relief aid from the European Union. It has also approached the United States and Canada for help.
Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov broached the question of relief at a meeting today with Jacques Santer, the President of the European Union. "There has been a request for humanitarian aid," a spokeswoman for Mr. Santer said. "There are no details yet." 
 A senior American official said the Russians had begun to sound out the United States and Canada about arranging shipments of food. "They have told us they want to talk to us about what is possible," the official said. "They are looking at the acquisition of grains and other commodity supplies."
Though Russian officials are still trying to figure out how much help they need, there is no mystery about why the Kremlin is asking. Russia is being pushed to the brink, anxiously facing a harsh winter and fearful that it may lack the food, medicine and power to get by.
Food is a big worry, a result of bad luck, bad agriculture and a collapsing economy. Western experts say that Russia may have enough to survive the winter but that the country's reserves will be dangerously depleted by spring.
Russia's production of grain is way down, mainly the result of this summer's drought in the Volga River and Ural regions.
But the downturn also reflects the nation's sorry experience with agriculture, which has been slow to reform since the breakup of the Soviet Union. Outdated farm equipment, the result of a lack of investment, as well as inadequate supplies of fertilizer and deficient storage have also contributed to the bad harvest.
Russia's grain harvest this year will reach about 52 million tons, down from 88 million tons last year, according to a new projection by the United States Department of Agriculture. That would make it the worst harvest since 1953.
Cattle inventories and other livestock have also declined, because of shrinking supplies of feed grain.
Aggravating the problem, the financial crisis has led to sharp cutbacks in food imports. Russia has imported about half of the food it has consumed in recent years, making the recent falloff in imports especially serious. For example, about 15 ships full of American frozen poultry have delayed unloading their cargo because payment has not been made and Russia's creditworthiness is now in question.
Publicly, the Russian Government has issued assurances that there will be sufficient food to get through the winter. A senior Agriculture Ministry official said today that he did not anticipate the need for emergency imports of grain.
"With last year's carry-over of 20 million tons, the grain balance is such that there will be no need for centralized purchases," said Vyacheslav Chernoivanov, the Deputy Agriculture and Food Minister.
But privately, Russian officials have already begun to discuss food shipments. An American official said the Russians had talked informally about obtaining 3 million tons of wheat, 1.5 million tons of corn, 500,000 tons of soy meal and 100,000 tons of meat. Speculation about American shipments to Russia has driven up commodity futures prices.
Other American officials said the Kremlin was still trying to figure out what it might need.
It is far from clear how the shipments would be financed or how much the cash-poor Russians can afford to pay for themselves. American officials are considering ways to help including loans on favorable terms and outright grants of food.
Closer to home, Russia has suggested that Belarus and Ukraine repay their debts for shipments of Russian natural gas by providing food instead of money. "Instead of replenishing hard currency reserves, Russia will be receiving foodstuffs and will eat them up," the newspaper Kommersant observed wryly.
Mr. Primakov and his new coalition Government have promised other steps as well. To ease the way for imports, Russia is considering abolishing import duties on meat, butter, grain and other food.
It is giving the agricultural industry five years to repay debts to the state budget. It is also allowing Russian regions to pay some of their debts with deliveries of food.
Russia consumes about 70 million tons of grain a year, of which 22 million tons is used for food. The rest is used largely for cattle feed and for seed. But grain may play an increasingly larger role in the Russian diet as Russians substitute bread for high-priced meat.
A paradoxical result of Russia's disastrous harvest is that the quality of the grain has improved. Experts say the dry summer made the grain more suitable for milling.
Russia's looming food shortage is hardly the only humanitarian issue here. The financial crisis has also interfered with the import of medicines, many of which are produced abroad. "The socioeconomic crisis has hit all aspects of the health system, stopping us from doing our job," Vladimir Starodubov, the new Health Minister, said today.
There is also the general problem that is crippling all aspects of the society: a debilitating shortage of cash. Tax collection is down, and Mr. Primakov acknowledged today that he had no idea where the money for the Government's budget for the rest of this year would come from.
Russia is still holding out hope that it can persuade the International Monetary Fund to distribute billions in more aid. But the fund does not give money on humanitarian grounds. It is looking for signs that Mr. Primakov is prepared to advance market reforms. And the Government's absence of an economic program and its talk of printing money to pay back wages has not comforted the fund.
"I don't know what the sources will be for financing the Government program that is being worked out," Mr. Primakov said.

Bill to Bring Technology Workers to U.S. Dies

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 9

 BODY:
A bill that would have increased the number of United States visas granted to foreign high-technology workers died in the Senate today, with backers of the bill warning its demise could have dire consequences as the computer industry tries to deal with the year 2000 millennium bug.
Both the House and the Senate had passed earlier versions of the bill, and a compromise with the White House had been worked out last month. But a small number of senators were able to block a vote on the bill late today, killing any chance of its passage this year. 
 Under current law, 65,000 H-1B visas are granted annually to noncitizen computer programmers and other highly skilled professionals to work in the United States for up to six years. The bill would have nearly doubled that, to 115,000, for the next two years and, to 107,500, in the third year. After that, the level would drop back to 65,000.
The bill's chief Senate sponsor, Spencer Abraham, a Republican from Michigan, said the decision could hurt the high-technology industry and academic institutions.
"This is a severe problem and it is especially severe at this time," said Senator Abraham, noting that the industry is trying to resolve the millennium bug, which may cause some computer systems to fail if internal clocks do not recognize the year 2000.
Tom Harkin, a Democrat from Iowa who opposed the bill, said he did not think there was a shortage of high-technology American workers now, but he was willing to take another look at the issue next year.
"Right now it does not appear that the demand is there that they have anticipated," Senator Harkin said.
Senator Abraham disagreed, saying the United States cannot fill the 130,000 new information jobs a year without importing foreign workers.
High-technology companies had lobbied to increase the cap on foreign workers, but some lawmakers with ties to organized labor opposed it.

Another Indignity for Islanders: Opener Isn't on Local TV

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
The Islanders will open their season against the Penguins tonight, but the game will not be shown to cable television viewers by Fox Sports New York.
The Islanders' 7 P.M. game conflicts with the Devils-Blackhawks game at 8, so F.S.N.Y. announced it would carry only the Devils' contest. 
 Joe Cohen, the executive vice president of Madison Square Garden, who made the decision for F.S.N.Y., refused to comment.
"We're very disappointed," said David Seldin, president of New York Sports Ventures, which owns the Islanders. "There's apparently no good explanation for this. This is an inconvenience to our fans, who expect greater service."
The game can be heard on radio on WJWR-AM 620 and WLUX-AM 540. But the only place to watch the game on television is in the Penguins' market, on Fox Sports Pittsburgh.
Frequently, when F.S.N.Y. is faced with two teams playing at the same time, it creates an overflow channel, Fox Sports New York 2. Last season cable television carried all Islander games when conflicts arose.
Although Cohen would not elaborate on his decision, it is believed that sagging advertising sales for Islander games did not make it economically feasible for F.S.N.Y. to produce a second telecast. The Garden rebuffed the team's offer to pay a fee to carry the game.
"The Islanders have expressed their concerns to me and I called the appropriate parties to express my concern," Gary Bettman, the National Hockey League's commissioner, said through a spokeswoman. But Bettman cannot order F.S.N.Y. to carry the game.
The opening-night blackout is the latest problem for the Islanders, who are in a legal fight with Nassau County and S.M.G., their landlord, over safety at the Nassau Coliseum. Attendance at the team's two home exhibition games was sparse, and tonight's crowd is expected to total about 12,000.
After tonight's game, there will be four more instances this month when Islanders and Devils games conflict on F.S.N.Y. No decision has been made on carrying them.
 
SLAP SHOTS
ZIGMUND PALFFY's representative had several conversations with DAVID SELDIN, the Islanders president, this week, but the sides could not reach an agreement on a new contract for the 26-year-old right wing. So, when the Islanders play host to the Penguins in the season opener for both teams tonight, Palffy will be at home in Slovakia. PAUL KRAUS, Palffy's agent, was seeking a multiyear deal worth about $6.8 million for his client, but this week told Seldin that for the right price he would settle for a one-year deal. . . . KEVIN MILLER, who was invited to training camp for a tryout, signed a one-year deal with the Islanders yesterday believed to be worth about $300,000. The center and right wing, 33, played 37 games for the Blackhawks last season.

HEADLINE: Congress Extends Deadline On Stalled Spending Talks

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: Washington, Oct. 9

 BODY:
Budget negotiations faltered today, prompting Congress to delay until midnight Monday its deadline for passing a spending bill to keep the Government open.
Republican leaders vowed they would not let the Government shut down. At the same time, many rank-and-file members of Congress, suffering from impeachment fatigue and anxious to get home to campaign for the Nov. 3 elections, fled Capitol Hill temporarily tonight in an acknowledgment that any resolution was in the hands of Republican leaders and the White House. They are subject to return at the call of their leaders to vote on a final package, probably not before Monday. 
 Meanwhile, the chairmen of the spending committees and Republican leaders engaged in on-and-off negotiations with the White House. The two sides met twice today and were working tonight, but little overt progress was made on the spending bills as the process devolved into a political blame game, with each side trying to control the message that goes out to voters.
President Clinton said that Republicans were not providing enough money for his education initiatives, including measures to hire teachers and repair schools.
"This budget is purely and simply a test of whether after nine months of doing nothing, we are going to do the right thing about our children's future," the President said.
Representative Robert L. Livingston, the Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee, responded that he was astounded to see the President on television complaining about Republicans when the White House had failed to propose cuts in domestic spending to make up for the billions of dollars that the President was seeking for his own proposals.
Republicans were keenly aware that the President had successfully blamed them for previous Government shutdowns, in 1995 and 1996, and were determined today not to let that happen again.
As the negotiations stalled, Mr. Livingston asserted, "There's not going to be a shutdown."
The Republicans were responding not only to the President but to a prevailing sense on Capitol Hill that their leaders were giving in to the Administration's demands behind the scenes in order to make a quick break from Washington and leave with the political focus on the impending impeachment inquiry.
Democrats appeared more eager to draw out the endgame and were advancing the view that Republicans, in their haste to capitalize on the President's woes in their re-election campaigns, were being careless about the budget.
"They're cutting out on everything because they want to get out of here," said Representative Bill Delahunt, Democrat of Massachusetts. "The impeachment stuff has been draining on the whole institution. It's been sucking all the air out."
Representative Jennifer Dunn, Republican of Washington, emerged from a closed-door meeting of her colleagues saying she was "disappointed that the President has put us on the defense."
But really, said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, a member of the Republican leadership, Republicans "want to stay here and work, work, work."
A top Republican aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity put the message in plain English: "We're not going to give them the ability to say it's our fault."
But that is the message that Mr. Clinton and Democratic leaders tried to convey, portraying the Republicans as blocking bills on health care, campaign finance and the minimum wage, even though these measures are not directly related to the 13 must-pass spending bills that keep the Government going.
Only two of those bills have been signed into law. Four others have been sent to the President, and he has vetoed one. The current negotiations are over several contentious items in the remaining seven bills, which are likely to be wrapped up into one big omnibus bill and presented to the President next week.
The Senate added to that bloated omnibus today by killing the bill financing the Treasury Department and United States Postal Service.
The White House and Republicans continued to work on a compromise that would provide the International Monetary Fund with $18 billion to replenish accounts depleted by economic bailouts in Russia and Asia.
Today's deadline extension, which Mr. Clinton signed tonight, is the second that Congress has sought in two weeks. The first took Congress through tonight, even though the new fiscal year began Oct. 1.
In other action today, the House approved, 300 to 125, legislation overhauling the bankruptcy code, but the legislation still faced the threat of a veto from the White House and opposition from Senate Democrats who said it failed to rein in abusive credit card lending and marketing practices. Tonight, however, Democrats withdrew a filibuster threat that would have killed the bill.
Senator Richard J. Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said the Democrats had relented after Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, told them he would not pass the freestanding bill but instead try to include it in the omnibus spending measure needed to end the Congressional session.

HEADLINE: Bill to Punish Nations Limiting Religious Beliefs Passes Senate

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 9

 BODY:
The Senate today unanimously approved a compromise bill that would require the Government to deal with countries that persecute citizens for religious beliefs by using measures ranging from the mildest private rebuke to tough economic sanctions.
The bill, the International Religious Freedom Act, would not force the President to impose automatic sanctions but would allow him to decide whether and how to act against violators. It would require the State Department to issue annual reports of each country's record on religious freedom, and would require the President to take action based on those reviews. As a check on the Administration, the bill would create a 10-member independent commission that would publish its own review of religious liberties. 
 "The tragic reality is that literally millions of religious believers elsewhere in the world live under constant, oppressive fear at the prospect of being arrested, imprisoned, tortured or even killed, simply for their religious faith," said Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the Republican whip.
 The bill grew from an effort more than a year ago by the Christian Coalition and other conservative religious groups to require the Government to step up its fight against religious persecution from Sudan to China.
It struck a chord in the corridors of Capitol Hill as well as in churches and synagogues across the country, and was soon embraced by religious organizations including the Episcopal Church and the American Jewish Committee. "No government has the right to tell people how to worship and certainly not the right to discriminate against them or persecute them for the way in which they choose to express their faith in God," said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut.
But it took weeks of closed-door negotiations before the Senate today approved a compromise measure, 98 to 0, after agreeing to give the President greater discretion in determining which penalities to impose.
Senate leaders whisked the bill to the House, where speedy approval is expected this weekend. Administration officials said Mr. Clinton would sign the bill, reversing earlier threats of a veto.
Passage of the legislation would fulfill a promise that House and Senate Republican leaders made earlier this year to conservative religious groups, handing conservatives a rare legislative accomplishment to tout in campaigns leading to Congressional elections less than a month away.
Supporters of the legislation cited a stream of gruesome incidents -- from the killing of Christians in Pakistan and Sudan to the torture of Tibetan Buddhist monks -- as evidence that stricter measures were needed.
The overwhelming support for the legislation masked differences among Republicans over the bill. Social conservatives like the Christian Coalition say the measure is essential to protect religious freedom worldwide. But moderates and business groups, like the United States Chamber of Commerce, say the bill's sanctions would alienate important diplomatic and trade partners.
"While well-intended, this bill could easily become counterproductive to U.S. interests and foreign policy objectives," said Frank Kittredge, vice chairman of U.S.A. Engage, a coalition of 676 small and large business, farm groups and trade organizations.
Administration officials took advantage of the Republican divisions, and of the eagerness of Republican leaders to produce a bill before Congress adjourns in the next few days, to wring the last-minute concessions.
The legislation calls for the State Department to conduct annual reviews of religious freedoms just as the department does now on human rights. The bill would create a new office within the department, headed by an official with ambassadorial rank, to monitor religious liberties.
Based on those reports and other information, the Administration would determine whether a country violated citizens' religious beliefs and should be punished. The toughest sanctions, including opposition to loans by international financial institutions, would be imposed only on countries that engaged in "systematic, on-going and egregious" violations like torture or imprisonment.
The President would be allowed to waive sanctions for "national interests" or if the Administration deemed that the penalties might provoke a popular backlash against religious minorities.
Administration officials and the bill's two chief sponsors, Senator Nickles and Senator Lieberman, hammered out the final details late on Wednesday, Mr. Eizenstat said.
In late September, Mr. Nickles altered his original bill to win the support of two Republicans, Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and Rod Grams of Minnesota, who had bottled up the legislation in committee.
Senate passage of the legislation culminated more than a year of Congressional action on the measure, which has been considerably softened over time.
In May the House voted, 375 to 41, to impose automatic sanctions against countries that permit or endorse a pattern of violent attacks or other persecution against religious believers. But the House bill faced immediate and immovable opposition in the Senate because of Republican resistance to automatic economic sanctions. Senators also complained that the original House bill would indiscriminately sanction close allies like Saudi Arabia, Germany, Israel and Greece.
Faced with what they considered a weaker bill or no bill, House leaders embraced the Senate version.

PRATT & WHITNEY CUTTING GLOBAL WORK FORCE 6%

BYLINE: Reuters 

 BODY:
The aircraft engine maker Pratt & Whitney will cut about 1,000 jobs each in Connecticut and Florida, or about 6 percent of its global work force, by mid-2000 in a bid to increase profits and absorb a decline in production, the company said yesterday. Pratt, a unit of the Hartford-based United Technologies Corporation, has about 13,000 employees in Connecticut, about 5,000 in Florida and a total of 33,000 worldwide. The company, the largest private employer in Connecticut, is offering early retirement to hourly workers in the state to minimize layoffs. United Technologies' stock rose $2.75 a share, or $78.

20% REDUCTION IN SOMEU.S. OPERATIONS IS PLANNED

BYLINE: Reuters 

 BODY:
The Shell Oil Company, the United States unit of Royal Dutch/Shell, said yesterday that it was cutting 20 percent of its United States exploration and production work force of 3,700 because of severely low oil prices. The 740 job cuts will mostly come out of Shell's Houston and New Orleans offices, a Shell spokeswoman said, and should be completed by Dec. 31. "On Oct. 21, employees will be notified by their supervisor if they will be included in the voluntary severance plan," Shell said. "Dec. 31 will be the departure date for most of the staff." A Shell spokeswoman said that the cuts would come from only the United States exploration and production unit and that no further reductions were currently planned.

To the Editor:
This is a time of great change and crisis in the world and the country. Your Oct. 9 edition is full of examples. Refugees in Kosovo, facing a harsh winter, are sleeping in open-air shelters. The United States seems poised to bear the brunt of the economic burden of rescuing the failing economies of Asia. 
 Who cares whether President Clinton tried to hide his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky? That's between him and Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. Clinton and his family. Right now, we need him as a leader. So give it up, Republicans, and get on with the business of the world.

HEADLINE: Cardinal Health Is Acquiring Allegiance Hospital Supply

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Skirting antitrust concerns that derailed its attempt to acquire a competing drug wholesaler in July, Cardinal Health Inc. announced yesterday that it would buy the Allegiance Corporation, a hospital supply company, for $4.5 billion in stock and assume $890 million of its debt.
Allegiance makes surgical instruments, rubber gloves and other operating room supplies. Cardinal already gets half of its $16.5 billion in annual revenues from hospitals. 
 Robert D. Walter, chairman of Cardinal, which is based in Dublin, Ohio, said the acquisition would generate $50 million from added revenues and cost savings within two years. Joseph F. Damico, president of Allegiance, said the payoff would come through sales growth, not by shrinking their combined 2,500-member sales force.
He said Allegiance's account managers would promote Cardinal products, but Cardinal representatives would still make their own sales. Allegiance is an offspring of the American Hospital Supply Company, which Baxter Healthcare Corporation acquired in 1985.
"It's a terrific merger," said Ronald Nordmann, a partner at Deerfield Management, a New York-based health care money management firm. "It makes Cardinal a one-stop shop."
The fortunes of drug wholesalers like Cardinal and the McKesson Corporation rise and fall with the pharmaceutical industry, and "the drug companies are in the best shape they have ever been in," said Leonard Yaffe, a health care analyst in San Francisco with Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities.
Hospitals, for their part, are under cost-cutting pressures from managed care and Government payers. But Mr. Damico said that demand for medical-surgical products was rising with the aging of the population. Allegiance sales were $4.4 billion in the year ending June 30.
Another plus: both companies have little exposure to overseas economic or currency problems, Mr. Nordmann said.
Under the deal, each share of Allegiance stock would be exchanged for 0.415 share of Cardinal stock. Based on Thursday's closing price of Cardinal on the New York Stock Exchange, the transaction was valued at $38.47 a share, a 67 percent premium on the Allegiance share price.
Yesterday, Cardinal dropped $8.8125, or 9.5 percent, to $83.875, and Allegiance gained $9.4375, or 22.5 percent, to close at $32.4375, also on the Big Board.
Some analysts said it was a rich price for Allegiance, which is in a commodity business with annual sales growth of only 2 percent to 4 percent. They said the company received a significant portion of its $107 million in net income last year from a slide in the value of the Malaysian ringgit currency. Allegiance makes medical gloves in Malaysia.
The deal was a rebound for Cardinal, which dropped its $2.4 billion bid for the Bergen Brunswig Corporation, also a big drug wholesaler, after a Federal judge ruled in July that the deal raised antitrust problems. McKesson's attempt to buy the Amerisource Health Corporation also foundered on Federal Trade Commission objections.
Cardinal then bought the R. P. Scherer Corporation, which makes gelatin drug capsules and other drug delivery products, for $2.2 billion in stock and assumed debt.
"It became clear when the F.T.C. blocked the mergers of the pharmacy distributors that the second-best option would be to buy a hospital supplier," said Vivian Wohl, a senior research analyst at Merrill Lynch. She said McKesson, which bought General Medical Inc., a hospital supplier, last year, recently jolted competitors by winning the drug and supplies business of the big Columbia/HCA Healthcare hospital chain.
Credit Suisse First Boston advised Allegiance on the deal. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup Inc., advised Cardinal.


CORRECTION-DATE: October 13, 1998, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Saturday about the acquisition of the Allegiance Corporation by Cardinal Health Inc. misstated the year in which the lower value of the Malaysian currency, the ringgit, contributed to Allegiance's profits. It was this year, not 1997.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
Hawaii's Tourism Slump: Short or Long Term?

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
WHILE most of the United States appears headed for a second consecutive year with a record number of tourists in 1998 -- or was before the recent stock market gyrations raised questions about rosy tourism projections for this fall -- Hawaii's tourist industry continues to struggle.
The islands' overall visitor count of 3,974,530 through July, the latest month for which figures are available, is off almost 1 percent over the same period last year, and with the traditional tourism slowdown this month, there is little prospect that the islands will come close to the record of almost 7 million visitors in 1990. Meanwhile, the hotel occupancy rate in August dropped to 75.8 percent statewide, a 3.6 percent decline from August 1997, while Waikiki hotel occupancy fell 3.82 percent in the same period, to 78.9. This on-again, off-again slump, during a time when tourism has been flourishing on the mainland, has renewed questions of whether Hawaii is mired in a prolonged though temporary downturn or whether its problems are systemic. What makes the soul-searching so important is that the $11 billion in tourism revenues account for one-quarter of Hawaii's tax revenues, as well as one-third of the jobs in a no-growth state that is struggling with above-average unemployment. 
 Hawaii's tourism woes began in earnest with the Gulf War in 1991. While that scare cut international air travel drastically, diminishing numbers of passengers on United States airlines by 44 percent on trans-Atlantic routes and 20 percent on Pacific routes, according to the Air Transport Association, it had a longer-lasting impact on Hawaii. Those islands lost about 850,000 visitors from 1991 through 1993, mainly because they were so heavily dependent on Japanese tourists, who tend to be cautious travelers, according to Japanese tour operators.
When tourists finally began venturing back in 1994, many complained that hotels were expensive and rundown, and that Honolulu lacked amusement parks and similar attractions. At the same time environmentalists faulted the state for not doing more to promote nature and environmental tourism.
Hawaii's high prices put it at a competitive disadvantage with ocean cruises and mainland vacation sites. The American Automobile Association recently listed Hawaii as the most expensive place to vacation in America -- the $383-a-day average for meals and lodging was $53 a day more than the runner-up, New York City. That may help explain why Hawaii, at one time almost every American's dream vacation destination, finished behind Florida and California in recent Travel Industry Association surveys of the favorite summer and winter destinations for Americans.
While all this was going on, the decades-long honeymoon between Hawaii and its once-lucrative Asian market was battered by the Asian economic flu that has weakened Japanese and Korean currencies in the past year, effectively pushing up the price of everything on the islands for many Asian visitors. As a result, tourism from Asia is down 8.5 percent through July, and a number of airlines have canceled flights from Asia to Hawaii and put smaller planes on their remaining Hawaiian routes.
This year occupancy in the beachfront hotels of Waikiki plunged to its lowest May occupancy since 1982 -- to 70.8 percent from 76.9 percent a year earlier, according to PKF-Hawaii, a consulting firm -- and from January through August occupancy at those hotels was down 4.2 percent. Also in August, a strong month for visitors, Oahu occupancy plummeted four percentage points to 77.4, Oahu's lowest August rate since 1979.
One result, which is now contributing to the problem, is that few hotels, especially the hotels on Waikiki beach, have been refurbished or renovated, according to Ernest A. Watari, chief executive officer of PKF-Hawaii.
While acknowledging problems, optimists point to Hawaii's many pluses. Once the Asian crisis passes, they say, Japanese and Koreans will return in big numbers. Meanwhile, in hopes of attracting many of the 2.6 million Chinese tourists who went abroad last year, the Hawaii Convention and Visitors Bureau opened a sales office in Shanghai last April. And Honolulu's $350 million convention center, which opened in mid-June, has already booked 60 conventions over the next few years that are expected to account for almost 600,000 room nights and add $1.6 billion to the state's economy.
In addition, tour operators, including Globus, Cosmos, Tauck, Collette, Pleasant Holidays, Perillo and Gogo Worldwide, currently have special rates to Hawaii, while Liberty Travel and some other big travel agencies offer package deals featuring room and car upgrades. In addition, such hotel chains as Castle, Sheraton, Aston and Outrigger also have special rates through this year.
Even as the number of Asian visitors dwindles, visitors from the mainland are increasing -- up 4.8 percent through this July to 1.78 million. Christopher Kam, a researcher with the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau, said the major factor appears to have been "the overall strength of the U.S. economy." Which explains why Hawaiians are keeping their fingers crossed and their eyes on Wall Street and the national economic indicators.

HEADLINE: The Funniest Italian You've Probably Never Heard Of

BYLINE: By Alessandra Stanley; Alessandra Stanley is the Rome bureau chief for The New York Times.

 BODY:
The funniest man in Italy appeared to be talking, quite solemnly, about American dentistry. "Mandelbaum," Roberto Benigni said, breathing the name reverently. "Some of the best dentists in the world are American." Few would argue the point, but it seemed an odd topic for an Italian comic whose knowledge of the United States is limited. His teeth, moreover, are even and unblemished.
"American dentists are extremely important," Benigni continued in rapid-fire Italian, sitting in a hotel garden in Rome. "They have influenced contemporary poetry a lot. They have a perspective that is very fresh and modern compared to the older texts." 
 Not "dentista." Dantista. The Italian word for Dante scholar. Mandelbaum is Allen Mandelbaum, a poet whose translation of "The Divine Comedy" is widely used in American universities, and Benigni is a passionate Dantista who, as a youth in Tuscany, could recite the entire "Divine Comedy" by heart. He recently gave an outdoor recital in Florence of the Fifth Canto of the "Inferno" before a rapt audience of 16,000.
Benigni looked a bit reproachful when told of the initial confusion, then laughed delightedly. Dumb misunderstandings, after all, have been at the core of some of his most popular movies, hugely successful slapstick farces like "Il Mostro" ("The Monster") and "Johnny Stecchino" -- movies confected around Benigni's naive, hapless and hopelessly bumbling screen persona.
Until now, that is. His latest movie, "La Vita Bella" ("Life Is Beautiful"), is about as abrupt a departure from his previous movies as can be imagined. It is a comedy set during the Holocaust. Benigni, who also directed and co-wrote the film, plays Guido, an assimilated Italian Jew in Arezzo who is deported, along with his 5-year-old son, to a German concentration camp. To hide and protect the boy, Guido playfully works to convince him that the horrors of their concentration camp are all part of an elaborate game.
It is as risky a premise as a popular comic can undertake. So far, however, the gamble has paid off. Despite initial grumbling from some critics, the movie instantly became a hit in Italy. "Titanic" sold more tickets, but an Italian polling firm found that 30 percent of Italian women would like to take a trip with Roberto Benigni; only 20 percent preferred Leonardo DiCaprio.
Elsewhere, "La Vita Bella" was something of a sleeper. It was accepted only at the last minute by the Cannes Film Festival, then astonished everyone by winning the Prix du Jury. At the presentation ceremony, Benigni shed all piety and reverted to his usual manic, bubbling self, sprawling on the floor in front of a startled Martin Scorsese, who led the jury, kissing his feet, then leaping up to kiss every member of the jury.
Benigni has since shown his film in Israel, where it was so acclaimed that Ehud Olmert, the Mayor of Jerusalem, awarded him a medal of recognition that was roughly akin to the keys to the city. In the United States, where the film opens next week, it is likely to be an Oscar contender for best foreign language film.
At 45, Benigni has bounced from one success in Italy to another since he first began drawing crowds to his risque one-man shows in small experimental theaters in Rome in the early 1970's. The Italian film business has been in an artistic and commercial slump these past several years, overshadowed by the popular American imports -- except for Benigni, who is the country's biggest star and top moneymaker. His 1991 movie, "Johnny Stecchino," grossed more than $30 million, outselling "Robin Hood" and "Terminator II." In 1994, "Il Mostro" outdrew "The Lion King" and "Forrest Gump."
But with the American release of "La Vita Bella," it is not at all clear whether Benigni can make the leap to success in a country that only a handful of European actors have conquered. And this film is not Benigni's first attempt to seduce American audiences. He appeared in Jim Jarmusch's 1986 cult film "Down by Law" and, in 1993, "Son of the Pink Panther," a limp eighth sequel to the Peter Sellers classic. "Johnny Stecchino," a farce about a doltish school-bus driver who is the uncanny double of a murderous Mafia don, was heavily promoted in the United States but fell flat.
As Benigni works to recast himself as a more serious comic, he seems both tempted and bemused by Hollywood. "After the Jarmusch movie, I got a lot of offers from Hollywood," he says. "Americans are generous. Disney asked me to stay and write for them. They took me around the studio, showed me early drawings of Pinocchio, but what could I do there?" He starts laughing. "Even Warner Brothers came after me. A studio executive wearing a lapel pin with Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck pointed to it and said that if I wrote for them, my face would be on the pin right next to Daffy Duck."
Still, Benigni says, "I would love to do great things in America." He admits, though, that his shaky English sometimes gets in his way. Tim Burton sent him the script for "Beetlejuice," which he rejected after he heard the title translated. "They said it meant spremuta di scarafaggi, and I said, 'Yuck, no thanks."' He beams with mock grandeur and adds: "Look what that film did for Michael Keaton. I could have been Batman." He pauses. "Well, maybe Robin."
Sometimes compared to Woody Allen (mostly because he stars in and directs his own movies, is slight, reads highbrow books and wears glasses off-camera), Benigni is actually the un-Allen -- there is no detectable angst or self-loathing in either his comic persona or personal psyche. He is not insecure, neurotic or even overly neat. Happily married to Nicoletta Braschi, 38, the actress who stars opposite him in all his films, Benigni is the rare example of a comedian who seems genuinely content behind the performance mask.
"On the outside he could appear insecure, but inside he was always enormously confident," says Giuseppe Bertolucci, one of Benigni's early mentors and collaborators, who is a filmmaker and younger brother of Bernardo Bertolucci. "The great gift of all actors is the capacity to like themselves, a certain narcissism that the rest of us don't have. He had an extraordinary sense of what he should and shouldn't do."
At first, even Benigni wasn't sure he should take on the Holocaust. "You never know how ideas come, but I had this strong desire to put myself, my comic persona, in an extreme situation," Benigni says. He and his co-writer, Vincenzo Cerami, were brainstorming one winter day in 1995 at the small, melancholy working-class trattoria in Rome that is their preferred hangout. "I said, 'Well, the ultimate extreme situation is the extermination camp, almost the symbol of our century, the negative one, the worst thing imaginable."' As soon as he said it, Benigni recalls, both men recoiled in horror.
Benigni then stood up and improvised a scene of a father trying to reassure his son by extravagantly ridiculing the idea that Germans would make buttons or soap from the remains of prisoners. From that first sketch, which ended up in the film, the rest of the story flowed.
It took them another year to summon the confidence to proceed. They read Holocaust books and studied documentaries, as well as "Schindler's List" and "The Great Dictator." (Benigni, who is increasingly described as Chaplin-esque, is openly in Chaplin's debt: the number he wears on his concentration camp uniform in the film is the same one Chaplin wore when playing the Jewish barber in "The Great Dictator.") Benigni also sought the counsel of Jewish historians and Holocaust experts, seeking to lend his film historical authenticity and himself moral support for a project that could easily strike audiences as sacrilege in the worst possible taste.
The risk of career-crushing failure was, after all, quite real. "The Great Dictator," Chaplin's 1940 satire of Hitler, may well have been a masterpiece, but that was Chaplin. Then there was Jerry Lewis. In 1971, when Lewis's career was at a nadir, he filmed "The Day the Clown Cried," about a German clown enlisted by the Nazis to distract wailing children destined for the gas chamber. Lewis's performance was reportedly ghastly and the movie was never released. According to Shawn Levy, a Lewis biographer, the sole complete copy is in a vault in Lewis's home.
"I know about this," Benigni says quietly. "But still I would so much like to see it, because Jerry Lewis is, he is, well, bello."
The concept for Benigni's movie did not fall entirely from thin air. Over the past several years, the Jewish experience has become a hot topic in Italy. Memoirs by Italian Holocaust survivors are in every bookstore, as are books about Yiddish humor and culture; there are numerous conferences and exhibitions about the Holocaust and Jewish life. Benigni, who is not Jewish, had already steeped himself in the works of Primo Levi and Isaac Bashevis Singer. (Years ago, he wooed his wife by telling her Singer stories.) As he cast about for a new film subject, he could hardly help absorbing the Zeitgeist.
Part of the inspiration was more personal. Benigni's father was a poor Tuscan farm worker who served in the Italian cavalry in Albania during World War II and ended up in a German labor camp when Italy changed sides in 1943. For two years, Luigi Benigni was nearly worked and starved to death, and weighed 80 pounds when he was released.
What shaped Benigni's thinking about "La Vita Bella" was not just his father's experience but the way he described it. "Night and day, fellow prisoners were dying all around him," he says. "He told us about it, but as if to protect me and my sisters, he told it in an almost funny way -- saying tragic, painful things, but finally his way of telling them was really very particular. Sometimes we laughed at the stories he told."
Now 79, Luigi Benigni still tells those stories, still mixes the chilling details with whimsical ones. "We were forbidden to talk to women," he recalls. "There were Czechs, Poles, Russians in there with us, but the sign over the door that said 'Those who attempt to speak to women will be severely punished' was written only in Italian." He smiles slyly. "The Germans knew how much Italians like to expletive ."
Benigni's parents live in the small town of Vergaio, one block from the modest stucco house his father built in 1960; they now have a larger house, which Benigni bought them in 1992 so his mother, Isolina, could have a garden. His childhood friends never left home, and Benigni returns often to see his parents and play cards with his old cronies. "If there were anger in Roberto, it would be the atavistic rage of the hungry peasant, but actually, there is no anger in him," says Franco Casaglieri, 46, who has known Benigni since elementary school. "He is not unhappy. He is a channel of joy. I don't know where it comes from, but he transmits it."
He was the only boy in the family, baby brother to three doting older sisters, growing up in a rural community united by postwar poverty. In their first house, near Arezzo, the medieval town where "La Vita Bella" is set, the family didn't have running water, a toilet or electricity. Even when they moved to Vergaio, when Benigni was a child, there was no television or pocket money. In the summers, he and his closest sister, Anna, could not afford movie tickets, so they would sneak onto the field behind the town's outdoor movie screen and watch westerns and gladiator films backward.
Gifted in school, Benigni was a precocious performer who at age 5 would climb on top of the bandstand during a break in summer outdoor dances and tell jokes. The Benignis, like everyone else in town, voted for the left; social life revolved around the Communist Party clubhouse. Urged on by his father, the teen-age Benigni quickly mastered a local pastime, competitions in ottava rima, in which two people debate while improvising the eight-line rhyming verse that has been a Tuscan tradition since the 13th century. The whole village would gather to watch their favorites compete. "The audience would throw them a theme," Benigni recalls. "America versus Russia. The guy who played the American would always let the Russian win to get more applause."
Benigni went to a rural elementary school until a local priest took note of the boy's intelligence and enrolled him in a Jesuit school in Florence. The 1966 floods closed the school and he dropped out to work as a magician's apprentice in a traveling circus. He ended his education in an all-female secretarial school and, in 1972, made his way to Rome, falling in with actors trying to make their mark on experimental theater. Giuseppe Bertolucci saw he had a raw talent and helped tame it, transforming Benigni's funny stories about Vergaio into a monologue. In 1977, they made a satiric coming-of-age movie that took Benigni's boyhood to comic extremes -- it is heavy on political message and puerile masturbation jokes.
An autodidact, Benigni absorbed the classics out of love -- and, as Bertolucci points out, to lend legitimacy to his extremely lewd monologues. It didn't always work: he was repeatedly threatened with obscenity charges, and was fined and given a one-year suspended sentence in 1980 after mocking Pope John Paul II.
As dangerous as his stand-up comedy may have seemed at one time, Benigni is, in person, almost alarmingly good-natured and eager to please. When explaining why he agreed to star in Blake Edwards's "Son of the Pink Panther," Benigni praised Edwards as the equal of Billy Wilder, then swiftly backtracked after the interviewer smiled skeptically at the analogy. "O.K., yes, there is a difference," he said. "I say Billy Wilder because he is the greatest of all, but in the American school, Edwards is a great comedic director."
His favorite adjective is bellissimo, which he applies with equal relish to describe Fellini, Cary Grant in "North by Northwest," Robert Frost's poetry, gin rummy and the extravagant catering trucks on the set of "Asterix et Obelix," a new French film in which he plays a small part opposite Gerard Depardieu.
Most often, he applies the adjective to his wife. "What I love best about her is that she is a woman who really knows how to laugh," he says. "It sounds banal -- 'she has a great smile' -- but no, but no, it's her laugh, it's different, she really knows how to laugh."
It is the perfect encomium for a comedian's spouse, of course. Their romance began when he cast her in 1983 as the Virgin Mary in the first film he directed, "Tu Mi Turbi" ("You Move Me"). They married in 1991 and now live in a spacious apartment in the Aventino, a lush, exclusive residential neighborhood near the center of Rome.
In his spare time, the restless Benigni is a passionate, ruthlessly competitive card player. He is also addicted to other games of skill. Among his playmates he counts the Italian novelist and semiotics professor Umberto Eco, whom he befriended 15 years ago when they engaged in a fierce ottava rima competition that lasted for weeks. They still trade complicated riddles and recondite guessing games by mail.
Benigni, whose merciless ridicule of the former conservative Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is credited with contributing to his political demise, has long been a darling of the left. But now that Italy has a center-left Government led by a down-to-earth economist, leftist intellectuals are suffering from post-ideological angst; they accuse the Government of buonismo -- "goody-goodyism." And because Benigni has not attacked the current Government, he, too, has been tarred with the same brush.
Some of his critics complain that "La Vita Bella" is the triumph of buonismo. "Benigni is very simpatico, but he is self-indulgent and so politically correct," complains Giuliano Ferrara, the editor of Il Foglio, a maverick conservative Roman newspaper that has led a relentless campaign against Benigni. "There is this tendency to make the Holocaust banal with easy tears and narcissism. There is no intellectual rigor, just sentimentality." Benigni, Ferrara says, has overstepped his talent. "It's like Bill Cosby trying to do Off Broadway. Benigni is a good entertainer, and that is what he should stick to."
Benigni is certainly one of Italy's most ambidextrous entertainers, one who boasts the rubbery physical agility of a silent movie actor and the verbal pyrotechnics of a young and wired Robin Williams.
In his most popular movies, the gags are mostly physical: one of the memorable moments in "Il Mostro," in which he plays a working-class loner mistaken by homicide detectives for a serial killer, is quite literally a seltzer-down-the-pants joke: he drops a lighted cigarette down his pants, and manically tries to put out the fire with Perrier. Through the lens of grainy black-and-white police surveillance cameras, Benigni battling with his crotch looks suspiciously like a sex maniac unbound.
Until now, his Italian comedies have all been quite similar, and it seemed as if Benigni had reached a plateau. That creative restlessness led to "La Vita Bella."
Flush with the attendant acclaim, Benigni has begun to express an almost messianic belief in his movie. "I didn't want to make a movie about the Holocaust -- I wanted to make a beautiful film," he says. "But if this film has even in a tiny way helped get people to talk about this subject, to feel the absurdity and the incomprehensible folly.. . ." Benigni pauses, searching for his words. "And if we can talk about it and also even smile about it, not sneeringly, but to naturally make fun of it, to smile at the Holocaust, we will be able to get over it, even though I can't say if it is wrong or right to get over it, but it has to be done somehow."

 BODY:
I can't remember now at which point during the Starr report I stopped reading. Maybe it was the sudden prim reminder that "the President's wife" was out of the country during one of President Clinton's hallway trysts. Or the superfluously wounding inference that the President was considering leaving his wife after his second term. Or the inclusion of the date for one of the President's liaisons: Easter Sunday. Or any one of the points when it simply became obvious that the narrative, compelling and lucid as it was, seemed to be building a case not so much for the President's public, legal impropriety but for a private, moral iniquity. And I stopped reading not because I sympathize with President Clinton's repeated public lies, or his abuse of power and of his office. (I still think he should resign.) Nor because I am instinctively a liberal. I stopped reading at some point because it became depressingly clear that the Starr report and its aftermath represents not simply a case study in what has gone wrong with an American Presidency, but also a case study in what has gone wrong with American conservatism.
To be sure, Bill Clinton goaded the independent counsel into some of this detail by the hairsplitting of his legal defense. But not all of it. And to be sure, Bill Clinton, by his failure to settle, and then to apologize, and then to tell the truth, was responsible in the first place for the nine months of trauma. But again, not entirely. For Bill Clinton was responsible for none of the prurient, lip-pursing moralism of the report, nor for the subsequent, egregious outspilling of grand-jury testimony. Proof of perjury or obstruction of justice required none of this, as most Americans immediately understood. This moral obsessiveness was the creation of Kenneth Starr and something far larger than Kenneth Starr. It was the creation of a conservatism become puritanism, a conservatism that has long lost sight of the principles of privacy and restraint, modesty and constitutionalism, which used to be its hallmarks. 
 This scolding, moralizing conservatism is one with a lineage; it is the construction of a cadre of influential intellectuals who bear as much responsibility as anybody for the constitutional and cultural damage this moment may have already wrought. And they will bear an even greater responsibility if the ultimate victim of this spectacle is the reputation and future of conservatism itself.
The Lewinsky Kulturkampf, after all, did not come out of nowhere. Since the implosion of Reaganism during the Administration of George Bush, and the evaporation of anti-Communism with the collapse of the Soviet Union, American conservatism has been in a period of radical intellectual reconstruction. Much of this reconstruction has occurred in journals and magazines and seminars largely unnoticed by the general public, but quite openly and candidly discussed among the conservative intellectual elites. And the dominant ideas that have emerged in the last few years bear only the faintest resemblance to the major themes of the 1980's: economic freedom, smaller government and personal choice. Although libertarians are certainly numbered among the intellectuals of the right of the late 1990's, they are clearly on the defensive. What is galvanizing the right-wing intelligentsia at century's end is a different kind of conservatism altogether: much less liberal, far less economic and only nominally skeptical of government power. It is inherently pessimistic -- a return to older, conservative themes of cultural decline, moralism and the need for greater social control. As much European as American in its forebears, this conservatism is not afraid of the state or its power to set a moral tone or coerce a moral order. A mix of big-government conservatism and old-fashioned puritanism, this new orthodoxy was waiting to explode on the political scene when Monica Lewinsky lighted the fuse.
You can see it in the current Congressional races. The issues that are driving the Republican base this fall have little to do with economics or politics or national security. They are issues of morals: infidelity and honesty, abortion, family cohesion and homosexual legitimacy. Much of this, as has been widely reported, is because of the evangelical Protestants who now make up the Republican activist base. Some of it is also because of Bill Clinton, who has done more to give credibility to the far right's conviction about moral collapse than anyone. But this is only half the story. If the remoralization of conservative politics has been fueled by events and by Republican activists, it has also been diligently refueled by conservative thinkers. The new moralism has been enforced with a rigidity that puts old-style leftists to shame. It is an orthodoxy, to put it bluntly, of cultural and moral revolution: a wholesale assault on the beliefs and practices of an entire post-1960's settlement. And, if recent polls hold out, it could be on the verge of coming to power in November.
The centrality of this moralism to the Lewinsky saga was perhaps best put by David Frum, one of the brightest of the young conservative thinkers now writing. "What's at stake in the Lewinsky scandal," Frum wrote candidly in the Feb. 16, 1998, issue of The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, "is not the right to privacy, but the central dogma of the baby boomers: the belief that sex, so long as it's consensual, ought never to be subject to moral scrutiny at all."
It would be hard to put better what was so surprising, and so dismaying, about the Starr report and the Republican Congress's subsequent behavior. The report was driven, as the Republican leadership seems to be, not merely to prove perjury but to expose immorality. In this universe, privacy is immaterial, hence the gratuitous release of private telephone conversations, private correspondence and even details of the most private of human feelings. For these conservatives, there is only a right, as Starr revealingly wrote, to a "private family life" (emphasis added). A private, nonfamily life is fair game for prosecution and exposure.
No conservative thinker has done more to advance this new moralism than William Kristol, best known for his urbane appearances on "This Week With Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts," and about as close as Washington has to a dean of intellectual conservatism. And no journal has done more to propagate, defend and advance this version of conservatism than the magazine Kristol edits, The Weekly Standard, founded in 1995 by Rupert Murdoch. Most of this year, Kristol and The Standard have gleefully egged on Republicans in their moral crusade. As early as May -- at a time when it seemed the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal might dissipate -- Kristol urged Republican Congressional candidates to forget other issues in the fall and campaign solely on the issue of the President's morals. "If Republicans do that," he argued, "they will win big in November. And their victory will be more than a rejection of Clinton. It will be a rejection of Clintonism -- a rejection of defining the presidency, and our public morality, down."
His magazine has been relentless in presenting the scandal as a moral crisis for the nation. Thanks to the President's affair with Lewinsky, The Standard's writers were finally able to see unreservedly in Clinton what they had desperately tried to see in him from the start, but which Clinton's own conservatism had blurred: the apotheosis of the 1960's. The Clinton White House, in the liberated words of Peter Collier in The Standard, is "a place where denatured New Left politics meets denatured New Age therapeutics." In February, The Standard put on its cover a cartoon of Clinton-as-satyr on the White House lawn grappling with a nude Paula Jones and a nude Monica Lewinsky, surrounded by other naked women in bushes and on a swing, with the one-word headline, "Yow!" Almost 1 out of 2 subsequent covers in 1998 have focused on the Lewinsky affair. One of the few breaks from Lewinsky coverage was a September cover article on Clinton's alleged genesis. "1968: A Revolting Generation Thirty Years On," the headline blared. The connection with Clinton was not exactly underplayed.
But perhaps no edition of The Standard captured the current state of American conservatism better than the one that came out immediately after the Starr report was made public. Its cover portrayed Starr as Mark McGwire, with the headline: "Starr's Home Run." Inside, page after page of anti-Clinton coverage, anchored by an essay by Kristol advocating a full House vote for impeachment of the President within a month, was followed by a long, surreal article by a reporter attending a four-day World Pornography Conference. Six pages of explicit sex, interspersed with coy condescension, followed. (The cover teased with the headline: "Among the Pornographers.") One of many graphic scenes in the article occurs in a ladies restroom: "Unprompted, Dr. Susan Block removes a rubber phallus from her purse and hikes up her assistant LaVonne's dress, baring her derriere. Block paddles it and kisses it while LaVonne coos." The article was so lurid that The Standard's editors prefaced it with a note: "Because of the subject matter, some material in this article is sexually explicit and may offend some readers." The weird porno-puritanism of the Starr report does not exist, it seems, in a vacuum. It comes out of a degenerated conservative political and literary culture.
The only issue to rival Lewinsky for prominence among conservative intellectuals in 1998 was homosexuality. But in some ways, this was only apposite. For the new conservatives, the counterattack on homosexual legitimacy is of a piece with the battle against Presidential adultery. They see no distinction between an argument for same-sex marriage, for example, and a Presidential defense of adultery, because in their eyes, there is no context in which a homosexual relationship can be moral. Homosexuality, for the puritanical conservatives, is not a condition or even a way of life; it is a disease. And again, the intellegentsia led the way -- with Kristol at the heart of it.
If most Americans were a little surprised by the religious right's advertising campaign last July in defense of "curing" homosexuals, then they had not been following closely the drift on the intellectual right. As usual, Bill Kristol was at the heart of it. In June 1997, he gave the concluding address at a Washington conservative conference dedicated, as its brochure put it, to exposing homosexuality as "the disease that it is." Kristol shared the podium with a variety of clergy members and therapists who advocated a spiritual and psychoanalytic "cure" for homosexuals. One speaker, a priest, described homosexuality as "a way of life that is marked by compulsion, loneliness, depression and disease," comprising a "history-limiting horizon of a sterile worldview divorced from the promise and peril of successor generations." Another speaker decried legal contraception and abortion as the "homosexualization of heterosexual sex," and bemoaned that nonprocreative trends among white Europeans was leading to "race death."
In the broad advertising campaign last summer, sponsored by groups allied with those who organized the D.C. conference, homosexuals were portrayed as sick and in need of therapy. The notion that homosexuality was involuntary was dismissed, with Starr-like certainty, as a violation of "the truth." The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, said that homosexuals were guilty not of a public crime, but of a private "sin." Again, The Standard had pioneered this politics, routinely decrying any public destigmatization of homosexuals, and calling, in one article in late 1996, for the "reaffirmation by states of a sodomy law" that would imprison gay men for private sex as a counterstrike against the threat of same-sex marriage.
The weekly Standard's obsession with the Lewinsky scandal and homosexuality may seem an odd conjunction of issues, but the joint crusades have uncanny echoes in the halls of Congress. So Representative Bob Barr was the pioneer of the Defense of Marriage Act, and the author of the first resolution to impeach the President. And Trent Lott, while leading the charge against the President's immorality in recent weeks, also insured that the nomination of James Hormel as U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg was held up purely because of Hormel's homosexuality. And among the most aggressive supporters of impeachment -- the House Judiciary Committee members Charles T. Canady and Bob Inglis, for example -- have been the most virulently hostile to gay rights in the current Congress.
But there is one issue above all others at the center of this new conservatism. That issue is not adultery or even homosexuality, although both have come to play a significant part in it. It is abortion. Its importance to the new generation of conservative intellectuals is easily underestimated, and far too easily ascribed simply to the influence of religious activists. In fact, abortion is at the center of current Republican orthodoxy as much because of conservative intellectuals as evangelical activists. Since this may not be self-evident, I'll let one of those intellectuals stress it himself. Here is a writer in The Standard, taking a rare break earlier this year from the Lewinsky obsession:
Republicans talk a lot about being a majority party, about becoming a governing party, about shaping a conservative future. Roe and abortion are the test. For if Republicans are incapable of grappling with this moral and political challenge; if they cannot earn a mandate to overturn Roe and move toward a post-abortion America, then in truth, there will be no conservative future. Other issues are important, to be sure, and a governing party will have to show leadership on those issues as well. But Roe is central.. . .
Who wrote this paragraph? Pat Robertson? Patrick Buchanan? Randy Tate? The answer, again, is William Kristol. His seamless merging of the Lewinsky scandal with the right's other social concerns is perhaps what makes him so integral to the new conservatism. Always, however, the key social issue is abortion. He put the argument most revealingly in the February 1997 issue of the neoconservative political monthly Commentary. "The truth is," Kristol wrote, "that abortion is today the bloody crossroads of American politics. It is where judicial liberation (from the Constitution), sexual liberation (from traditional mores) and women's liberation (from natural distinctions) come together. It is the focal point for liberalism's simultaneous assault on self-government, morals and nature. So, challenging the judicially imposed regime of abortion-on-demand is key to a conservative reformation in politics, in morals, and in beliefs."
The choice of words is revealing here. Not just politics, a realm conservatives were once comfortable restricting themselves to, but "morals" and "beliefs." And not revolution or reform but "reformation." Kristol's conservatism is happy with the vocabulary of religious war. Earlier this year, Kristol argued that "abortion is likely to emerge as the central issue in the Presidential campaign of 2000."
In the 1980's, the outlawing of abortion was framed in the somewhat liberal terms of saving human life, and protecting human rights. And that is why a smattering of left-leaning intellectuals also signed on as anti-abortion advocates. But in the 1990's, the conservative emphasis has changed. Now the banning of abortion is linked primarily to an attack on the Supreme Court's judicial activism in other areas as well (prayer in schools, women's equality and gay rights foremost among them) and to the more general sexual liberty of the society as a whole. Abortion is central to a reassertion of what Kristol called "traditional mores" and of "natural distinctions" between the sexes. It is not unrelated to the Lewinsky obsession and the anti-gay crusade. In fact, it is the anchor of both.
Bizarrely enough, abortion has even come to play a role in the reformulation of Republican foreign policy. After all, the main obstacle to Republican financing of the United Nations has not been that body's wasteful bureaucracy, or even the U.N.'s infringement of American sovereignty, but rather its support of birth-control initiatives in the developing world. And the critical issue that seems to have tilted the right toward rampant hostility to China has not so much been Beijing's Communist regime or its militarism but Beijing's specifically anti-Christian bent.
In a long article two years ago in Foreign Affairs that Kristol co-wrote with another Standard regular, Robert Kagan, the connection between domestic puritanism and foreign-policy interventionism was made explicit: "The remoralization of America at home," Kristol and Kagan wrote, "ultimately requires the remoralization of American foreign policy."
China has been the case study, becoming the overwhelming foreign-policy obsession of the fin-de-siecle right. Kristol and The Standard have long advocated a policy of containment and economic sanctions against China almost identical to the one fashioned for the Soviet Union for several decades. Kristol has also argued for a large increase in defense spending and a policy of international isolation of the Chinese. The posture against China is not related to Beijing's puny military power as such, but to its moral indecency. Gone is the realism that was once the hallmark of conservative foreign policy.
Kristol's "remoralization" model here might seem, on first glance, to be Ronald Reagan. But it is interesting to see the differences between the Reaganism of the 1980's and Kristolism of the late 1990's. The historical context is the most striking contrast. Reagan tackled a monolithic, militarized Soviet state with global ambitions, military occupation of half of Europe and Central Asia and an arsenal immensely larger than China's is today. Although Reagan didn't hesitate to talk about Soviet Communism in moral terms, he was also a foreign-policy realist who deftly changed tack when he saw that real change had occurred within the Soviet bloc. Reagan's foreign-policy moralism was also, with regard to China, far less strident than with regard to the Soviet Union, precisely because Beijing had never entertained the global ambitions of Moscow, and also because he recognized the economic and social freedoms that were even then making China a vastly different country -- and a far more complex diplomatic problem -- than the Soviet Union.
In the same way, it's worth remembering that Reagan's domestic moralism was also of a very different variety than that of today's conservatives. Rather than sternly criticizing liberal mores, Reagan tended to ignore them, preferring to praise conservative ones, finding in small human examples object lessons of traditional virtue. It was occasionally a goofy moralism, but also a sunny one. Rather than pinpoint moral demons, Reagan would point out moral heroes in the gallery of the Congress during his State of the Union addresses. Whereas conservatives in the 1990's obsessed about Clinton's draft-dodging, Reagan went to Normandy to eulogize a different kind of ethic. It is a telling contrast.
Reagan's view of America was never bleak, and he was careful to stay away from the front lines of the cultural wars. Although he was nominally anti-abortion, for example, he never attended an anti-abortion rally. Moralism, for him, was always a vague but essentially positive construct. As a divorced man who rarely went to church, this was a fittingly modest -- and conservative -- approach to the world. And it was far more in touch with the center of American culture.
Kristol's version of Reaganism, in other words, is an oddly displaced one. It transfers concepts -- like containment -- to a historical context in which they no longer make sense, and a sensibility -- moralism -- in a way that inverts its original spirit. Reagan's heirs of the 1990's have turned the man into an ism, his sense of right into orthodoxy, his smile into a scowl.
And they have done so with a vehemence and activism that can only be called characterologically leftist. Of course, because so many of the neoconservatives once hailed from the left, this imprint is unsurprising. It manifests itself in the structures of old-left activity: the magazines and journals dedicated to the correct line; the messianic faith in the capacity of politics to transform the world; the infighting, and the incessant definition and redefinition of ideology. One of the best descriptions of this evolution actually occurred in The Standard, expressed by a conservative writer with a bent for subtlety, David Brooks. It is from an article on "Rich Republicans," a group despised by the troops of the far right and treated with thinly veiled disdain by the magazine. But Brooks put his finger on a critical shift in conservatism in a rare moment of Standard self-awareness:
It used to be liberals who railed against the complacency of the American electorate, but now it's conservatives who long to see a little more mass outrage. It used to be liberals who based their politics on abstract notions more than concrete realities, but now it's conservatives who like to emphasize that ideas have consequences. It used to be liberal intellectuals who longed for the drama and turmoil that put them center stage, but now the habits of the New Class, both good and bad, have migrated rightward.
That is putting it mildly.
But if you want to go to the spiritual nerve center of the new conservatism, you have to dig deeper than the weekly journalism of The Standard, and examine the other major new conservative journal of the 1990's, First Things. Few people outside the conservative new class will have heard of the monthly, which is devoted to matters of politics, culture and religion, and edited by a former left-wing activist turned Catholic neoconservative priest, Rev. Richard John Neuhaus. But like The Standard, it is very much of its time, and like The Standard, too, it is deeply influential. Its editorial board includes respected scholars of the communitarian right, like George Weigel, Mary Ann Glendon and Michael Novak; the neoconservative doyenne, Midge Decter, is also on the board.
Reading through the pages of First Things, one begins to understand why conservatism as a political movement has become, in many ways, a somewhat strained version of a neoreligious revival. A key phalanx of its intellectual gurus has, in fact, abandoned the secular underpinnings of the American constitutional experiment as a whole. These writers have been dubbed "theo-conservatives," because of their religious bent. And, indeed, the intellectual basis on which their politics is built is a radically theocratic reinterpretation of the Constitution itself.
"The great majority of those who signed the Declaration of Independence ," Neuhaus wrote in the November 1997 edition of First Things, "and of those who wrote and ratified the Constitution thought themselves to be orthodox Christians, typically of Calvinist leanings. It never entered their heads that in supporting this new order they were signing on to a minimalist creed incompatible with their Christian profession."
So the distinction between church and state, in Neuhaus's mind, has been vastly overplayed. All that the Constitution instituted, he would argue, was that no single religious group would become the official religion of the Government. The Constitution certainly did not imply that Christianity would be forbidden to dominate the public ethos and institutions of American government.
That same order should, according to Neuhaus, apply today. For the theo-conservatives, the secular neutrality of modern American law and government is, in fact, no neutrality at all, but the willful imposition by liberal elites of what Neuhaus has dubbed "secular monism." Neuhaus has no compunction in arguing that government itself -- and its constitutional instrument, the Supreme Court -- should uphold as public policy and law the articles of faith of orthodox Christians. The current secular order, he maintains, amounts to "the exclusion of the deepest convictions of most Americans from our politics and law" -- what Neuhaus calls "perverse pluralism."
What of non-Christian minorities in this divinely sanctioned order? What of those who do not, for example, adhere to Kenneth Starr's view of "private family life," or who do not even adhere to Christianity? Neuhaus insists that he doesn't want "a sacred public square, but a civil public square." Nevertheless, his main guarantee that non-Christian minorities would not be excluded from power is that Christians themselves would be urged to exercise "renewed opposition to every form of invidious prejudice or discrimination." The guarantee of minority freedom, in other words, would be majority benevolence. It is perhaps unsurprising that when Neuhaus gathered a group of public thinkers and ministers to endorse a statement reflecting this orthodoxy, in October 1997, there were no Jews among the signers.
It is also unsurprising that the object of this group of thinkers' deepest animosity is the current Supreme Court, the critical enforcer of what the magazine has dubbed "thinly disguised totalitarianism." The Court's deference to cultural pluralism and its defense of individual conscience and a right to privacy against communal and religious authority is anathema to the theo-conservatives. But even the most dogged critics of the theo-conservatives failed to anticipate the lengths to which they would go in pressing their case. In what became an infamous ideological fracas two years ago, First Things actually argued for seditious activities on the part of conservative Christians "ranging from noncompliance to civil disobedience to morally justified revolution" against what it called, with echoes of the new left, the "morally illegitimate" American "regime."
The critical backdrop to this, of course, is the intellectual right's conception of the continued ascendancy of 60's liberalism. The pages of The Standard and First Things are crammed with horror at the decline of American politics and culture into nihilism, self-indulgence and rampant liberal individualism. In this picture of moral chaos, there is little space for nuance. So Bill Clinton, arguably the most conservative Democratic President since Truman, becomes, for these conservatives, the apex of 1960's liberalism. The fact that he balanced the budget, signed welfare-reform legislation, has shredded many civil liberties in the war against terrorism, is in favor of the death penalty and signed the Defense of Marriage Act is immaterial to his conservative enemies. For the model of cultural collapse to work, Clinton must represent its nadir.
In the same way, the decade of the 1990's, which has seen cultural and social conservatism spread throughout the middle classes, and Republican control of House and Senate, is, to these intellectuals, a decade of unabashed liberal hegemony. The country may seem quiescent, even conservative, but a radical liberal takeover is still in full swing. Here is the novelist Mark Helprin, former speech writer for Bob Dole and darling of the Wall Street Journal op-ed page, on the necessity for full-scale cultural war at the end of the century. Writing in Commentary last winter, he called the Democrats "proponents of a revolution in American life in which the tough talk came in the 60's and the sweet talk comes now."
But though their revolution may be swathed in positiveness and pleasantries it is a revolution nonetheless.
It is a revolution in which individual rights have become group rights, in which responsibility has become entitlement, marriage has become divorce, birth has become abortion, medicine has become euthanasia, homosexuality is a norm, murder is neither a surprise nor necessarily punishable, pornography is piped into almost every home, gambling is legal, drugs are rife, students think Alaska is an island south of Los Angeles and mothers of small children are sent off to war with great fanfare and pride.
By any measure, this is an extraordinary outpouring of anxiety. It is also, in almost all of its particulars, false. To take a few examples: Helprin claims that murder is neither a surprise nor necessarily punishable at the end of the century. Yet in the 1990's, murder rates have been dropping precipitously, and the prison population and execution rate are at record highs. Helprin claims drugs are rife. Yet drug use is far below the levels of two decades ago. He says that responsibility has become entitlement. Yet a Democratic President recently ended the Federal welfare entitlement and welfare rolls have been free-falling nationwide. He argues that marriage has become divorce. Yet again, divorce rates have been steadily dropping for a decade. He says that birth has become abortion. And yet abortion rates are now at their lowest since 1975. One begins to wonder what country Helprin is living in.
Indeed, it seems at times as if conservatives in the last few years have been unable to take yes for an answer. As the country becomes more conservative, the right sees liberalism everywhere. It is almost as if the habits of beleaguerment have completely blinded conservative intellectuals to their own success. They need the adrenaline rush of persecution and the thrill of ideological battle. So if the enemy doesn't exist, they need to invent one, by concocting ever more fanciful conspiracies of the left, by fatally misreading the character and politics of Bill Clinton, by constructing a Manichaean cultural universe where good and bad are always inseparable from right and left and where politics is always a war and never a conversation. And so an era of peace and prosperity and conservative cultural values has been transformed in their eyes into a liberal hell. These conservatives have become like Japanese soldiers on a distant island who don't realize the war is over. And even when they're told, they disbelieve it, because they need the war, even if the war itself has no reality except in the prose of Mark Helprin.
If one man alone could personify this hysterical pessimism about America, it would have to be Robert Bork. There are perhaps few more tragic examples of the degeneration of conservatism into puritanism than this once-piercing intellectual. Not so long ago, Bork was a pillar of conservative intellectual rigor and elegance. To be sure, his constitutional views placed him well outside the mainstream of liberal legal discourse, but even his enemies credited him with philosophical consistency, a sometimes tart and witty pen and a brilliant legal mind. He was famously subjected to one of the most scurrilous attempts to smear a Supreme Court nominee in recent history. (For the record, I supported Bork's nomination and wrote one of the first articles attacking his opponents for extremism and inaccuracy.)
But even in the wake of that inevitably embittering experience, Bork kept his cool. His memoir-cum-essay after the event, "The Tempting of America," was a restrained, sometimes funny, always compelling defense of extreme judicial passivity in constitutional law. In that book, he was firm even with the ideologues of his own side, warning conservatives not to respond to liberals in kind, nor to appoint an ideologically conservative judiciary, which would be just as activist as the alternative. "Conservatives," he wrote, "who now, by and large, want neutral judges, may decide to join the game and seek activist judges with conservative views. Should that come to pass, those who have tempted the courts to political judging will have gained nothing for themselves but will have destroyed a great and essential institution."
Not many people outside conservative activist circles seem to have read Bork's latest book, published in 1996, but it became a New York Times best seller on the strength of its sales to conservative book clubs alone. It was called "Slouching Towards Gomorrah." In it, Bork describes contemporary America as a hellish "moral chaos," "punctuated by spasms of violence and eroticism." He predicts "the coming of a new Dark Ages." Much of this, he argues, is the product of modern liberalism, which has destroyed constitutional democracy by fomenting radical individualism and egalitarianism. Far from being in a conservative era, today's America, according to Bork, is dominated by the left, which has no viable opposition: "There is no group of comparable size and influence to balance the extremists of modern liberalism, no 'right' that has a similarly destructive program in mind."
The only hope, Bork posits, is "the rise of an energetic, optimistic and politically sophisticated religious conservatism." Thus the prophet of judicial restraint puts his weight behind the untrammeled religious right, just as surely as Kristol and Neuhaus.
The extremity of Bork's oratory is matched only by the simplicity of his argument. He makes almost no distinctions between the Clintonian liberalism of the 1990's and the radicalism of the 1960's. It is, for Bork, all of a piece. A President whose economic policy is designed to please bond traders, who bombs Sudan and Afghanistan without warning and who declares that the era of big government is over is simply a cover for liberal radicalism. And the agenda is terrifying: "Modern liberalism," Bork avers, the descendant and spiritual heir of the New Left, is what fascism looks like when it has captured significant institutions, most notably the universities, but has no possibility of becoming a mass movement or of gaining power over government or the broader society through force or the threat of force." The Clintons, it seems, are Nazis manques.
One pillar of Bork's case is that liberalism cannot win democratically, so it uses the courts and the executive to flout the popular will. And yet, at the same time, the people, in Bork's view, are depraved as well, spawning a popular culture that is in "a free fall, with the bottom not yet in sight." Indeed, Bork's book was an early indicator of a new theme among conservatives: not simply a hatred of liberal elites, but a contempt for the mass of Americans. Such disdain, of course, has come to a head during the Lewinsky affair. As public indifference to the scandal has continued, and as Clinton's approval ratings have remained buoyant despite a pitiless series of embarrassments, the new conservatives have had little alternative but to blame Americans for their lack of judgment.
Hence the title of William Bennett's latest book, "The Death of Outrage." Hence the religious-right icon James Dobson's recent statement of disappointment in the American people in a letter to his group, Focus on the Family. "What has alarmed me throughout this episode," Dobson wrote, "has been the willingness of my fellow citizens to rationalize the President's behavior even as they suspected, and later knew, he was lying. I am left to conclude that our greatest problem is not in the Oval Office. It is with the people of this land."
Once upon a time, this kind of distaste for America was the preserve of liberals and leftists who made up what was called the "Blame America First" crowd. Today's conservatives have added a new twist to this. They are in danger of becoming the "Blame Americans First" crowd. Bork is particularly caustic in this regard. Here is his assessment of popular culture at the end of the century: "What America increasingly produces and distributes is now propaganda for every perversion and obscenity imaginable. If many of us accept the assumptions on which that is based, and apparently many do, then we are well on our way to an obscene culture."
The only possible hope in all this, according to Bork, is either a fundamentalist religious revival, or a sobering great depression. (Bork seems to welcome both possibilities.) Or, if all else fails, a restitution of government censorship. In an interview last year with the magazine Christianity Today, Bork was refreshingly candid about this. He would gladly use government power to restrict the dissemination of objectionable speech and images. When asked by the magazine what an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer would say about this, Bork replied that the lawyer would say, " 'You are inhibiting my liberty and my right to express myself.' And the answer to that is, Yes, that is precisely what we are after."
Thus modern conservatism, which began as a movement of personal liberation from the state and intellectual skepticism in response to ideological certainty, has become its precise opposite. Convinced that society is in mortal moral and cultural peril, the most influential conservative intellectuals have made their peace with big government, censorship and the presence of sectarian dogma in politics. The supremacy of this way of thinking among conservatives is perhaps best illustrated by David Frum, a young writer who has long supported a more economically based conservatism, one that would return the movement to its 1980's emphasis on tax cuts and smaller government. But his rationale for such a move in his recent book, "Dead Right," is revealing. He wants to limit government not to expand personal freedom, but to so rob the middle class of financial security that they would have little choice but to return to the social mores of the 1950's. In order not to fall through the widening cracks of the vanishing welfare state, Americans would have no option, Frum argues, but to strengthen family ties, avoid divorce and cling more carefully to children, spouses and parents.
In other words, even those conservative thinkers who still argue for a low-tax, small-government philosophy have been unable to make headway with their peers without cloaking their case in the austerity of moral revival. The blithe optimism of Reagan, the joy that conservatives once took in the sheer unpredictability of a free people in a free society, has been replaced by a dark dread of how people could misuse such freedom, and the desperate need to coerce them back into line.
In the 1990's, as America has experienced a phenomenal burst of new wealth, as conservative values have enjoyed a revival among the young, as divorce and abortion have dropped, as welfare has been transformed and fiscal prudence restored, intellectual conservatives have responded by launching a bitter crusade to save the country from hell. No wonder that during the Lewinsky matter, Republicans consistently misread the public mood and the popular culture. No wonder they managed to let one of the most duplicitous Presidents in history seem an object of unjust persecution. No wonder they have yet no clue how to engage or inspire the vibrant, new America that their predecessors did so much to bring about.
This is not to say, of course, that morality is not an important, or an importantly conservative, issue. Conservatives have always been concerned with morality -- and rightly so. They have long understood that political order rests upon a vibrant civil society, and on the morality that such a society sustains. But conservatives have also always been aware of the dangers of excessively policing that morality, and of the evils that can occur when the morally certain gain power. Hence the apparent conservative paradox. Conservatives want morality but they don't want the big government that could effectively enforce it. For true conservatives, the evils of moral chaos are usually outweighed by the evils of a moralizing big brother.
And so conservatives have learned over the years to live with a little paradox. They have resisted the temptation either to become morally indifferent libertarians or to become morally repugnant ideologues. Although they have worried about moral and social trends, they have resisted easy pessimism and the jeremiad. And they have left the impositions of morals to the churches and preachers and mothers and fathers and teachers and friends of America to sort out. When it comes to preaching, true conservatives would much prefer to praise the examples of Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa than to demonize the likes of Dennis Rodman or Marv Albert.
Above all, true conservatives have not been depressed by freedom. This, after all, is where the modern conservative movement in America started in the 1950's -- in a revolt against the creeping power of the postwar welfare state. When American conservatives lose sight of that central strain in their philosophy, when their love of freedom becomes an afterthought to their concern for morality, then they lose sight of what makes them both conservative and quintessentially American. They lose sight of what distinguishes them from the darker history of European conservatism, and what sets them apart even from the government-friendly Toryism of their English cousins.
Truly American conservatives would not recoil at the greater liberty enjoyed by women, racial minorities and homosexuals, as the truly American conservative Barry Goldwater showed. In the last decade, true American conservatives would have been heartened by the declines in divorce, crime and teen-age births, and encouraged by the move among gay people for more stable, responsible relationships. They would have been elated by the collapse of collectivism and totalitarianism abroad, and encouraged by the return of fiscal prudence and social responsibility at home. They would have seen in Bill Clinton a dangerous proclivity for dishonesty and abuse of power, but they would not have seen him as the degenerate apotheosis of an entire generation -- let alone an entire nation. And they would have seen the emergence of religious dogmatists on the far right as a threat to constitutional order and political civility, not as a boon for votes.
Above all, they would not have fatally overplayed their hand and tried to impeach a President not for illegality but for immorality, and they wouldn't have shredded the virtues of privacy and decency and common sense for the emotional release of a cultural jihad. Today's conservatives -- the intellectuals in particular -- have begun to replace skepticism with certainty, faith in ordinary people with contempt for the masses, religion with theocracy. These are fools' bargains. And unworthy of conservatism itself.
Moreover, this shift has also undoubtedly weakened, rather than strengthened, the ability of conservatives to address moral issues in a limited but compelling way. When conservative extremists accuse Bill Clinton of murder, when Republicans make a divisive, difficult issue like abortion a litmus test for moral purity, then most Americans will be reluctant to listen to them when they worry about illegitimacy, juvenile crime or Presidential law-breaking. Conservative moralizing, in other words, requires a certain temperance to be truly effective.
Of course, conservatives have now achieved a political ascendancy regardless of these mistakes. Thanks in part to the collapse of the liberal alternative, and to the self-destruction of Bill Clinton, the flaws of religious zeal and moral authoritarianism have not prevented conservatives' rise to cultural and political power. That makes the danger of hubris all the greater and the need for self-restraint all the more pressing. In the past, conservatives have rightly been praised as much for what they haven't done as for what they have. Maybe today's conservative generation, poised on the brink of unprecedented power, will heed that lesson. But maybe, God help us, they won't.

HEADLINE: Put Zoning to Work For Central-City Industry

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "Little Industries Mean a Lot to Manhattan" (Viewpoint, Sept. 13), Joel Kotkin raises an important warning flag about New York City's increasing overreliance on financial services and its concomitant neglect of manufacturing. 
 For contrast, consider two prominent examples of pro-manufacturing zoning and planning in the last decade: in Chicago and in Portland, Ore.
Chicago has created Planned Manufacturing Districts, or P.M.D.'s, where only industrial uses are allowed in industrial areas that are under pressure from one of the hottest loft condominium markets in the country. Chicago has also invested millions of dollars to make its infrastructure more functional for central-city manufacturers and to make manufacturing areas better known and more attractive. As a result, city officials say, Chicago has halted the decline in manufacturing jobs and has been competitive with suburban locations for manufacturing plants.
Portland, under the prod of state planning law, has created "industrial sanctuaries," which are restricted to manufacturing and industrial uses. These sanctuaries have attracted new plants and plant expansions -- and one of them, the Central Eastside Industrial District, even has its name on a freeway exit.
Chicago's goals in creating P.M.D.'s centered on retaining good jobs for people without college degrees, the majority of the population. (These jobs are not provided by media and business services, two types of businesses cited in the column as replacing manufacturing in New York.) Portland's aim has been to maintain industrial services to its downtown core and diversity in its economy. All these goals are important for New York, too.
I helped develop a plan for the older industrial district in Berkeley, Calif. As in Chicago and Portland, it was found that many manufacturers would like to stay in the city and would do so if policies were reasonably supportive. In the last five years, the Berkeley plan has attracted new industries and retained old ones in a city once seen as inexorably post-industrial.
New York City exerts tremendous efforts to regulate land use -- witness the drive against adult-oriented businesses. It also devotes tremendous resources to economic development.
If the city harnessed these resources to protect and expand manufacturing, which Mr. Kotkin correctly identifies as crucial, there could be a significant impact.

HEADLINE: Panel Calls for Limit on Airport Expansion

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
FURTHER expansion of the County Airport should be severely curtailed or halted altogether because of quality-of-life and environmental issues affecting residents, airport neighbors and especially the adjacent Kensico Reservoir.
Those conclusions were presented to the Environment Committee of the Board of Legislators last Tuesday by representatives of several citizen task forces established by the Citizens' Advisory Subcommittee of the Environment Committee. The Citizens' Advisory Subcommittee had been appointed by the Environment Committee to study the airport. 
 "We were given carte blanche by the legislature's Committee on the Environment," said Julius Shultz, who is a member of the citizens' advisory subcommittee. "We were talking about the greater issues that affect the airport, like noise pollution, air pollution, ground water and runoff. We feel that quality-of-life issues affect the economy."
While neighboring residents -- especially members of the Purchase Friends Meeting whose silent Sunday morning worship has frequently been disrupted by the roar of planes overhead -- as well as county residents from as far away as Somers and Hawthorne have complained about airport noise for the last few years, noise is not the only environmental problem.
Of particular concern to members of the subcommittee, who echoed similar themes whether they spoke for the economic task force, the environmental task force or the maintenance and expansion task force, was the impact on Kensico Reservoir. It supplies the county with 85 percent of its drinking water and also supplies a majority of New York City's water. Its proximity to the airport, however, means that the reservoir is subject to storm water runoff, which includes chemicals like petroleum products and de-icing fluids. Recently, some airport drainage was diverted to Rye Lake, which flows into Long Island Sound.
"At first, I thought of the airport as purely a noise issue," said Ellen Kaidanow, a member of the citizens' advisory committee and chairwoman of the town of Harrison's airport advisory committee. "I realized after working on the committee that water is as important. The airport is sitting right on top of the water supply for 10 million people. The runoff has been going to Kensico. Recently, it has been re-directed to Blind Brook, which means it ultimately ends up in Long Island Sound. We want the legislature to look at where the runoff is going. We want to protect the water now so we don't have to build a water-filtration plant. Any revenue gained from airport expansion will be wiped out if we have to build a filtration plant."
Possible threats to the adjacent watershed are serious, said Peter Dermody, a senior hydrogeologist with the Long Island-based concern of Fanning, Phillips & Molnar Engineers, who acted as consultant for the subcommittee.
"De-icing fluid has gone into Rye Lake," Mr. Dermody said. "This is causing a degrading of the water quality in Rye Lake. Because they de-ice at the airport, the proposed expansion would lead to an expansion in the rate of pollutant loading. Our position is that there have been impacts to the environment from airport activities. The expansion of the airport would lead to an increased rate of degradation in water quality."
In the view of Ronald B. Bianchi, Supervisor-Mayor of Harrison, the reckoning from the airport's environmental impact is already at hand. "The runoff of de-icing chemicals goes into the Rye Lake reservoir system," he said. "It's a terrible runoff problem. The county has been on a campaign to clean up the Hudson River and Long Island Sound. Do they want to risk Long Island Sound just to keep the airport in existence? My town and I are against any expansion of this airport.
"The airport has caused a financial burden. We buy our water from New York City, which gets it from Kensico. Harrison owns 45 percent of the Westchester Joint Waterworks, along with the village of Mamaroneck and the town of Mamaroneck. Because of the runoff from the airport, our water doesn't meet standards. That water is not as clean as the water upstream or the water downstream as a result of the airport runoff. The town of Harrison has had to pay $1.7 million to buy the real estate for a filtration plant and will have to share the cost of a $25 million to $30 million filtration plant."
The citizens' advisory committee recommended that the county agree to accept zero tolerance for environmental damage at the airport. It also recommended that the county conduct detailed studies to identify and determine the types of damage, enact legislation to protect the Kensico Reservoir and Blind Brook, extend the Terminal Capacity Agreement and require a mandatory curfew for all aircraft.
But not every committee member endorsed all the recommendations. Vic Weinstein, a Tarrytown businessman, submitted his own report to highlight the airport's benefits.
"I think you need to look at what the airport has done in terms of being a major factor in the economic viability in this region," he said. "As a result of airport activities, over $600 million is annually contributed to the local economy. Westchester competes with Long Island, New Jersey and the entire metropolitan area for corporate occupants. Many corporations, when looking to relocate, consider proximity to an airport a major factor. Without the airport, many companies would not have considered Westchester for their facility."
The airport, which has often been a source of political tension and conflict, not only between its neighbors and management but also between the executive and legislative branches of county government in recent years, is now operating in a different environment.
"When Andy Spano ran, he made a commitment that the airport would be a good neighbor and that he would oppose any future expansion of the airport," said Larry Schwartz, chief adviser to the County Executive, who was in China and unable to attend the conference. "This administration's committment is to make sure this airport is a good neighbor. We want to protect and preserve the quality of life. We want to know what the issues are. I give you our word that we will not do anything without consulting you."
Although the citizens' advisory subcommittee was limited to making recommendations, legislators emphasized that its role was not mere window dressing.
"We gave the committee a specific charge to give us specific recommendations that we can institute or change," said Michael Kaplowitz, chairman of the Board's Committee on the Environment. "If we can make this a better airport, tell us how."

State Adds to Subsidies to Spur Home Ownership

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
TWO state initiatives aimed at increasing home ownership in New Jersey, especially in cities, received new infusions of money last week. One program helps developers build houses, while the other helps people buy them.
On Wednesday, Jane M. Kenny, Commissioner of the state's Department of Community Affairs, which oversees housing issues, announced that the state was making $107.5 million in below-market-rate mortgages and construction financing available under the programs. She made the announcement at the Governor's fourth annual conference on housing and community development, held at the Robert Treat Hotel in Newark. 
 Under the Dream Come True Mortgage program, the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency is offering $70 million in 30-year fixed-rate mortgages at a 5 percent interest rate, with no points and a down payment as low as 3 percent. There are qualifying requirements on income and purchase price and mortgage insurance may also be needed. The loans will be available statewide to first-time home buyers through 55 participating lenders.
This is the second time the state has offered such loans. Last year, an initial $70 million was committed and 721 loans, averaging $98,000 each, were delivered. State officials expect the same number of loans to be generated under this round of financing.
The semi-autonomous housing agency is also making $27.5 million in construction financing and $10 million in housing subsidies available under its three-year-old Urban Home Ownership Recovery Program. Under it, the agency will provide 50 percent of a construction loan and guarantee payment of the remaining 50 percent in loans made by participating lenders to spur construction or renovation of housing for people of all income levels in specific urban areas. The $10 million in subsidies helps to underwrite the cost of the low- and moderate-income units. Below-market-rate mortgages are also available to qualified buyers of these homes.
Five hundred new and renovated housing units with a total construction value of $65 million are expected to be developed under this round of the program. They will be added to the 1,647 units that have been built since the program began in 1995.
Commissioner Kenny said putting more money into the two programs was important because "they help get more people to write mortgage checks rather than rent checks and give them a stake in their community."
The programs also help the state to meet its affordable housing needs. Projections are that through 2001 the state will need 86,000 housing units affordable to people earning 50 to 80 percent of the median income in their areas.
Both programs are moving forward in anactive housing market in the state. In this year's first half, 87,000 existing single-family homes were sold in New Jersey, up 15.7 percent from the same period the previous year, according to the New Jersey Association of Realtors, which is based in Edison. Meanwhile, the median resale price of homes rose to $162,800 from $154,700. Among the reasons for the rises, the association reports, are an increase in family incomes and the availability of mortgages at low rates.
The state's Dream Come True mortgage program "may be the added incentive that will move people into a home ownership position who may otherwise be waiting on the sidelines," said Deborah De Santis, the state mortgage agency's executive director.
Like many other mortgages, current 30-year fixed-rate loans with no points, now at 6.78 percent, are at historic lows, said Keith Gumbinger, a vice president with HSH Associates, a financial publisher in Butler that surveys lenders across the country. "The world economy is confounding forecasting," he noted. "Though rates may continue to inch down a little more, there just is not that much space for them to fall much further."
Under the state mortgage program, income limits for borrowers vary according to family size and where people choose to live. For families of two or less, they range from $61,200 to $72,900, while for families of three or more they are $70,380 to $83,835.
LOANS are available for new and existing single-family homes as well as existing two- to four-family houses. But there are purchase price limits, depending on the location and size of the house. For example, the price limits for existing one-family houses range from $129,647 in Atlantic and Cape May Counties to $183,167 in Bergen and Passaic Counties. The price limits for existing two-family homes range from $144,245 in Hudson County to $206,246 in Bergen and Passaic.
Ms. De Santis said that by obtaining mortgages at 5 percent interest, buyers could not only lower their monthly cost but also afford to buy a bigger house for their money.
That was the case for Patrick and Alison Cavanaugh, who tapped the state mortgage program last year to buy a home in Brick in Ocean County. The couple, both in their 20's, relocated from a rental apartment in Boston because Mr. Cavanaugh got a job as a school psychologist and crisis counselor at the Point Pleasant school district. Mrs. Cavanaugh stays at home to care for their three children. They paid $140,000 for their three-bedroom colonial with a large backyard.
The couple originally looked at homes for $110,000 to $120,000 that had either fewer bedrooms or smaller yards, Mr. Cavanaugh said. "With the lower interest rate, we were able to buy a bigger and better house," he added, noting that their $1,100 monthly mortgage was on a par with the rent they would have paid for an apartment in the area and did not make them "house poor."
The state will begin accepting applications for the 5 percent mortgages on Tuesday.
The state is devoting an additional $37.5 million to home ownership projects in cities, where ownership rates remain low. "There continues to be a need to provide incentives to encourage developers to look at the state's central cities, some of which have not seen such construction in 20 to 25 years," Commissioner Kenny said.
It also follows the aims of the state's Development and Redevelopment Plan, which encourages growth where roads, utilities and transit are in place and discourages it in less-developed areas, she added.
Under the program, the state finance agency forms a partnership with a commercial lender to make the construction financing available and guarantees the loan, accepting the risk in case of a default. Developers receive $25,000 to $45,000 per unit to help subsidize the cost of building the low and moderate-income units. Developers must put 10 percent of their own money into the project.
Among the latest projects developed under the program is Magnolia Court, 32 single-family homes built on what once were two and a half derelict acres along Magnolia Street in the Central Ward of Newark. The $4 million project, to be completed this month, is being developed by the RPM Development Group of Montclair.
The company got $2.6 million in construction financing, half from Summit Bank and the other half from the state finance agency. The state also provided $980,000 in housing subsidies to build the two-story, 1,800-square-foot fee-simple town houses. Under fee simple, buyers own the land under their units.
"Without the state program, the housing would not have been economically feasible to build," said Ed Martoglio, a RPM principal. "But with it, we were able to build $125,000 houses that purchasers could buy for $100,000 or $80,000, depending on their income."
That, along with the 5 percent mortgages offered by the state, made the homes appealing to middle-income buyers, Mr. Martoglio said. All of the three-bedroom homes, each with a garage and front and rear yards, have been sold, he added.

HEADLINE: In the Region / Connecticut;
Offices Spread in Shore Towns Near New Haven

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
ECHOES of the commercial development that swept through suburban Fairfield County in the 1970's are reverberating eastward along the midshore suburbs of New Haven County. In quiet, upscale, residential towns like Guilford, Madison and Killingworth -- where antique homes abound, a few farms still exist and village greens remain pristine -- office building and applications for new construction are accelerating despite local concerns for preserving the New England character.
Cautiously, local officials have been approving construction of commercial buildings up to 50,000 square feet in communities where offices have been accommodated mostly by converting single-family homes. Small as the new structures are compared with those in Stamford, White Plains and New York, they loom large on such semi-
rural horizons, and apprehension over their proliferation has nudged some local planning and zoning departments into re-examining their regulations. 
 The few developers who jumped into this market early have been careful to keep their projects low in profile -- two or three stories -- and compatible with the town's general appearance. Some find that they are more readily accepted by preserving a New England architectural ambiance, while others have won approval for a bolder, contemporary big-city look.
Patrick Mahoney recalls that a few years ago, when he was northeastern regional manager for Medtronics, a Minneapolis manufacturer of pacemakers and other medical devices, "We couldn't expand our district sales office in Secaucus, N.J.; I looked at Connecticut as the center point of my geography from southern Massachusetts to the Bronx and narrowed it down to the confluence of I-95 and I-91."
After seeing dozens of unsuitable buildings in the New Haven area, he found what he was looking for at Concept Park in Guilford, a new, 50,000-square-foot, state-of-the-art office building on Route 1. "I was also relocating my family," he said. "It all made sense." The median price of a house in Guilford, known for its fine schools and homes, is $250,000, less than half that of comparable dwellings in Fairfield County.
Concept Park is built of pale beige concrete in a contemporary style. "The sophistication of the client these days requires this type of construction," said Richard Beauvais, 39, the first-time developer of the project.
"Companies will not come here into a house," he added, noting the difficulty of installing today's requirements for climate-control, communications and electronic systems in a wood-frame building.
Last year, Mr. Beauvais built an additional 28,000-square-foot building on the same 7-acre site. Both buildings are fully rented. Mr. Beauvais's newest plan, for a 58,350-square-foot black glass building on 16 acres overlooking a pond at Goose Lane, will be the subject of a public hearing on Oct. 21.
GUILFORD'S Planning and Zoning Commission is rewriting its master plan. "There is a debate going on," said George Kral, the town planner, "whether or not to continue a policy that encourages development of offices on quite a bit of available land along Route 1." None of it is zoned for retail. "We don't want to repeat the strip development you see on so much of Route 1," Mr. Karl said.
"The town does see commercial development as an economic benefit," said the First Selectman, Samuel D. Bartlett, "but there is a lot of concern about changing its character."
Kevin Geenty, head of the Geenty Group, commercial realtors in Branford, brought Medtronics and Concept Park together. "There is a pent-up demand in New Haven and Middlesex Counties for commercial and industrial space," he said. "Companies in New Haven and Hartford with nowhere to go are putting off expansion, and their employees who live in the shoreline towns would like to work closer to home."
Besides his real estate concern, Mr. Geenty owns and operates a 42-acre office and research park in Old Saybrook. Since 1991, he has built and rented six buildings totaling 186,000 square feet and will start a seventh next month.
A need for more space brought Pharmedica, a medical education, training and publishing concern, from New Haven to Killingworth, a town of 36 square miles and 5,500 people. The company has built and owns a white, New England-style, 19,000-square-foot headquarters on Route 81.
"We couldn't find anything to expand into in New Haven," said Pharmedica's president, Lawrence R. Timmerman. "We also had parking problems, we had some cars broken into, and employees who worked late were ill at ease in that environment. We finally realized we didn't have to be there anyway -- with faxes and modems we could be anywhere -- and it turned out that most of our people live east of the Quinnipiac River, making their commute much easier."
Robert Dowler, head of the Dowler Group in Madison, was the Pharmedica builder. A developer in the Connecticut midshore communities for more than 25 years, Mr. Dowler has approvals for additional buildings designed to form the Town Center of Killingworth. With Pharmedica as its anchor, the complex would have two more 20,000-square-foot buildings and one of 8,000 square feet, all white New England-style frame construction.
Like his counterpart in Guilford, Killingworth's First Selectman, David LaVasseur, is not convinced that continued commercial growth is the way to go. "We look at our town as crowded," he said. "There were only 500 of us 50 years ago. While there will be some modest development, mostly in the residential field, it will be many years before we see a major influx.
"Meanwhile, we have embarked on an aggressive policy to set aside open space for aquifer protection. Our rocky topography is such that it would be impossible to install city water and sewers required for large-scale development."
In addition to the Killingworth project, Mr. Dowler has approval from Madison to build two office campuses: Millstone Square, a two-building, three-story complex of 34,000 square feet at Mill and Cottage Roads off Route 1, and Tuxis Square, containing a three-story building and two two-story buildings totaling almost 56,000 square feet at Bradley Road. "The buildings will look like the 18th-century brick homes on Beacon Street in Boston," said Mr. Dowler, indicating his commitment to the town's historic architecture.
Expressing one more negative view of increased development, Madison's First Selectman, Thomas Rylander, said that of the town's 22,000 acres: "Ten percent is in state land, open space and watershed. The rest is almost entirely residential, and the only large parcels are residentially zoned. Commercial development will never become a major force here."
Nevertheless, Herbert D'Atri, a commercial broker with the Gould Agency in Madison, said, "the town sorely needs office space; Greenwich people come in looking for first-class offices and to move into homes here as well." Office rents in Madison and Guilford range from $16 to $22 a square foot annually, compared with $25 to more than $30 in Stamford and Greenwich.
Many companies leasing space and looking for space in the New Haven County suburbs are in the biotech and biomedical fields. Some have been spun off from research groups formed at the medical schools of Yale and the University of Connecticut, and they stand to benefit from a recently established fund created by the State Legislature to help small and midsize biotech companies grow.
The state's Department of Economic Development contributed $20 million, with $10 million more provided by Connecticut Innovations Inc., a quasi-public corporation. "Our first done deal was consummated this month with Genaissance Pharmaceutical Company Inc. of New Haven," said Stephanie Mitchell, director of marketing for the program. "We gave them $950,000 to build 8,000 square feet of lab space or convert it from existing office space."
Mr. Dowler, wary of building offices on speculation, has scheduled meetings with state officials involved in the program to explore matching his projects with companies in line for grants. The program was established to slow the movement of biotech companies from Connecticut to Maryland and South Carolina, which have had similar programs for a few years.
"Office development is a wonderful, clean way of broadening the tax base," said Michael Sexton, a director of the Mid-Shoreline Board of Realtors and vice president of H. Pearce Company Realtors in Branford. "Our towns have jealously guarded their borders from rampant commercialization, and the planning agencies are making the right decisions. I think commercial development will continue here. It is not an anomaly."

HEADLINE: Teaching the Elderly to Spot Fraud

BYLINE: By TOM CALLAHAN 

DATELINE: MOUNT VERNON

 BODY:
A RESIDENT of New Rochelle became aware of the economic waste in the Medicare system when his mother needed a special bed from a medical equipment company. Medicare paid for the bed and continued to pay for it for three months longer than it was needed, despite repeated phone calls to have it removed.
"That started me thinking if I ever get on Medicare, I'm going to pay attention to the bills," said the man, Dr. Irwin Golden, 70, who is semi-retired and has a doctorate in social work. Besides checking his own Medicare statements, Dr. Golden is a volunteer with Operation Restore Trust, a program developed by Federal and state agencies and carried out by the county's Office for the Aging. Through public presentations, the program seeks to teach the elderly how to identify and report suspicious and possibly fraudulent medical bills. 
 Federal officials estimate that fraud and waste cost the Medicare and Medicaid system $57 billion in 1997. That figure represents 15 percent of the total Medicare and Medicaid expenditures, although some analysts say the number is as high as $94 billion.
"All of us are concerned that our Medicare and Medicaid system remain viable," said Mae Carpenter, director of the Office for the Aging here. "The amount lost to fraud and waste means that premiums will eventually go up or service will be cut back or reimbursements will be cut to providers, which means they will cut back services."
Since the start of the year, 1,600 people have taken part in Operation Restore Trust at 55 presentations offered at senior citizen centers, libraries and nutrition sites in the county. The meetings are conducted by county officials and 50 volunteers. There are 100,000 Medicare beneficiaries in the Westchester, according to numbers supplied by the company that administers Medicare in this region, Empire Medicare Services of Yorktown.
When a doctor or health care provider bills Medicare for a service, Medicare sends the beneficiary a statement describing the service, when it was performed and the amount Medicare paid for it. Since Medicaid recipients do not receive a statement, it is difficult for them to detect fraud. The State Attorney General's office handles investigations involving Medicaid.
"Medicare forms are hard to read," Dr. Golden said. "I see the form as confusing. In my experience, people are afraid of taking a position regarding a doctor. They feel that the relationship they have with him has kept them healthy."
Carol Lebowitz, a Yonkers volunteer with the Operation Restore Trust program and a retired county social worker, is not yet eligible for Medicare because she is only around 60, she said. But she agreed that people were reluctant to report Medicare fraud. "I've had friends tell me that their parents might be involved with problems like these, but they don't want to admit it," she said. "So they will just stop using the doctor."
Operation Restore Trust consists of a 40-minute training session. The elderly are urged to scrutinize their statements. While doctors can make honest billing mistakes, program participants are warned about schemes in which people try to obtain Medicare numbers in return for a free service like a blood-pressure screening or consultation. The government is then billed for the services. In other cases, imposters will bill the system for thousands of dollars worth of care or equipment that is never sent to the beneficiary.
In some schemes, people will call the elderly on the phone and try to trick them into giving out their Medicare number by saying that they need it to verify their eligibility. "Medicare does not solicit over the phone or go knocking on doors to verify your insurance," said Robin Pratts Williams, a program specialist at the Office for the Aging. "If a service is free, why would you have to give your number? There are many ways to verify your age. You can show them a senior card or driver's license. I advise people not to give their Medicare number out to anybody. Guard it like a credit card."
Another common scheme involves "upcoding." This means that a health care provider performs a legitimate service and then bills the Government for a more expensive procedure. For example, a company may supply the patient with a standard wheelchair and bill the Government for an electric wheelchair. "We are not trying to scare the elderly," Ms. Williams said. "I tell them that not every provider is trying to cheat Medicare. It is only a small percentage. But that small percentage generates $57 billion in fraud each year." One problem in detecting fraud is that providers have a year to bill the system for services. Fraudulent providers will often wait months before submitting a bill, hoping to confuse the elderly victim.
"I advise people to keep a journal or write it down on a calendar when you go to a doctor," she said. "Write down what was done and use it as a reference. Then you can compare it to the Medicare statement, instead of having to rely on your memory."
For those who complain that they cannot understand the medical terminology used on statements, Ms. Williams suggested that they rely on their common sense. "If you were there for 20 minutes and get a bill for $1,000, something is wrong," she said. "You had a electrocardiogram, but the bill says it was a stress test, a red flag should go up."
If a person suspects that his bill is wrong, he should contact the Office for the Aging or the Medicare Fraud hot line. The hot line number is listed on the Medicare statement.
Ms. Williams investigates each complaint by contacting the beneficiary and the service provider. If it is a clerical mistake it can be easily resolved. But if there is a suspicion of fraud she sends a report to the fraud investigators at Empire Medicare Services, a subcontractor of Empire Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Empire administers the Medicare program for 1.2 million beneficiaries in 16 downstate counties of New York, including Westchester.
"We determine if a potential for fraud exists," said Kathy Dunphy, director of Medicare beneficiary and professional relations at Empire Medicare Services. "We'll do whatever it takes to get an overpayment back. If there is a pattern of widespread abuse, we can turn it over to the United States Attorney General's office or the F.B.I."
Since January, Ms. Williams said she has investigated 40 complaints and referred eight of them to Empire Medicare Services. Two of the cases are still being investigated. County officials refused to disclose details of the six cases that have been resolved. "That may not seem like a high number," Ms. Williams said. "But for every senior who calls and says they have been fraudulently billed, 50 will stay silent."
All officials involved in the program emphasize that every effort is made to protect the confidentiality of the person who reports a suspicious bill. For example, if a person fears they were over billed for a particular office visit, investigators will request the records of every bill the doctor posted for that day. The county is receiving $15,000 in Federal funds disbursed by the State Office for the Aging to run the program.
Operation Restore Trust will be offered on Tuesday at the Van Tassel Senior Residence in Sleepy Hollow and Wednesday at a meeting of the American Association of Retired Persons to be held at the Yorktown Cultural Center. For more information on those and future presentations or to report possible fraud, call the Office for the Aging, at (914) 665-5961. Suspected fraud can also be reported directly to Empire Medicare Services at (800) 442-8430, or to Medicare directly at (800) 447-8477.

You're Asked To Cheat. What to Do?

BYLINE: By PATRICK J. LYONS 

 BODY:
THE cynical cliche has it that "business ethics" is an oxymoron and that getting ahead requires locking one's conscience in a desk drawer. But three-quarters of working American adults say they have never been asked or told to do something they thought was unethical on the job, according to a survey by Yankelovich Partners released last week.
And of those who were, 4 in 10 said they actually did the dirty deed. 
 When the survey asked what they would do if they found out an employer was up to no good, only a handful said they would choose one of the popularly imagined horns of the dilemma -- looking the other way (9 percent) or quitting (5 percent). The vast majority, 78 percent, said they would talk to the boss or otherwise try to resolve the situation without losing their jobs, a finding that suggests most people feel they have some scope to affect ethical behavior in their workplaces. (The remaining 8 percent were unsure what they would do or gave other answers.)
Who is most often put on the spot? The survey found that slightly more men than women, and more people with some college education than those without, have been asked to do something they thought was unethical, a finding that may simply mirror differences in the kinds of jobs most often held by people in each group.
Harder to interpret is a finding that more people who live in the South and West or in rural areas in general report having been asked to transgress than people who live in the Northeast or Midwest or in towns, suburbs and cities generally. Greater rates of churchgoing in the South and in rural areas don't seem to be the reason: Responses nationwide from people who said they regularly attend religious services were no different from others' responses.
The survey of 1,002 American adults was conducted in June, before President Clinton's public acknowledgment of an inappropriate relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky or the report of the independent prosecutor, Kenneth W. Starr, to Congress.
Yankelovich Partners conducted the survey for the Lutheran Brotherhood, an organization owned by its 1.1 million Lutheran members. The group provides insurance and other financial services and operates charitable programs, and it often sponsors surveys on ethical and other issues. PATRICK J. LYONS

On the Hudson's West Bank, Optimistic Developers

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
EVEN as its steel skeleton for a 420,000-square-foot office building at 90 Hudson Street on the Jersey City waterfront is starting to rise, Hartz Mountain Industries has purchased another acre of Colgate Center where it plans to erect an identical 12-story building at a location designated as 70 Hudson Street.
Development is proceeding apace on the west bank of the Hudson River, even as nervousness in financial markets is slowing transactions in Manhattan. At its Newport development in Jersey City, the Lefrak Organization is building a 575,000-square-foot office complex. Just to the north, in Hoboken, SJP Properties has full approvals for a 1.1 million square foot office tower called Waterfront Corporate Center and expects to begin building in the spring if an anchor tenant can be signed. 
 It was the securing of an anchor tenant, the mutual fund manager Lord Abbet, to a 20-year lease for 150,000 square feet -- and the rush to meet a deadline -- that motivated the $10 million purchase of the 70 Hudson site, said Emanuel Stern, president of Hartz Mountain.
"We believe in the location and we had an option we had to execute," Mr. Stern said. He said the Lord Abbet lease at 90 Hudson, which enabled Hartz to secure longterm financing on the building, encouraged the company to invest its own money in the land at 70 Hudson.
The 70 Hudson site includes the 25-foot-high Colgate clock, which was on the roof of the Colgate-Palmolive factory at the site until the factory was closed in 1989, and will be moved before excavation begins. Its future location has not yet been decided, but people associated with the project said the intention was to place e it so that it will easily visible.
Hartz Mountain's actions at the two sites, Mr. Stern said, reflect the ability of private developers to move quickly, regardless of what is happening in securities markets.
Indeed, he expressed some glee at the
recent difficulties of real estate investment trusts, whose activities have been curtailed by their plunging stock prices. "The REIT's are dead in the water," he said. "They hit all their numbers, but Wall Street has turned fickle and they can't print stock anymore."
The REIT's, or real estate investment trusts, had been using operating partnership units, which eventually convert to common stock, to make acquisitions without immediately triggering capital gains taxes for the seller. With a low stock price, REIT's are reluctant to issue more stock and dilute the value of existing shares.
"We put our own money into our deals," said Mr. Stern. And he said that the success in finding an anchor tenant at 90 Hudson demonstrates that traditional sources of finance are available for developers who build properties that are attractive and priced properly.
"If we get tenants, then we get taken out by insurance companies and pension funds," he said, referring to the long termfinancing that replaces, or takes out, the developer's interim financing. he said.
Certainly the success of past projects is an encouragement for developers to press ahead. According to a third-quarter report by Cushman & Wakefield, the vacancy rate for Class A space in Hudson County, almost all of it on the waterfront, is just 2 percent.
With Class A vacancy rates in midtown Manhattan in the low single digits and rents rising, many firms in New York are being forced to look elsewhere in the region for office space, observes Michael T. Cohen, the president of Williams Real Estate, a Manhattan-based firm. "Most service companies in New York -- and they constitute the bulk of tenants -- are looking for rents that begin with a 2 or a 3," Mr. Cohen said, explaining that he meant rents ranging from the high $20's to low $30's per square foot annually.
"That simply is out of the question in midtown," he said, adding that some formerly fringe areas in Midtown South that had previously been available were filled up as well. Given that the buildings on the New Jersey waterfront are new and equipped with the latest technology and just a few stops on the PATH trains from Manhattan, they become an attractive alternative. "It's the sixth borough," he said.
Indeed, Steven J. Pozycki, the president of SJP Properties, said it was wrong to think of the waterfront as part of the New Jersey office market, despite the political jurisdiction. "The west bank of the Hudson is really part of the New York market," he said.
The availability of sizable tracts of land in the old industrial locations on the waterfront allows developers to offer prospective tenants large floors that are almost impossible to find in Manhattan. "We are offering floor plates of 95,000 square feet," Mr. Pozycki said. "In New York it would take two generations to assemble enough land for floors like that." Big footprints mean that buildings can be more efficient in several ways: For example, there is less need for common areas, such as elevator lobbies and reception areas, providing more work space. And 12- to 14-story buildings, which are what is being proposed and built on the waterfront, require fewer elevator shafts than much taller buildings erected on smaller plots of land.
"There is less penetration by elevators, so the space is more efficient," said Joseph Hilton, who is a managing director of CB Richard Ellis and specializes in the New Jersey waterfront. "And the availability of land means that it is easier and cheaper to build than in New York."
HE noted that the Lincoln Harbor development in Weehawken had the room to add 1.4 million square feet of office space.
Both developers and brokers emphasize the extensive transportation infrastructure of the area, with train, bus and highway links that are available to take workers from the suburban areas of New Jersey to the waterfront. And they note that the PATH trains provide quick service to both midtown and downtown Manhattan, as do a growing fleet of ferries.
In addition, construction has begun for a light-rail system on the west bank of the Hudson that will run north and south in an area where most public transportation is oriented east and west. Phase One of the systems is scheduled to be completed from Bayonne as far north as Hoboken by the spring of 2000, with further extensions under consideration.
This may add appeal for the young professionals who are drifting into places like Hoboken as it has recovered from the industrial drabness of the past. "We are seeing the children of families that moved out of Hoboken moving back in for the quality of life," observed Mr. Pozycki.
Development on the riverfront appears different from other office developments in northern New Jersey, said Norman Baker, a senior managing director of Insignia/ESG. "As New Jersey grew, people clustered near the bridge and the two tunnels," he said. "As they got comfortable they moved farther west. Companies that started out right by the bridge in Fort Lee are in Parsippany now. But the ones in Jersey City don't leave."
With rents in midtown Manhattan moving north of $40 a square foot for less than state-of-the art space, brokers say brand new waterfront space on the New Jersey side of the Hudson can be obtained from the high $20's for tenants who are the first to commit to a project to the low $30's for those who follow later.
But rents alone do not constitute the whole economic picture, real estate executives say. New Jersey does not have not have New York City's occupancy or local personal income tax and there are a variety of financial incentive programs available to further lower corporate tax bills.
"There are a lot of area development programs available and the savings can be fairly substantial," said Joseph R. Romano, executive vice president of Grubb & Ellis's New Jersey office.
Despite the attractions of the waterfront, many companies are apparently reluctant to prelease space, which favors companies like Lefrak and Hartz Mountain, which can finance their own projects.
"As soon as a project gets into the ground, the corporate guys will make a commitment," Mr. Romano said. "It really is, 'if you build it, they will come."'
For all its economic attractions, the waterfront offers something that might be just as important as it is intangible -- magnificent views of Manhattan. Waterfront buildings offer an unbroken view across the Hudson to the city's forest of skyscrapers. "People are attracted to the area because of the quality of life and the views of New York," Mr. Pozycki said.

Will Regionalization Work?

 BODY:
Would combining municipal services cut the cost of government? Would it mean a loss of local powers and identity?
 
Opposite of National Trend
Property taxes cannot be substantially reduced until New Jersey residents share a willingness to relinquish some of their desire for home rule. The consistent trend in New Jersey is one of division and separation. We have more school districts and municipalities today than we did 20 or 30 years ago. This is the exact opposite of the national trend. Most people elsewhere recognized that better services, better schools and more savings can be obtained when more people set aside their differences and work together. 
 On my street a water main was recently installed. There are only nine houses on my street. If each of us had hired separate contractors to make the connection, it would cost us more than if we banded together and asked contractors to bid on making the connections to all nine houses at once. More work gets done for less money when we pull together.
That is what we have to do in New Jersey to reduce property taxes.

Follow the Money
Before Governor Whitman pushes the municipalities to regionalize as a means of reducing property taxes, she should look at the largess that the Legislature dispenses to the two powerful municipal unions representing the police and the educators. Schools typically represent about two-thirds of all municipal taxes and a major portion of school expense is salaries. Under the conditions imposed by these laws, the unions typically achieve pay increases that significantly exceed the inflation rate.
Patrolmen's pay in Wyckoff grows at a rate of 20 to 25 percent per year for the first six to eight years of employment. The result is patrolmen earning over $80,000 per year after this initial period of employment.
Furthermore, a review of per-pupil costs in regional high schools in Bergen County shows that their average costs are 45 percent above the average of nonregional high schools (figures for 1995-96 school year). A cursory review of figures for the rest of the state shows that there are very few instances where regional high schools have costs comparable to the nonregional schools and, on average, none are less costly.

A Town, Not a Region
I choose to live in a small town. If I wanted to live in a region I would move to a city. Bigger is not better. The identity of a small town is important to me. The Governor's commission is just another example of her out-of-touch fiscal thinking. The individual towns in the state can make their own decisions, and do not need Big Sister telling them what to do or how to do it.

HEADLINE: Co-op Admissions: Doing the Numbers

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
IN the thicket of assessing the finances of prospective co-op purchasers -- with its tangle of documents, murky requirements, competing interests and board-member egos -- a would-be buyer's application can be impaled on a thorn.
Take, for example, the case of a local storekeeper who wanted to purchase an apartment at Concord Village, a seven-building complex in the eastern shadows of the Brooklyn Bridge, where prices range from $30,000 for a studio to $150,000 for a two-bedroom. 
 For want of a paragraph in a letter from his daughter's school, the storekeeper was rejected.
It was a prestigious private school, costing about $15,000 a year, "and with what they were showing on their tax returns," said Claudia Corwin, president of the Concord Village board, "we did not see how they could pay for this school, as well as their real estate obligations.
"This is how subtle a lot of this is."
The board requested the letter after the storekeeper mentioned during his interview that his daughter was in a private school. The board was hoping, Ms. Corwin said, "that the couple was getting financial aid from the school, that their income wouldn't have to cover that expense." The couple was claiming an income of about $40,000.
"But the letter came and it said nothing about financial aid, indicating that the money for the school was coming out of their pockets," Ms. Corwin said. "And, therefore, we concluded that if they could afford the school, obviously they had cash they weren't telling us about -- a little thing like that, that the letter from the school didn't mention financial aid."
Such are the vagaries of the financial assessment process faced by scores of hopeful buyers in a real estate market that -- despite the buckling of some foreign economies and the gyrations of Wall Street -- has, so far at least, continued to percolate.
Brokers and others involved in the co-op market say the demand for high-priced apartments, especially in Manhattan, has allowed co-op boards in many white-glove buildings to retain or tighten financial requirements. But boards in many middle-class buildings, particularly in the other boroughs and the suburbs where the effects of the last recession lingered longer, remain relieved to be making sales, and more readily approve applications -- albeit a bit more fussily.
Fussiness, however, is not necessarily akin to precision. And applicants -- no matter their financial status -- must deal with an assessment process that lacks standardized requirements. Boards in high-end buildings tend to demand that a buyer have reserve assets that are multiples of the purchase price. In midpriced buildings, boards are more concerned about what the proportion of an applicant's maintenance and loan obligations would be to his income. But in terms of required percentages, there are no set criteria.
As for recent zigs and zags in the financial markets, said Clark Halstead, founder of the brokerage that bears his name, co-op boards at the high end "are case-hardened against knee-jerk reactions." If an applicant's wealth is in stocks, Mr. Halstead said, "what's happened recently is a 20 percent decline in that person's net worth."
"And, frankly," he said, "20 percent is not enough to change the picture for most boards with respect to approving that candidate."
Mr. Halstead sees the approval process as "the most thorough invasion of your financial privacy that you'll ever suffer."
"And this inquisition," he said, "has not gotten better in recent years. It's gotten a little worse. But in the past few weeks there's been no change."
In the middle-priced range, said Herb Rose, a co-op consultant, "the standards have relaxed considerably because there was such a long period when it was impossible to sell an apartment," and some owners even abandoned their homes after failing to meet their obligations.
At buildings still haunted by memories of sales droughts and defaulting owners, Mr. Rose said: "The boards want apartments to move because they can't keep taking them back. So I don't perceive that middle-range boards are becoming extremely cautious because apartments are selling for little money, and there's relief that there are some sales."
Still, whatever the price range, the approval process can be stressful -- for both buyer and board.
Donna Harrison is the manager of River House, a 213-unit co-op on 16 manicured acres in Peekskill, N.Y., where a two-bedroom sells for about $80,000. "It's amazing," she said. "When people start this process, I am straightforward: 'We are going to run a TRW credit check and a driver's license check. Be honest about any problems.'
"Some people say, 'No problem, my credit is great.' And then you run it and they have judgments, bankruptcies, chronic late payments."
Ms. Harrison recalled one applicant who "looked very professional, like out of a catalogue; this person said, 'No problem.'
"She had a good administrative job, about $80,000 in income. But the TRW was atrocious -- nothing paid on time, student loans unpaid, bankruptcy. And she thought she was clean."
For the buyer, the process can seem like slogging through a swamp seeded with mines.
"There is no single standard, unfortunately, perhaps," said Sylvia Shapiro, author of "The Co-op Bible," a guidebook scheduled for release in December by St. Martin's Griffin. "It's unfortunate for the buyer because he may not know what he's up against. For the board, the lack of an objective standard may allow them to make determinations without the buyer able to hold them to account."
To further complicate matters, said Ms. Shapiro, who is also board president at the 229-unit Randall House in Greenwich Village, "every building has its own financial and emotional persona."
"SOME board members get Napoleon complexes," she said, "try to be heroes and impose standards that they certainly could not meet themselves. That creates friction between potential shareholders buying at today's prices and entrenched board members who bought back in the days when apartments could be had for a song." Not to mention current shareholders seeking to sell, perhaps immobilized in their hopes of closing on another home.
One thing, however, has become standard in recent years. "If there is one currently commonplace requirement," said Stuart Saft, chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives, "it is that the applicant provide tax returns for at least two years. Ten years ago, boards never asked for tax returns. It was considered too intrusive."
But intrusion has plumbed new depths in recent years -- perhaps of necessity. As Mr. Rose, the co-op consultant, pointed out: "We are in a more complex world in which few people have only one income source. Whereas years back a salaried person would give you their W-2, and that was their income, now almost everybody has interest, stock profits, capital gains on a real estate transaction, maybe another business.
"So the practical way to determine income is really to get their tax forms."
But complicating matters for board members, Ms. Shapiro said, is the fact that they "can never be certain that a tax return reflects reality."
"Follow-up questioning sometimes indicates that not everybody is totally candid with Uncle Sam," she said. "It puts the board in a conundrum: if they are not up front with Uncle, how will they be with fellow shareholders?"
There are, essentially, two financial components a board considers in deciding whether to approve a sale -- or, in more precise legal parlance, a transfer, because what is actually happening is that stock and a proprietary lease are being transferred.
"It's a misnomer to say you are purchasing a co-op apartment," Mr. Saft said. "What you're purchasing is stock in the corporation that owns the building and the right to live in a specific apartment under a proprietary lease" -- proprietary because the buyer is both tenant and stockholder.
One component of the board's inquiry is, obviously, to determine the applicant's income; the other is to ascertain his or her net worth -- assets less liabilities. The board's job is to determine whether the applicant will be able to cover his or her regular living expenses while paying off the apartment loan (commonly, though technically incorrectly, called the mortgage), the maintenance and any possible assessments for capital improvements to the complex.
Lurking assessments should concern prospective buyers.
"Brokers and sellers wax poetic about all the improvements because, of course, they enhance the building's value," Ms. Shapiro said. "But they are likely to be close-lipped about items coming down the pike that will require an assessment."
If the building has recently been converted, the buyer might ask to see the engineer's report commissioned by the tenants' association, which will indicate work that may be needed. In an established co-op, copies of board minutes for the last year or two should indicate the work being considered. And, as Ms. Shapiro said, "I see nothing wrong, although it would be considered revolutionary, for the buyer to ask, 'What's coming up?' In my seven years on the board, only one buyer took the trouble to get my phone number and ask. She earned my respect, not my annoyance."
The financial inquiry process begins after the buyer and seller agree on a price and sign a contract, followed by a period during which the purchaser prepares a "board package" -- folders full of documents -- with the broker learning the board's requirements and acting as go-between. During the same period, assuming it is not an all-cash deal, the buyer will apply for an apartment loan, with most boards requiring a down payment of at least 20 percent.
"They cannot submit the package until they get the mortgage commitment," said JoAnne Kennedy, president of Coldwell Banker Hunt Kennedy, a Manhattan brokerage. "It may take four weeks to get the commitment."
After the papers are submitted, the building's managing agent reviews the documents, then presents them to the board. If, after picking the package apart to make sure the pieces fit, the board tentatively approves, the buyer will be invited for an interview -- itself an arduous encounter, with designated board members frequently demanding more explanation and documentation.
"The process may take another month after the mortgage commitment," Ms. Kennedy said. "So there may be two months between contract signing and board approval. That's two months the seller doesn't know what to do. They can't show the apartment because they are in contract; they can't purchase a new home."
One pioneering board, however, is taking steps to abbreviate the process. Harold Spitzer, the president of 400 West End Avenue, at the corner of 79th Street, said his board would vote this month on a policy of reviewing financial packages before buyers have received loan commitments. "We wouldn't approve the buyer before the commitment is secured," he said, "but we would review the package. There's no reason to hold up the buyer or the seller on a technicality; no reason not to let them off the hook."
Once a board has a buyer's financial package in hand, it will first scrutinize the assets and then, in effect, write a budget to assess the applicant's ability to meet his obligations. And, given that there are no standard formulas for that assessment, there are general principles.
"All buildings now are looking for a financial cushion, and certain boards want more feathers than others," said Ms. Kennedy.
Many boards, she pointed out, had to take back apartments during the last recession, "so they want the buyer to have a minimum of three month's mortgage and maintenance in reserve."
"Some fussier boards, where they are looking at gigantic mortgages -- a million and up -- want a reserve equal to or more than the apartment cost," she said. "And some East Side buildings want assets that are multiples of the apartment price."
IF the buyer has sufficient funds for an "all-cash" purchase, the board will be less concerned about net worth. But not always. "We had an out-of-town, fat-cat dad who bought his aspiring model daughter an apartment with all cash," said Ms. Shapiro. "But until she made the cover of Vogue, she had no visible means of support. So we asked, and dad agreed, to deposit a year's maintenance into escrow. That way, the buyer got fast-track approval and the board got financial protection."
If, however, the buyer is taking out a loan, the board will examine its terms, again to determine whether the buyer can meet his obligations. This is particularly true in small co-ops where one shareholder's failure can overwhelm the others.
There are four apartments in the brownstone on Pacific Street in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, where David Becker is board manager and everybody else is on the board. "We had one unit purchased six months ago by a woman who insisted that her boyfriend live in the apartment," Mr. Becker said. "But her income looked like it did not support her financial obligations.
"The irony is, not reporting the boyfriend's income was hurting her. So we asked for his income statements -- and she was also able to produce stubs showing she recently had a pay increase -- but all we could gather from his W-2's was that he was in construction."
In fact, he was an architect and construction manager for a large renovation firm. Between them, Mr. Becker said, "All problems were solved."
While there are no set, objective standards, there are guidelines -- based on the building's location. "A Fifth Avenue building will have a more restrictive formula than one in Canarsie," said Mr. Saft. "And one formula used in restrictive buildings is that the buyer's net worth be at least double the purchase price."
In the high-end market, with buyers willing to pay stratospheric prices, boards for exclusive buildings demand high net worth. "And it's justified," Mr. Saft said. "An apartment that sold three years ago for $1.5 million may now sell for $3 million. Boards have to question the unit's intrinsic value.
"If the value could double in three years, it could also halve. And, therefore, a buyer financing half the apartment would have no equity if the price went down."
Ms. Shapiro added: "Prices have escalated to such dizzying levels that the bank, not the buyer or seller, may scuttle the deal. The button-down banker may say, 'Wait a minute, this apartment is not worth $3 million,' and not lend unless the price is reduced."
In less restrictive buildings, boards are less interested in net worth and look for a monthly income about three times the combination of the buyer's maintenance and debt service. "That's the modern version of the old formula that housing costs should be 25 percent of your income," Mr. Saft said. But in New York's expensive market, that 25 percent is now closer to 40 percent.
"If before the current market your housing costs were $1,000 a month, then you would have needed $4,000 in income to get approval," Mr. Saft said. "Now they approve buyers with incomes as low as $2,500."
Over the years, he explained, less expensive buildings have reduced income requirements to accommodate shareholders trying to sell. "To do this they have to accept people with a lower income in proportion to their expenses," he said.
Some less-restrictive boards have informal formulas correlating an applicant's income to the size of the apartment he or she is seeking. At River House in Peekskill, Ms. Harrison said, the guidelines are $30,000 in income to buy a studio, $40,000 for a one-bedroom and $50,000 for a two-bedroom.
"But they are just that, guidelines," she said. "You could have someone who meets a guideline salary-wise, but when you look at their TRW their expenses are over-extended. You could have somebody who makes $100,000, but just blows it. Or you could have someone who makes a moderate salary, but has low expenses. You really have to look at all aspects."
Certain aspects, of course, can be problematic. And as a broker, Barbara Corcoran, chairwoman of the Corcoran Group, is fully aware of them, particularly for high-end buyers: "Too-new money. Lack of references from well-placed people. High salaries without strong assets. New York as a secondary residence. Overseas assets. Parents buying for kids."
But, at any income level, Ms. Corcoran said, "The hardest is someone who is self-employed."
Al Pennisi, a real estate lawyer who advises boards, concurs: "There are people in cash businesses, honest people. But they just can't document, dollar for dollar, their income."
One of the boards Mr. Pennisi advises "had a hot dog vendor; good income, in the $50's or $60's; but if the hot dog business drops, if he gets a cold corner, the income drops." The board, Mr. Pennisi said, "liked the guy, nice personality; he checked out with prior landlords, but he didn't have a credit history." The solution: "This guy put up six month's maintenance, and they approved him."
Co-op boards are not required by law to give the reason for a rejection, and most lawyers advise them not to offer explanations because they can be become the basis of litigation. But the boards must abide by city, state and Federal discrimination laws.
MS. CORCORAN contends there is one underlying reason for most board rejections -- failure to disclose. "It's not that they don't have it, whatever a board is looking for, but that they don't show it," she said. "And they don't show it because of the common false belief that 'the board will meet me and I'll explain.' Ninety percent of board turndowns happen without an interview because something wasn't disclosed."
And so, Ms. Shapiro, author of "The Co-op Bible," when asked what she might include in a Ten Commandments for Hopeful Buyers, came up with seven:
*Find out what the board requires, "and give them what they are looking for."
*Don't submit information in dribs and drabs. "Be neat and complete the first time around, otherwise you will rue your errors when the board engages in a war of attrition, seeking more documents than the Lewinsky grand jury."
*Don't edit out pages on your tax returns that you don't like, and don't add zeroes to your net worth.
*Many boards require that a net-worth affidavit be signed by an accountant; get it signed before you submit.
*If you are selling another piece of property, inform the board. "That indicates you will have less debt than might be apparent from a casual glance at your application."
*If your application is contingent on financing, first get a loan commitment.
*Avoid inconsistency. "We regularly get applications with one set of numbers on the loan application, another on the net worth affidavit, a third on the financial statements. If you do that, the board may conclude that you are playing games and drum you out of the corps."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT;
When Bad News Is Good News

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
BASICALLY, two winning themes emerged in a quarter so dismal that gains of less than 2 percent could catapult a mutual fund into the top 10 among domestic diversified stock funds: plays on falling interest rates, and an overall search for safety.
The Vanguard Wellesley Income fund, with a combination of stocks and bonds that neatly tied together both themes, ranked seventh among diversified domestic stock funds; its quarterly return was 1.65 percent. Many of its stocks are utilities, which have come into their own after struggling in red-hot markets. 
 Another winner, the Copley Fund, , took 10th place with a return of 0.97 percent, also helped by a heavy weighting of utility shares. Among purer plays, Strong American Utilities, up 4.89 percent, ranked third among specialized funds.
And a newfangled investment, Barr Rosenberg Market Neutral, ranked sixth among diversified funds, with a return of 1.9 percent. It aims for a steady return regardless of what happens in the market.
The managers of the four funds talked about how they coped and what might lie ahead.
 
Shelter in Utilities
"We've had a good portfolio all along," said William H. Reaves, who runs Strong American Utilities, with $216.5 million in assets. "We've just come into a period when the sun is shining on our stocks for a change." Among the fund's holdings are shares in electric utilities (38.5 percent), telecommunications (34 percent), energy (13 percent) and gas utilities(8 percent).
The climate for utilities stocks has been particularly good, he said, because the slowing earnings growth trend of industrial companies and falling interest rates have made the dividends paid by utilities companies more attractive. As of Sept. 30, the fund yielded 2.44 percent.
Mr. Reaves said he had been building his position in electric utility stocks throughout the year, "as the deregulation process moves along in state after state." One favorite is Ameren, now 7 percent of the fund's portfolio. Ameren, based in St. Louis, yields 6 percent.
Another large holding, 7.1 percent of the portfolio, is Nipsco, a natural-gas and electric company based in Merrillville, Ind. "We see good dividend growth and 8 percent per-share earnings growth over the next three years," Mr. Reaves said.
In telecommunications, his largest position is Ameritech (8.1 percent of the portfolio). "We expect dividend payments to increase about 6 percent a year, and earnings per share at 12 percent," he said. Other favorites: Bell Atlantic (7.2 percent) and the SBC Corporation (6.6 percent).
Mr. Reaves expects the good times to continue for utilities "as long as we have slow growth and until the trend of interest rates turns up."
 
The Short Strategy
Barr Rosenberg Market Neutral, with $310 million in assets, has also been shining. William Jump, the portfolio engineer, aims to buy stocks he thinks are undervalued and then "neutralize" the risk by selling short (that is, selling borrowed shares of) an equal amount of stocks he sees as overvalued. If the prices of the shorted stocks fall, as expected, the borrowed securities can be replaced with shares that cost less.
Over all, the combination is intended to produce a fund with the same risk levels as intermediate bonds, but with higher returns. "Our goal is to beat Treasury bills by 5 1/2 percent to 6 percent a year, which is about 10 or 11 percent in the current interest-rate environment," Mr. Jump said.
"We wouldn't stand out in good markets," he said, but "this is a prime environment for our fund."
No single holding contributed to the fund's relatively strong performance this quarter; Mr. Jump juggles more than 700 long positions and a like number of shorts. "Our returns aren't driven by individual home runs," he said. "They're driven by lots of base hits."
All that trading pushes up the fund's turnover rate to about 200 percent, more than double that of the average stock fund. That means transaction expenses will be high, and investors may receive a big chunk of short-term gains, taxable at ordinary income rates, at year-end.
Mr. Jump focuses mostly on small and midsize companies. "That's where we find the greatest inefficiencies in pricing," he said. About 90 percent of the fund's holdings are companies with market capitalizations of less than $2.8 billion.
 
A Bond-Heavy Mix
"It's not as if we did something brilliant," said Earl E. McEvoy, who manages the fixed-income portion of the $8.1 billion Vanguard Wellesley Income fund.
"When interest rates come down and the economic outlook slows, Wellesley does well on both the stock and bond sides," Mr. McEvoy said. Wellesley's portfolio is 60 to 65 percent invested in bonds; the balance, in stocks, is run by John R. Ryan.
Wellesley holds long bonds, mostly corporate (80 percent of its bond total), with the balance in Treasuries. It has an overall duration of nine years, meaning that the value of the bonds increases 9 percent for every decline of one percentage point in interest rates. This quarter, rates fell by roughly one-half percentage point, so Wellesley's bonds gained about 4.5 percent, Mr. McEvoy figured.
What Wellesley chose not to own also helped bolster its showing this quarter: junk bonds, emerging-markets debt and mortgage securities.
On the equity side, Wellesley's holdings include utilities, 33 percent of the stock portfolio, and energy and financial stocks, 14 percent each. "Because their dividends look stable," Mr. McEvoy said, utilities are "almost like bonds in some people's minds."
The fund's biggest gainers for the quarter were Amoco, up 29 percent; Consolidated Edison, which rose 23 percent, and AMP, up 22 percent..
 
Buying and Holding Utilities
 A tough stock market is good news for Irving Levine, manager of the $87.5 million Copley fund, which has about 55 percent of its portfolio in telephone, gas and electric companies, which pay the high dividends many investors seek in uncertain times. The next-largest chunk (12 percent) is in oil companies.
The fund's biggest gainers this quarter were BellSouth (up 12 percent), Ameritech and Florida Power and Light (10 percent each).
Mr. Levine chooses his stocks carefully, then holds on. He estimates that the fund's turnover rate for 1998 will be just 8 percent.
Despite his strong showing, Mr. Levine has a gloomy outlook for the market. "I think we're going to have -- not tough sledding anymore, that's finished -- but we're certainly going to stay down at these levels until the problems in Asia level off and Russia gets back on its feet," he said.
Copley is also an industrial corporation that wholesales imported handbags and shoes. As such, it can exclude 70 percent of its dividend income from tax, so the fund pays taxes itself and does not make any distributions to shareholders. Shareholders pay taxes on gains only when they redeem shares.
For most investors, this structure creates tax-adjusted returns that are about three percentage points higher than comparable returns on other funds, he said.

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF;
Eisner's Tell-Little Tale Of His Magic Kingdom

BYLINE: By DEBORAH STEAD 

 BODY:
I'VE always found that experiences from everyday life made the best drama," writes Michael D. Eisner in "Work in Progress" (Random House, $27.95), a first-person account of his years at ABC, Paramount Pictures and, of course, the Walt Disney Company, where he has run things since 1984.
Alas, much of this real-life narrative has the drama of, say, an annual report. Here is the chief executive's message on everything from Disney's management feuds to its millennium plans. And, yes, there he is on the cover, posing with the Mouse. 
 To be fair, it may be futile to expect much more from a sitting corporate chief, especially when the corporation is an American icon. Mr. Eisner says he wrote his book -- with Tony Schwartz, a journalist -- as a kind of mission statement. And he discloses that his wife, Jane Breckenridge Eisner, opposed the project, viewing such midcareer memoirs as vain and invasive.
Still, it would have been interesting to glimpse more of the private man who has been behind so much popular culture. Or some juicy, inner-circle accounts of past Disney deals or decisions. Or a few Big Thoughts, as Disney becomes more global, about the company's power over the world's collective imagination.
Instead, Mr. Eisner -- whose business talents have long been well regarded -- tells an already familiar tale about Disney, with an emphasis on his creative contributions.
At the same time, he stays away from anything deeper than a surface look at his personal life: childhood on prosperous Park Avenue, summers at a beloved Vermont wilderness camp that taught him "core values," wholesome mischievousness at boarding school. "I found a way to balance basic respect for authority with youthful rebelliousness," he writes. (How Mickey-like.)
Even his grief, years later, over the death of Frank Wells, Disney's No. 2, seems glossed over, as does his ordeal with quadruple-bypass surgery.
"Work in Progress," in fact, seems to let down its guard only when discussing work experiences now safely in the past.
Mr. Eisner started at ABC at 24, developing soap operas and game shows and, later, prime-time comedies like "Welcome Back, Kotter," "Barney Miller" and "Happy Days." There he met and worked -- sometimes quirkily -- with Barry Diller, who recruited Mr. Eisner into the No. 2 job at Paramount Pictures in 1977 after a decade at ABC. (We learn that Mr. Diller once clapped a hand over Mr. Eisner's mouth to stop him from talking in front of a group.)
At Paramount, the two were tight-fisted, producing movies as cheaply as possible by relying on new, relatively unknown talent. The studio made the hit spoof "Airplane!" for $6 million, using a novice director, and netted $83 million; "48 Hours," made before Eddie Murphy was expensive, cost $10 million and earned $76 million. And another Murphy film, "Beverly Hills Cop," was based on an idea that Mr. Eisner says he got after being ticketed for speeding in California.
Nonetheless, in 1984, Mr. Eisner was dismissed -- for personal reasons, as he tells it -- by Martin Davis, who ran Gulf & Western, then the studio parent.
The author's Disney years take up the bulk of the book, beginning with the takeover battle that was raging when Roy E. Disney approached Mr. Eisner (then at Paramount) about taking the top post.
As he describes his tenure at Disney -- the remade this-is-not-your-father's Disney -- we get a sense of Mr. Eisner's popular-culture instincts and his much-lauded business acumen: the sharp attention to movie costs, the cross-promotions between theme parks and retail shops, the push for a greater presence in television.
But there is little discussion of the controversies at the company. Mr. Eisner doesn't discuss the conservative backlash against the company's gay-friendly employee policies. (He does, however, grapple with the "authenticity" issues surrounding Disney's failed plans for an American-history theme park near Manassas, Va.)
What we get, for the most part, is a bland presentation -- a look at the new, grown-up films from Miramax and Touchstone, the Capital Cities/ABC acquisition, "The Lion King" on Broadway, the turnaround at Euro Disney (now Disney Paris), the cruise ships.
Occasionally, there is a glimpse of how deals are done in the rarefied realms of really big business: Mr. Eisner exchanges ideas on the chairlifts at Aspen and engages in buyout banter at a top-level executive retreat in Sun Valley. But over all, the reader gets little in the way of an inside look at the Magic Kingdom.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT;
A Happy (or Not So Sad) Group

BYLINE: By NOELLE KNOX 

 BODY:
AFTER years of lagging behind pure equity funds, balanced mutual funds are suddenly looking a lot more attractive.
Balanced funds, which hold a mixture of stocks and bonds, tend to underperform pure stock funds during bull markets, but their bond holdings can salvage some returns when equities head south. Think of them as a good hedge against an overheated stock market or a global recession. 
 "Any time risk is that high in equities, it's always a good idea to look at less risky alternatives, and balanced funds fall into that category," said Norman G. Fosback, editor of the Mutual Fund Forecaster, a newsletter in Deerfield Beach, Fla. "Balanced funds, as a class, are extremely attractive."
The average balanced fund lost 6.7 percent in the third quarter -- a return not as good as the 1.8 percent gain for the average bond fund but far better than the 13.4 percent slide of the average stock fund, according to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago.
The class, however, includes a lot of individual differences. Some balanced funds are split between two managers -- one for the stock assets, one for the bonds. The funds can also have a fixed or variable asset split and enormously different objectives.
Investors should be aware that scores of balanced funds have been rolled out recently by firms eager to fill out their product lines for the 401(k) market, said Amy Arnott, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds. Nearly half of the balanced funds tracked by Morningstar have assets of less than $30 million and thus do not appear in the mutual fund tables of The New York Times.
It may behoove investors to either select big, established balanced funds, said Ms. Arnott, or to pay extra-close attention to the style a fund uses. "Be more cautious," she said. "Especially if it's going to have a newer manager."
In fact, some balanced funds are not very balanced. Portfolio managers may make big bets on the stock market, or even on certain types of stocks. Avondale Total Return, for example, has almost 86 percent of its assets in stocks and just 9 percent in bonds. The Berger Balanced fund, by contrast, has 50 percent of its assets in stocks, 18 percent in bonds and the rest in cash. In a down market, such differences between funds can produce a vast gulf in results. For the year through Sept. 30, Avondale's 1.7 percent return was far below Berger's 13.7 percent.
The types of stocks in a balanced fund can also throw performance out of kilter. Consider the Smith Barney Security and Growth fund, which has a nearly 50-50 split between stocks and bonds. The fund may look evenly balanced, but the majority of its stock holdings are in small companies, which are getting hammered in this market -- as is the fund, down 9.4 percent through the third quarter of this year.
While balanced funds as a group are known for their stability, certain funds still change the weightings in their portfolios radically and quickly. Provident Investment Counsel Pinnacle Balanced, for example, has cut its stock holdings to about 62 percent, from 74 percent in July, according to Jeffrey Miller, managing director of the fund. It has returned 12.7 percent this year through Sept. 30.
Alliance Growth Investors is another balanced fund that has unloaded stocks. Nicholas D. Carn, the portfolio manager, recently cut his equity holdings to 55 percent, from 68 percent in July and 82 percent in January. "Obviously, the high stock exposure is one of the things that has helped our performance" in the bull market, he said. The fund returned 5 percent in the first three quarters. Investors looking for a less risky balanced fund, he said, can put their money in Alliance Conservative Investors, which has only about 23 percent of its holdings in stocks and returned 6.8 percent in the period.
While bonds give these funds more stability, they have their own risks. In general, the longer the bonds' maturities, the higher the interest-rate risk. Long-term bonds usually pay higher interest rates than short-term bonds, but if rates rise, a fund dominated by long-term bonds is locked in at a lower rate of return.
Balanced funds can hold many different types of bonds -- corporate and municipal, as well as Treasury -- with varying maturities. The Mainstay Total Return B fund, for example, is holding bonds with an average maturity of 13.2 years, while Avondale Total Return is holding short-term debt with an average maturity of two years. For the first three quarters, Mainstay's 7.8 percent gain beat Avondale's return by more than 6 percentage points.
"Balanced funds are usually sold as conservative investments, but if you've got a fund that is concentrated in small stocks and long-term bonds, you don't have a conservative product," said Steve M. Lipper, senior vice president at Lipper Analytical Services, the research firm in Summit, N.J.
Mutual fund experts caution investors to read the current and past semiannual reports to see what kind of securities a fund is holding and the changes the portfolio has made.
An investor's tax bracket will also influence her choice of balanced mutual funds. One option for investors in the top brackets is USAA Growth and Tax Strategy, a fund with about 51 percent of its assets in tax-free bonds and 49 percent in growth stocks. It returned 2.8 percent in the first three quarters.
Then, of course, there is always another option. Sheldon Jacobs, editor of the No Load Fund Investor, a newsletter, recommends that investors do their own portfolio balancing by buying separate stock and bond funds. That, he said, gives them more control over the amount and types of stocks they are holding and lets them plan tax gains and losses more effectively.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT;
Municipals: Prime Time for the Other Haven

BYLINE: By ABBY SCHULTZ 

 BODY:
TURMOIL in global equity markets has sent investors scurrying for the safety of United States Treasury bonds. But investors willing to forgo the ironclad Government guarantees of Treasuries may be able to garner significant extra income after taxes -- and still maintain relative safety -- by investing in a municipal bond fund.
Muni bonds almost always make sense for investors in high tax brackets, because Federal income taxes, which go as high as 39.6 percent, can take a big chunk from the coupon income of Treasury securities; income from munis is generally not subject to Federal taxes. 
 Today, however, the tax advantage of municipals makes sense for people in any tax bracket, largely because the yield of municipal securities with maturities of five years or more is nearly the same as the before-tax yield on comparable United States Treasury securities for the first time in more than a decade. Usually, muni yields are only 80 percent to 85 percent of Treasury yields.
The highest-quality 30-year muni, for example, was recently yielding about 4.64 percent, or 98 percent of the yield of a 30-year Treasury bond, said Richard J. Moynihan, director of municipal securities at the Dreyfus Corporation. After taxes, an investor in the 36 percent tax bracket, for example, would wind up with a yield of 3.03 percent on the 30-year Treasury, only 65 percent as much as the investor in munis, Mr. Moynihan said. (Put another way, the tax-equivalent yield of that muni for this investor is 7.25 percent.)
And an investor in the 28 percent bracket would wind up with an after-tax yield of only 3.4 percent on the 30-year Treasury bond, just 73 percent as much as the muni.
"The value is screamingly there in municipals," Mr. Moynihan said.
Kenneth E. Willmann, who oversees fixed-income securities at USAA Investment Management in San Antonio, agreed. "If you pay any Federal tax at all, you are better off in municipals," Mr. Willmann said. "That's maybe a rash statement, but that's pretty close to true."
For investors with less than $100,000 available for a muni portfolio, mutual funds are generally the best way to go. That's because muni bonds are generally sold in lots of $25,000, meaning it would take $100,000 to get a reasonably well-diversified portfolio of four issues.
Of course, fund investors give up an important protection enjoyed by people who hold bonds outright: If a bond is held to maturity, the principal is repaid. A fund makes no such promise.
Municipal yields are relatively high because low interest rates this year prompted record issuance of new munis as well as refinancings of older issues. The extra supply put downward pressure on prices throughout the muni market, pushing up yields, which move in the opposite direction. Prices of Treasuries, meanwhile, rose to 30-year highs, as Americans and foreign investors -- many of whom receive no tax benefit from munis -- rushed into Treasuries, pushing down yields.
WHAT happens next?
If global equities markets stabilize and the United States stock market pulls out of its slump, Treasury prices could fall. The "devil's advocate" view, said Eric Jacobson, a fixed-income analyst at Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago, is that prices of munis would follow suit.
The more common opinion, Mr. Jacobson said, is that the municipal market is cheap and that there is plenty of room for prices to rise. If the economy slows or even slips into recession, municipal securities will provide more income than Treasuries after taxes, and they will resist credit depreciation more than bonds issued by corporations, he said.
Making the case for general obligation bonds, which are backed by the full faith and credit of a municipality, he said, "Most city governments have done a good job of putting their fiscal house in order over the last few years, so it'll be a pretty slow process of deterioration if they are hurt by recession."
Still, investors worrying about a recession might want to steer clear of some of the best-performing funds, which can be loaded with "nonrated" municipal bonds, or securities issued by weaker municipalities. A lot of managers think that the current yields on many weaker credits are not high enough to compensate investors for the risk, Mr. Jacobson said. So while good managers can pick their way through weaker credits, many are choosing instead to buy high-quality muni bonds.
Investors looking for managers who can take advantage of carefully researched bargains among higher-yielding, nonrated securities should stay away from high-yield municipal bond funds that are often required to have a big percentage in lower-quality issues, said Michael J. Chasnoff, a financial planner in Cincinnati.
"If you want a fund that can be more opportunistic, you need a national fund," Mr. Chasnoff said.
What else should investors watch for in a muni fund? Low operating expenses, Mr. Chasnoff said, because even superior returns may not compensate for extra costs. He recommends funds with expense ratios below the average of their peer group -- 1.10 percent for long-term national municipal funds, for instance, according to Morningstar.
And what about single-state muni funds? These often make sense for investors who live in a state with high taxes, like California or New York, because the income will be exempt from state as well as Federal taxes. The downside of a single-state fund is that it offers less diversification by making an investor dependent on the local economy.

 BODY:

Q. I am a computer consultant at a major international bank. Recently, my boss and one member of the staff have made anti-Semitic remarks that are at best insensitive, at worst fighting words. The agency that hired me for the job has acknowledged the problem but says I am overstating it. The agency, however, has to defend its client, so its sympathies lie with her. 
 I am looking for a job elsewhere, and the agency says it is trying to help me. My problem is: How do I explain why I am leaving? No future employer wants to hear negative comments about a current employer, no matter how justified.
A. Remember how you were taught as a child that honesty is the best policy? Forget it. While you don't want to tell a lie in an interview, committing a sin of omission may be your best course in this instance.
"Never go negative," said Lee E. Miller, an employment lawyer turned human-resources executive and author of "Get More Money on Your Next Job" (McGraw-Hill, 1997). 'I don't care what the reason. Nobody wants to be around someone like that. Think of it this way: If you were on a first date and you spent the entire time bashing your first wife, what do you think your date would think?"
When talking with prospective employers, it may be better to skip the negatives about the past and emphasize the upbeat about the future. "There are a million reasons one could give for wanting to change jobs," said Carole A. Pinkett, a former human-resources executive with the Metropolitan Transit Authority of Houston and now head of human resources at the STP Nuclear Operating Company in Wadsworth, Tex. If necessary, you may even reach into your bag of interview cliches, saying you're looking for an advanced opportunity, or a new challenge, or a chance to work for a really (fill-in-the-flattering-adjective) company.
Mr. Miller also advises focusing on why you want the position in question, not on why you are leaving your current job. "What is it about a particular company that excites you?" he said. "If it's that the company is fast-growing, concentrate on that."
A parting note: Your decision to abandon ship appears to be the correct one. Life is too short to linger in an office environment that is making you miserable, Mr. Miller said. And even in litigation-happy America, taking legal action would most likely bring you more pain than justice. ("If you try to fight such behavior in the courts, it can be very expensive and you can be branded a troublemaker," Ms. Pinkett said.)
However, once you are on your way out the door, you might want to drop a friendly, thought-you'd-want-to-know letter to the human-resources manager at your old employer, explaining your real reasons for leaving. (Be sure it contains no hint of nastiness or implied threat.) It might not do any good, but if the company's executives are unaware of your former boss's behavior, they might appreciate the information.
After all, the next person in your position might decide that a lawsuit is precisely what the doctor ordered.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT: FUNDS WATCH;
Just How Low Can Fees Go?

BYLINE: By ABBY SCHULTZ 

 BODY:
WITH equity markets on the skids, investors may soon notice the bite that fees take from their mutual-fund returns. But a new fund family with big-name outside advisers hopes to attract investors by reining in these costs.
In rolling out four funds earlier this month, Forward Funds, a San Francisco firm, pledged only that expenses would never be more than the average of all funds in its peer group. 
 In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, expenses for the Forward Equity fund, for example, are estimated at 1.4 percent for the initial fiscal year, just below the 1.41 percent average expense ratio of domestic equity funds. But Ronald Pelosi, the group's president, said he expected to "be able to deliver lower expenses" -- and still make a profit -- by applying institutional-style pricing to retail funds.
Laura Lallos, a senior analyst at Morningstar Inc., the financial publishing firm in Chicago, said the group's success would depend on how big it becomes. As assets grow, fund companies can realize economies of scale on fees. Unlike most fund companies, Forward plans to pass on those savings, she said.
Geoff Bobroff, a fund industry consultant in East Greenwich, R.I., was cautious in assessing the group's prospects. "Cost isn't the only factor," he said. "If it were, Vanguard would have all the assets," he added, referring to the low-cost fund giant.
What's more, if Forward Funds succeeds, it could face a flood of competition, even from its own sub advisers, which could match its pricing very quickly, Mr. Bobroff said.
Forward Equity is managed by Barclays Global Fund Advisors. The other funds are International Equity, managed by Templeton Investment Counsel; Global Bond, managed by Pacific Investment Management, and Small Capitalization, managed by Hoover Capital Management.
A fifth fund, Global Asset Allocation, is managed by Webster Investment Management, the fund family's investment adviser, by distributing its assets among the four other funds in the family.
The group will get a head start with a $100 million cash infusion from Sutton Place Associates, a group of private investors also in San Francisco.
Stephen Rogers, a principal at Barclays, which manages $563 billion, said its agreement with Forward Funds was an "Intel inside" strategy that allowed Barclays to have someone else sell its product.
Forward Funds investors pay an upfront purchase fee of 0.25 percent, which is not a load because it goes directly into the fund's net asset value -- and not to the management company -- to cover the costs of buying securities. Vanguard employs similar "transaction" fees ranging from 0.25 percent to 1 percent on some of its index funds to defray the costs of buying and selling, a Vanguard spokesman said.

Mutiny in the Markets
Not surprisingly, when investors lose money they become restive, even mutinous. But would shareholders make even the vaunted J. Mark Mobius, captain of seven Templeton funds with a total value of more than $13 billion, walk the plank?
No. Dissidents at the $448 million Templeton Dragon fund, which is intended for investors seeking long-term capital appreciation by investing in companies in China, proposed that the board consider converting from a closed-end fund traded on the New York Stock Exchange to an open-end fund. But Franklin Resources, Templeton's parent company, reported that shareholders had rejected the proposal.
Templeton Dragon, which reached a 52-week high of $15.75 a share a year ago, closed Thursday at $6.25, up from a low of $5.25 on Sept. 1.
Despite that drubbing, Dr. Mobius, perhaps the leading apostle of emerging-markets investing, voices optimism. In an article from Hong Kong, Dow Jones recently reported that Dr. Mobius was advising investors "to be patient." He added, "We have seen a tremendous over-correction in the markets."
But not every manager has Dr. Mobius's sway with shareholders.
At Clemente Global Growth, an $80.4 million fund that has seen its share price shrink from a 52-week high of $13.125 on July 22 to a close of $8.5625 on Thursday, a group of dissidents gained control of the board. The dissidents, led by Phillip Goldstein of Opportunity Partners and Ronald Olin of Deep Discount Advisors, triumphed over Lilia Clemente, the fund's manager, who was not re-elected to the board.
 
Fly, Fly Away
To paraphrase an ad for a rival marketing combination, , was it the fund or was it the miles?
Warburg Pincus Asset Management Inc. and Northwest Airlines announced that they had agreed to create and market mutual funds -- initially, two money market funds -- through which Warburg Pincus investors can earn Northwest World Perks frequent-flyer bonus miles. Investors can earn one bonus mile for each $4 invested on an annual basis, plus up to 1,200 bonus miles if they open their account during the first six months of the program, which began Oct. 1.
And just think, if the market really turns south, you can too. Just take a nice holiday and get away from it all.
 
Two New Acorns
Acorn Investment Trust, managed by Wanger Asset Management L.P., announced two new no-load mutual funds. Acorn 20 will invest in 20 to 25 American companies; Acorn Foreign 40 will invest in 40 to 60 foreign companies. Both will seek long-term capital growth. John H. Park and Mark H. Yost manage Acorn 20, while Marcel P. Houtzager and Leah J. Zell manage Acorn Foreign Forty. Each fund has a minimum investment of $1,000.
 
Gabelli Sticks to Its Guns
With storm clouds over the world's financial markets, both Goldman, Sachs & Company and Neuberger & Berman have decided this is no time to go public. But the intrepid Mario Gabelli is pushing ahead with an initial public offering.
In an amended Securities and Exchange Commission filing this week, Gabelli Funds said a group including Merrill Lynch and Salomon Smith Barney would manage the offering, but gave no hint of when the sale might occur, or how many shares would be sold, Bloomberg News reported. The firm, based in Rye, N.Y., managed about $15.8 billion of assets as of June 30.

HEADLINE: Shuttered Clubs, Scrambled Lives

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
LIZABETH JAY stepped onto the stage in a pair of patent leather stilettos, swayed her hips a few times and coyly began removing her sheer black negligee. Two Italian tourists sat expectantly at her feet as Ms. Jay, backlit by the kinds of flashing bulbs that adorn bodega awnings and used-car dealerships, gyrated to a Led Zeppelin song.
She puckered her lips in that centerfold sort of way and tossed aside her slip to reveal a full-fitting black bra and matching underwear. 
 The men smiled.
Then she spread a leopard-print blanket on the mangy carpeting, got down on her knees and spent the next five minutes engaged in what appeared to be a series of elaborate stretching exercises.
At one point she stood up and slowly swiveled her pelvis. She even flashed a few come-hither pouts at the Italians.
But by then the men had stopped smiling.
"You can see this on the beach for free," griped one of them as they headed toward the door. "This is no fun."
It wasn't much fun for Ms. Jay either, who finished her half-hour set at Billy's Stopless with her top on and her tips way off. Last summer, when the legendary strip club in Chelsea was still known as Billy's Topless, Ms. Jay might have ended her nine-hour shift with $450 in gratuities. These days, she said, she is lucky to go home with $200, which includes $50 from Billy's.
"This is a disaster," she said between sets one night last week as she sat at the bar smoking a cigarette. "I don't know how much longer I can hold on."
Ms. Jay at least has a job to hold on to. In the two months since the Giuliani administration began shuttering topless bars and X-rated video parlors across the city, hundreds of men and women have lost their jobs, according to those who monitor the sex industry. The biggest losers in the crackdown have been the striptease dancers, go-go boys and other live performers who earned several hundred dollars for an evening's work.
"It's a shame because these are high-paying jobs that don't require any special skills," said Herald Price Fahringer, a lawyer who represents more than 100 sex-related businesses affected by the new zoning rules, which ban adult entertainment from operating in residential areas or within 500 feet of religious properties, schools or other sex shops. "They are jobs that cannot be easily replaced."
At least 23 topless bars and strip clubs have closed since Aug. 1, when the police carried out a highly publicized raid on Wiggles in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, making it the first casualty of Mr. Giuliani's campaign to curtail the sex industry in New York severely. The Mayor, who has called adult establishments a threat to public "health, safety and welfare," has vowed to shutter two dozen more by the end of the year. On Tuesday, a judge ordered four more closed in Queens.
The Mayor's criminal-justice coordinator, Steven M. Fishner, says eliminating such venues will have a positive economic effect on neighborhoods throughout the city. "Other businesses don't want to locate near a sex shop, so when one closes, the surrounding area will thrive," he said, adding that for every adult entertainment job that is lost, "a multiple number of jobs will replace it."
But others say the sex industry jobs are irreplaceable, especially the estimated 3,500 dance jobs that, before the crackdown, provided the kind of income unavailable to many unskilled women. "These jobs are safe and for a lot of women, especially single mothers and those who haven't had the opportunity to learn other bankable skills, there's no legal work out there that pays as well," said Juliette Widoff, director of outreach for Frost'D, (From Our Streets With Dignity) an organization that provides social services to sex industry workers. "Our biggest worry is that in desperation some will turn to prostitution."
Even if the Supreme Court decides this fall to hear their case challenging the constitutionality of the new policy, many club owners say the damage has been done. Strip joints that have been padlocked may never reopen, and many of those that have survived are hanging on with bikini-clad go-go girls who are forbidden to pose too provocatively. Even tucking a dollar bill in a dancer's G-string is proscribed. "It doesn't take a genius to realize that our customers aren't thrilled," Ms. Jay said. "They somehow blame you, and tip accordingly."
Even the few high-end clubs that still feature bare-chested entertainment are suffering. "It's been a nightmare," said Steve Aslan, a partner at the V.I.P. Club on West 20th Street, which is fighting the city in court to stay open. "Either people assume we've already been closed down or they're afraid to come in because they don't want to get caught in some police raid."
 
Down to Two Tokens And Lacking 'Barbie Doll Looks'
While the owners worry about losing million-dollar investments, the dancers, some of whom earned up to $1,000 a night, are afraid they will never find such well-paid work again. Some, like Ms. Jay, anticipated the economic hardship by moving to Brooklyn from a more expensive apartment in Manhattan. But others, like Sondra, one of 100 performers who lost their jobs after Show World ended live entertainment this summer, were caught off guard. To feed her two children and her disabled mother, Sondra, 31, who would not give her last name, recently registered with an escort service that operates on the Internet.
"Usually I just accompany some rich guy to dinner," she said. "But sometimes after dinner, I have to put out. No matter what they say about stripping, at least I kept my dignity."
Still, Sondra, who has a nursing degree and hopes her escort job will be temporary, says things could be worse. One of her co-workers at Show World lost her apartment two weeks ago, she said, and another with a drug habit occasionally puts on a latex miniskirt and walks the streets near the Port Authority Bus Terminal. "I never imagined that politics could affect my life in such a dramatic way," Sondra said.
Rachel Walsh, a social worker and former stripper who provides advice and job information through the New York City Erotic Dancers Hotline, says she receives a dozen panicked calls a day from those who have lost jobs. "Most of the girls thought this would never happen and were caught completely unprepared," she said.
Ms. Walsh and other advocates for sex industry workers say they fear that many dancers, suddenly deprived of lucrative jobs, will be forced into more compromising employment. "A lot of women have started to turn tricks, which really puts them in danger," she said. "At least dancing doesn't threaten your health and your safety."
 
A 'Good Business' Turns 'Unbearably Nasty'
For now, at least, many of those who recently lost their jobs are living in limbo. Many, like Kim Niles, a former Harmony dancer, get by with loans from friends. "I'm really at a loss," said Ms. Niles, 24, who grew up in the Bronx and dropped out of college after one semester. "Right now all I have is two tokens in my pocket."
A self-effacing, soft-spoken woman, Ms. Niles spent the last four years earning $500 to $800 a night. She says she didn't love to dance but enjoyed the camaraderie of other women, and, more importantly, the freedom it gave her to travel. "I loved not having to get up at 9 A.M. and having the power to control my own destiny," she said. "Now I have no control, and I feel like an idiot for not having made plans."
Although she suspected the end was near, it was not until Aug. 3, while watching the news, that she learned she was jobless. As the Mayor proclaimed the Harmony, which employed 250 women, a "corrosive institution," cameras broadcast its closing. "When I saw my co-workers filing out of the place with coats over their heads," she said, "I knew the game was up."
Since then, Ms. Niles says, she has avoided looking for work at the dwindling number of clubs in the city. "I don't have that Barbie doll look, and I'm afraid of rejection," she said. The prospect of looking for other types of employment, she says, is just as daunting. "What am I going to write on a job application, that I was a lap dancer for the last four years?" she said.
Out of options -- and money -- Ms. Niles said she planned to take a bus to Springfield, Mass., this week to search for work in that city's prodigious crop of topless dance clubs. A friend and former colleague used her savings to buy a house in Springfield, and Ms. Niles said she might also move there. "I don't want to leave New York, and I really don't want to strip for a living, but I don't know what else to do," she said.
Many former dancers, dependent on the lucrative income, are trying to stick it out in adult entertainment. But with hundreds looking for work and the number of clubs declining, jobs in New York are increasingly scarce. Some women are traveling to clubs as far away as Texas, California and Puerto Rico. The clubs that remain open in New York, many women say, are imposing stricter hiring rules and paying less.
Sondra, the former dancer from Show World, said she tried to find work at three high-end gentlemen's strip clubs but was told she "just wasn't right." Later, she said, a sympathetic manager confessed that they were looking to hire blonde women and those with bigger breasts. "This used to be a good business," said Sondra, who is black. "Now it's become unbearably nasty."
After losing her job at the Harmony, Cecilia Angelo headed to San Francisco, where, word had it, work was plentiful. Three weeks later, she was back in New York. "The clubs there were creepy and depressing," said Ms. Angelo, 30, a part-time philosophy student who has been dancing for three years. Like many dancers, Ms. Angelo said she enjoyed working at the Harmony, which attracted a diverse clientele and "men you could have a conversation with and joke with." The management, many dancers say, hired an unconventional mix of women and allowed them to work as little or as much as they wanted.
Since returning to the city in late September, Ms. Angelo says she has been living hand to mouth. Last week she spent a few days dancing at topless clubs in Bridgeport, Conn., but left, she said, after a fellow dancer who was sharing her hotel room stole her possessions. "The girls were nice for the first half-hour and then they turned evil," she said after returning to New York. She tried to work at Legz Diamond, an upscale club on West 54th Street, but quit after one night because the management, she said, expected dancers to pressure customers into buying drinks. She said she felt sorry for the men, mostly out-of-towners, who were coerced into spending $20 for a "private dance" that allowed no touching and included a bouncer who sat a few feet away with one eye on his watch.
"Men would pay for a six-minute dance and then the bouncer would end it in four minutes and force him to tip," she said. "The whole thing felt deceitful." At night's end, she left with $95, far less than the $300 to $500 she often made at the Harmony.
Legz Diamond, Flashdancers, Paradise Club and other glitzy clubs that cater to businessmen and fall within the zoning rules tend to employ so-called industry girls, she explained, "girls who have big hair, boob jobs and a permanent tan."
"I'm not a career dancer," Ms. Angelo said, "and I don't want to be one." Still, she said she's not giving up on dancing, partly on principle. "I'm very stubborn," she said. "I won't let anyone rip it away from me."
 
When the Brass Ring Comes With a G-String
Juan Carlos Acevedo came to New York from Mexico with a standard-issue dream: to perform on Broadway in a big, splashy production. But with limited English and no green card, he quickly discovered the difficulty of finding work in the theater. When he was offered a dance job at Cats, a gay bar just west of Times Square, Mr. Acevedo thought he had grabbed the brass ring. What he didn't realize was that he would be dancing in a G-string. "To be honest, you don't have to be a professional dancer to do that," said Mr. Acevedo, 25, an earnest, shy man who, in the two years since his arrival, has learned to speak fluent English.
If he was wary about working as an erotic dancer, his apprehension was eased by the $200 or more he brought home each night, which helped support his family in Aguas Calientes. In time, he began to enjoy the theatrical aspect of his job and the interaction with patrons. "I started to feel like the host of a party whose job is to make everyone happy," he said. He also fancied himself as a social worker and counselor of sorts, and often spent time listening to the hard-luck tales of his customers, many of them lonely men who came back night after night.
But Mr. Acevedo knew the good times were over early in the summer when uniformed police officers began making regular visits to the club, shining flashlights at patrons and sending a chill through the crowd. When they finally closed Cats in early August, the police cited illegal drug sales they said were taking place in the club.
Since then, Mr. Acevedo has lived off his savings and scrambled to make up for the lost income. Every few weeks he travels to Washington, D.C., to do domestic work for a friend, who pays him $400 a week. A few days ago he began modeling part time at the School of Visual Arts for $10 an hour.
Finding dance work in New York, he said, has become much harder, and with a glut of unemployed dancers, the money is not as good. He said he was not ready to give up on theater, but in the meantime he would like to study computers and find a job to make his parents proud. "I want to try something more respectable," he said. "But right now I don't have money to do anything."
Like many erotic dancers, Sonny Suitz was drawn to the business by the freedom it gave for other pursuits. Ms. Suitz, an aspiring pop singer, could make as much as $600 during "Tranny Night" at Angels, a lap dance club on Walker Street that featured transsexual dancers on Wednesdays.
Besides Angels, Show World was the only club that provided steady employment to transsexuals. "As you can imagine, there aren't a lot of places that hire dancers like me," Ms. Suitz said wryly.
The police closed down Angels the same August night they padlocked the Harmony. Both clubs were owned by Madeline D'Anthony, a former dancer who encouraged her employees to attend rallies at City Hall protesting the new zoning restrictions. Some of those who used to work for Ms. D'Anthony said she planned to open a new club in the coming weeks. Messages left on her voice mail were not returned.
After Angels closed, Ms. Suitz returned to her former job as a customer service representative for Clairol, although she has to work a full week to make half of what she earned in a single night. To save money, she recently moved from her East Village apartment to Park Slope, Brooklyn, stopped going to therapy and cut down on visits to the electrologist. "I've started to do yoga, which is cheaper and calms me the way therapy did," she said.
 
Another Door Closed To Transsexuals
In its final weeks, Ms. Suitz said, Angels's laid-back and friendly work environment became frenzied and cutthroat as laid-off workers from Show World flocked to the club. "The atmosphere became competitive, desperate and uncivilized," she said, "and the place ceased to be fun."
Transsexuals, many of whom have difficulty finding jobs in the mainstream, have been particularly hurt by the closings, social service workers say. Positive Health Project, an organization on West 39th Street that runs safer sex and harm reduction programs for transgendered sex workers, says the crackdown has disrupted its relationship with its clients. Richard Alvarez, an outreach worker, used to give out advice and hundreds of condoms during his twice-a-week visits to Show World. "The girls grew to trust me and looked forward to me coming," he said recently as he walked through the now-deserted sex emporium, its "tranny booths" replaced by billiard tables and rooms that show classic movies. "Now who knows where they are?"
The agency, which sponsors a support group for those in the adult entertainment business, said attendance at its weekly meetings has dropped to eight from two dozen since the crackdown began. "We're worried that these people are being pushed even further underground, driven into riskier types of work," said Jason Farrell, the project's executive director. "It's not like you shut down these clubs and everyone's going to find office jobs."
The brainy college student who strips to pay tuition is something of a cliche, but topless dancing is how Krista Belle put herself through art school in Florida. "It really was the most obvious solution," said Ms. Belle, 23, who was reared in upstate New York and found work at the Harmony after she moved to the city two years ago.
After the Harmony closed, she spent a month dancing in Puerto Rico but realized she did not want to live a life of commuting to dance gigs around the country.
Ms. Belle, who paints and acts in her spare time, is living off her savings and working as a club promoter and disk jockey. She calls herself DJ Krista and bills herself as New York's only topless disk jockey. "I feel like I'll be fine," she said last week as she spun records at Vanity, a nightclub on East 23d Street. "It's the other girls that I worry about."
Many advocates for women say that the club closings will be devastating for minorities, especially those without an education or marketable skills. Rachel Walsh, the social worker, says she is frustrated by her inability to help the unemployed dancers who call her hotline. "For many, especially single mothers who don't have a degree, dancing was the only way to provide their families a decent living," she said. "These days, their options are pretty grim."

Graph: "ENTERPRISE: Sex and the City"
Topless and tap dance clubs in New York generate at least $50 million a year in revenues. If Mayor Giuliani has his way, only 20 sex-related businesses will remain after those in restricted areas have closed. Here's a look at the number of adult businesses in the city in the last three decades.

A Pessimism As Irrational As That Old Exuberance

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
SO, whatever happened to the new economy?
It was only months ago that economists had difficulty seeing any credible threats to an expansion that began in 1991 and begat a stock market that recognized no ceiling. So heady was the ride that economists and fiscal policy makers from Alan Greenspan down were pondering whether the United States had entered a golden era -- one in which business investments in technology were driving a resurgence in productivity and gains in productivity were making strong growth and low unemployment possible without inflation. 
 Well, inflation is still dormant, and the unemployment rate, while inching up, is still near a quarter-century low. But growth is suddenly looking fragile, so much so that economists began talking seriously last week about whether a recession was in the cards for the United States.
But even if the outlook has changed abruptly for the worse, there is still something undeniably new and uncharted in this economy. After all, most periods of economic expansion end when the Federal Reserve is forced to raise interest rates to squelch inflation. But this expansion is at risk because of an altogether more elusive phenomenon: rapidly changing investor psychology.
 WHAT Mr. Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, labeled "irrational exuberance" less than two years ago has given way to fear and pessimism of equally dubious rationality.
"I had argued, in fact quite extensively over the last two or three years, that the markets were becoming too complacent about risk," Mr. Greenspan said last week.
"Well, that has changed," he said to a wave of laughter from his audience of economists. "If there was a dime to turn on, it did. And it has been a fairly dramatic, broad and as yet seemingly incomplete adjustment."
The effects have been well documented. Since Russia in effect defaulted on its debt in mid-August, investors have been diving for the foxholes. Money has been pouring into United States Treasury securities, and credit has become more expensive and difficult to get, not just for developing nations but for corporate borrowers as well.
The squeeze has hardly stopped the economy dead in its tracks. The United States also continues to benefit from what Brian S. Wesbury, an economist at Griffin, Kubik, Stephens & Thompson in Chicago, called a "tremendous productivity performance" that is providing "a good foundation" for an eventual rebound.
Still, a true credit crunch would quickly spill over into the real economy, which is why Mr. Greenspan is clearly so concerned. Should investors and lenders become even more nervous, the problem could force businesses to cut back their plans for expansion and modernization, undercutting a primary force behind the economy's strength.
Moreover, Mr. Greenspan is worried that the downturn in the stock market could scare consumers into cutting back on spending. And if both consumers and businesses feel compelled to retrench, the economy could lose steam quickly.
What the economy faces is, as much as anything, a crisis of confidence.
 PSYCHOLOGY -- in the markets, among consumers, in politics -- is a perilous subject for economists and policy makers. It lacks any certain predictability, and there is no model or playbook for dealing with it.
Indeed, William Dudley, an economist at Goldman, Sachs, says the most obvious tool available to policy makers -- cuts in interest rates -- may not be of much help at this point. The sectors of the economy that are sensitive to interest rates, particularly housing, are already robust. And the rates that are set by the markets already reflect expectations of further rate cuts by the Fed, and so are unlikely to fall much more from their already low levels.
"This is the most bizarre business cycle we've ever had," Mr. Dudley said. "The Fed doesn't have a good template for this."
And the Clinton Administration has, in effect, taken fiscal policy off the table as a means of stimulating the economy. President Clinton's demand that the Federal budget surplus be left untouched until Social Security's financing problems are addressed succeeded in stymieing Republican plans for a big tax cut this year. But it also forced fiscal policy to remain contractionary at a time when the economy appears to be slowing.
Mr. Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin have been heaped with praise over the last few years for their steady economic stewardship. Their credibility with the financial markets is unmatched, and they have proved deft at balancing political and policy pressures from at home and abroad to keep the American economy on an even keel.
But both are probably approaching the final chapters in their careers in public service. Their legacies are likely to rest not only on how they handled the good times the country enjoyed for most of this decade, but also on their success in using their clout and credibility to keep the current expansion going. And given the nature of the threat, that may prove a daunting task even for the likes of them.

HEADLINE: PERSONAL BUSINESS;
A Bankruptcy Rush, Just in Case

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
BY all accounts, President Clinton plans to veto the bankruptcy bill now in the final stages of approval in the Republican Congress. But many debtors aren't taking any chances.
Lawyers across the country are reporting a surge in bankruptcy filings by clients rushing to beat the tough new standards in legislation agreed to by House and Senate negotiators on Wednesday and passed by the House on Friday. 
 The agreement would force many families of four making more than $51,000 a year, and individuals making more than $17,900, to repay part or all of their credit card bills and other unsecured debts by going into Chapter 13 bankruptcy, instead of walking away from them by filing Chapter 7, which cancels most debts.
The White House said President Clinton was unlikely to sign the measure, but lawyers for debtors said many consumers couldn't afford the risk that he would change his mind. "If they are going to have to file, we recommend that they do it without waiting," said Melvin J. Kaplan, a bankruptcy lawyer in Chicago who handles about 1,000 cases annually and whose business has shot up 40 percent over the past month.
William P. Binzel, vice president for government affairs for Mastercard International, said bankruptcy lawyers were creating a sense of panic among debtors when none was warranted. "Income is only the first threshold," he said of the proposed rules. "Then judges will look at expenses in each metropolitan area" to determine if a debtor can pay some credit card bills.
But Charles W. Juntikka, a bankruptcy lawyer in Manhattan, disagreed. "If your Chapter 13 fails because you get sick or lose your job or your car gets stolen, this bill says that you could be denied refuge in Chapter 7 and be thrown to the mercy of the credit card companies," he said. "Whether you could stay in bankruptcy would depend on the luck of the draw as to what judge you get, and that introduces a degree of uncertainty that makes it crazy to delay filing."
Mr. Juntikka said his business had increased by a third in recent weeks and he had four dozen files on his desk representing people who could be forced into Chapter 13 under the proposed rules.
The plight of one of his clients, Elaine Salmon, 43, a city corrections officer at the Bronx House of Detention for Men, illustrates the problems many consumers face. Because Ms. Salmon makes a $35,000 base salary, she would be forced into Chapter 13 under the rules in the bill.
But while her income places her statistically in the ranks of the middle class, she said her finances had been devastated by a marital separation, her 9-year-old daughter's illnesses and the theft of her Jeep, on which she has been unable to collect insurance compensation. She is sinking under $36,200 in unsecured debt.
 TO ease the burden, Ms. Salmon took her daughter out of Catholic school and ended the girl's skating lessons. But, realizing such moves were ineffectual against debt so large, she went to Mr. Juntikka's office on Wednesday to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy papers. "I'm not living some high life like the banks are saying on the television," Ms. Salmon said, referring to assertions of abuse of bankruptcy by debtors.
The credit card industry says the overhaul is needed to reverse an explosion of personal-bankruptcy filings to a record 728,000 in the first half of this year and to force deadbeats to repay some debt.
But critics say the bill would not stop abuses by wealthy individuals, who could put their assets into homes in Florida or Texas, where state laws protect even the most expensive homes from creditors so long as they bought the homes two years or more before filing bankruptcy.
Norma Hammes of San Jose, Calif., the president of the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Lawyers, called the final legislation "a nightmare for consumers."
"I have little red sticky tags on about 20 cases," she said. She has flagged them to be filed immediately if the bill is sent to the White House.
And H. Jason Gold of Gold & Stanley in Alexandria, Va., a lawyer who represents creditors, said that if the bill became law it would prove impractical and be "bound to fail" because it didn't reflect the economic realities that debtors face.

HEADLINE: The World: Taboos, Globally Speaking;
Like Politics, All Political Correctness Is Local

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBERG

 BODY:
IF there is a worldwide canard about political correctness, it is that it's an American disease. Geopolitically speaking, though, that is wildly incorrect. Every country has its own strain.
The Japanese think it bad taste to talk about burakumin, social outcasts that include leather tanners and slaughterhouse workers. It recalls ancient prejudices, but there are lands where the repetition of not-so-old cruelties is what evokes horror: the mention of "scientific racism" in Germany, for example, or the similar assumptions behind South Africa's "grand apartheid." 
 All these linguistic taboos have something in common: they are meant to take the sting out of confrontations by constantly ratcheting down the sharpness of the words used. In the United States, this is the process by which, over decades, "village idiot" ratchets down to "slow," which ratchets down to "retarded," then to "challenged" and then all the way down to "special."
 
In America's Image
 In today's global culture, some of this kind of thing is happening all over. Sometimes it is simply a reflection of fashions emanating from America. In Mexico, for instance, where it is still common for the common man to call homosexuals "maricones," a deep insult, the politically correct will say "gay" (though the word is pronounced "guy" and means nothing in Spanish).
Nonetheless, political correctness isn't just about America's unspeakable words. It takes taboos to tangle, and taboos tend to be local. For instance, Japanese newspapers simply avoid mentioning burakumin and even the occupations they practiced, like butchering meat. In formal Japanese, no one is blind, bald, fat or ugly. And while a tall man in a group is "the tall one," a short man is "the fourth from the left."
In Latin America, by contrast, a short man can be "petiso" -- "shorty" -- and a dark-skinned man "negro," and no offense is taken. But make an aside about someone's mother and there will be trouble.
With informers around for 20 years under the juntas, discussing politics in most Latin American countries used to be dangerous, especially for anyone who let slip socialist catchwords like "bourgeoisie." Now politics can be discussed freely, but one must disparage politicians.
In France, discussing politics has always been the chief instrument of torture used at the dinner table. Unrepentant lefties will excuse a wildcat strike as a "social movement," while average folks may toe the pan-European line and justify government austerity measures. Jean-Marie Le Pen's right-wing National Front gets 15 percent of the vote, so somebody must be discussing him, but the newspapers just don't like to. Liberal journalists say ignoring his views will suppress them, but the theory seems thin.
Meanwhile, if Americans are sick of discussing Bill Clinton's sex life, the French are sick at the idea that Americans discuss it at all. They assume their presidents fool around -- Francois Mitterrand's mistress and daughter attended his funeral -- and the national "don't ask, don't tell" policy never compels a leader to lie or obstruct justice about sex (not that the French expect their presidents to be incapable of either).
The Germans, by contrast, have many things that are illegal to say or do, all related to the Nazi era: one may not deny the Holocaust or make the Hitler salute. Except for rebellious skinheads and soccer hooligans, jingoism is out, and outspoken anti-foreigner sentiment is frowned upon. Still, many privately blame Turks and Africans for higher crime rates and encourage tougher immigration laws.
Some concepts protected by political correctness in the United States don't export at all in most places -- women's rights, for example. These are rapidly, and sometimes violently, retreating in much of the Muslim world. And in Mexico, secretarial ads still ask for "good-looking young women."
Foreigners can't keep up with American changes, and often think them foolish. Probably the most fashion-policed word anywhere is that with which Americans refer to their countrymen of African ancestry. In 50 years, that defining term has shifted from colored to Negro to black to Afro-American to people of color to African-American.
Foreigners may hoot at that, but they too have yielded to subtle pressure to rename their minorities. Polite euphemisms coined by 19th-century liberals -- "natives" in Africa, "aboriginals" in Australia (no doubt to avoid words like "savages") -- are now themselves out of favor. "Indigenous" is O.K. in Australia. It used to be O.K. in Mexico, but "Indios" is now preferred. (There is no confusion with people from the Indian Subcontinent; Mexicans call all of them "hindus" -- pronounced "EEN-doos" -- even if they're Pakistani Muslims or Christians.)
An African, by contrast, would never take a cue from the now-fashionable American invention "Native American" because "natives" is an old insult. In South Africa, the former "Bantus" (an inoffensive word elsewhere in Africa) now run the country, and non-whites are sometimes called "the previously disadvantaged." There is also nothing basic about "black" -- in some contexts it refers only to black Africans while in others it includes mixed-race people and Indians.
When it comes to the context of political correctness, in some ways South Africa resembles America, with blacks and whites exchanging hostilities across an economic divide. In others, it is unique. Its constitution, for example, curbs hate speech and forbids discrimination that is based not just on race and religion but also on sex, sexual preference, handicap, pregnancy status and almost every imaginable ground.
Perhaps because South Africa spent so much of the apartheid era in isolation, America's political correctness and the backlash against it arrived simultaneously.
 
Black and White
 Take race. Everyone talks about crime, but for whites to dwell on it too long smacks of racism, because most criminals are black. Suburban wives complain about their maids, and husbands complain about labor productivity, but it's all code for "the blecks." White and black liberals strain to ask people of other races to dinner, but to get caught practicing tokenism is a faux pas.
Given its many races, however, South Africa is also remarkably rich in racial insults. It has a macho culture where one is expected to roll with a punch and sensitive types are mocked. In young, racially mixed groups of friends, people lightheartedly use words like "darkie" and "hout-kop" (wood-head) for blacks, "coolie" and "curry-muncher" for Indians, "bushie" (Bushman) or "half-naat" (half-baked) for coloreds and "whitey" or "mlungu" for whites.
Meanwhile, English-speaking whites call uncouth Afrikaner ones "hairybacks" or "rockspiders," while Afrikaners call the other whites "rooinek" -- rednecks, as in sunburned British soldiers -- or worse.
And then there is Russia, where the most discriminated-against groups are residents of the Caucasus -- Chechnyans, Azerbaijanis, Georgians and so on. There, unlike elsewhere, Caucasians are relatively dark skinned -- and to Russians inclined to be derogatory, this makes them "chorniye" or "blacks" (except when this is seen to be insensitive, in which case Caucasians become "people of Caucasian nationality.")
In other words, in Russia it's the Caucasians who can be blacks, but a person of African extraction is never black, except derogatorily. (A white Russian, of course, is vodka, Kahlua and cream.)

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Letting Reality Settle In

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Plenty of sound and fury emanated from the stock market this week. What does it signify? In one of the more tumultuous weeks on record, the Dow Jones industrial average ended at 7,899.52, up just 1.3 percent.
Not much of a move on the week. But investors stomached enormous swings. On Thursday, the Dow fell 274 points before clawing its way back. It jumped 167.61 points on Friday, or 2.17 percent. 
 Does the end-of-the-week about-face represent a real turning point? Or is it just another sucker's rally?
There are, of course, highly intelligent market observers who will argue that the gloom has just begun, while others say the worst is over. The truth, of course, is unknowable. But after a volatile week, tallying the good news and the bad may be in order.
What is hurting the stock market? The big fear, though not news, is that corporate profits will disappoint or even plunge later this year and in 1999. Since earnings drive stock prices, this is a grave concern. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is trading at approximately 23 times earnings, well down from its peak of 28, but still high historically.
Meanwhile, other key props have recently been kicked out from under the stock market. A big one: support from foreign buyers.
As long as the dollar was strong against foreign currencies, United States stocks looked attractive to foreign investors. They poured $116.1 billion into equities in the first three months of 1998; in the second quarter, they bought only $55.4 billion.
Now, with the dollar in free fall, foreigners are almost certainly fleeing American markets. Japanese investors in both stocks and bonds, for example, are big losers, thanks to their strengthening currency. Since Aug. 21, when the 30-year Treasury bond began its big move up, the dollar has lost 19 percent against the yen, more than wiping out the roughly 9 percent a bondholder would have made in the period. In those months, the Dow lost 7.5 percent. With the dollar down 9 percent against the mark, German investors are also hurting.
Also contributing to the downturn in stocks are the beginnings of what may be a severe credit contraction. The titanic borrowings of hedge funds are only just beginning to be unwound. As these and other speculators -- including individual investors who are heavily leveraged in their stock holdings -- are forced to come up with more cash as collateral, they will be forced to sell positions in which they may have profits. This could knock down big-name stocks that are still up for the year.
Now for the positives. Investors are no longer eager to buy whenever stocks drop. Ridding the market of complacency is good.
Other excesses are getting flushed out of the system. Hedge funds -- this bull market's version of the investors in 1929 who borrowed to buy stocks at 10 cents on the dollar -- are being clipped. They have been a destabilizing force in the markets; eliminating some will be helpful.
The weaker dollar has benefits, too. It will help make the exports of American companies more affordable overseas, possibly bolstering corporate profits. A strong Japanese yen, meanwhile, will forestall the potential for another deadly round of currency devaluations in the Pacific Rim.
If the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond continues to strengthen against shorter-term notes, as it did at the end of the week, that could aid the market, too. Banks now can lend at rates that are considerably higher than their borrowing costs. Since banks have led the market both up and down this year, a turnaround there will have an upbeat effect over all.
Economic gloom and doom on mass-market magazine covers is another good sign. When these folks discover a bull or bear market, the trend is usually about to end.
Tom McClellan, editor of the McClellan Market Report in Lakewood, Wash., finds today's market strikingly similar to that of 1988-91. Stock prices, he says, are "in the neighborhood" of a bottom. He also says that since 1940, stocks have typically hit their depths around midterm elections.
None of this means, of course, that we are out of the woods. Indeed, at week's end, the average New York Stock Exchange stock was down 40 percent from the July peak; the average Nasdaq stock was down 55 percent. Yet favorite stocks like Dell Computer, Microsoft and Intel were still well off their lows. This suggests some downside ahead.
Still, bear markets usually end with a thunder clap, on a day of panic selling and investor exhaustion. Such a day has not yet happened. When it does, hello bulls.

HEADLINE: How We Fell, Then And Now

BYLINE: By Jay McInerney; Jay McInerney is the author, most recently, of "Model Behavior."

 BODY:
The sense of shock is different this time around. The stretch limos, the hubristic shoulder pads and the junk bonds of the 80's were bound to excite the anger of the gods, but hey, we've been riding around in Jeeps and dowdy gray Town Cars for the last 11 years.
We threw away all those big suits in '88, the bonds in our portfolios are AA rated or better, and we never do drugs anymore, at least not in public and hardly ever during the week. 
 The 90's were the Stealth Decade: tastefully discreet, self-conscious, sober. (Or was that sneaky and hypocritical?) Somehow we imagined that our sport utility vehicles were invisible to the radar of fate, and we can't quite believe we're suddenly taking this heavy incoming fire.
Even those of us who didn't have a dime in the stock market 11 years ago had a weird inkling by the time we woke up on Oct. 20 that something big had happened, that the party might be ending. The model was already in place: once the 80's started getting compared to the 20's the conclusion seemed inevitable.
But the crash of '87 turned out to be more significant symbolically than economically, the slump that followed Black Monday was delayed and relatively benign compared with the one that squelched the roar of the 20's.
My brother, an investment banker, sounded wistful the other day as he recalled the crash of '87. "Eighty-seven was like, if you were on vacation for a week you missed it," he said. "The bond guys did O.K., and things recovered fairly quickly. But this is much more widespread."
Back then I seem to recall a certain masochistic comfort in the notion that the laws of gravity still prevailed; we understood we were being punished for our sins: wretched excess, greed, leverage, trophy wives, nightclubs with exclusionary door policies, post-modern architecture, cocaine, Duran Duran, the couture of Christian Lacroix.
The fact that big sinners like Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken were behind bars made it easier for us to sit out our hangovers in devalued co-op apartments, with those espresso machines that we never really learned how to operate.
And if we were living in Ann Arbor or Altoona, we probably didn't even hear the big crash. Back then, not that many Americans owned securities -- or a suit with an Armani label.
If the hypertrophied RJR Nabisco deal seemed to symbolize the end of the bad old days, Henry Kravis, the prime mover of that deal, set the tone for the new decade when he replaced ur-trophy wife Carolyne Roehm with an intellectual several years her senior. Clearly the 90's were going to be serious and substantive. Red dresses and yellow ties suddenly disappeared. The 80's, in disgrace, were hounded out of town and eventually found a new home across the ocean in London. And we all said we were sorry.
The most surprising thing about the 90's, really, is how long it has taken us to realize that this decade makes its predecessor look innocent and quaint. Even, dare we say it, temperate. After disappearing for a few years, the leveraged buyout came back bigger than ever. And after stumbling along for a while, the Dow Jones industrial average rocketed to heights that would have seemed unimaginable to the putative high fliers of the 80's in their Gulfstream Threes. Martini, anyone? Cohiba Esplendido?
Suddenly everyone, everywhere was getting in on the action, through pension funds or mutual funds. For those who weren't content with a mere 30 percent return on capital, hedge funds came along and made greenmail seem like a piker's game. Nobody knew how they worked, but the nomenclature was reassuring: "hedge fund" sounded like a conservative, cover-your-bets financial instrument. It rang totally 90's, just as "junk bond," from our 90's perspective, sounds so perfectly, vulgarly 80's. I mean, what did those clowns at Drexel Burnham expect?
Six months ago I had dinner with an acquaintance from the financial sector. "To be a player these days," he told me, "you've got to have 100 million." In a tone that suggested he thought the club was getting just a little too democratic, he estimated that there were about 300 such players just on the island of Manhattan. Until that moment I would never have guessed my dinner partner, whom I had known for five years, was a man of such mind-boggling means. A Stealth tycoon, he kept a low social profile, went to church, remained happily married to his first wife and had affected none of the flamboyant hobbies associated with massive wealth.
In the 90's, new money started behaving like old money, which counts surely as a triumph of style when we compare the current decade with its flashy predecessor. There was a feeling abroad that the lessons of the 80's had been absorbed, even as our expectations became inflated far beyond those of that famously reckless decade. Because we didn't flaunt our winnings, we felt we deserved them. That seems to be part of the reason for the sense of shock and indignation that has spread far beyond Wall Street these past few weeks. We've all become so used to the idea that style is substance -- we're indignant that our good manners and our new clothes didn't protect us.

HEADLINE: Long-Term Capital: A Case Of Markets Over Minds

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS FRANTZ and PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
BOND traders nicknamed Long-Term Capital Management "Salomon North," a reference to the many partners in the Greenwich, Conn., hedge fund who were veterans of Salomon Brothers. But a more apt choice might have been "M.I.T. South."
The people -- and the mathematical "rocket science" -- at the core of the elite hedge fund had strong ties to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the working atmosphere was far closer to the studied tranquillity of academia than to a frenetic trading floor. 
 Even the setting in wealthy, quiet Greenwich was chosen to contrast with the gray skyscrapers and crowded, narrow streets of Manhattan's financial district. The partners, many of whom had mined those financial canyons for tens of millions of dollars, traded suits and ties for polo shirts and chinos, preferring to relieve stress with a game of pool or a fishing break.
The mood was collegial, recalled Peter van Rijssen, a recent college graduate who spent a pleasant three months as a $17-an-hour temp at Long-Term Capital in the summer of 1996. "Everyone was extremely friendly, from the boss on down," he said. "It was very calm and ordered."
That order was shattered last month as Long-Term Capital ran out of money and was deemed too big to fail without disrupting the global financial markets, leading to an emergency $3.6 billion capital infusion by a consortium of brokerage firms and banks organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
As the winds of turmoil strip away some of the firm's secrecy, a portrait emerges of a group of highly analytical, extremely rational former academics who believed they had created a mathematical trading model to withstand the sharpest gyrations of the global marketplace. In hindsight, their lack of trading instincts and their adherence to numerical models -- which showed that their bets would eventually pay off -- kept them from understanding the gravity of their situation until it was too late.
So certain were they of the firm's infallibility that they kept virtually all their money in the fund, treating it as a checking account, and borrowed money to increase their personal stakes in it. Some expected to attain riches that would put them on a par with the wealthiest dynasties in America.
One of the 16 partners, Lawrence E. Hilibrand, an M.I.T. graduate who earned $23 million at Salomon in 1990, borrowed $24 million last year to increase his investment in the fund. Now Mr. Hilibrand, his partners and many of firm's 180 employees are scrambling to avoid financial ruin and anguishing over the damage they have inflicted to themselves and their investors.
"Our wealth has been knocked down to zero in many cases," said a person involved with the firm. "But most of us came from backgrounds of academics and teaching, and it wasn't too long ago that we didn't have much." Of course, many of them have long become accustomed to the trappings of wealth.
The partners at Long-Term Capital have laid low, generally declining requests for interviews. "They have always been extraordinarily secretive and didn't want to be in any publication," said Antoine Bernheim, who could not even get enough information to include Long-Term Capital in his annual hedge fund directory. But several people involved with the firm agreed to speak on condition that their names be withheld.
 JOHN W. MERIWETHER, a pioneer in betting on fluctuations in bond prices, a strategy known as bond arbitrage, recruited many of the finest minds in finance, most from his former firm, Salomon Brothers, to create Long-Term Capital in 1993. They shared an intellectual approach to the world of trading, one that flowed from their backgrounds in academia and their doctorates in finance.
"These guys are among the best and the brightest," said William A. McIntosh, a former Salomon partner and a former colleague of many Long-Term Capital principals.
The partners "tried not to react to things too quickly," said one person involved since the early days. "We have tried to study things very carefully. We have tried to do it very slowly."
That strategy was well suited to the good times but would come back to haunt the partners when market volatility outstripped their ability to react.
Among the fund's original partners were two academics who had spent time at M.I.T. and who would later share a Nobel Prize, Myron S. Scholes of Stanford University and Robert C. Merton of Harvard University, whose groundbreaking work in 1973 had turned risk management into a science and opened up Wall Street to the era of "rocket scientists," the mathematics and physics whizzes who trade according to formulas instead of hunches.
Mr. Scholes, whose Greenwich house overlooks Indian Harbor on a private road, played a key role in soliciting money for the original fund, according to one fund investor. "At the presentation, he was just the brightest guy I'd ever heard," the investor said. "It was a collection of uniquely intelligent men."
The rocket scientists included Eric R. Rosenfeld, a former professor at the Harvard Business School who had been a managing director at Salomon, and Gregory D. Hawkins, another former Salomon managing director and a former finance professor at the University of California at Berkeley.
Like Mr. Hilibrand, Mr. Rosenfeld and Mr. Hawkins did graduate work at M.I.T. when Mr. Merton was on the faculty there. Mr. Scholes did his pioneering work while a junior faculty member at M.I.T. David W. Mullins Jr., who left the No. 2 spot at the Federal Reserve Board to join the venture, received his doctorate from M.I.T. at the same time Mr. Scholes was teaching there.
Later, two others with M.I.T. connections joined Long-Term Capital: David M. Modest, who had moved to Berkeley as a finance professor after graduating from M.I.T., and Chi-Fu Huang, an expert on creating models for swap contracts, financial instruments designed to take advantage of currency, bond and other price differences.
Success came fast. The firm, which is organized as a limited partnership with a minimum investment of $10 million, began trading in February 1994 and produced a net return of 20 percent that year, 43 percent in 1995 and 41 percent in 1996. In the first three years, investors more than doubled their money, far better than they would have done in a typical American stock fund. The fees that the firm charged investors were hefty, too -- a 2 percent management fee and a 25 percent annual "incentive" fee, both well above those of other firms -- but no one was complaining.
Along with attracting money from wealthy individuals and institutions, the partners contributed about $150 million of their own money to the investment pool and then treated the fund like a private bank.
"Some months they would withdraw $10,000, and when they had a big purchase, they would take out more," said one person involved with the firm.
 SOME purchases were big, indeed, befitting risk takers who were reaping big rewards. Some of the partners had bought into a golf course in Ireland. Others began to learn about wine and developed a taste for $100-a-bottle Burgundies, like Gevrey-Chambertin.
Mr. Meriwether, a top earner on Wall Street for 15 years, already owned a 67-acre estate in Westchester County, N.Y. But even after earning $23 million in 1990 at Salomon Brothers, Mr. Hilibrand and his family remained in a $1 million colonial on about an acre in Scarsdale, N.Y. In 1996, though, he and his wife, Deborah, paid $2.1 million for a 15-acre lot in a gated development in northwest Greenwich and began to build a $4 million home, according to records on file with the town's division of buildings. Construction is nearly completed, and the builder said recently that no one had told him to stop work.
Mr. Hilibrand shuns interviews and refused to have his photograph taken when he was a managing director at Salomon. Friends describe him as a political libertarian and say he is obsessed with his privacy.
Mr. Hilibrand is one of at least four Long-Term Capital partners who took out personal loans, secured by their shares in the firm, to increase their investments in the portfolio, according to people involved in the transactions. His loans are the largest, at $24 million.
Hans U. Hufschmid, who received $18 million in compensation from Salomon in 1993, according to a former firm official, also borrowed heavily. People involved with the firm said Mr. Hufschmid, a foreign-exchange expert who works out of the firm's London office, had borrowed $14.6 million to increase his fund equity.
Now Mr. Hilibrand and Mr. Hufscmid are negotiating with creditors from Credit Lyonnais and other banks to reschedule their debts and to persuade lenders to take a claim on future earnings, say bankers and others involved in the talks.
It is probably too soon to say whether anyone will be pushed into personal bankruptcy. "If banks require them to pay it today, they can't pay it," said one person involved in the firm's finances. "Their assets must stay in the fund. They also have other liquid things in their names. I believe everything can be worked out."
 AT the very least, the fabulous wealth has evaporated, and some partners may lose everything they have accumulated in recent years, from mansions to wine cellars.
"If people have to sell their homes, it's not the end of the world," said the person involved in the finances.
Mr. Scholes may have at least some money outside the fund. After he and Mr. Merton shared the $1 million for the Nobel economics prize in 1997, Mr. Scholes told a reporter that he would not be investing his portion in the hedge fund. "I thought about that," he told Institutional Investor magazine. "But I think it's in bad taste."
For some lower-level employees, the collapse of the firm means more than just lost wealth. A couple of days after the Sept. 23 bailout, a trader entered the office of one partner and began to weep. He said he feared that he would have to cancel his wedding because he had been wiped out, said a person who witnessed the scene.
The partners' decision to hang on to their market positions even as their capital evaporated and markets turned against them was completely in tune with their "take it slow" character. Trouble became apparent in May, when the portfolio lost 6.5 percent. In June, it lost 10 percent, leaving it down 5 percent for the first half of 1998, its first period in the red, according to people involved with the firm.
 THE cataclysm came on Aug. 17, when Russia devalued its currency and halted payments on its debt, sending bond prices down almost across-the-board. Only United States Treasury securities were spared as investors decided safety was everything. Nearly every big investment house and bank that trades bonds took a hit, but Long-Term Capital was devastated because its positions were spread across the globe and it had invested as much as $100 billion in borrowed money.
By the end of August, the portfolio was down 44 percent for the month and 52 percent for the year.
After failed attempts to raise more money, the partners agreed to a rescue in late September by the consortium of 14 brokerage firms and banks. In exchange for an infusion of $3.6 billion in capital, the equity of the investors, including the partners and employees, was reduced to 10 percent and tight restrictions were set on their ability to withdraw funds.
For the moment, Long-Term Capital, rescued by its nervous creditors, has narrowly avoided a meltdown, and its partners with big debts, like Mr. Hilibrand and Mr. Hufschmid, seem sanguine about avoiding bankruptcy.
Things could still get worse -- if the financial markets eat away at the fund's capital and the rescue falls apart -- but the bulk of the risk has been shifted from Greenwich back to Wall Street, no small bit of rocket science itself.
"There is an old axiom in the restructuring business: If you're going to fail, then fail very big," said Thomas Maloney, a partner at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. That way, he explained, your creditors have to bail you out.
 
Chart: "Next Stop Greenwich"
As if there were a pipeline, many of the most influential economic and financial minds from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge seemed to be drawn to Long-Term Capital Management in Connecticut, where they turned their arcane quantitative theories into dizzying investment practices. But markets don't always respect the primacy of intellect, and Long-Term Capital's brain trust is seeing a reversal of fortune.

Partisan Rancor: Not Always So Bad for the National Soul

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE tidy, fateful day of partisan struggle was winding down as Representative Henry J. Hyde, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, forwarded the recommended impeachment inquiry of President Clinton to certain approval by the House.
But he suddenly looked up, recalling another bit of urgent business -- the committee's need to pose for its official group photograph. "I plead with you to show up," Mr. Hyde said to the lawmakers, intent on replacing the existing class photo. "I have a lopsided picture in my office, not very bipartisan." To his left, Barney Frank, the outspoken Democrat with the trigger instinct of a standup comic, interjected, "Why should that be any different, Mr. Chairman?" 
 There followed some easy laughter that was rare and much needed as counterpoint in the rigidly partisan day as the committee launched the House impeachment vessel upon highly uncertain political seas.
 
Factions and Facts
In the partisan debate that formally blessed the inquiry, the Watergate gavel wielded artfully 24 years ago by Peter W. Rodino Jr., Mr. Hyde's predecessor in the impeachment of Richard M. Nixon, was invoked as if it were the magic sword of Excalibur. "Here we may be partisan in the highest sense," pleaded Christopher B. Cannon, Republican of Utah. "We must argue our views, we must look for facts and characterizations that favor our side."
But lurking about the 105th Congress are some of the darker insights of the Founding Fathers about partisanship, or factionalism, as it was then termed.
"The latent causes of faction are sown in the nature of man," cautioned James Madison, the Constitution's architect, in the Federalist Papers. "An attachment to different leaders, ambitiously contending for pre-eminence and power," he warned, has "divided mankind into parties, inflamed them with mutual animosity."
Madison's words might well be carved in House stone in qualification of the more idealized Capitol chiselings on nonpartisanship that urge debaters onward and upward.
"Not long ago, partisanship was a tool with which one accomplished a policy agenda," said former Representative Pat Williams, a Democrat looking back from his new and gentler career as an environmentalist in Montana. "Now it's a mechanism whereby one destroys the opponent, embarrasses his family and puts him in jail at the end of the day. I think the American people despise it."
With similar regret, other Capitol Hill veterans insist there truly were better times of partisan disputation focused on ideas -- before "to Bork" was coined as a political attack verb, from the undermining of a Republican Supreme Court nominee.
Those were days, too, before Newt Gingrich wielded the partisanship of personal attack in destroying his Democratic rival, Speaker Jim Wright, in a scandal assault. There are old-timers aghast that these days Speaker Gingrich and the Democratic House minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, can barely tolerate each other's presence, while the late Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill was a beloved buddy of Bob Michel, the Republican minority leader, when the sun set each day on their legislative wrangling.
"Don't forget the Republicans had 40 years to collect grievances," said M. Caldwell Butler, a former Republican Congressman from Virginia, recalling his party's decades in the House wilderness. He well remembers his freshman year in the minority on the Judiciary Committee, when the Watergate partisanship was indeed heavy-handed at first, despite the fabled Rodino gavel. But this ultimately eased.
"As you get near the nitty-gritty and the rules are ironed out, you start addressing the facts. And the inclination becomes less partisan and more specific between yourself and your own conscience and not the party," said Mr. Butler, a 10-year House veteran who finally voted to impeach. "My own perception of it was that as the Democratic majority became more aware of the importance of having a bipartisan vote on impeachment, the deliberations became more bipartisan."
Chairman Hyde is hoping for a similar syndrome, provided the nitty-gritty is deemed to be there in the case against Mr. Clinton, and presumably with such partisan factors as Mr. Gingrich himself offstage. Initially, at least, the Clinton case seems problematic for the furious tangle of partisan animus and factual dispute at its heart. To win over Democrats and the public, the Republicans must move beyond some members' plain detestation of Mr. Clinton as their partisan engine, and prevail on the firmer historical ground of a two-party adversary proceeding rooted in demonstrated fact and Constitutional principle.
 
Clarifying Agent
The House vote approving the inquiry had a slight protective coloration of bipartisanship, with 31 Democrats voting with the Republicans, in fear, perhaps, of being demagogued as blatantly tolerant of the President's transgressions. But Democrats are fearful of gross partisanship in the coming inquiry. David P. Schippers, the Republicans' Judiciary counsel, while trumpeting himself as a die-hard Democrat, incensed committee Democrats with an emotional postscript to his initial reading of the case against Mr. Clinton -- a caution that America's hallowed generations "are looking down and judging what you do." Mr. Hyde quickly struck the moralizing remarks from the record, but Mr. Schippers was unapologetic. "If they don't like what I said, that's too bad," he told reporters.
The politics of personal attack are rooted in well-funded campaign stratagems that can dominate politicians' styles even before they arrive here. The public plainly eschews partisanship as the sort of device that infamously saw the Government shut down in a budget fight. But historically, partisanship can be viewed as a clarifying agent as much as a muddling device when the great issues are at stake.
In the furiously fought impeachment of President Andrew Johnson, who was finally spared by the margin of one Senate vote, the issue was how punitively or magnanimously to re-integrate the South into the Union -- nothing less than how to make the country whole again. In the Senate censure of Andrew Jackson in 1834 after his scuttling of the national bank (a censure soon reversed), the issues were Federal versus local power and the shape of the nascent economy at a critical juncture between agrarianism and industrialization. Big stuff, and again necessarily ugly, perhaps, in the tooth-and-claw partisanship of debate. And the Nixon impeachment was about a White House's array of criminal behavior finally closing in on the nation's leader, with Congressional partisanship itself the nation's last best adversary device for testing the charges.
"There never was a nonpartisan in politics," President Harry S. Truman fervidly insisted, amused at the very idea, long before such phenomena as Watergate and Monica S. Lewinsky ever surfaced, that any critical dispute in the life of a nation can be somehow devoid of partisanship.

HEADLINE: The World: Boom;
A Panic Can Be Stopped, Until It Starts

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS the world's finance ministers and bankers argued and strategized here last week about the most virulent outbreak of economic turmoil in half a century, it often seemed as if they were watching a spectacular fire, viewed from the safety of a well-catered picnic just across the river.
While nibbling on fresh shrimp and sushi, the leaders of the global economy marveled at how high the flames were soaring, and how quickly they leapt from house to house. But mostly, they talked about what an amazing global economic village they planned to build some day on the charred landscape. 
 It will be magnificent: Big buildings equipped with computer-controlled sprinkler systems that kick into action at the first whiff of smoke. A protective shield will descend on nearby structures to keep them from going up in flames, too. There will be new safety rules: Kindly leave your combustible hedge funds, your insolvent banks, and your crony capitalists at the door.
The only thing that was missing was a plan for putting the fire out.
At the crisis-wracked annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank -- the institutions created 53 years ago to assure global stability after World War II -- the 21st-century village was termed the "new international financial architecture." President Clinton insisted it would be designed "to tame the pattern of boom-bust on an international scale."
Unfortunately, the groundbreaking ceremony is years away. And with 20 million people in East Asia falling back into poverty this year, the I.M.F. cutting its estimates for world growth by more than half, Muscovites taking to the streets and the dollar taking a mysterious 25 percent plunge in two days, it seemed odd that the overseers of the global economy were more comfortable talking about how to prevent the next crisis than how to survive this one.
It didn't exactly help when Michel Camdessus, the I.M.F.'s managing director, tried to sound reassuring by declaring, "We are not in 1928."
 
Uncharted Territory
 It is hardly surprising that everyone wants to talk about long-term solutions. New financial architectures sound neat and well-planned, a system as thoroughly modern as trading stocks on the Internet. Unfortunately, solving the immediate crisis is far messier -- for it involves navigating a global economic landscape no one has mapped, complicated by political failures no one could have predicted.
At the core of the economic problem is a classic panic: Fear has overwhelmed greed. The Asian crisis caused investors around the world to pull back. But Russia's economic collapse last summer signaled that countries really can default -- and there is not much their creditors can do about it.
Ever since, banks and investors have been unwilling to take the normal risks that are a necessary part of keeping the world running smoothly. Suddenly they see trouble everywhere, and they are simply refusing to lend or invest in countries to which, only 18 months ago, they were willing to funnel money at astoundingly low interest rates. Now all that money has poured out of emerging markets like Southeast Asia and Latin America and fled to safe havens, chiefly United States Treasury bonds. The resulting shortage of credit is strangling economies around the world, and threatening to afflict the American economy, too.
"I've never seen anything like this," said Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve and no stranger to odd things that happen when a herd mentality takes hold.
The new architecture everyone is talking about is supposed to quell this kind of flight for the exits -- first by setting up a system of global smoke detectors that would sound whenever a country was courting financial trouble, and then by setting up a system of common rules so investors would know that bad debt problems, if they arise, would be dealt with sensibly. The thinking is that if all nations and their biggest corporations are required to reveal far more data to investors, people might think twice about how much money they pour in. And building some common legal standards for dealing with bad debts, bankruptcies and defaults could prevent a wild stampede for the exits as soon as a crisis breaks out.
But creating these systems takes time. It took America and Europe most of this century to figure out how to regulate the markets -- and it is still a work in progress, as the near-collapse of a giant hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, proved just a few weeks ago. Getting nations new to market capitalism to embrace these rules could take decades. But the crisis is now.
In ordinary times, the process of restoring confidence -- a psychological feat as much as an economic one -- and persuading people to put their money to work again would be hard enough. But these days it is made even harder by something that markets and investors hate -- political uncertainty, as far as the eye can see.
The financial ministers here were treated to the extraordinary experience of debating the future of the world economy face-to-face with a President who was in the opening phase of what promises to be a long impeachment inquiry. "You might find that the leader of the world's biggest economy," one European finance minister said, "could spend more time figuring out ways to save the world economy if he was not also trying to save his job."
But Europe has its own distractions: a change of Government in Germany and a preoccupation with monetary union, a process that could be undermined if a world recession sets in. Japan was here to reassure the world -- again -- that after seven years of dithering, it finally understands that its fast-sinking banking system is sucking down its neighbors as well. But ask Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, and he responds in a tone of I'll-believe-it-when-I-see-it. Add to this the first big investment-house collapse in China, more anti-Chinese riots in Indonesia, and a fraying, nuclear-equipped Russia that can't decide whether failed capitalism is better or worse than failed Communism.
 
Looking for Has Anyone Seen Vision?
 "In times of uncertainty, when you have a global crisis, you need one or two powers with the vision and the reach to act globally," said Kenneth Courtis, the chief economist in Asia for Deutsche Bank. "And yet every day, you see evidence that everyone is preoccupied -- either not interested, or interested and unable to move."
There are some steps that many here thought would help. President Clinton repeated his call for a global movement to promote growth, chiefly by cutting interest rates. He was talking largely about Europe, but Germany spent the week resisting; it is traditionally preoccupied by inflation, even though the threat to the world these days is deflation. In private, several officials said, Mr. Clinton was fuming.
Some Europeans, the least affected so far by the chaos, remain unconvinced that things are as bad as everyone says: The Swiss finance minister, Kaspar Villiger, complained that the problem was in everyone's heads, and that "many speakers tend to overdramatize the situation."
Mr. Clinton had another idea: Change the rules of the I.M.F. so it can provide aid to some fundamentally healthy countries like Brazil before the tornado strikes, in hopes that this will lessen the chances that investors will panic and pull out.
Nonetheless, the scope of Mr. Clinton's ideas left other countries underwhelmed, and wondering whether the President, distracted and weakened, has the power to do what he insists the United States must do: Lead the way out of the crisis. His two speeches to the finance ministers lacked any proposals that involved spending American taxpayers' money, because he was still arguing with Congress over coughing up $18 billion that the United States has already committed to the nearly broke I.M.F.
The dispute between Congress and the I.M.F. has frozen other action. For example, Mr. Rubin is debating whether to use billions of dollars under his control as an American contribution to a pool of money to shore up Brazil. But Congress was outraged when that money was tapped for Mexico in 1995 (it has since been repaid) and the White House is in no mood to anger anyone on the Hill.
But the United States is hardly the only country where domestic politics make it hard to turn the Titanic away from the icebergs. Japan's opposition fears that the Government will use billions of taxpayer dollars to bail out its biggest banks, without firing the managers who created the mess, or assuring that the shareholders lose their investment. And the banks would rather go under slowly than commit ritual suicide. With the world's second-largest economy remaining frozen, the rest of the world is reluctant to lend the banks more money, though there were signs last week that a logjam in the fragmented Parliament might be breaking.
Then there are the Russians, who have told the I.M.F. how little they think of its economic reform plans, while a new Government prints money to pay off pensioners and the military. But Russia is running out of real money, and a senior I.M.F. official notes that Russia is essentially blackmailing the West by saying that without I.M.F. aid, political chaos could reign.
 
The Bankruptcy Vacuum
 But most of the political battles that are compounding the world's economic troubles are far more prosaic -- like rewriting bankruptcy laws. Still, they offer a glimpse of why that new international financial architecture could run into some building delays.
Thailand is a good example. This year borrowers there simply stopped paying their debts. But because Thailand has no effective bankruptcy law, Thai companies can delay efforts to liquidate reorganize them. Essentially, they can hold their lenders at bay for years, while, magically, whatever value is left in their companies gets drained away. Because their money is unrecoverable, Thai banks have stopped lending and the world has stopped lending to Thai banks.
So the I.M.F., as part of its aid package, is requiring Thailand to rewrite its bankruptcy laws on the Western model. But there's a hitch: Many of the legislators are the country's most powerful businessmen. They are resisting, complaining that foreign businesses are snatching up Thailand at fire-sale prices. Which, of course, is exactly what a few savvy American and European companies are trying to do.
It's called capitalism, and it's a lot more fun in up markets than in down markets.

HEADLINE: Coping With Economic Crisis

 BODY:
The world's economic situation is perilous, and there is little doubt that there will be pain and suffering in many countries during the next few years. But the problems need not lead to world recession, let alone depression. With time and wisdom, the problems can be overcome.
The gathering in Washington of the world's financial leaders last week proved to be long on alarming rhetoric and short on action. The dismal forecasts contrasted sharply with what the visiting central bankers and finance ministers could see around them in a prosperous country where it is lies, not layoffs, that dominate the news. But the United States is beginning to feel effects of the Asian collapse, particularly in manufacturing, and has reason to worry as Latin American economies are damaged by high interest rates imposed to slow the exodus of foreign investors. Similarly, Western Europe's export-led growth is threatened. 
 It is easy -- and partly correct -- to blame market excesses for the problem. Investors poured money into emerging markets with little concern for risk, and then fled when the Asian crisis and Russia's default led to large losses.
Only now are we learning the extent that leverage -- that is, borrowed money -- fueled the great bull market of the 1990's. The collapse of John Meriwether's Long-Term Capital hedge fund opened eyes, and there are likely to be more surprises, and failures, as the leverage is unwound. That means financial markets probably will continue to have a bumpy ride, but in some ways this is good news. Much of the leverage came from speculators borrowing Japanese yen and investing the money in other countries. Now those yen are being repaid, pushing up the value of the yen and easing the pressure on Asian currencies.
While there are no magic wands, and the process will be slow, necessary steps to protect the world economy have emerged. Pro-growth policies will be needed in Europe and the United States. Central banks will have to lower interest rates, and major countries may have to cut taxes or raise spending to provide fiscal stimulus. Fiscal reforms are required in Latin America, particularly in Brazil. Countries that had relied on overseas investors to finance large trade and budget deficits must deal with a newly hostile investment climate.
Adequate resources must be provided for the International Monetary Fund. With private capital running scared, the role of public money is all the more important. Some of it will be needed to alleviate suffering in poor countries.
Some countries that have tied their currencies to the dollar will have to let them float. There are advantages to fixed exchange rates, but over time they can create imbalances that lead to big -- and unforeseen -- currency moves that can devastate economies and businesses.
Finally, Japan, which has fallen into a deep recession, must reform its banking system and stimulate its economy. But even if Japan makes the necessary changes, it will take years for its financial system to recover from a mountain of bad loans, and growth may be sluggish. The world will have to get along without a Japanese engine.
At the same time, there are some policy prescriptions that should be avoided. The United States is running a huge trade deficit, as exports to Asia fall. There are cries for protectionism, particularly in steel and agriculture, that must be resisted. The trade deficit is a major reason that the dollar has started to decline, a fall that will help to ameliorate the problem over time.
A weaker dollar can lead to higher reported inflation. If it does, that will not be a good reason for the Federal Reserve to back off from trying to stimulate the economy. It is deflation, not inflation, that threatens the world now, and that will not change until low commodity prices begin to move up in a convincing way.
It is tempting for countries that have been buffeted by international capital flows to adopt capital controls, and they conceivably could help by giving a country breathing room. But they will work only if the countries involved use the respite to pursue good policies. That does not seem to be happening in Malaysia, whose Government appears more interested in repression than reform.
There is nothing new about markets going to excess, with bouts of unreasoned enthusiasm followed by equally illogical fear. World growth in the mid-1990's was pumped up artificially by floods of capital into countries and companies that were ill equipped to handle them. Now world growth is likely to be held back by fearful investors and by stringent credit standards imposed by banks newly concerned about the risk of loss. That is unfortunate, but it is something that can be dealt with if countries pursue growth-oriented strategies.
It is obviously true that market failures were a prime cause of the world's problems, and improved regulatory mechanisms should be sought. But no one should forget the benefits that markets have brought to world growth, and will bring again when investor fear subsides. A return to allowing governments to allocate capital would be no improvement. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, markets are the worst way to allocate capital -- except all those other ways that have been tried from time to time.

G.O.P. Cover Story

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Throughout Thursday's impeachment debate in the House you could hear the uncharacteristically low-keyed voice of the G.O.P.'s chief inquisitor.
"The gentleman from Missouri is recognized for three minutes," Newt Gingrich would say. Or he would rap his Speaker's gavel for quiet and ask, oh so formally and respectfully, "Does the gentleman move the previous question?" 
 Every now and then he would smile hideously, reminding us that hypocrisy is as abundant in Washington as fertilizer on the farm.
It was, frankly, chilling. Newt Gingrich presiding over the possible impeachment of a Democratic President, even one as spectacularly vulnerable as Bill Clinton, is insane.
This is the same Newt Gingrich who several years ago told a group of young Republicans: "I think one of the great problems we have in the Republican Party is that we don't encourage you to be nasty. We encourage you to be neat, obedient and loyal and faithful and all those Boy Scout words, which would be great around the campfire but are lousy in politics."
The Republican Party, refashioned by Mr. Gingrich and his right-wing cronies, no longer has that problem. Since winning control of Congress in 1994, it has consistently pursued a mean-spirited extremist agenda and is now determined to turn the self-inflicted wounds of Bill Clinton into an even larger majority.
Try to imagine the implications of a bigger, more powerful, more aggressive, more right-wing regime of Republicans in Congress.
This is a party that is not content with trying to roll back abortion rights. It is fighting on several fronts against contraception. Just last week the Republican leadership in the House, under pressure from the right, killed a measure that would have required Federal health plans that cover prescription drugs to cover the cost of contraceptives. No one seemed to think it was crazy to have abortion foes opposing a measure that would reduce the need for abortions.
This is a party that tried to eliminate Federal nutrition standards for school meals and fought hard against a meat inspection system designed to protect the public from the deadly E. coli bacteria.
It's a party that attacked Medicare and Medicaid and went out of its way to trash the environment. Clean air? Clean water? Forget about it. Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip and a sharp critic of Mr. Clinton, denounced the Environmental Protection Agency as the "Gestapo of the Government."
You want ethics? Pull the clips on Mr. Gingrich and learn how not to behave. Or check out John Boehner of Ohio, chairman of the House Republican Conference. I wrote a column in 1996 describing how he took money from tobacco lobbyists and handed it out to certain of his colleagues on the floor of the House, while the House was in session.
These are men who couldn't find the high road if they approached it by parachute.
There is no doubt that Bill Clinton brought his problems on himself. He destroyed his own Presidency. But there are consequences to be paid if the Republicans are allowed to feast too ravenously on the political spoils.
Democrats have already lost the opportunity to control the campaign season with discussions of such issues as the rights of patients in the era of managed care, the need to move boldly to rebuild the public school system, the concerns of working Americans in a chaotic economic environment and the outlook for Social Security.
Having been handed the gift of Monica Lewinsky, the Republicans are running with her. She conceals their real agenda. If they can parlay the Monica madness into substantially increased majorities in the House and Senate, they can renew their conservative assault on government and their subversion of the interests of ordinary working Americans and the poor.
Keep in mind that this is a party that crafted extraordinary tax breaks for billionaires while claiming the sky would fall if the minimum wage was raised to $5.25 an hour.
Bill Clinton and the Democrats fended off the most extreme aspects of the so-called Republican revolution of the mid-90's. Now Mr. Clinton has given the right-wingers the opportunity to take care of their unfinished business. Only the voters stand in the way.

A Moneyed Young America, With Great Expectations

BYLINE: By DANIEL M. GOLD 

 BODY:
The robust economy may have everyone feeling a bit flush, but a survey of young Americans suggests that the money culture is building some strongly materialistic desires.
Yankelovich Partners, working for the Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Company, interviewed 1,262 students aged 12 to 21 in households with at least one parent earning $40,000 a year. The survey found that 57 percent expect to be wealthier than their parents, up from 52 percent in a 1996 survey. Moreover, only 18 percent expect that they will have to work harder than their parents to achieve that wealth. On average, college students in the survey expect an annual starting salary of $36,000, up from $32,000 in 1997; 18 percent expect $50,000 or more. 
 As for money and the comforts it can secure, 35 percent agreed that "being able to buy what you want" is a very important objective in adulthood, up from 31 percent in 1996; 15 percent said the same about "having a million dollars," up from 11 percent; and 8 percent said it of "owning an expensive car," up from 5 percent. Not all impulses were focused on the self: 41 percent said that "giving money to charity" is very important, up from 36 percent two years ago. DANIEL M. GOLD

Other Alums May Take the Hint

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
Never one to shirk the limelight, Michael R. Bloomberg has rounded off his gift-giving to Johns Hopkins University at an even $100 million. Mr. Bloomberg, the colorful -- some say egotistical -- founder of Bloomberg L.P., says he will add $45 million to the $55 million he contributed three years ago. That makes him the "largest single donor by double" to the Baltimore school, a spokesman for Johns Hopkins said, adding that Mr. Bloomberg, head of its $1.2 billion fund-raising drive, is "putting his money where his mouth is." 
 Mr. Bloomberg says most of the new money will go to undergraduate financial aid. "Even though the economy is softening and markets go down, we still have to educate kids," said the author of an autobiography entitled "Bloomberg by Bloomberg." Last year, he gave a similarly high-minded reason for his original gift, but couldn't help adding that the donation generated "great publicity for my company and the university." GERALDINE FABRIKANT

Like Bryant Park, Bronx Garden Is a Jewel

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In the early 1980's, when Andrew Heiskell set out to resuscitate the New York Public Library (as chairman of its board), he realized that to save the library he must save Bryant Park (Soapbox, "Struggling to Save Bryant Park," Sept. 13). Mr. Heiskell's plan and the park's ultimate success was based in part on the principles of the urban planning visionary Jane Jacobs, whose "eyes on the street" theory gave credence to the notion that social activity and interaction, not just policing, made public spaces safe and attractive. 
 Nearly a decade before the comeback of Bryant Park -- from derelict "needle park" to urban oasis -- scores of abandoned lots in New York's low-income neighborhoods were being transformed into smaller, but no less significant, sanctuaries. The rebirth of Bryant Park is rightfully celebrated as a key feature of New York City's renaissance. The same entrepreneurial spirit that reclaimed this park is manifest in the more than 700 community gardens located on former vacant lots throughout the five boroughs. The pioneering vision, planning and labor that have turned languishing public properties into vibrant social and cultural centers also deserve credit for the city's improved quality of life.
At the Rincon Criollo casita and community garden in the South Bronx, there are no gazebos or cappuccinos. But on any given day, the members of Rincon Criollo, their friends and anyone who happens by are peforming and teaching bomba and plena music, playing dominoes and tending their communal vegetable garden. But while the city considers Bryant a jewel in its crown, the other is a thorn in its side that the Giuliani administration is taking steps to painfully remove.
Since 1978 most community gardens are recognized through the city's Green Thumb program. In recent months, jurisdiction over all community gardens has been assigned to the Housing Preservation and Development Department. In May, Rincon Criollo's last Green Thumb lease expired. The site is slated for development: there will be no renewal, only a 30-day notice of eviction from H.P.D.
Rincon Criollo and 15 other community gardens are now slated for demolition in the Melrose Commons urban renewal plan. These gardens deserve a serious assessment of their social, cultural, estheic and environmental value to the community. Rincon Criollo deserves preservation.

After a 7-Year Summer, Economic Leaves Turn

 BODY:
The outlook for the United States economy has "weakened measurably," Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, told a group of economists last week. Though current indicators remain fairly healthy, he said, "we are clearly facing a set of forces that should be dampening demand going forward to an unknown extent," including a "scary psychology" in financial markets and fears that gloomy market news will undermine consumer confidence and chill spending. Fed watchers found in Mr. Greenspan's remarks strong hints that further interest-rate cuts were in the offing. 
 Hours after his testimony, J. P. Morgan economists said they expect a recession in 1999, which would end the nation's longest peacetime economic expansion.

World Markets Keep Roiling; World Leaders Keep Squabbling

 BODY:
A five-day conference of finance ministers and central bankers in Washington ended without agreement on any coordinated steps to bolster the world economy, despite a direct appeal for a unified plan from President Clinton. European leaders and the president of the World Bank broke with the United States and the International Monetary Fund over strategies for restoring stability in global financial markets. Latin American governments, envious of what they consider lenient treatment of Russia, called for more generous financial aid for themselves.
The dollar sank sharply against the Japanese yen, not because anyone thought Tokyo's new stimulus package would end the country's recession, but because hedge funds and other investors were unwinding dollar investments and buying yen to repay loans to Japanese banks. 
 The falling dollar took the wind out of the Treasury bond market's sails; yields bobbed back up to levels of two weeks ago. Stocks were exceptionally volatile, with the Dow soaring or plunging wildly at times on several days, only to reverse course and close nearly unchanged.

Presenting President Clinton's New Best Friend

BYLINE: By Gail Collins 

 BODY:
Early in this election season, a consultant for New York City Council Speaker Peter Vallone used a focus group to test Mr. Vallone's potential as a gubernatorial candidate. Kevin McCabe, Mr. Vallone's top aide, reported that the focus group initially felt the Speaker was "a nice guy who'd been around too long." But, Mr. McCabe added triumphantly, once shown extensive information on Mr. Vallone's accomplishments, the group saw the error of its ways and announced that he was an excellent public official who just needed more publicity.
Grasping onto reeds like this, and with the faithful Mr. McCabe at his side, Mr. Vallone jumped into the race. But cynics have always had doubts about that focus group -- mainly because it seemed extraordinary that there were that many average citizens in New York who knew enough about Peter Vallone to feel they were tired of him. 
Now that he is the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, it appears that virtually the only people in the state familiar with Mr. Vallone were the ones in that group. A month before the November election, 49 percent of the respondents in a New York Times/CBS News Poll said they did not know anything about Mr. Vallone. Twenty-eight percent claimed to know enough to have an opinion but did not know exactly what that opinion was. This is no way to win an election, and sure enough, Mr. Vallone is trailing the incumbent, George Pataki, by about 28 points. "We got Pataki where we want him," cried Mr. McCabe, who has a well-honed, if occasionally dark, sense of humor.
All of which gets us to Mr. Vallone's ads, in which he becomes perhaps the first post-Lewinsky candidate in the country to wrap himself around Bill Clinton. "I think it's time someone stood up for President Clinton," the candidate tells the camera, urging the Republicans to let Mr. Clinton alone "for the good in our hearts and for the good of our country." (The last part was written by Mr. Vallone himself, a sweet-natured man who is not exactly a phrasemaker.) But the main message is that Governor Pataki, in concert with Senator Alfonse D'Amato and Republicans in general, is "determined to bring the President down, even if it means hurting the country."
Governors do not actually have a whole lot to do with the impeachment process, and it is unlikely that the President has Mr. Pataki on his enemies list. On a pure issue level, Mr. Vallone might just as well do ads on Japan's banking crisis. But his strategy does make some political sense. For Mr. Vallone, anything that attracts attention is a help. "If people don't want to listen about tax reform and health care, you have to get in the game somehow," says Mr. McCabe.
Most of the nation's Democrats worry that their voters will be too disheartened to vote this November while the Republican core skips happily to the polls. But New York, as usual, is not quite the rest of the country. In the dead-heat race between Senator D'Amato and Representative Charles Schumer, the Times poll suggested that supporters of Mr. Schumer, the Democrat, were the more energized. Mr. Clinton's approval ratings in New York reveal a level of enthusiasm normally associated with military victories rather than sex scandals.
Mr. Vallone's other ads attack Mr. Pataki's reluctance to debate. That is a tried-and-true tactic for challengers, but a rather problematic one for Mr. Vallone, who is not what you would call a verbal wizard. As a public speaker, he is best known for his tendency to stop whatever he is saying to welcome each new person who comes into the room. Mr. Vallone has big issues, like ethics, campaign finance and debt reduction, but he has apparently decided TV viewers would be more interested in Mr. Clinton and the fact that Mr. Pataki declines to come out and fight.
The world of the 28-points-behind gubernatorial candidate can be a pretty depressing one, particularly if that candidate is strapped for money. The options come down to leaving town (as one of Gov. Mario Cuomo's opponents once did) or soldiering onward and hoping that some unanticipated disaster befalls Mr. Pataki in his rose garden. Mr. Vallone, who is an old pro, is sticking to business. "He's like Karl Malden as opposed to Robert Redford, but he's still very confident," said Mr. McCabe.

HEADLINE: Some in Japan Fear Authors of Subway Attack Are Regaining Ground

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
The cult that planted nerve gas in the Tokyo subway three years ago, killing 12 people and injuring thousands more, is back.
Aum Shinrikyo, which was found responsible for the sarin attack and for several murders with VX, the most toxic nerve agent known, is regrouping, recruiting new members at home and abroad and raising vast sums of money, security officials and Japanese and American terrorism experts say. The State Department has designated it a terrorist group, although it has not been linked to any illegal acts since 1995. 
 The resurgence of the sect that masterminded the most serious terrorist attack in Japan's modern history, the officials said, is due partly to Japan's unwillingness to ban it.
The Tokyo district court deprived Aum Shinrikyo of its legal religious status in 1995 and liquidated its assets after declaring it insolvent the following year. But the Japanese Government decided last year that the Justice Ministry had not proved that the group posed an "immediate or obvious threat" to Japanese society. It rejected a request from security officials to outlaw the sect under a 1952 law against subversive activities. The law has never been applied.
As a result, despite security experts' warnings, Aum Shinrikyo, arguing that the Government has effectively sanctioned its existence, has used the decision to rebound.
"There has been no word of repentance or apology," concludes the Public Security Investigation Agency, the main intelligence arm of Japan's Ministry of Justice, in a 70-page report issued in January. Moreover, the document states, Aum Shinrikyo -- the Buddhist mantra "Om" followed by "Supreme Truth" -- has not revised or abandoned "its dangerous doctrine that justifies murder to achieve its ends."
According to the report and interviews with Japanese security officials and independent experts, the group now has about 5,000 followers, including 500 "monks," followers who are "ordained" and live communally. It operates some 28 installations at 18 branches (down from a peak of 24) throughout the country.
 
A Ban in Russia Proves No Deterrent
Despite being banned in Russia, it is still active there, as well as in Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. It maintains encrypted Web sites and chat rooms in Japanese, English and Russian and controls a network of electronic, computer and other stores that generated about $30 million in revenues in 1997. Its publishing company, now its second-largest source of revenue, reopened last April and issues at least one book or pamphlet a month, officials said.
The group is far weaker and poorer than it was at the peak of its influence in 1995, when it owned about 30 pieces of property throughout Japan, as well as a business empire that controlled restaurants, computers and other technology companies. Its net worth was estimated at $20 million to $1 billion. It was also said to have 10,000 followers in Japan and up to 40,000 in other countries, 30,000 of them in Russia.
Still, the group's resurgence deeply troubles security officials, who say they monitor known followers and businesses 24 hours a day and continue searching for three of its leaders.
Signs of the group's resurgence abound. Among them, say the police and other experts, is Trisal, a store that customizes computer systems at discount prices. The tiny office, four stories up a steep, narrow staircase in a small Tokyo office building, is staffed by very young salespeople and jammed with bargain hunters.
Asked whether the cult had a financial stake in the company, a Trisal spokesman said, "Not really." And spokesman for the group declined to comment on whether it has a financial stake in Trisal or in any of the other electronics companies that Japanese authorities identify as directly or indirectly controlled by the sect. But Hiroshi Araki, the spokesman since his predecessor's arrest in 1996, did not deny that Aum Shinrikyo had financial ties to several businesses reportedly owned by, or employing, its followers.
"Naming them and discussing such things would only help the Government harass the companies and people who work for them," Mr. Araki explained in an interview in the group's library, which was filled with books and pamphlets describing the beliefs of the sect's founder and spiritual leader, Shoko Asahara.
The half-blind 43-year-old guru preached his own blend of Hinduisim and Buddhism with an apocalyptic spin. According to his books and preaching, his followers will rise from the ashes of Armageddon. To speed the new order, he planned to help destroy the old one by assembling a corps of young scientists to develop and use chemical, germ and other weapons of mass destruction.
Mr. Asahara remains in jail while being tried on 17 counts of murder, kidnapping, gun and drug trafficking, the subway attack with sarin nerve gas and other assaults with chemical or biological weapons. He has pleaded not guilty.
After the Tokyo attack, the police said that 427 people, some Aum Shinrikyo members and some suspected as such, were arrested, of whom 215 were eventually released without charge. Of those let go, the police said, 155 have returned to the cult. Of those charged, 156 have been convicted. More than 30 members are still on trial.
Despite the convictions, arrests and what the police acknowledge is constant surveillance, the cult has continued to hold regular training sessions, recruiting members and raising money. Last May, more than 500 believers and others curious about the sect gathered at a resort near Mount Fuji to hear religious sermons and receive training in yoga, meditation and other activities.
Security officials and private experts estimate that the group raised about 50 million yen, or about $350,000, from that meeting alone.
While the police say there is no evidence that the cult has resumed its efforts to make or buy weapons of mass destruction, the cult still worries them. Using anthrax, botulinum toxin and a variety of other germ or chemical weapons, the sect repeatedly conducted covert attacks against targets, including a United States military base where thousands of Americans live, throughout the early 1990's.
Although these earlier efforts failed, the sect's secret sarin attack on an apartment complex in Matsumoto almost a year before its Tokyo subway attack resulted in 7 deaths and 600 injuries.
After the police finally raided the sect's compound at the foot of Mount Fuji following the subway sarin attack, they found tons of chemicals for use in weapons, although the cult's stocks of VX, 50 kilograms of sarin and other deadly agents had already been destroyed, said Anthony T. Tu, a Colorado State University chemist who advised the Japanese police on the case.
While many Aum Shinrikyo members are now unwilling to identify themselves as such, security officials say that hundreds of hard-core believers remain despite the 1995 subway attack. Many provide financial assistance to fellow members, officials say, and even to the three senior cult fugitives.
"It's hard to imagine that such fugitives could still be at large here without the active help of believers," one official said.
 
A Chilling Allure For Young Scientists
Security officials expressed particular concern about the group's continued allure for young scientists, engineers and other well-educated people who might be able to reassemble an arms arsenal. Satoshi Izumi, a reporter at the daily Asahi Shimbun, said that almost 200 of some 1,400 Aum monks investigated by security officials were university students or graduates. Most of those who put bags of sarin nerve gas in the subways in 1995 were graduates of the science departments of leading universities.
Several experts have attributed the rise of religious cults -- 185,000 of which are registered with the Government -- as a response to the strains of modern Japanese society. They also caution about the persistence of the underlying conditions that leave young Japanese vulnerable to groups like Aum.
As Taro Maki, the former editor of Sunday Mainichi, put it, "In a country whose fathers are utterly preoccupied with work, whose mothers want their children to be winners and whose educational system prides itself on the fiercest of competition for admission, these new-new religions, as they are called -- or pseudo religions, as I call them -- are attractive to kids who don't quite make the cut, or to those who do but see little purpose to their lives." Mr. Maki waged an early campaign against Aum Shinrikyo.
Even many defectors remain mesmerized by Mr. Asahara. Still calling him their father, they have told Robert Jay Lifton, the American psychiatrist who is writing a book about the group, that the guru retains almost mystical powers.
Mr. Araki, the Aum Shinrikyo spokesman, said he had abandoned art history studies at Kyoto University after attending a lecture by Mr. Asahara. The guru, he recalled, left him with an almost "indescribable sense of peace and inner harmony." Asked how he could defend the guru's orders to kill innocent people with sarin, Mr. Araki, 30, replied that he still could not believe that Mr. Asahara was responsible for the attacks, because the guru "would not give such an unjust command."
Experts disagree about whether the group is still dangerous. Many argue that with Mr. Asahara and other leaders in jail, it poses little immediate threat. Even security officials concede that given their surveillance, it would be unlikely to stage illegal actions now. But they worry about copycat attacks, and about Aum Shinrikyo's potential.
At the moment, they say, the group is led by a secretive steering committee of six senior members who have increasingly focused on two of Mr. Asahara's six children -- his third daughter and his youngest son -- as spiritual symbols.
But by next summer, Fumihiro Joyu, the group's former spokesman, may be out of jail, since he has been charged only with relatively minor crimes like perjury. Because he continues to declare his adoration of Mr. Asahara and has become something of a teen idol -- girls are said to swoon over his photo and snap up Joyu T-shirts and posters -- Government and private experts fear that he could regalvanize the group and reunite its warring factions.
 
Official Ambivalence Aids Sect's Cause
Nevertheless, there is little support within political circles for banning the group, even among some of its most ardent opponents. Mr. Maki, for one, argues that outlawing the group would only drive it underground, making it harder to track and possibly compelling it to ever more desperate acts.
He and others also trace this hesitancy to a reaction against the prewar Government's repression of political, and particularly religious, groups. Noting that Japan's modern legal system was adopted after World War II at the behest of the United States, the Government has been sensitive to any charges of limiting religious freedom.
Moreover, Japan's political left and other small groups fear the precedent: they might be the law's next targets, said Seizaburo Sato, research director of Japan's Institute for International Policy Studies. Religious status in Japan affords considerable political sanctuary. So other religions, some of which support political groups and agendas, oppose any Government constraint.
Professor Sato noted, for instance, that the Soka Gakkai, a Buddhist sect founded here in the 1930's, recently delivered 7.5 million votes in national elections to the party it supported.
"So no political party is going to alienate religious groups and sects by supporting a ban on the Aum," Professor Sato said.
Shoko Egawa, the author of several books on Aum Shinrikyo, argues that short of banning the group, the Government could do more to discourage its activities. "The authorities could use the tax and employment laws more effectively to help curtail their resurgence," she said, "but they do not."
Some analysts even suspect a widespread sympathy for cult members who say they knew nothing about the violence. They embraced the group because of its opposition to the materialism that, while making Japan the world's second-strongest economy, has also left a nostalgia for values believed discarded in the postwar rush to modernize.
But Yoichi Funabashi, the diplomatic correspondent of Asahi Shimbun, rejects this. He said opposition to invoking the law against subversive activities reflected the broader political paralysis that has prevented Japan from taking serious measures to resolve its economic crisis. "Civil society has an obligation to protect itself," he said.

HEADLINE: Fright, Misery and Anger Fuel Serb's Plan

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Oct. 10

 BODY:
To many Serbs in this frightened capital, the threats of air strikes against the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, are producing one result that Washington says that it does not want: strengthening rather than weakening the control of Mr. Milosevic.
In the end, they say, Mr. Milosevic may accede to some of the demands on Kosovo and avert the calamity of NATO bombs. 
 But as the pressures of outside military action have accelerated in the past week, so Mr. Milosevic has introduced new repressive measures to halt foreign broadcasts, close an independent radio station and hound academics at the University of Belgrade.
With the assistance of the far right leader of the Radical Party and deputy premier of Serbia, Vojislav Seselj, Mr. Milosevic has whipped up an atmosphere of victimization that has turned smoldering anger about his miserable economy into anger at the West, and at the United States in particular.
"He is very good at creating a xenophobia inside the country and using that as an instrument to step down on any kind of democratic process," said Milan Protic, a Serbian historian. "So what he has done in the past few weeks is declare an informal state of war and used that to jump on the university and the independent media."
After Mr. Milosevic signed the peace agreement that ended the war in Bosnia three years ago, the situation in the southern Serbian province of Kosovo remained the last unfinished piece of business in Mr. Milosevic's failed vision of a Greater Serbia.
In the late 1980's, Mr. Milosevic used Kosovo as the cause that propelled him to power, whipping Serbs into an emotional frenzy about the need to protect the Serbian province, the touchstone of Serbian culture and home to the finest Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries.
From 1991 to 1995 he rallied Serbs around him in his losing fight for Croatia and Bosnia. In the last six months he has played a similar card with Kosovo. Although Serb fervor has proven harder to stoke now, the hostility to ethnic Albanian dominance of Kosovo remains acute among Serbs.
That dominance makes it increasingly difficult for Mr. Milosevic to justify to the outside world his abrogation of the province's autonomy in 1989 and the imposition of Serbian police control. Serbia and Montenegro are the last republics in Yugoslavia, with Serbia dominant.
In Belgrade in the last few days, as homemakers have stocked up on essential supplies and drivers have tried to find scarce gasoline for their cars, many worry not so much about a NATO bombing itself but about the aftermath.
The public has been warned that an outside attack would result in a declaration of a state of war by the government giving the authorities wide powers of mobilization, arrest without charges, and the introduction of food rationing.
"I'm not afraid of the bombing, I know they won't bomb me," said Brigitte Miladinovic, a receptionist in an office. "I'm scared of what happens afterward -- and all the crazy Serb men who will want to go to Kosovo and fight the Albanians." On Thursday night, Mr. Seselj appeared on a call-in show on Palma Television, a station owned by a government supporter, appealing for volunteers to go to Kosovo in event of air strikes.
In order to squelch dissent, the Serbian Government issued a decree on Friday officially banning the rebroadcast of the Serbian-language reports by Radio Free Europe, the British Broadcasting Corporation and Deutsche Welle. These news services were broadcast by more than 30 independent radio stations in Serbia, including Radio B-92, the most influential of the non-government stations.
Ominously, said the managers of the radio stations, the decree appears to be open-ended in effect.
On Thursday night, Radio Index, run by university students was ordered to vacate the studios it rented in the building of the state-controlled television. Transmission was cut, Radio Index said.
At the University of Belgrade, Mr. Milosevic has continued a campaign started last spring of stripping professors who are not members of his ruling Socialist Party of their posts in the law, electronics and linguistics faculties.
Opposition politicians in Serbia complain that the laser-like attention that Washington has devoted to Mr. Milosevic has reinforced his position, even though his real popularity is far less than it was a few years ago.
In the last few weeks, as diplomats have poured into Belgrade to plead with Mr. Milosevic about Kosovo, few of them have sought out anybody else.
An outspoken priest of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Kosovo, the Rev. Sava Janjic, said in an interview that he believes the approach of Richard C. Holbrooke, who has been engaged in increasingly intense negotiations with Mr. Milosevic as NATO steps up its threat of air strikes, is "encouraging the regime." "For a good settlement you need all representatives on the Serb side, but Milosevic is the only who is asked," he said.
Intellectuals and opposition leaders insist that by concentrating on Mr. Milosevic, Western leaders play into his hands. Virtually the only time Mr. Milosevic appears on television in Serbia is during the visits of foreign dignitaries, when he is filmed sitting in an armchair in front of a bowl of flowers, listening sphinxlike to his important visitors.
"People here watch him and think: 'If the international community supports him, who are we to oppose him,' " said Mr. Protic.
Underneath the xenophobia stirred up by media controlled by Mr. Milosevic, however, there is far less enthusiasm for the cause in Kosovo than there was for the earlier war in Bosnia. "I personally don't know one person who is willing to go and fight in Kosovo but I have a lot of friends who volunteered to go to Croatia and Bosnia," said a university student, who declined to give his name for fear of retribution.
If the bombing did go ahead, some here predict, Mr. Milosevic would emerge triumphant.
"Both ordinary people and intellectuals would turn against the outside world," said Mladjan Dinkic, a young economist who heads Group 17, a confederation of economists. "In that case the country would sink into complete isolation that would perfectly suit Milosevic and his hard-line socialists, Seselj radicals and the part of the Yugoslav left run by his wife, Mira Markovic."
The teetering Yugoslav economy is Mr. Milosevic's most vulnerable point and, say his critics, the threats from NATO distract attention from the general misery.
The gross domestic product of roughly $15 billion is about half what it was in 1989. Nearly half the work force is unemployed and pensioners, who make up a large percentage of the population, are now receiving their monthly checks of about 150 German marks (roughly $100) three months late.
"Milosevic doesn't know what to do with the economy and he needs NATO to explain why everything is bad," said Gordana Igric, a researcher with the Humanitarian Law Center, which compiles reports on atrocities by both sides in the Kosovo conflict.
One of Mr. Milosevic's longtime critics charged that the Yugoslav leader would continue to provoke crises for the sake of staying in power. "The West struck a deal with the regime in Belgrade and the war ended, but the hope for a real democratic reform was put on hold when the regime received credibility and recognition," said Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia, exiled scion of the country's pre-World War II monarchy, in an appeal from his base in London.

HEADLINE: U.S. BID TO BUILD CASPIAN PIPELINE APPEARS TO FAIL

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10

 BODY:
A two-year campaign by the Clinton Administration to persuade major oil companies that they should quickly build a multi-billion-dollar pipeline in the Caucasus, a campaign that has become a centerpiece of American foreign policy, appears to be on the brink of failure.
Companies from the United States and seven other nations are to make a decision this month about how to begin transporting the vast amounts of oil that are believed to lie near the Caspian Sea. For the region's fragile new nations, wedged between Russia and Iran, the decision may be a momentous turning point. 
 The Caspian region has emerged as the world's newest stage for big-power politics. It not only offers oil companies the prospect of great wealth, but provides a stage for high-stakes competition among world powers.
This grand rivalry has begun with an intense competition for control over pipeline routes that will carry Caspian oil to foreign markets. These pipelines will not simply carry oil but will also define new corridors of trade and power. The nation or alliance that controls pipeline routes could hold sway over the region for decades to come.
The Clinton Administration has been exerting every form of persuasion at its disposal to convince the oil companies to choose a route that would run from Baku, the capital of oil-rich Azerbaijan, through Turkey to its Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. But it is evidently losing the battle.
Administration officials, Congressional aides and oil executives said in interviews last week that the companies will probably decide that the American-backed pipeline is too expensive to build now. The companies are expected to announce that they will rely on a much shorter pipeline that is already being built from Azerbaijan to the port of Supsa, on Georgia's Black Sea coast, or an enlarged pipeline along the same route.
From Georgia the oil would be loaded into tankers and shipped across the Black Sea toward Europe -- a move that not only would deny potentially billions of dollars in revenue to Turkey, an American ally, but would mean a sharp increase in tanker traffic through the narrow Bosporus, which Turkey strenuously opposes.
The decision is expected to be announced on Oct. 29, and a senior executive of the oil consortium, Robin Branagan, asserted in a telephone interview from Baku that "at the moment all options are still open."
Officials in Washington, however, expect that the American-backed route will not be chosen. They are already debating how serious a setback it is for the Administration and American security interests.
"It's a disappointment, but I wouldn't call it a defeat," said Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas. "Half a loaf is better than nothing. The oil is going to come out on an east-west axis, rather than south through Iran or north through Russia. And Baku-Ceyhan may still happen down the road."
The oil companies, which include Amoco, Pennzoil and Exxon, are expected to couch their announcement in terms that will be as reassuring as possible to all parties and to include a pledge to build the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline someday. But that is not enough to console some in Washington who have worked hard to secure an immediate commitment.
"I think it is a defeat, to be honest," said a State Department official who concentrates on Caspian issues. "We pushed this project to the top of our agenda, but we weren't able to provide the sweeteners to get it done. We wanted to get something for nothing. It's a setback for our commercial interests and certainly for our prestige. It's another case of talking big but not backing up what we say."
Senator Brownback said one reason the United States was not able to impose its will on the oil companies was that President Clinton has "lost the power of moral persuasion" because of scandals that surround him.
There are more tangible factors at play. Among them are the low price of oil, which made the companies reluctant to embrace a project that could cost $4 billion or more; uncertainty about how much oil the Caspian will produce over the next few years, and hope that United States sanctions against Iran may soon collapse, making a pipeline through Iran possible.
The Administration favored the Baku-Ceyhan route because it would pass through only relatively friendly countries -- Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey -- and would bind them closer to the West; because it would pull Azerbaijan and Georgia out of the Russian shadow; and because it would not pass through either Russia or Iran, both of which have offered routes of their own.
Unfortunately for the Administration, however, the Baku-Ceyhan route is also the longest and most expensive to build of all proposed routes.
Last year the oil companies discreetly asked the Clinton Administration if it would be willing to pay part of the cost of building its favored Baku-Ceyhan pipeline. They were told that any such payment would be viewed as a Government handout to the oil industry, and therefore politically impossible.
Unable to subsidize the Baku-Ceyhan line themselves, American officials urged Turkey, through which most of the line would run, to offer the companies a generous package of incentives and tax breaks. They said this week that Turkey never produced such a package, and complained that the instability of Turkey's Government has made it a difficult partner.
"Oil companies sometimes don't even know who they should be negotiating with over there," asserted one oil consultant. "We kept telling the Turks that they had to come to the table with something to offer, but it didn't work. Now of course they're going to be very upset, but in part they brought this on themselves."
Administration officials are working to assure that the text of the companies' announcement is as positive to United States interests as possible. Several said that given economic realities, they could understand a decision by the companies to build a pipeline only as far as Georgia.
"It would reflect the difficulty of getting a consensus on all the cost issues at a time of low oil prices and of anxiety about large capital investments," said Ambassador-at-Large Stephen Sestanovich, who has helped shape United States policy toward Caspian countries. "Given all this, the companies naturally want to be cautious."
"We're committed to making Baku-Ceyhan happen," Mr. Sestanovich said. "A couple of years ago people didn't take the idea of an east-west corridor seriously at all. Now everyone can see it's just a matter of time."
An oil company executive involved in making the pipeline decision said that by building a pipeline to Georgia, the companies would be responding to American concerns.
"They have received what they want, which is an east-west route, but in a phased approach," the executive said. "Most things in life come in stages. If you're going to build a huge new house, do you build it all now or start small and expand it as you need it? That's how we're thinking."
A pipeline from Baku to Georgia's Black Sea coast is already under construction, but it will not have enough capacity to handle the heavy volumes of oil that are expected to be shipped from the Caspian in coming years. The fact that a right of way already exists, however, would make construction of a larger-capacity pipeline relatively easy.
It is still unclear what the companies will do with their oil once it arrives at the Black Sea. The Bosporus is the only maritime route out of the Black Sea. It runs through the center of Istanbul and is already overcrowded. Turkish officials say it cannot sustain a sharp increase in tanker traffic.
Foreign Minister Ismail Cem of Turkey, in a telephone interview, declined to comment on the oil companies' deliberations until they officially announce their conclusion. But he said competition for pipeline routes would shape events in the Caspian region for decades to come.
"It creates a new complex of economic and strategic issues that will shape the next century," Mr. Cem said. "Certain countries in the region will become big players in world affairs, and countries outside the region are anxious to press their own interests. The rivalry, the competition for influence, has already begun."

With the threat of NATO military strikes looming over Serbia, the President of Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosevic, finds his control increasing, to the disappointment of Washington. As the pressures of outside military action have accelerated in the past week, Mr. Milosevic has whipped up an atmosphere of victimization that has turned smoldering anger about his miserable economy into anger at the West, and the United States in particular. 8

Clinton Inquiry Raises Ire In One Bellwether State
There is no question that voters are upset here in Washington, a state that has been an electoral bellwether in recent years. It broadly backed Bill Clinton and Congressional Democrats in 1992, turned to Republicans with spectacular vengeance in 1994, then returned to Mr. Clinton in 1996. Now, voters are distressed over events in the nation's capital, where the House voted to begin an inquiry that could lead to the President's impeachment. Many voters are not sure where to direct their anger -- and it is not clear how that will affect coming elections. 1
 
Escape to Campaign Trail
Congress is now savoring the sheer comfort of asexual political skirmishing as lawmakers struggled with lost legislative causes and artificial doomsday deadlines in their attempt to quit and head for home to face the voters. 1
 
Spending Bill Races the Clock
President Clinton challenged Congress to provide money in the budget being hammered out on Capitol Hill for billions of dollars' worth of new education programs. The President signed a second stopgap spending bill on Friday night in order to keep the Government running through midnight Monday. 26
 
Complaints About Insurers
State health insurance regulators are reporting surging numbers of formal complaints from patients and doctors against health insurers, primarily health maintenance organizations. The regulators tie much of the increase to greater public readiness to fight H.M.O.'s and to the insurance commissioners' efforts to encourage people to file the complaints. 22

In 1940, the Battle of Britain was in its third month, and a group of English children were sent away to a pastoral 2,000-acre retreat in Tuxedo Park, N.Y. They came to live in the baronial stucco house that had been named Children's House and donated for their use. Park residents contributed money for their food, clothing and medical care and to pay for the housekeepers and cooks who served them. This weekend, 58 years later, seven returned, for their first, and probably only, alumni reunion. 37

HEADLINE: Clinton Urges More Money For Educational Programs

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10

 BODY:
In a campaign-style effort to regain their political footing after this week's impeachment vote, President Clinton and Congressional Democrats challenged Republicans today to enact broad education initiatives in the new budget.
"I do not want to see this Congress walk away from America's schoolchildren," the President said in his weekly radio address, delivered as Republicans and White House officials remained far apart on numerous spending matters that must be resolved before members of Congress can leave town and fully engage in their re-election campaigns. 
 One major issue that did appear headed toward a compromise was financing for the International Monetary Fund. Republicans said they were willing to provide the $18 billion requested by the President to shore up the fund's reserves, but only if the Administration agreed to impose certain conditions on the fund. Both sides said tonight that they were close to an agreement.
But occupying the front burner was education. Republicans indicated tonight that they would cede to the President's request for $1.1 billion next year to hire 100,000 teachers, on condition that the Administration identify cuts of an equal amount elsewhere in the budget.
Erskine B. Bowles, the President's chief of staff and top negotiator on Capitol Hill, said after a meeting tonight with Speaker Newt Gingrich: "I think we have made some progress. I think they clearly have heard what we were saying on education and I'm optimistic in that regard."
Mr. Gingrich agreed. "I don't currently see anything which is impossible to bridge," he said, adding that he hoped negotiations could be concluded by Monday.
Such pushing and pulling marked the 10th day without a Federal budget beyond the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year. The President signed a second stopgap spending bill on Friday to keep the Government running through midnight Monday. Congress has cleared only 6 of the 13 spending bills needed to keep the Government open and is negotiating with the White House over what to include in one omnibus package to present to the President. There was little chance of action before Monday, because the Senate and the House have postponed all recorded votes until Monday afternoon and many members have left town for the weekend.
Both Republicans and Democrats have insisted they do not want to shut down the Government and, with the Nov. 3 elections looming, are eager to set their broad campaign themes.
Republicans wanted to leave town with the focus on the enduring image of a wounded President subjected to an impeachment inquiry. Democrats demonstrated today that they wanted more time to change the subject to education, an issue that voters have said is of prime importance.
The President's two major education proposals call for hiring 100,000 teachers for hard-to-recruit schools in inner cities and rural areas, to reduce the size of the average class to 18 students, and for upgrading old schools and making them Internet-compatible by 2000.
Republicans have criticized the programs as pork-barrel spending that offers a big-Government solution to problems that should be solved locally.
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, said that the Democrats' emphasis on education was "pure politics, pure demagoguery." He said that the White House had not identified where to find the $4 billion for its education package because that would cut into other programs sought by liberals.
The White House said late Saturday that Mr. Clinton had scheduled a Sunday afternoon meeting with his budget team and top House and Senate Democrats to review the negotiations. The President will also be available much of Monday for budget talks, delaying a fund-raising trip until late afternoon. He plans to travel to New York on Monday to raise money for Representative Charles E. Schumer, the Democratic Senate candidate, and Peter F. Vallone, Speaker of the New York City Council, who is running for Governor. On Tuesday, Mr. Clinton plans to visit Florida for more fund-raising and to join senior citizens and declare that he is protecting the budget surplus to shore up Social Security.
Republicans demonstrated that they were just as "on message" as the Democrats, returning throughout the day to the President's woes. "Clinton has held just two Cabinet meetings this year," Representative Joe Scarborough of Florida said on the House floor. "The first one to lie to his Cabinet, and the second one to apologize to his Cabinet."
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, spoke at a news conference packed with Democrats left idle as the chairmen of various spending committees met with Administration officials to work out dozens of matters, ranging from emergency aid for farmers to polarizing questions of contraception -- for minors, for Federal employees and for overseas family planning organizations.
"Having spent four weeks talking about impeachment, surely we can spend four hours on the President's education initiatives," Mr. Gephardt said in criticizing House Republicans for spending "not one minute, not one second" debating the President's education proposals.
One of the biggest items on the table -- how much to give to the I.M.F. -- appeared close to resolution. Republicans said they would provide the full $18 billion under conditions that curbed what they called the fund's profligate lending practices. They want the fund to stop lending money at below-market rates and to operate more openly.
"We've come a long way," said Representative Sonny Callahan, the Alabama Republican who is chairman of the foreign operations subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. "We're in a position to reach some type of agreement."
The Administration also sounded optimistic. "I think it's too early to tell, but I think there are more hopeful signs than there have been in quite some time," said Gene Sperling, Mr. Clinton's national economic adviser.
The surplus is a major flash point with Congress. Republicans argue that Mr. Clinton is raiding the surplus to pay for his education and child-care programs. He had expected to pay for them with money from a settlement with the tobacco companies, which never materialized.
They also say he wants to take billions from the surplus to pay for "emergencies" that are not true emergencies, like the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and fixing the year 2000 computer bug, both of which were foreseen and could recur. Republicans agree that some of the emergency money the President seeks -- to improve security at United States embassies and to help Americans who were hit by natural disasters -- are legitimate.
After the House voted on Thursday to open an impeachment inquiry into President Clinton's relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, Mr. Clinton was eager to show that he was tending to the people's business. At a news conference with Democrats in Congress, he presented himself as the guardian of education and a safety net against Republican extremists.
His education agenda includes money to make sure all children can read by second or third grade and help colleges provide mentors to students to guide them toward college.
The Administration is also concerned about some education issues that have little to do with money. These include a Republican ban on the President's proposal for national testing of fourth-grade students in reading and eighth-grade students in math and a Republican plan to dissolve bilingual education.
In other business, the House passed without dissent a bill that would require the Government to deal with countries that persecute citizens for religious beliefs by using measures ranging from the mildest private rebuke to tough economic sanctions. The bill passed the Senate unanimously on Friday.

HEADLINE: Experts Discuss How Arts Can Aid Network

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Oct. 10

 BODY:
The arts saved Cleveland and Pittsburgh and they can save Newark, too, participants in a conference at Rutgers University were told today.
The conference, titled "Arts Transforming the Urban Environment," brought together experts from around the world to discuss ways that cities can discover an identity, take pride in their cultural attractions and find the money to rebuild and revitalize themselves. 
 Such thoughts have been on many minds in Newark in the year since the $180 million New Jersey Performing Arts Center opened with the goal of reviving a city in a protracted physical, social and economic decline. Because of "Newark's large civic gamble on the arts," as Annette Juliano, a professor of art history at Rutgers, put it, the conference was organized to explore and learn from other communities' efforts. The four-day conference is sponsored by Rutgers and ends Sunday.
Civic leaders from Cleveland and Pittsburgh described how arts-related construction and arts districts had revitalized their cities, and officials from Charleston, S.C., said the preservation of that city's distinctive cultural heritage had sustained it. But beyond the talk of bricks and mortar, there were insights into the arts' less tangible benefits.
South African artists described using art and culture to create a "nonthreatening zone" in which blacks and whites could come together in a still tense post-apartheid Johannesburg. Adolfo Nodal, Los Angeles' general manager of cultural affairs, said the introduction of a chamber music group into a crime-ridden park had made it safer.
In many ways, this role for art and artists is an old one, said Trevor Phillips, chairman of the London Arts Board. He read passages from Dickens' novels about the squalor of 19th-century London and noted that the public outcry the novels had provoked had led to reforms.
"It may have been romantic to see the artist as a marginal figure in society," Mr. Phillips said, "but they are at the center of things. When we talk about culture, we are talking about all of the artistic endeavor a people can muster to say where they have been, what they are and where they are going."
In one workshop, Lawrence Goldman, president of the Performing Arts Center, said that in the past, growth of the arts and culture followed economic development. But in the last 15 years, he said, the order has been reversed in many cities. As generators of revenue, centers like Newark's rank below sports stadiums in the eyes of public officials, but that will change, he predicted.
Compared with stadiums, cultural centers are "the bargain of the century," said Art Falco, president of Cleveland's Playhouse Square Foundation, which spent $55 million a decade ago to renovate four historic but run-down theaters into a downtown arts district. Mr. Falco said studies had shown that the city's arts sector in 1994 generated $165 million in revenues for the city, compared with $79 million from its sports teams.
The Pittsburgh Trust for Cultural Resources transformed that city's red-light district with performance and gallery spaces, said Carol Brown, president of the trust. According to a recent survey, the new arts district, nestled on the banks of the Allegheny River, draws up to 35 percent more visitors annually than the city's sports arenas do, she said.
What this investment in the arts says about a society and its people remains a crucial question, said Stanley Katz, director of the Center for Arts and Cultural Policy at Princeton University. Mr. Katz said he wondered whether large halls like Newark's were an efficient way of accomplishing social goals like instilling an appreciation for the arts in children, and whether efforts to promote cultural tourism were good ways to invest public and private funds in the long run.
"The big question in the end," said Mr. Katz, "is not so much whether there is economic development, but whether there is civic development and a move to a more civil society. What is the real relationship between the jobs created and the building of a civil society?"

HEADLINE: Clark Clifford, a Major Adviser To Four Presidents, Is Dead at 91

BYLINE: By MARILYN BERGER 

 BODY:
Clark M. Clifford, the silver-haired Brahmin of the nation's political establishment who advised Presidents across half a century of American history, died yesterday morning at the age of 91 at his home in Bethesda, Md.
A Secretary of Defense for one President, friend and confidant of three others, Mr. Clifford frequently played the role of capital Wise Man in inner sanctum crises, helping President Harry S. Truman keep peace with labor and warning President Lyndon B. Johnson about the folly of the Vietnam War. 
 With a gentle drawl and an insider's run of the halls of power, Mr. Clifford was consulted as well by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Jimmy Carter, bridging the nation's postwar political era until he ran afoul of legal troubles in high-finance brokering.
For all the roles he played in Presidential history, Mr. Clifford faced a rigorous ordeal in his final years, insisting on his innocence to the end as he faced charges of fraud, conspiracy and taking bribes in the biggest banking scandal in history, the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
It was only earlier this year that Mr. Clifford and his law partner, Robert A. Altman, reached a $5 million settlement with the Federal Reserve. Just last month, they settled the last of several civil lawsuits brought in the case.
Mr. Altman was acquitted in 1993 in New York state court of charges of bank fraud; indictments against Mr. Clifford had been set aside because of his failing health.
Mr. Clifford considered his role in extricating the United States from what he called that "wretched conflict in Vietnam" to be his finest moment; the day he was indicted and fingerprinted like a common criminal, he said, was the worst.
Few people in Washington, let alone Clark Clifford himself, could have imagined so inglorious an end to so glorious a career. From the time in World War II when he went to Washington as a naval aide to Truman, Mr. Clifford was a highly respected lawyer and public servant about whom scarcely an unkind word was ever uttered.
He was a symbol of elegance -- 6 feet 2 inches tall, trim, wavy-haired, his French cuffs always a precise half-inch longer than the sleeves of his impeccably tailored double-breasted suits.
There were a few who saw in him a little too much smoothness, a touch of the riverboat gambler, perhaps. But to most people who knew Mr. Clifford, he was a symbol of probity, even a legend in his own time. Except for Spiro Agnew and a lone article in Ramparts magazine, nobody had a bad word to say about him in public, at least not until the B.C.C.I. scandal.
Whether in the White House or in his law offices across the street from the White House, Mr. Clifford was the man politicians and business leaders turned to for advice. Johnson, beleaguered by the Vietnam War, asked him to be his Secretary of Defense, and President Carter called on him to be a White House adviser. Kennedy asked him for legal help and put him at the head of his transition team, and Truman appointed him special counsel.
Few people in Government were as familiar with as many of the nation's problems as Clark Clifford. He helped articulate the policies for the reconstruction of Europe after World War II. He wrote the basic legislation establishing the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Department. On the domestic front, he wrote some of Truman's most important speeches and helped keep labor peace in the postwar period.
With a thriving private law practice, Mr. Clifford liked to think of himself as a bridge between business and government. But he was more than that. Like many lawyers who made up the Washington establishment, he advised corporations on how to navigate their way through laws and regulations.
For each new client he had the same well-rehearsed speech that he offered to one of his first clients, Howard R. Hughes. As Mr. Clifford recounted it in his memoir, "Counsel to the President" (Random House, 1991), he said his firm had no influence and would not represent anyone before the President or any of his staff.
"If you want influence you should consider going elsewhere," he would tell prospective clients. "What we can offer you is an extensive knowledge of how to deal with the Government on your problems. We will be able to give you advice on how best to present your position to the appropriate departments and agencies of the Government."
He gave the same speech to the Arab investors who came to see him in 1978, the same investors who, it turned out, were front men for the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. The bank, which was chartered in Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands and had offices in 70 countries, was shut down in July 1991 in a worldwide swoop by banking regulators.
B.C.C.I. was accused of fraud, laundering drug money and bribing bank regulators and central bankers in 10 developing countries.
 
The Importance Of Credibility
In an interview in the mid-1980's, Mr. Clifford said his concept of the practice of law "is that through the years you conduct yourself in such a manner that the staffs of the Government agencies have confidence in your integrity and your credibility." He added, "I've never contended that I have influence, felt I had influence or attempted to use influence."
It was precisely his reputation for integrity and credibility that led the group of Arab investors to seek Mr. Clifford's help in the late 1970's when they wanted to acquire an American bank. The Federal Reserve Board approved the takeover in 1981, reassured by Mr. Clifford that there would be no control by B.C.C.I., which he also represented. The fact that Mr. Clifford himself was to become chairman of the bank further reassured the regulators. The bank, with Mr. Clifford as its chairman, was called First American Bankshares and became the largest in Washington.
Ten years later, Robert M. Morgenthau, the District Attorney in Manhattan, disclosed that his office had found evidence that the parent company of Mr. Clifford's bank was secretly controlled by B.C.C.I. The District Attorney convened a grand jury to determine whether Mr. Clifford and his partner, Mr. Altman, had deliberately misled Federal regulators by assuring them that B.C.C.I. would have no control.
Mr. Clifford's predicament worsened when it was disclosed that he had made about $6 million in profits from bank stock that he bought with an unsecured loan from B.C.C.I. A New York grand jury handed up indictments, as did the Justice Department. Mr. Clifford's assets in New York, where he kept most of his investments, were frozen.
Mr. Clifford said the investigation caused him pain. If the regulators had been deceived about any secret ownership by B.C.C.I., he said, he, too, had been deceived.
But if he was deceived, it would have been an aberration. While Washington lawyers like Mr. Clifford say they do not "sell" influence, what they do offer is sophistication, experience and knowledge of the mechanics of government. That is why it was so difficult for people to believe that Mr. Clifford, who was so experienced at seeing around corners and anticipating problems for his clients, could have been duped by front men for B.C.C.I.
"It's easy to say I should have known, but a client tells his lawyer what the client wants the lawyer to know," Mr. Clifford said. "I have to admit that they came to me because of my standing and reputation. If you think of that, then you'd understand better that I'd be the last person they'd divulge this stuff to. I gave them standing. Why would they jeopardize that? They knew if they told me I'd be out the door."
 
A 'Wretched' War: Pride and Regrets
Although he spent a total of only six years in Government service, those were the years that he liked to dwell upon. Looking back one day in the mid-1980's as he was preparing to publish his memoirs, he said in his customary measured tones, "I believe the contribution I made to reversing our policy in that wretched conflict in Vietnam is very likely the most gratifying experience I have had."
There was no sense of self-congratulation. "I was part of the generation that I hold responsible for our country's getting into that war," he said. "I should have reached the conclusion earlier that our participation in that war was a dead end."
Mr. Clifford added: "I've been quite severe with myself that I didn't make a greater issue of it with President Johnson. I permitted myself to be lulled into a false sense of optimism over reports that came back from Vietnam."
But in the nine months that he headed the Defense Department, succeeding Robert S. McNamara in 1968, Mr. Clifford used everything he had ever learned about the levers of power, all his skill as an advocate and all his political capital to persuade the President not to further escalate the role of American ground troops in South Vietnam. United States military involvement in Southeast Asia, Mr. Clifford argued, was sapping the nation's strength as a world power.
In his later years, no longer in Government service, he sought to end the arms race as he once tried to end America's participation in the Vietnam War. When he began in Government, the world had two atomic bombs. Within four decades the world had 24,000 nuclear bombs, and that awesome fact continued to preoccupy him long after he left public office.
In the Truman years, Mr. Clifford wrote that military power was the only language the Soviet Union understood. He was nevertheless a consistent advocate of finding a way to coexist with the Russians, and urged the adoption of arms agreements and a nuclear freeze. He often said he was haunted by a remark Winston Churchill had made about the superpowers and the arms race: "All they're going to do is make the rubble bounce."
 
Old World Grace, Midwest Openness
Trim and disciplined -- he kept his weight at 180 pounds and allowed himself dessert only when he fell below that, and he smoked one cigarette a day, proving to doubters that he could do it -- Mr. Clifford was the personification of Old World grace combined with a kind of Midwestern openness.
To close the door on entering Mr. Clifford's office meant to close out the hurried pace of the 20th century and to return to the more measured rhythm of the 19th. In the cauldron of the Vietnam-era Pentagon or in the paneled luxury of his Connecticut Avenue office, there was always time for the niceties of conversation. He would inquire after one's spouse, and ask whether the children were writing from college.
The quintessential insider, Mr. Clifford had access to the corridors of power and to the private clubs that were the marks of success. He tried to play golf at Burning Tree Country Club in Maryland every weekend, but he liked to take his lunch at the People's Drugstore around the corner from his office. He said he could have a sandwich and a glass of skim milk in 22 minutes at the lunch counter there, while his occasional visits to the Metropolitan Club meant an hour and 22 minutes.
His office kept a car and chauffeur at his disposal but, until his health declined, he liked to drive himself to work from his 150-year-old house on Rockville Pike in Bethesda.
No one can recall a time when Mr. Clifford raised his voice. What Washington veterans do remember was his ability, even into his 80's, to speak, seemingly extemporaneously and without notes, for 40 minutes. In fact, Mr. Clifford prepared every statement carefully and then memorized it. "The mind is a muscle," he said. "The more I use it the better it gets."
Mr. Clifford had a way of taking his listeners step by step through an argument, pausing now and then to ask rhetorically, "Do you see?" as he ushered them along with him with carefully reasoned logic.
"Clark was so smooth that when you lost with him, you thought you'd won," said Phil G. Goulding, an Assistant Secretary of Defense under Mr. Clifford.
 
His Father's Words: 'To Live Is to Work'
Clark McAdams Clifford was born in Fort Scott, Kan., on Dec. 25, 1906. He was named for his mother's brother, Clark McAdams, a crusading editor of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. His mother, Georgia McAdams Clifford, was, as her son remembered her, a great storyteller, very dramatic and "beautiful beyond belief." His father was an official of the Missouri Pacific Railroad, a man who, Mr. Clifford said, "instilled in me the precept that to live is to work."
"He developed in me habits of industry -- too much, my wife thinks sometimes," Mr. Clifford said.
He was given chores to do when he was a boy, and as he got older the tasks increased. When the family moved to St. Louis he was a delivery boy for a grocery store and, in the summertime, was a night delivery boy for a drugstore. He also remembered earning $30 a month for singing in a choir.
"I had an extremely happy childhood; it was ideal," Mr. Clifford said. "I thought everybody loved his mother and father and would go to the wall for his sister. Boy, was I naive!"
Mr. Clifford attended college and law school at Washington University in St. Louis. On graduating in 1928 he entered law practice there. In the summer of 1929, while traveling in Europe, he met a Boston woman, Margery Pepperell Kimball. They were married on Oct. 3, 1931. In addition to his wife, he is survived by their three daughters, Faith Christian of Chico, Calif., Dr. Joyce Burland of Halifax, Vt., and Randall C. Wight of Baltimore; 12 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren.
 
From Naval Aide To Truman Adviser
Although Mr. Clifford was over the draft age and already a father when the United States entered World War II, he volunteered for the Navy in 1943 and was accepted as a lieutenant junior grade. After an assignment to assess the state of readiness at naval bases on the West Coast, he was drawn into the White House in 1944, where he began a career, as the columnist James Reston once put it, of rescuing American Presidents from disaster.
In July 1945, when Truman attended the Potsdam Conference near Berlin, Mr. Clifford found he did not have enough to do. "You're kind of a potted plant when you're a naval aide," he recalled. "So I offered to be helpful to Judge Samuel I. Rosenman, the special counsel, who had more work than he could handle." When the President returned, Mr. Rosenman said, "Let's keep that young fellow here."
As a speechwriter, and later as special counsel to Truman, Mr. Clifford helped articulate the Truman Doctrine, a program proposed in 1947 to help Greece and Turkey resist potential Communist expansionism, and related innovative programs for assisting underdeveloped countries.
Mr. Clifford also participated in the creation of the Marshall Plan for the rehabilitation of Western Europe and in the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
It fell to Mr. Clifford to be Secretary of State George C. Marshall's adversary on the issue of recognition of Israel. "President Truman said he would like me to prepare the case for the formation of a Jewish homeland as if it were a case to be presented to the Supreme Court," Mr. Clifford said.
Marshall, who opposed recognition, became almost apoplectic at a White House meeting when Mr. Clifford made his points -- points that he could still reel off in detail 40 years later. When Truman decided in favor of immediate recognition of Israel, Mr. Clifford said, there were some tense days until Marshall relented.
Mr. Clifford insisted that Truman acted out of conviction and humanitarian considerations, and not for domestic political advantage, as Marshall had suggested.
In his years in the Truman White House, Mr. Clifford was a poker-playing regular of the kitchen cabinet; he even played a hand or two with Churchill.
Mr. Clifford was an important architect of the President's "give 'em hell Harry" whistle-stop campaign in 1948, when Truman won an upset victory over the Republican nominee, Thomas E. Dewey.
Mr. Clifford was also one of the principal architects of the National Security Act of 1947, which unified the armed services and established the Central Intelligence Agency. Amendments that he framed two years later greatly strengthened the authority of the Secretary of Defense.
In his memoirs, he expressed regret that he had not made a greater effort to kill the loyalty program instituted to root out Communist subversives. But he has been criticized for contributing to the climate of fear -- the proposition that "the United States must be prepared to wage atomic and biological warfare if necessary."
Mr. Clifford left the White House in 1950 to open a law firm in Washington, hoping to repair his personal finances, which had been tattered by his years in the Government, most of them at an annual salary of $12,000.
When Truman discussed with him the possibility of a seat on the Supreme Court, Mr. Clifford told him he would not be happy there. In 1949 he turned down an offer from a group of prominent Missouri Democrats to run for the Senate.
"I'd been in the Navy and the White House for almost seven years," he said, looking back at that period. "I had three growing daughters reaching the age when daughters become expensive, and going through this economic ordeal again that I'd been through was an obstructing factor I could not overcome at that time."
After leaving the Government, Mr. Clifford overcame his economic problems so quickly that within four months he was able to move his family from a rented house in Chevy Chase, Md., to the historic house on three acres outside Bethesda that was his home for the rest of his life.
Clients lined up outside his door. One of the first was Mr. Hughes, who asked Mr. Clifford to be the Washington counsel for Trans World Airlines. There followed a clientele that represented blue-chip America and included General Electric, A.T. & T., I.T.T, the RCA Corporation, ABC, Du Pont, Hughes Tool, Time Inc., Standard Oil, Phillips Petroleum and El Paso Natural Gas.
In time, the man whose early ambition was to be the finest trial lawyer in St. Louis became the first Washington lawyer to make a million dollars a year, a Washington superlawyer -- highly paid, it was thought, because he could fix things for his clients. Mr. Clifford said he always found that concept deeply disturbing.
But the legend of his influence had grown so that a favorite story around Washington was that whenever Mr. Clifford had occasion to go to a Government office on behalf of a client, the meeting would be interrupted by the announcement that the President was calling Mr. Clifford.
"That happened exactly once," he protested. The President, he said, was Kennedy, and there was a genuine emergency at the White House.
In the Eisenhower years Mr. Clifford was not called by the White House, but he remained active in Democratic politics. He was also the personal lawyer for Kennedy, then a young Senator from Massachusetts.
In 1960, when Kennedy won the Democratic nomination for President over Stuart Symington, whom Mr. Clifford had supported, Kennedy asked Mr. Clifford to prepare an analysis of the problems Kennedy would face in taking over the executive branch. Mr. Clifford wrote a detailed assessment and, after the election, was named to head the transition team.
At a dinner shortly after his election, Kennedy paid tribute to Mr. Clifford for all the work he had done and for asking nothing in return. "All he asked was that we advertise his law firm on the back of one-dollar bills," the President-elect quipped.
After the abortive invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs in April 1961, an operation supported by the C.I.A., Kennedy again turned to Mr. Clifford, who in 1947 had written the legislation establishing the agency. The President asked him to become a member, and then chairman, of the newly created Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.
Kennedy also turned to Mr. Clifford a year later, when the nation's major steel companies refused to honor an agreement that the President thought he had with them not to increase prices. The companies backed down several days later, after Mr. Clifford convinced them that it would be in their best interest to rescind the increases.
President Johnson was hardly in office 24 hours when he called for Mr. Clifford. Faced with the sudden and enormous task of running the country after Kennedy's assassination, Johnson talked with Mr. Clifford for two hours, then three, then four. It was late in the evening, Mr. Clifford remembered, when Lady Bird Johnson entered the Oval Office and reminded her husband, "Just because you're President now doesn't mean you don't have to eat dinner."
Mr. Clifford's warm relationship with Johnson became strained and almost broke over Vietnam in 1967, when Johnson asked him to be Secretary of Defense. Mr. Clifford's first assignment was to determine how to meet Gen. William C. Westmoreland's request for 206,000 more American troops in Vietnam. The special panel Mr. Clifford set up to study the issue soon became a forum for debating the rationale for the war.
Because he then had the complete confidence of the President, whom he had known for more than 20 years, and because he had the luxury of not being bound to previous official positions on Vietnam, Mr. Clifford was able to ask the difficult questions. He did not like the answers. No one could say whether the 206,000 troops would be enough. No one could say whether the war would take another six months, a year, two years or more.
Mr. Clifford finally came to the conclusion that there was no plan for military victory in Vietnam and that the United States was in what he called "a kind of bottomless pit." He said he realized that "we could be there year after year, sacrificing tens of thousands of American boys a year, and it just didn't add up."
When Mr. Clifford began to oppose Johnson on the war, a rift opened. Mr. Clifford remembered a "sense of personal hurt that I was doing this to him." To help heal the breach, Mr. Clifford asked Johnson to have lunch at his home on his final day in Washington, the day Richard M. Nixon was inaugurated as President. Johnson accepted and, as one of his last official acts, awarded Mr. Clifford the Medal of Freedom with Distinction, the highest award given to civilians in the United States.
Having persuaded Johnson to cut back the bombing and negotiate an end to the war, Mr. Clifford spent the next years trying to urge President Nixon to end the war. His efforts led Vice President Agnew to accuse him of being "a late-blooming opportunist who clambered aboard the rolling bandwagon of the doves when the flak really started to fly."
Except for Mr. Agnew's comments and a broadside from Ramparts magazine at the other side of the political spectrum, Mr. Clifford's more than 40 years in Washington passed with a relative absence of criticism, until the bank scandal broke. At the time, no one paid much attention when Ramparts called Mr. Clifford a "curious hybrid of Rasputin, Perry Como and Mr. Fix," in an article that depicted him as an architect of United States economic imperialism and linked that role to his legal work representing major multinational corporations.
Only once in his long career did he step out of character, and that was when he referred to President Ronald Reagan as an "amiable dunce." The remark was made at a private dinner party but, unknown to Mr. Clifford, a tape recording had been made so that the hostess, who was ill with the flu and unable to come to her own party, could hear what was expected to be some sparkling conversation. Excerpts from that tape were published out of context.
Mr. Clifford explained his remark this way: "In the fall of 1982, President Reagan said he would cut taxes by $750 billion, substantially increase defense expenditures and balance the budget in the 1984 fiscal year. Those were public promises. I made a comment that if he would accomplish that feat, he'd be a national hero. If, on the other hand, it did not work out after such a specific and encouraging promise and commitment, I thought the American people would regard him as an amiable dunce."
Given the opportunity some time later to retract his remark, however, Mr. Clifford declined to do so.
In time, even President Carter, who kept his distance from the Washington establishment, turned to Mr. Clifford for advice when Mr. Carter's budget director, Bert Lance, came under attack for his banking practices in Georgia. A former Kennedy aide later remarked, "They ran against Washington, but when the water comes up to their knees they call for Clark Clifford."
 
A New Challenge In His Later Years
It was Mr. Lance who introduced Mr. Clifford to the Arab investors who sought to take over the bank in Washington that was to become known as First American Bank. Mr. Clifford and his young partner, Mr. Altman, structured the deal that led to the takeover of the bank and, according to prosecutors, the success of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International in the United States. Mr. Clifford said to the end that he did not know that B.C.C.I. had been behind the purchase of the bank.
For him, the bank became a new challenge for his later years. He looked at his contemporaries and did not like what he saw, he said in an interview in The Washington Post.
"Some of them would go with their wives each morning to the market and help with the marketing, pushing those carts and all," he told the interviewer. "Well, I didn't find that very appealing."
And so he accepted the clients who are now known to have been associated with B.C.C.I., and agreed to become the chairman of First American Bank. In itself, some lawyers saw his wearing of two hats as a conflict of interest.
Mr. Clifford was called before Congressional committees and had his lawyers send reams of material to the prosecutors in an effort to show that his work for B.C.C.I. and First American was proper.
How will history judge Clark Clifford, he was asked by a visitor to his office several months before he was indicted. "It depends on the ultimate result," he said. "If it comes and goes and nothing else happens, gradually it gets swallowed up in history. If it turns out badly, as far as history is concerned I've taken a bad tumble."

HEADLINE: COVER STORY;
Tackling a Tale of Guilt To Its Classic Core

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
Let's begin with a show of hands. How many read Fyodor Dostoyevsky's "Crime and Punishment" in school (even if involved a bit of cheating by way of Cliffs Notes)? 
 A fair number of arms probably just shot up.
Now, how many can remember details of the many plots and subplots that Dostoyevsky, apparently paid by the word, tossed into his stew of a novel?
Bet a lot of hands are back down.
And NBC figures much the same with a new, two-hour film version of the Russian classic that it will broadcast tonight at 9. Given the constraints of prime-time television, the network felt it had no choice but to hack away at the thicket of subplots in "Crime and Punishment," eliminating nonessential story lines to focus on what the movie's director, Joseph Sargent, calls "the kernel of what Dostoyevsky is writing about."
The excisions might offend some purists, Mr. Sargent acknowledged. But he suspected that, as in the fanciful show of hands, most viewers would not miss a thing.
"Originally, it was scheduled as a four-hour mini-series," he said in a telephone interview from a London studio where he was putting the film into final shape. "But we decided that maybe it's too early for an American audience to sit through four hours of a Russian classic novel."
Even so, it would be unfair to call this production Dostoyevsky Lite. The book's dark introspection remains intact, as does its brooding portrait of Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, the St. Petersburg student who believes that his superior intellect should allow him to get away with murder. Ultimately, he finds himself overtaken by burning guilt, and confesses his crime to a cunning police inspector, Porfiry, played here by Ben Kingsley.
If anything, executives at NBC feel it is quite bold of them to put a work like this on the air, scaled down or not. An action-packed segment of "E.R." it isn't. Half the time you wonder if the self-absorbed, guilt-racked Raskolnikov, played by Patrick Dempsey, will even manage to drag himself out of bed.
Lindy DeKoven, NBC's vice president for movies and mini-series, describes the film with the kinds of words that usually strike terror in the hearts of network officials: "highbrow," "intelligent," "introspective" and, that most dread adjective of all, "risky."
"I think it's incumbent upon us in broadcasting to try to raise the bar," Ms. DeKoven said. "We should be taking more risks in television than we are." Of course, she added, the bottom line in the end will be, "Is it going to be entertaining, and will people respond to it?"
David Stevens, the screenwriter of this adaptation, confesses to having been somewhat baffled when NBC first suggested the project. "I asked them why," he said, "and their answer was quite remarkable. They said, 'We want to do something good.' It's reminding people that television is capable of much more than just crime shows."
"Crime and Punishment" has been rendered on film at least 11 times before, including two American productions, in 1935 and 1959. Every screenwriter had to grapple with the challenge of making visual a narrative that exists to a large extent inside the head of the tormented Raskolnikov.
Mr. Stevens decided against a voice-over telling the audience what is on the hero's mind while nothing much happens on the screen. Somehow, that struck him as "cheating with the book." Instead, he has Raskolnikov roaming St. Petersburg (on those days when he manages to roust himself out of bed) and agonizing out loud throughout. And getting progressively loonier as he does so, one might add.
Could some in the audience see all this walking and talking and raving as a bit artificial? Not at all, the director, Mr. Sargent, insisted. "Let's face it," he said. "Shakespeare did the same thing 400 years ago. We're not doing anything new."
To recreate the look of St. Petersburg in the 1850's, he and his crew ended up in Budapest. "I wish we could have done it in St. Petersburg, if only so I could have gone to see the Hermitage," Mr. Sargent said.
But the Russian city did not have enough stagehands and available bit actors who could speak passable English. Besides, the Russian economy has been coming apart at the seams, making this not the best of times to put millions of dollars at the mercy of wobbly exchange rates.
So Budapest it was. Besides being the birthplace of the film's executive producer, Robert Halmi Sr., it had plenty of streets to give the feel of an Eastern European city of the last century. Computer graphics filled in the onion domes of Russian Orthodox churches that are not to be found in predominantly Roman Catholic Hungary. Budapest had another advantage: a pool of set designers, wig makers and other craftsmen -- not to mention actors -- who learned their trade well in the Communist days of lavish subsidies for the arts, and who now needed work.
Mr. Sargent hired dialect coaches, both to teach his Hungarian actors to speak better English and to teach his American and British actors to cultivate a Hungarian accent. It seemed easier to have everyone settle on a single accent, Hungarian, than to force the poor Hungarians to learn English and then give it a Russian flavor. After all, the director figured, American audiences would hear a Middle European sound, and that would be good enough. Who would lose sleep over a detail like that?
Not many people, except perhaps Mr. Kingsley, who is blessed with a keen ear. "I stuck to my Russian," the Oscar-winning actor said proudly by phone from London. "I was told that my Russian accent was very good."
Crime, if not punishment, dogged the film crew in Budapest.
While it was shooting a key scene inside an old building -- Raskolnikov washing the blood of his victims from his hands -- a knife fight spilled out of a bar down the block. One man was stabbed. A doctor assigned to the film crew raced over to try keeping him alive, Mr. Sargent said, but the man died in his arms.
"It was a little unsettling," the director said.
Far more disturbing was a bomb that later went off near the hotel where the crew was staying. Three people were killed and more than 20 were injured in the explosion, which was apparently criminal in nature and not an act of political terrorism. "It blew out half the buildings on the streets," Mr. Sargent said. "The reverberations were incredible."
Aside from those unnerving episodes, the on-location shooting passed uneventfully. That left the movie makers with ample time to reflect on their central question: whether a cerebral exercise like this can be a hit in the land of "South Park," "The Simpsons" and disease-of-the-week movies. Can it be possible that "I <heart> Dosty" T-shirts will start popping up all across America?
"I can only hope so," said Mr. Stevens, the screenwriter. "What I hope happens with this film -- because everyone expects it to be applauded in the attempt, if not the achievement -- is that it would encourage more of this sort to be done. If it does passably well, then some crazy person might want to try tackling another formidable book."
"Or even," he added with a bark of a laugh, "try an original idea, Heaven forfend."

HEADLINE: As U.S. Presses Talks on Kosovo, Hope of Averting Air Strikes Rises

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Sunday, Oct. 11

 BODY:
The continuation of negotiations on Saturday by the American envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke, with both the ethnic Albanian leadership in Kosovo and the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, suggested that enough common ground was being found to avert NATO air strikes, Western diplomats said.
Mr. Holbrooke spent about an hour and a half with Ibrahim Rugova, the ethnic Albanian political leader, in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, and returned for seven hours of talks with Mr. Milosevic, which ended shortly after midnight. Later, the official news agency Tanjug said that "all the conditions are there" for a political solution to the crisis. 
 But an American official traveling with Mr. Holbrooke dismissed the statement, calling it "old wine in an old bottle."
Mr. Holbrooke said he planned to meet again today with Mr. Milosevic. "Nothing has changed," he said. "The situation is very serious."
The longer talks go on and the more exchanges take place between the two sides in the Kosovo conflict, the greater the chances for a peaceful resolution, diplomats said.
NATO has threatened air strikes unless Mr. Milosevic ends all military operations in Kosovo, a province in southern Serbia, and begins negotiations with the ethnic Albanians who make up about 90 percent of the province's population.
Even if Mr. Milosevic backs down, however, many Serbs in this frightened capital say the mere threat of air strikes has enabled the Yugoslav leader to strengthen rather than weaken control of his economically depressed country. Page 8.
There is still a high likelihood, the diplomats said, that NATO will formally declare an "activation order," the last step necessary to authorize air strikes.
The Secretary General of NATO, Javier Solana, said in Brussels on Saturday that the alliance had completed all the necessary decisions before declaring the order.
American officials have consistently said they believe that it would take the final authorization of air strikes to push Mr. Milosevic to compromise.
There were signs in Belgrade that Mr. Milosevic had decided that taking NATO air strikes was not the smoothest route to his political survival.
The Daily Telegraph, an independent newspaper that is considered to reflect a sense of what the secretive Mr. Milosevic is mulling, reported on Saturday that the Yugoslav leader "objects to some parts of the proposed agreement" but that a deal was in the making.
The newspaper said Mr. Milosevic was against having NATO soldiers as part of a peacekeeping force in Kosovo. Senior Clinton Administration officials have said in the last several days that an "international presence" would be necessary in Kosovo to verify the withdrawal of Mr. Milosevic's troops.
The officials have also suggested that the "presence" would be used to help the international aid effort needed over the winter to assist about 250,000 ethnic Albanian refugees who were forced to flee their homes in Kosovo during a three-month offensive by Serbian forces.
American officials have not been specific about the composition of such a "presence." Mr. Holbrooke has noted the opposition in Congress to sending G.I.'s to Kosovo.
The Daily Telegraph also reported that Mr. Milosevic had asked for all economic sanctions to be lifted against Yugoslavia, including the ban on loans from the International Monetary Fund and financing from the World Bank. The newspaper said Mr. Holbrooke had offered a gradual lifting of sanctions.
Mr. Holbrooke was characteristically tight-lipped about his discussions in Pristina. The situation was "just as serious" as some days ago, he said on Saturday before taking the 40-minute flight back to Belgrade.
He met with a three-man negotiating team for the ethnic Albanians in Pristina but spent most of his time with Mr. Rugova.
Mr. Rugova has led the ethnic Albanian policy calling for the independence of Kosovo rather than some kind of enhanced autonomy within a Yugoslav framework. His peaceful pursuit of independence has earned him Western backing over the violent guerrilla tactics of the Kosovo Liberation Army, an ethnic Albanian group trying to win independence on the battlefield.
Accompanying Mr. Holbrooke was the American Ambassador to Macedonia, Christopher M. Hill, the main author of an interim political plan for the status of Kosovo.
Mr. Hill's plan would restore to Kosovo some degree of autonomy, which was stripped away by Mr. Milosevic in 1989, but postpones for several years the question of independence. It also lays out details of much greater representation of ethnic Albanians -- who outnumber Serbs nine to one in the province -- in the police force, the courts, a legislature and other bodies.
Officially, Mr. Holbrooke is armed with six points of negotiation that he brought with him from a meeting with the so-called contact group in London on Friday. The group consists of Russia, the United States and European countries that monitor events in Yugoslavia.
The points include the withdrawal of the Yugoslav National Army and the Serbian police in Kosovo to the levels in March, when the crackdown against the guerrillas began, and the storage of heavy weapons, the freedom for the 250,000 ethnic Albanian refugees to return to their homes without intimidation from Serbian police and the start of talks based on the Hill plan.

DATELINE: UNIONDALE, N.Y., Oct. 10

 BODY:
The sky didn't fall, and neither did their 10-ton scoreboard. But the Islanders, the Chicken Little franchise whose threat to boycott their home games due to unsavory conditions at Nassau Coliseum landed them in state and Federal court last month, fell into immediate arrears on the 1998-99 season tonight.
Forced by a State Supreme Court ruling to play their home games at their 26-year-old county-owned home base, the Islanders lost their season opener against the Pittsburgh Penguins, 4-3. The game was not shown on Fox Sports New York, which blamed its decision on a dearth of advertisers, but it was seen live here by 11,457 fans whose mood ranged from hostility toward the new Islander ownership to embarrassment for the players caught in the web of management's machinations. 
 As fans entered the arena, they were handed fringed white towels to wave if and when their players scored. Other than that meager touch, there were no welcome, or welcome back, mats laid out.
Indeed, there wasn't even the traditional opening-night introduction ceremony to honor the players: David Seldin, the president of New York Sports Ventures, which owns the club, attributed that oversight to Spectacor Management Group, the company that runs the facility. Seldin also blamed S.M.G. for the virtually blank scoreboard, which showed the score but no replays.
According to Seldin, the scoreboard, which is due to be replaced, sprang a mysterious leak and dripped a small but steady stream of water onto center ice throughout the opening period. "The lack of cooperation we're receiving from the building is profound," he said.
And for the Islander faithful, the opening period was a doleful one. Jaromir Jagr ignited a three-goal scoring spree with his power-play deflection at 4 minutes 50 seconds, and in the space of four shots between 4:50 and 6:02, the Penguins staked themselves to a 3-0 lead.
"At 3-0 we're scrambling for some sort of life preserver," said Mike Milbury, the coach and gGeneral manager, who called a timeout after the third Penguin goal. As for the added opening-night distraction caused by the club's off-ice controversies, Milbury said, "There's no problem."
The Islander defense, operating somewhere between dismay and deflation, was culpable on all three goals, with Rich Pilon providing an inadvertent assist to Jagr on the first one, which scuttled off his skate and behind goalie Tommy Salo. The second Pittsburgh goal was scored by Robert Lang at 5:42, and Aleksei Morozov completed the scoring rampage at 6:02.
When Jagr went to the penalty box on a hooking call, there was a brief flurry of optimism among the fans, but things quickly turned vituperative when the Islander power play failed to assert itself. The crowd, sympathetic at the game's start and stunned into silence by the Penguins' three-goal outburst, began to boo the home team.
With five minutes left in the period, the crowd began to chant for Zigmund Palffy, the unsigned superstar and league leader in power-play goals (17) last season: "We want Ziggy," they demanded. And when Brad Werenka, parked just inside the blue line, cranked out the slap shot that put Pittsburgh ahead by 4-0 at 18:04, the fans launched into a sarcastic lament for John Spano, last year's fraudulent purchaser of the perpetually on-the-block franchise.
"We want Spano," they jeered. What they got instead, with just over eight seconds left on the clock, was a glimmer of hope from Kenny Jonsson, who powered the puck behind Pittsburgh goalie Tom Barrasso at 19:51 and trimmed the deficit to 4-1.
In the second period, Trevor Linden, the team captain who finally accepted the Islanders' take-it-or-leave-it offer of $2.5 million just four days before this opener, made up for the missing Palffy by contributing two power-play goals of his own. Now perceived as a hero by the Islander fans, who believe Linden deserved the $4 million, multiyear deal he sought but exhibited true professionalism by returning in time to lead his dejected troops into the season, Linden put the Islanders back into competitive position with a close range tip-in at 5:03.
Linden made it a 4-3 game at 16:58. With no further heroics on tap for the final period, where Linden missed a hat trick chance in a goal-side scramble with 3:54 remaining, the Islanders settled for a close loss instead of the rapid rout.
But the patience of the club's fans, many of whom wore Islander jerseys emblazoned with the names of stars from the club's past, is dwindling fast. All one had to do was look at the ice, where white towels were tossed like garbage.

HEADLINE: Impeachment Inquiry Won't Help Us Abroad

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The concept of overturning a Presidential election through a one-sided "judicial" inquiry and an impeachment process (front page, Oct. 9) has side-railed essential legislative business (campaign finance and health care reform). 
 The notion of our Government's stability now appears in question. For 200 years our Constitution, with its provisions for an orderly system of elections and a balance of power among the executive, legislative and judicial branches as a safe harbor, attracted capital to the United States for investment and safekeeping.
Rather than bringing foreign capital to our shores and preserving prosperity, the Republicans' present efforts are sullying this safe, stable, constitutional harbor and can only succeed in bringing the worsening worldwide recession to America next.

HEADLINE: NEW YORKERS & CO.;
Famous in Tokyo If Not Here

BYLINE: By ERIC HUBLER

 BODY:
IF you came to New York to be famous but haven't made it yet, take heart. You already have 100 million fans.
They're called the Japanese, and if you're a New Yorker, they want to know all about you. 
 That's why they tune in to a hit television show called "New Yorkers," which is produced in New York and does nothing but profile -- you guessed it -- New Yorkers. Created by Nancy Lee Giller, an American who went to Japan as a teen-ager and worked there as a TV reporter, "New Yorkers" has been going strong for five years in a country where most shows last -- and are intended to last -- for only one year.
"New Yorkers" is the most prominent example of Japan-centric video production in New York, but it certainly isn't the only one. There is a cottage industry here that rests on Japan's fascination with the city; slowed somewhat by Japan's recession, it still sustains half a dozen companies as well as numerous independents that probe New York life and put New York scenes in commercials. Global Japan, which owns "New Yorkers," is the largest such venture, with 35 full-time employees.
New York offers several practical advantages for Japanese and other film makers. "We're a very film-friendly country," said Jeffrey Murray, president of Downtown Reel Productions, which since 1988 has made commercials exclusively for Japanese clients. "We can shut down Fifth Avenue if it's the right time on a weekend and race a car up and down. It's just amazing what we can get away with here."
In taking Wall Street and the Statue of Liberty to Japanese viewers, directors here can also gain access to American camera operators, who are the world's most skilled; to such costly goodies as camera cars, and to stars like Antonio Banderas, Peter Falk and Liv Tyler, whom Mr. Murray has filmed for commercials peddling Subaru, Toyota and Lux hair products, respectively.
But enchantment with New York is this industry's biggest asset. "Japanese viewers love to see the way Americans live, what they eat, how they dress, what their houses look like," said Tracy Roberts, a freelance producer in Brooklyn who has been arranging tapings for Japanese game shows, dramas and commercials for eight years. Ms. Roberts's current project is a sober series about early American history, but "I've done lots of things with drag queens" as well, she said.
Indeed, the Japanese curiosity is profound. "I frequently forget how much people love this show," Ms. Giller of "New Yorkers" said. But she is soon reminded. On a recent trip to Japan, a business acquaintance begged her to go to his house to meet his 16-year-old daughter, who watches "New Yorkers" with the same devotion that an American teen-ager might lavish on "Dawson's Creek" or "Melrose Place."
"Life in Japan can be a little mundane, and watching 'New Yorkers' is a kind of hopeful, interesting, colorful thing," Ms. Giller explained.
Ms. Giller created "New Yorkers" in response to a contest run by NHK, the BBC of Japan, which needed to fill a slot on one of its satellite channels. (In Japan, satellite plays the role that cable does here.) The show had to be about New York, and the other entrants featured predictable fare like hot Manhattan restaurants and clubs. Focusing on people instead of places gave "New Yorkers" the edge, Ms. Giller said.
The first installment of the weekly 20-minute show was about Peter Max, the artist. But Ms. Giller did not want the show to become celebrity-heavy and, given the Japanese appetite for New York information, that was no problem. Episode 2 was about a young woman who gave up her career as a bridal consultant to become a police officer. Number 3 focused on a man, now a choreographer, who was then working at one of the most nerve-wracking jobs on Broadway: "swing," or stand-in for all nonstarring parts, in "Jelly's Last Jam."
Ms. Giller and her crew found the first 40 or 50 subjects themselves, but when they ran out of friends and friends of friends to follow around for a week at a time, they turned to summer interns and a researcher.
Sometimes, the cultural curiosity cuts both ways. Cynthia Casoff, a midwife, was asked to be on the show last year after delivering the baby of an NHK employee based in New York. She loved the idea -- in part because she had been fascinated by the handful of Japanese women she had worked with here. "I've never seen women tolerate pain the way they do," Ms. Casoff said. "They are, I would say, the strongest women I've ever delivered. I've encouraged them to scream; they will not."
Horacio Hugo Sende, an Argentine immigrant who is in charge of polishing all the metal surfaces in the public areas of Rockefeller Center, from the Atlas to the revolving doors, was profiled this year and said the show captured him perfectly. "I love it," he said of his episode, calling it "very well made, very serious."
Like the show, the host of "New Yorkers" straddles more than one culture. Sali Oguri, 28 years old, immigrated to Queens from Nagoya with her family when she was 6. "I have a very eclectic life, just because I live in New York," Ms. Oguri said. Her main love is singing, and she has worked with a Latin combo and a Sicilian wedding band. On Sundays, she sings at a Pentecostal church in the Bronx.
On a recent taping at Grand Central Terminal -- the subject was Mike McLendon, the station superintendent -- Ms. Oguri showed how automatically she switches between her American and Japanese personas. The moment the camera starts rolling, her petite frame undergoes a subtle but real transfiguration: with a huge smile, slightly bowed head and a cute wave, she becomes the girl in the rice-paper house next door, the counterpart of millions of office ladies, elevator girls and housewives in the audience. When "cut" is called, the New York career woman is back.
Indeed, the "New Yorkers" crew at Grand Central is a living celebration of the multiculturalism that so many young Japanese seem to crave: Sean O'Hara, the 27-year-old director, is an Irishman who grew up in London; Robin Adams, 35, the cameraman, is a native New Yorker, and Katsuho Shimoharu, the sound woman, grew up in Nagasaki but is married to an American and considers New York home.
But it is one culture -- Japan's -- that keeps this enterprise going. "They watch 99 percent more programming about the United States and other foreign countries than we watch about anybody else," said Tracy Roberts, the freelance producer in Brooklyn. "They have a whole history of observing and imitating and adapting American culture in all its forms, and I think this is an extension of that."

HEADLINE: As Local Papers Merge, Some Ask: Will One Size Fit All?

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER with MATTHEW J. ROSENBERG

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Oct. 9

 BODY:
Many residents of Westchester County can remember when every city and several towns had their own hometown daily newspapers.
Papers like The Yonkers Herald-Statesman, The Ossining Citizen-Register and The Tarrytown Daily News religiously covered school and planning board meetings, where the small-scale issues may not have resonated widely but were passionately felt nonetheless. They told residents when the Lions Club was meeting and whose home had been broken into overnight. 
 When a neighbor died, no matter whether it was someone who ran banks or cleaned houses, the local paper bid a tender farewell in an obituary that offered the highlights of a life.
In 1964, these daily newspapers fell under the umbrella of the Gannett Company, the nation's largest newspaper chain, which eventually consolidated many of their operations, from offices to presses to sections like food, sports and entertainment. Still, for most of the last three decades the papers have clung to their names and identities and continued to focus on community news.
With Monday's publication, though, Gannett will merge nine newspapers in Westchester County, one in Rockland County and an edition in Putnam County, into a single morning paper: The Journal News. From now on, the company will offer all readers in its 861-square-mile territory -- from Pelham, just north of the Bronx, to Patterson, 50 miles farther north -- essentially the same front page and the same platter of news, feature and service articles. The region will be divided into four zones, each with its own local news section.
With the new paper, Gannett Suburban Newspapers, the Gannett division based in White Plains, will be able to offer advertisers a single place to reach 153,000 paying readers in 144 communities, rather than a patchwork of 11 different newspapers. That merging of readership, along with the Gannett chain's growing presence in New Jersey, will make Gannett an even more powerful player in the New York City suburbs.
What worries many readers in Westchester, Rockland and Putnam, though, is that Gannett may lose some of its microscopic emphasis as it tries to do more stories with regional and countywide interest. Can reporters, these skeptics ask, who are told to concentrate on in-depth regional stories about Westchester's aging sewer systems or the Tappan Zee Bridge, which binds Westchester and Rockland like an umbilical cord, also sustain the zest to cover a Monday night meeting of the zoning board?
"The problems facing our areas are regional to a great extent," said Paul J. Feiner, the Supervisor of the Town of Greenburgh. "If there's a shopping mall in Rockland like the Palisades Mall, it impacts Westchester business as well. On the other hand, a paper has a certain amount of pages and more regional coverage could mean there's going to be less local coverage."
Already, Gannett has drawn complaints from some readers because this week it ended its policy of publishing obituaries for every Westchester resident who dies. Reporters now write obituaries for only the most prominent. Other deaths will simply be listed, and families who want longer obituaries will have to pay for them.
"I look at my parents and their neighbors," said Stephen Medwid, a 40-year-old Tarrytown actor. "These people spent their whole lives here and built the community. To not recognize what they've done in the obituary column, well, it's criminal."
Newspaper analysts like John Morton and Sig Gissler, a Columbia University School of Journalism professor who studied Gannett, say the trick for Gannett is to broaden the paper's outlook and achieve economies of scale without alienating readers who cherish local coverage.
"There's always a risk that you can overconsolidate," Mr. Gissler said. "A lot of people like their local, local coverage."
What Gannett is doing reflects trends that have been altering the suburbs for more than a generation. The image of suburbia made up of an archipelago of closely knit, largely white and middle-class villages where the wives shop on Main Street while the husbands commute to Manhattan has long been a wistful throwback.
Men and women do most of their major shopping in vast regional malls like The Westchester here and the Palisades in West Nyack and they may pass up a neighborhood hospital for the specialized care of a regional hospital like the Westchester County Medical Center. Women increasingly commute and the jobs they and working men travel to are increasingly outside Manhattan, in places like Westchester and Rockland. Suburban newcomers are often from Latin America or India, and may have more ties to their native countries than to the villages they live in.
Gannett has even noticed that two of every three families who buy houses in Westchester have lived somewhere else in the county and want to keep up with news of their former towns as well as their current ones.
Executives at Gannett, which publishes 84 dailies, including USA Today, say that as a result of interviewing readers through a survey method called focus groups, they have had to rethink their papers for a more cosmopolitan and sophisticated age. Obviously, economic considerations played as big a role in a chain that last year had before-tax profits of 31.2 percent, according to an analysis by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, a financial services company.
Beginning with Monday's issue, Gannett editors will no longer have to remake the paper 12 times a day, reloading the presses so each paper carries its own nameplate and several individualized pages for hometown news, social calendars and local advertisements. Not only has that meant extra editors, but presses in Gannett's White Plains headquarters have also had to start rolling as early as 9:30 P.M., leaving 40 percent of Gannett's subscribers without the results of late baseball games or late town meetings.
With Monday's newspaper, Gannett will revise the paper only four times for four newly carved zones -- in southern Westchester, central Westchester, the combined area of northern Westchester and Putnam, and Rockland County. While the front pages will have virtually identical assemblages of foreign, national and particularly compelling local news, a new second section of local news will be different for each zone. The southern Westchester edition, for example, will have three separate pages of news for Yonkers, Mount Vernon and New Rochelle.
Aware of the anxieties their merger is stirring, Gary F. Sherlock, president and publisher of Gannett Suburban Newspapers, the regional division here, repeatedly promised in interviews that the new paper would carry more local news than it does now. But he also made a distinction.
"The term local news is more broadly defined than just the news of the town I live in," Mr. Sherlock said.
As part of this more cosmopolitan approach, Gannett has opened a Manhattan bureau to tell readers about New York City decisions that affect the northern counties on issues like transportation. And it continues to emphasize more in-depth looks at issues affecting the entire region.
A half-dozen reporters and editors at Gannett who spoke on the condition of anonymity said they had been assured that the consolidation of the newspaper would not mean any job cutbacks, though some editors might be reassigned to other positions.
People wary of the changes contend that a New Rochelle reader accustomed to a steady diet of hometown news may not feel satisfied getting more stories about Yonkers and Mount Vernon but fewer about New Rochelle.
"People who live in Port Chester aren't particularly interested in Yonkers, even though they're both in southern Westchester," said Sy Schulman, the former Mayor of White Plains.
Goldie Solomon of Port Chester, the head of the village's historical society and a gadfly who attends most civic meetings to let neighbors know her gripes, said she missed the days when Gannett kept an office in Port Chester for its Daily Item edition. She could regularly drop off notices about upcoming meetings and buttonhole reporters with a complaint about a nagging town problem.
But Gannett closed that office in the mid-1980's and more recently closed offices in Yonkers and Yorktown, requiring reporters who cover those locales to work out of centralized offices in White Plains and New Rochelle. More important, Gannett has for the last few years been gradually homogenizing its front pages in the Westchester and Putnam newspapers.
"It's not a local paper anymore," Ms. Solomon said of The Daily Item, whose 100-year-old nameplate will cease to exist on Monday. "When they moved out of Port Chester, it lost its localness."
Politicians with more regional constituencies, like Andrew J. Spano, the County Executive, heartily applaud the merger, predicting it will bring the same cohesiveness to Westchester that Newsday brought to Long Island.
"One of our problems in this county is sometimes we're too parochial," Mr. Spano said.
And Mr. Feiner, who is running for Congress in the 20th Congressional district for the seat now held by Representative Benjamin Gilman, is pleased that a unified Gannett will introduce him to potential voters in Rockland.
But at the same time he laments that four or five years ago Gannett stopped covering every town board meeting in Greenburgh. Indeed, many Westchester politicians, like Assemblyman Richard Brodsky of Greenburgh, are hoping that Gannett holds on to some of its narrow-gauge coverage even as it tries to regionalize.
"What made Westchester is that we have kept distinct small communities," Mr. Brodsky said. "It matters if you live in Elmsford and not in Ardsley. The smallness of the communities gave the place an intimacy and heterogeneous feel that gets lost in an era of malls."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In / Berkeley Heights, N.J.;
Quiet Streets Near River and Mountain

BYLINE: By JERRY CHESLOW 

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH bisected by several major arteries, including Springfield, Plainfield and Mountain Avenues, the Township of Berkeley Heights in Union County retains its rustic ambiance.
Many of its tree-lined residential streets follow the contours of the Second Watchung Mountain and the Passaic River, which forms its northern border. Its largest commercial enterprise, Lucent Technologies, is set far back from the road. Even the downtown, along Springfield Avenue, has an unplanned suburban feel -- a hodgepodge of strip malls, small stores and supermarkets that are set far back, behind vast parking lots. 
 The township owes its rural character to its late development. Until 1941, when the American Telephone and Telegraph Company built its Bell Laboratories research facility in the township, it was a sleepy farming and resort community. According to a history compiled by the League of Women Voters in 1963, the population mushroomed to 9,500 in 1962 from 2,194 in 1940.
"Bell Labs drew scientists and other professionals to the area," Mayor Daniel A. Palladino said. "Among the inventions that emerged from the facility were the transistor and low-loss optical communications fibers, used in fiber-optic cable."
According to the Berkeley Heights Superintendent of Schools, Dr. Robert T. Stowell, Lucent Technologies, the successor to Bell Labs, has been "very supportive of the school system." In 1993, it cooperated with Dr. Stowell on what he believes was the first demonstration of the use of the Internet for educational purposes.
Today, Lucent supplies the township's Governor Livingston High School, free of charge, with a high-volume, high-speed T-1 line for Internet use. Besides the high school, the 2,275-student Berkeley Heights school system consists of an early childhood center at Hamilton Terrace for kindergarten and first grade, three elementary schools for second through fifth grades and the Columbia Middle School for grades six through eight.
"We chose to equip one school for kindergarten and first grade because we felt that it was healthier for the children not to be competing with their older siblings during their first years in school," Superintendent Stowell said. "We equipped the playgrounds to better serve these children, placed bulletin boards at their height and designed libraries for more exploration."
Computers are introduced in kindergarten, with at least one computer in each classroom. The middle school has two computer laboratories and the high school five.
Although it is within the township borders and served Berkeley Heights students, Governor Livingston High School was only incorporated into the Berkeley Heights system in the last school year. This followed a long battle for state legislation to allow the breakup of Union County Regional High School District No. 1, which included four high schools and six municipalities: Berkeley Heights, Garwood, Kenilworth, Clark, Springfield and Mountainside.
Among Berkeley Heights's complaints with the old setup was that, since it had a high per-household income, it was paying the highest per-pupil cost among the participating municipalities. "It was costing us $20,000 per student, when Garwood was paying $8,000," Dr. Stowell said. "We were subsidizing the system."
The high school offers 13 advanced placement courses in English, history, mathematics, the sciences and foreign languages. It has 18 sports teams and its Highlanders marching band is renowned for its bagpipes and kilts. Last year, the band defeated 28 other high school bands to win the Atlantic Coast Championship.
OF last year's 184-student senior class, 91 percent went on to higher education. That class had a combined average verbal and math score of 1,131 on the Scholastic Assessment Test, compared with a state average score of 1,005.
The school system was a major attraction for Christian and Tracy Procaccini, a young couple that bought a 40-year-old three-bedroom split level on Timber Drive five years ago, moving in from nearby Longhill Township, where they were living in a small two-bedroom house. Both grew up in the area and Mr. Procaccini works in the Lucent Technologies headquarters building, a 10-minute commute to Warren.
"We looked in Summit, New Providence, Berkeley Heights and Longhill Township, all of which have excellent school systems," Mrs. Procaccini said. "My first choice would have been Summit because it has a very nice downtown. But the housing here was more affordable and the street is quiet with a lot of trees and tons of kids. We now have a 2-year-old son and I'm excited about the early childhood center concept."
Delores Scott Croneberger, a sales associate with Burgdorff Realtors in neighboring New Providence, says the Procaccinis reflect a trend in which young families are buying older homes from empty-nesters.
Many of the early postwar homes are expanded capes or four-bedroom colonials on half-acre lots. Single-family houses listed for sale in the multiple listing service range from $179,900 for a small ranch in the Free Acres section on the southwestern side of town to $599,000 for a four-bedroom colonial on Emerson Lane nearby.
Among the more prestigious newer areas of town is Cinnamon Ridge in the central section, where custom colonials sell in the $500,000 range, Ms. Croneberger said. Closer to the center of town, expanded capes and ranches along tree-lined Coolidge or Harding Drives sell for $320,000 to $350,000.
Among the less expensive homes are small ranches and capes built on slabs in the 1950's along Delmore Avenue, where one house is listed at $189,000.
Since 1992, there has been explosive growth in town house condominiums, mainly to satisfy the township's obligations under the State Supreme Court's Mount Laurel rulings, which require communities to provide housing to people of all incomes.
Like many other New Jersey municipalities, Berkeley Heights allowed builders to construct four market-rate, high-density units in return for building one low- or moderately priced unit. The growing number of housing units has worsened an already-congested rush-hour along the town's main arteries and even some internal roads as drivers seek shortcuts.
Among the newer condominium communities, the 40-unit Berkeley Village, off Plainfield Avenue, is the most moderately priced. Two-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath units there start at $214,900. At the Highlands, a 62-unit complex off Springfield Avenue, two- and three-bedroom town houses sell for $225,000 to $269,000, Ms. Croneberger said. The most luxurious complex is the 44-unit Berkeley Meadows off Meadowview Lane, which has two- , three- and four-bedroom units at from the low $200,000's to $400,000. One four-bedroom unit recently sold for $395,000.
The earliest construction in Berkeley Heights began in an area that is now part of the 2,000-acre Watchung Reservation, a Union County park that includes 305 acres of the township.
The first white settler was Peter Willcox, who received a 424-acre land grant in 1720 from the Elizabethtown Associates, a group that bought much of northern New Jersey from the Leni Lenape Indians in the late 17th century. Mr. Willcox built a grist and lumber mill across Green Brook.
In 1845, Mr. Willcox's heirs sold the mill to David Felt, a paper manufacturer from New York, who built a small village called Feltville around the mill. It included homes for workers and their families, dormitories, orchards, a post office and a general store with a church above it. Mr. Felt was nicknamed King David because of the dictatorial way in which he ran the village, obligating workers to attend church on Sundays and to observe a 9 P.M. curfew.
In 1860, Feltville was sold to sarsparilla makers, after which it was used for a number of manufacturing operations, before going into bankruptcy in 1882. When residents moved away, it became known as Deserted Village, the remains of which consist of 130 acres on which there are seven houses, the store, the mill and a barn.
The site, on the National and State Registers of Historic Places, is under restoration by the Union County Parks Department, with grants of almost $2 million from various state agencies. Deserted Village, in the Watchung Reservation, is open daily for unguided walking tours during daylight hours. On the weekend of Oct. 24-25, free guided tours of Deserted Village will be held as part of a countywide historic celebration called Four Centuries in a Weekend.
Another early community of note is the 67-acre Free Acres, established in 1910 by Bolton Hall, a New York entrepreneur and reformer. Mr. Hall believed in the idea of Henry George, the economist, of single taxation, under which residents pay tax to the community, which, in turn, pays a lump sum to the municipality. Among the early residents of Free Acres were the actor James Cagney and his wife, Billie.
TO this day, residents of Free Acres pay tax to their association, which maintains its streets and swimming pool, approves architectural changes to homes and pays a lump sum in taxes to the municipality. "You could say that it was an early condominium community," Mayor Palladino said.
Early life in Berkeley Heights is documented in the Little-Lord Farmstead, an 18-acre museum surrounding two houses, one of which was built in the 1750's and the other near the turn of the century, according to Helen Tyler, president of the society.
Among the exhibits are a Victorian master bedroom and a Victorian children's room, furnished with period antiques. The children's room also has reproductions of antique toys, which visitors can play with. "We thought that, since it is a children's room," Mrs. Tyler said, "it would be unfair to prevent modern children from touching the toys."
The museum, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, also includes an outbuilding that was used as a summer kitchen, a corncrib dating to the 19th century and a spring house, built around a spring and used for refrigeration. It is open on the third Sunday of each month from 2 to 4 P.M.
Berkeley Heights has two supermarkets in the business district on Springfield Avenue. The street is filled with restaurants, serving Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, Italian, Thai, Indian and American food. Among the best known are Auberge Swiss (German), Di Maio's (Italian) and the Trap Rock Microbrewery. The closest major mall is Short Hills, four miles to the north.

 TEA LOTS: In 1902, land was so worthless in Berkeley Heights that it was used a marketing tool for tea. Harry O. Swift, a tea merchant from New Bedford, Mass., gave away a 25- by 60-foot lot with each pound of tea sold from a grocery store in nearby Summit. The buyers also had to pay a fee of between $15 and $25 for a deed. Mr. Swift never placed markers up to delineate the boundaries of the lots and most were too small for the construction of houses. Eventually, most of the tea lots reverted to the township for back taxes.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT;
A Time to Burn, a Time to Learn

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
AFTER seven fat years, the mutual fund industry has suffered a drought. A community of sainted portfolio managers has fallen from grace. And mutual fund investors may be thinking they have descended into the inferno.
The third quarter, in short, was one in which investors and fund managers alike were badly singed. Only 14 of 2,377 funds that invest in a broad array of United States stocks made money, according to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago, with the average domestic equity fund dropping 13 percent of its value. 
 Things were as bad or worse for investors who ventured overseas. The average emerging-markets stock fund lost half its value over the last year, and several have said they will liquidate their portfolios and close down. Since midyear, one well-known mutual fund manager after another -- from Michael P. DiCarlo of John Hancock Special Equities to Paul Stephens of Robertson Stephens Contrarian -- has relinquished all or part of his duties.
The contraction in mutual fund cash flows and assets as stock prices tumbled through the late summer and early fall is burning off some of the bloat that had built up among fund companies. But whether it has sculpted the industry into good-enough shape to provide the majority of mutual fund shareholders with the one thing they truly desire -- the investment returns and stability of assets to provide for retirement or other financial goals -- is, as yet, unclear.
The recent period of poor returns has brought to light flaws in the industry's practice of being all things to all people -- providing an endless variety of investment strategies, share classes and niche-filling funds. By slicing the fund bologna so absurdly thin that it hardly serves as a snack, much less a nutritious meal, mutual fund companies, in many cases, have left people more confused than informed.
A scan of the list of funds that performed the best over the last 12 months, however, could impart a few basic facts -- and expose a few myths -- about investing. And the lessons could serve investors well over the next year.
Some of the best performers over this period of market turmoil, for example, are funds that have the flexibility to add to or take away from asset classes like bonds or cash as the portfolio manager sees fit. Those managers generally are not bound to stay fully invested all the time or to limit themselves to one type of stock, and thereby to take risks that few sensible investors would take on their own.
"A lot of people get caught up with exotic portfolio theory," said Scott W. Schoelzel, manager of the Janus Twenty fund, which, according to Morningstar, was the best-performing diversified stock fund over the last 12 months, gaining 32.5 percent. "But I think I'm just like my shareholders. I'm 40 years old, I'm saving for retirement and for my kids' college education, and I think about how would I do that if I were investing on my own and not running a fund."
He does it by owning 20 or 30 stocks rather than 150, to better focus on his best ideas. And Mr. Schoelzel lets cash build up to 20 percent or so of the portfolio when he cannot find attractive stocks to buy. He prefers to wait until bargains crop up. He might even buy the occasional 30-year Treasury bond, as he did earlier this year with about 3 percent of the fund's $9.3 billion in assets when the yield topped 6 percent.
"To me it's a very common-sensical approach," Mr. Schoelzel said. "The key is to have balance -- not to own stocks of just one particular sector, but to look at five or six areas that generally offer the most dynamic prospects for growth."
Not surprisingly, investors have been throwing money at the Janus Twenty fund, even as they turned tail and ran away from stock funds as a whole in August. In that regard, investors abandoned the mantra they have have chanted for the last three years -- "Where else is there to put money than in stocks?" -- and pulled a net $11 billion out of equity funds. It was the first month in eight years in which they withdrew more money than they invested.
The cloud hanging over the fund business represents a startling change from the environment at the end of the second quarter, when a fourth consecutive year of 20-plus percent gains seemed likely for equity investors. Through the first half of 1998, the average general equity fund was up more than 11 percent. Bond funds, too, had registered gains, averaging nearly 3.5 percent.
But by losing more than 13 percent of its value in the third quarter, the average American stock fund wiped out the previous two quarters of gains and then some.
For the last three years, with the markets marching steadily upwards, the industry trend had been to push fund managers into ever-narrower pigeonholes. Fund companies increasingly cracked the asset-allocation whip, insisting that managers remain fully invested. And the companies progressively chipped away at managers' freedom to buy across a range of different securities. Yet the losses that many investors will face when they open their third-quarter statements later this month might have been smaller if fund managers had been given a bit more slack in how they managed their portfolios.
A fund manager who has some flexibility to decide when, as well as in which securities, to invest might give a fund shareholder a leg up in times of market upheaval. "I'm happy to have some extra cash around," said Wallace R. Weitz, manager of the Weitz Value and Weitz Partners Value funds, which have had as much as one-quarter of their assets in cash this year.
Mr. Weitz knows of what he speaks. He is the only manager with two of his equity funds among the top 10 performers over the last four quarters. (A third fund, Weitz Hickory, managed by Richard F. Lawson, ranked No. 11.) Mr. Weitz says he likes the spare cash "because I always think that tomorrow I'll find a great idea."
RESISTING the urge to pay too much for what are otherwise good companies and rigorously cutting back on holdings whose prices move up too far, too fast are two of the hardest disciplines for a portfolio manager to master. And doing so is subverted in the current environment, as fund analysts and pension consultants demand that managers remain fully invested.
Enforcing that dogma probably hurt investors more than it helped them recently, because it has caused the amount of nonequity investments in most fund shareholders' portfolios to drift further and further down. That left many investors in a vulnerable position when the market turned down. The amount of overall mutual fund assets in bonds has fallen over the last three-plus years to 17 percent of assets, from 31 percent at the beginning of 1995. Over the same stretch, stocks have risen to 58 percent from 40 percent, while cash has remained relatively constant at about 25 percent of assets.
In the last few years, of course, fund companies have tried to help investors know what is in their portfolios. But they have done so both by increasing their disclosure and by creating an enormous number of new, specialized funds, investing in specific niches.
Such specialization -- from Malaysian bonds to North American commercial real estate to stocks of companies working to solve the year-2000 problem -- creates inevitable problems for the fund industry, financial analysts say. "I always get concerned when a fund group goes into so many areas at once, particularly when those areas are not linked to any particular ability that the fund company has," said Kurt Cerulli, a Boston fund consultant.
That has been the case for much of the fund industry in the last several years. In trying to establish the breadth of product line needed to be considered for corporate 401(k) and other retirement programs, fund families have added funds that invest in obscure overseas markets, funds that specialize in various industries and portfolios that spread assets across all types of financial securities.
The strategy also helps fund companies by increasing the chance that at least one of their funds will land in the upper ranks of the performance tables, drawing attention and new investors. But rather than being seduced by such variety, an investor may be able to improve performance by looking for a company that has funds in just a few categories, and that performs admirably in them.
"I think if a fund company doesn't have a deep expertise in a particular area, it doesn't have any business offering a product to the public in that area," Mr. Cerulli said. "You may hire a manager with expertise in that area, but if as a company you don't have that depth, how do you tell when a manager is straying into areas where he shouldn't be?"
The problem, Mr. Cerulli said, is that the most esoteric investment areas also carry the most risk. So when a downturn comes, liquidity dries up quickly, making losses worse.
Mr. Cerulli said that if those more obscure types of funds do not perform well, fund companies are right to shut them down. "Everybody would be better served if they never put those funds out there in the first place," he added.
As emerging markets have crumbled around the world, investors have fled from many of those funds. In the last several weeks, as their assets have dropped to levels that make the funds unprofitable to operate, at least a half-dozen Asian and emerging-market funds have announced plans to liquidate or be merged into larger funds.
A few fund managers also shuttled off the stage in the third quarter, among them some managers who had been at or near the top of their ranks -- for example, Michael DiCarlo, who guided John Hancock Special Equities for 10 years.
During that stretch, Mr. DiCarlo had racked up a stellar performance record; the fund was in the top quartile of its peer group in four of five years from 1991 through 1995. In the latter year, he steered the portfolio to a gain of better than 50 percent. He was so well regarded by his superiors, in fact, that when Mr. DiCarlo decided to leave the firm in mid-1996 to start a hedge fund, John Hancock not only let him continue managing the Special Equities fund; it also took a stake in his new venture.
But he managed a return of only about 4 percent for the fund in 1996, followed by a 5 percent gain last year. And after getting off to a similarly poor start in the first half of this year, Mr. DiCarlo stepped down.
Mr. DiCarlo could not be reached for comment last week. When he stepped down from the John Hancock fund, he said in a news release: "The performance of the target universe of the fund has been disappointing over the last two years, as has the fund's performance. Still, I am very appreciative to have served on behalf of all those involved with Special Equities fund."
And Paul Stephens, chief investment officer for the Robertson Stephens mutual funds and manager of the high-profile Robertson Stephens Contrarian fund, gave up some of his duties last month after a similarly prolonged slide. While he remains at the fund, he now shares managerial duties with two colleagues, Andrew P. Pilara Jr. and Roderick R. Berry.
The Contrarian fund aims to buy out-of-favor investments that will perform well when the current favorites run cold; instead, even the worst-performing general stock funds in this year's market slide had to sprint to beat it to the bottom of the rankings. After one of the best performances among world stock funds in 1995 and 1996, the Contrarian fund lost 30 percent last year and 37 percent in the first nine months of 1998 -- leaving it with cumulative losses of roughly 20 percent since the fund's inception in June 1993.
Mr. Stephens did not return a phone call seeking comment. But Mr. Pilara said that while the fund has not changed its strategy, the new managers "will give us a greater breadth of sectors and ideas" from which to choose investments.
THAT such dismal performances can last so long usually means that more went against a manager than just his investment style going out of favor. Something else also falters -- his stock-picking, his expectation of which way interest rates will go or the like.
But out of such extended periods of dismal performance, opportunities are born. It is hard to believe, for example, that there are no hidden gems among small-cap stocks, which have far underperformed the large stocks that have benefited from equity investors' recent flight to quality.
Mark A. Coffelt, manager of Texas Capital Value and Growth, certainly believes there are. The fund gained 45 percent last year, but lost 32 percent in the third quarter, leaving it down 19 percent in the first nine months of 1998.
"When the psychology shifts, the place to be will be in small caps," Mr. Coffelt said. "The valuations already are incredibly compressed. Small caps are selling at 50 percent of the valuations of large-cap stocks. I think we will be in a recession sometime in the next five years, and maybe we already are. But at this stage I think that small stocks have already largely discounted that."
In other words, the best opportunities might be in funds investors have all but ignored in the last year.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT;
For 5 Retirement Portfolios, It Was a Quarter to Forget

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
THE battering of the financial markets left few money managers unscathed in the third quarter. Just ask the ones whose hypothetical retirement portfolios have been tracked by The New York Times for the last five years.
All five managers lost money, and they clearly were not alone: Only 150 of the 6,616 stock funds followed by Lipper Analytical Services, in Summit, N.J., had positive returns for the three months; on average, stock funds lost 14.82 percent. (Bond funds fared much better, with domestic long-term bond funds returning an average of 1.36 percent through Sept. 30, Lipper said. But fund portfolios for long-term goals like retirement are generally built on equities, which historically have returned more over time than bonds.) 
 For the five managers, the losses ranged from 9.86 percent for the "socially responsible" portfolio built by Jack A. Brill, a San Diego investment adviser, to 15.91 percent for Sheldon Jacobs, who edits The No-Load Fund Investor in Irvington, N.Y. Still, Mr. Jacobs remains in first place over all, with a cumulative return of 92.91 percent from July 7, 1993, when the contest began. (Mr. Brill is closing in, however, with a cumulative gain of 89.66 percent.)
In the third quarter, Mr. Brill was helped by his small holdings in bonds -- in the Vanguard GNMA fund, up nearly 3 percent, and Pax World, which lost just over 2 percent.
But that doesn't stop him from keeping a stock-heavy portfolio. "I still continue to think that over the long-term a retirement portfolio should have an asset allocation of 85 percent stocks and 15 percent bonds," he said, even though he does not expect market volatility to end soon.
"The market is still in for a very rough time over the next three to six months," he said. "It will probably continue these up-and-down bounces and generally move without much upward direction."
He is making just one change, adding Bridgeway Social Responsibility, a three-year-old large-cap blend fund that has outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index over the last year, and dropping Delaware Social Awareness, which returned just 2.9 percent in the last year and was down nearly 16 percent in the third quarter.
THE rough quarter provided a vindication of sorts for Harold Evensky, an investment adviser in Coral Gables, Fla. Mr. Evensky lagged behind the other advisers in the last quarter because his portfolio was not as concentrated as the others in large domestic stocks, the best performers until recently. With the collapse of those stocks in the third quarter, his portfolio took second place, despite its loss of 12.71 percent.
"Hallelujah! The benefit of diversification is finally showing its sweet little head," Mr. Evensky said. "Not much, but it's a start." He is making no changes in his portfolio.
One of his holdings, Barr Rosenberg Market Neutral, rose 1.8 percent. It was among just 3 of the 43 funds held by the advisers that made money in the quarter. (The other two were bond funds.) The fund aims to neutralize market volatility through a mix of long and short sales.
 In the long run, the five hypothetical portfolios continued to lag behind the popular Vanguard Index Trust 500, a portfolio designed to mimic the performance of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. The Index 500 has returned 157.2 percent since the contest began, compared with an average of just over 79 percent for the five advisers. And only Mr. Brill beat the Index 500 in the quarter; his loss of 9.86 percent was slightly better than its decline of 9.9 percent.
The performance of the five portfolios is tracked each quarter by Lipper Analytical. It excludes sales charges, transaction costs and taxes because most retirement money is held in tax-deferred accounts. The five managers can choose any fund open to new investors. From the outset, they were asked to pick portfolios that would grow for 20 years.
SUSAN DZIUBINSKI, editor of Morningstar Fund Investor, finished in third place for the quarter, with a loss of 15.55 percent. Her heavy portfolio holdings in value stocks, which tend to hold up better during market corrections, did not protect her during the third quarter, when the stocks with the highest price-to-earnings ratios were not necessarily hurt the most. Value funds, particularly the smaller ones, were hard-hit.
So she is adding a growth fund -- T. Rowe Price Mid-Cap Growth -- to offset her portfolio's value bias. The manager of the fund "likes growth," she said, "but he won't pay ridiculous prices for it."
To add that fund, Ms. Dziubinski is shaving her holdings in Third Avenue Value Small Cap and Ivy International.
Eric M. Kobren, president of the Kobren Insight Group in Wellesley, Mass., who finished fourth in the quarter, uses only Fidelity funds in his portfolio. He is concerned, he said, about a slowing economy and increasing volatility in the stock market.
As a result, he is doubling his position in a bond fund, Fidelity Spartan Government Income, to 20 percent of the portfolio. He is reducing his positions in Fidelity International Value and Fidelity Capital Appreciation.
IN last place for the quarter, Mr. Jacobs is making several changes to his portfolio. He is dropping the Mutual Discovery fund for several reasons: poor performance (it lost more than 19 percent in the quarter); the announcement by the manager, Michael Price, that he was leaving, and the fund's doubling in size over the last two years.
Mr. Jacobs is also dropping Hotchkis & Wiley Small Cap, which lost nearly 27 percent in the quarter. "I think small caps will continue to lag large caps the balance of the year because there will be greater tax-loss selling among small caps," he said.
He is adding to his positions in Marsico Focus, bringing it to 15 percent, from 10 percent, and Vanguard Total Stock Market, to 35 percent from 32.5 percent.
And he is creating a 12.5 percent position in the Vanguard Index Trust 500. "This gives my portfolio increased representation in the large-cap area," he said.

On Friday, the Bear Took a Holiday

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
After mauling the markets all week, especially technology, financial and small-capitalization issues, the bear took Friday off, allowing investors to go on a bargain-hunting spree amid optimism that interest rates would be cut further. 
 A rate cut could stimulate the economy, the Nasdaq composite index surged 74.11 points, or 5.17 percent, on Friday, to 1,492.49, but was still down 7.58 percent for the week. The Dow Jones industrial average rallied 167.61 points, or 2.1 percent, to 7,899.52, led by J.P. Morgan, which climbed 4 3/4, to 84 5/8. Friday's gain put the average up 105 points for the week and left it little changed for year.
 If there are surprises on the upside as corporate earnings reports begin to flow in this week, the bear could be sent back into hibernation. But disappointments could leave him on the prowl.
 Abby Joseph Cohen, chief stock market analyst for Goldman, Sachs, told clients that she saw no domestic recession, adding that corporate profits shoud rise, but less "than we originally expected."

 BODY:

THE AMERICAN CENTURY
 By Harold Evans with Gail Buckland and Kevin Baker.
 Illustrated. 710 pp. New York:
 Alfred A. Knopf. $50. 
 Harold Evans has set out to write what he calls "an accessible popular political history," and he has succeeded admirably. The thesis of "The American Century" is that this country's rise to power over the past hundred years has brought about its domination of the global economy and international politics. The results of that domination, Evans shows, have been notably mixed -- sometimes, as in the Cuban missile crisis, nearly catastrophic. In spite of America's repeated failures to live up to its own ideals, Evans argues, the ceaseless pursuit of these ideals has resulted in halting yet steady progress toward human rights at home and abroad.
This idea is not original, but the way it is presented is. Evans makes few claims to groundbreaking scholarship. Instead, with the help of a research team headed by Kevin Baker, he has culled a staggering amount of information from other history books. His innovation is his magisterial synthesis and seasoned analysis of this information.
Evans shows that this country's proud devotion to democracy has had contrasting results in different periods. In the 1930's, under Franklin Delano Roosevelt, it fostered a blinkered isolationism that allowed Germany and Japan to fan the flames of world war. The United States next nurtured a muscle-flexing, policemanlike mentality that led to repeated showdowns with nations of differing political ideologies, mainly the Soviet Union and China. This bullying zeal for democracy, he demonstrates, led to the disastrous escalation of the Vietnam War on the specious premise that if one small country fell to Communism, many others would quickly follow.
Jingoistic Americanism, Evans suggests, lay behind both the successes and the mistakes of several modern Presidents. In the Kennedy-Johnson era, it contributed to the Vietnam fiasco and the arms race, but it also brought significant movement toward full democratic rights for women and ethnic minorities. With Richard M. Nixon, it fed into a blind belief that the President, as the world's most powerful person, was somehow above the law. But it led as well to Nixon's democratic gestures toward our enemies, gestures which with Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan paved the way for detente and the collapse of Soviet-bloc Communism.
By summarizing a vast reach of history, Evans gives us a bird's-eye view of 20th-century people and events, leading us to ask constantly "What if?" What if the United States had become active in the League of Nations in 1920? Would it have then overcome its insular nationalism, which was partly responsible for World War II? And couldn't the war have been averted if Roosevelt had risen above his caution and got tough with Germany early on? What if J. Edgar Hoover, the longtime Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, had pursued the Mafia with the zeal that he hunted alleged Communists? Would not the power of the mob have been greatly curtailed? What would have been the outcome had Khrushchev not pulled his missiles out of Cuba when confronted by Kennedy? World War III?
Besides raising such questions, Evans puts to rest several myths. He shows that the stock market crash of 1929 was not the main trigger of the Great Depression, which resulted largely from other factors, including income disparity and the weak structure of banks. He argues convincingly that Japan would have surrendered without America's dropping the bomb.
Evans is adept at dispelling fabricated stories about plots and conspiracies. He dismantles the popular theory that Pearl Harbor was part of a secret plan by Roosevelt to inflame public opinion against Japan. Tersely trashing Senator Joseph R. McCarthy's Communist witch hunt, he writes, "He had nothing: no names, no Communists, no spies." After summarizing 35 years of speculation about alleged conspirators in the Kennedy assassination, he proves beyond reasonable doubt that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.
"The American Century" contains 900 photographs and dozens of other illustrations. Along with Gail Buckland, Evans has created a gallery of images striking in its variety and pungency, representative without being hackneyed. Presidents from William McKinley through George Bush are shown not in stiffly posed portraits but in a vivid range of photographs emphasizing their humanity and vulnerability. The polio-ravaged Roosevelt struggling to hoist himself out of a convertible, Nixon crying uncontrollably around the time of the Checkers speech, Lyndon Johnson conferring with advisers in a swimming pool, Jimmy Carter collapsing during a 10-kilometer race near Camp David, a weary Ronald Reagan on the phone at 2:45 A.M. ordering the invasion of Grenada -- these and many similar personal moments are captured in images that remind us of the ordinary side of America's leaders.
Equally striking are the book's pictures of average folk caught in socially resonant circumstances. The violence of labor conflict is depicted in a 1915 photograph of New Jersey oil refinery workers shooting at guards and in a 1937 montage of Henry Ford's thugs beating up union protesters. The misery of the Great Depression leaps from bleak pictures of abandoned farms and homeless migrants. Racial strife is repeatedly revisited in images ranging from an 1890 photograph of the heaped corpses of massacred Sioux Indians through a 1930 one of the suspended bodies of two lynched blacks to pictures of whites assaulting blacks with clubs and dogs during the 60's.
In most books, captions merely provide identification. In "The American Century" they are often miniature essays that supplement the main text. The caption with a picture of Calvin Coolidge at an exercise machine informs us, "Three times a day at the White House he rode an electrically operated artificial horse, whooping as he did." "Reproach: She was a student," begins a paragraph-long caption of a ghastly photograph of a Japanese girl whose face was burned off by the Hiroshima nuclear blast. In another caption we learn that J. Robert Oppenheimer, the developer of the atom bomb, knew many languages, including Sanskrit, and was a chain smoker given to self-loathing. Still others inform us that Eleanor Roosevelt considered sex "an ordeal to be borne" and that Ronald Reagan at the age of 29 posed in skivvies for a college art class making sculptures of a modern Adonis.
THE book also features statistical tables, historical chronologies and insets with historical asides. These informational segments, though not always smoothly integrated into the main narrative, contain a wealth of information. One table, entitled "Parallels: 1890-1990," is particularly suggestive. It tells us that in the century after 1890, life expectancy soared from 46.3 years to 71.8 years for men and from 48.3 years to 78.8 years for women. At the same time, the proportion of eligible voters who went to the polls sank from 74.7 percent to 55.2 percent, while the numbers of those belonging to organized religious bodies leapt from 34 percent to 63 percent. These facts lead to the perception of an American citizenry, possessed of increasing physical health but declining faith in the political process, seeking refuge in religion.
The downside of Evans's extensive use of tables, inserted biographies and the like is that it makes for choppy reading. But Evans does not expect most readers to peruse "The American Century" from cover to cover in a single sitting. As he explains in the preface, in creating what he calls a "history for browsers" he has organized the book as "self-contained 'modular' units, without runover, so that the casual reader can dip into any spread of pages and absorb what he or she chooses without having to begin at the beginning." Actually, the book's loose structure mirrors the texture of history itself, with its randomness and perpetual surprises. Besides, if the book cannot be easily swallowed whole, it can be savored in bits. Its individual chapters and subchapters are eminently readable, written in the liveliest historical prose I have come across in a long while.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY;
Microsoft Is Busy on Several Legal Fronts

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
Microsoft's legal department could keep a travel agent fully occupied these days. In addition to dispatching lawyers from Redmond, Wash., to Federal court in Washington, D.C., the company is currently defending itself against lawsuits filed by software companies in San Jose, Calif., Salt Lake City and Bridgeport, Conn.
Although Microsoft has said these three other suits are without merit, it has so far been notably unsuccessful in its efforts to have them dismissed or delayed -- or to have a change of venue to the presumably less burdensome and friendlier environs of Redmond. And the possibility exists that any evidence dug up in these corporate suits could reinforce the Government's case. 
 Whatever the differences among the three competitor suits, all make the same contention that lies at the heart of the Federal-state antitrust suit against Microsoft: they argue that the company has tried to use its dominance to forestall competition.
The oldest of these three pending suits was filed in July 1996 by Caldera Inc., of Orem, Utah, which sells DR-DOS, a competitor to Microsoft's MS-DOS, the operating system underlying Windows. The next, filed in October 1997, came from Sun Microsystems Inc., of Palo Alto, Calif., the creator of Java, a programming language. The most recent, filed in August, was brought by Bristol Technology Inc., of Danbury, Conn., which makes software tools that enable programs originally written to run on Windows to also run on other operating systems.
Like any large corporation, Microsoft over the years has been the subject of many legal actions. It has won some these -- notably in 1992, after years in court, when a judge ruled against Apple Computer Inc.'s claim that Microsoft's Windows software infringed on Macintosh copyrights. The software giant has lost some -- like tiny Stac Electronics Inc.'s 1994 claim for patent infringement, which resulted in Microsoft's settling the matter by buying a majority interest in Stac.
And Microsoft has settled others, most recently, for undisclosed terms, a licensing dispute with AT&T over access to the programming code underlying Microsoft's Windows NT software.
But it is the pending the suits by Caldera, Sun and Bristol that are most noteworthy right now because of their parallels with the Federal-state antitrust case.
Caldera filed its antitrust suit against Microsoft on July 24, 1996, the same day it completed the acquisition of the DR-DOS product from Novell Inc. (Novell had acquired the program's creator, Digital Research Inc., in 1991.) Although DR-DOS essentially duplicated the functions of MS-DOS, Microsoft could never challenge the product on legal grounds because MS-DOS itself was derived from CPM, an older operating system created by Digital Research.
Any chance for competition in desktop computing between MS-DOS and DR-DOS is now history. But Caldera officials see a market opportunity for DR-DOS in small hand-held devices, where their product competes with Microsoft's version of Windows for consumer-electronics products, called Windows CE. And Caldera's suit alleges that Microsoft used its market power to thwart sales of DR-DOS through unfair pricing practices and license agreements, as well as false statements and "vaporware" announcements suggesting that improved versions of MS-DOS were forthcoming.
"We felt as a smaller company we were in a unique position to bring the lawsuit forward," said Bryan Sparks, chief executive of Caldera, which is majority owned by Raymond J. Noorda, the former head of Novell. "We weren't beholden to Microsoft for anything," Mr. Sparks said, "so if they were to retaliate, they couldn't do much."
One of the more striking claims to come from Caldera's suit is the testimony leaked to the news media that is said to have been given in the deposition of Stefanie Reichel, a former Microsoft account manager in Germany. According to lawyers familiar with her testimony, Ms. Reichel's deposition alluded to the destruction and withholding of evidence that would have been relevant to the Justice Department's previous investigation of Microsoft, which the company settled in 1995.
At a hearing in Salt Lake City on Sept. 28, Microsoft requested that Caldera be served with a contempt order, claiming it was illegally sharing confidential information safeguarded by protective order. But Federal District Court Judge Ronald Boyce granted Caldera the right to attempt to substantiate Ms. Reichel's testimony. The Judge also denied Microsoft's request for a 120-day delay of the trial, which is scheduled to begin next June.
Microsoft contends that MS-DOS has been totally subsumed by the Windows 95 and Windows 98 operating systems and that any competitive issues with DR-DOS were covered in the 1995 Justice Department settlement. But Caldera officials assert that MS-DOS is alive and well and running under Windows 95 and 98 -- just as it did under earlier versions of Windows.
"We can run Windows 95 or 98 on top of DR-DOS; they are absolutely separable," Mr. Sparks said. "Windows 95 is essentially a walking antitrust violation because it ties together two products with no benefit to the consumer."
In the case of Sun Microsystems, which filed its suit on Oct. 7, 1997, the issue is breach of contract and false advertising, not antitrust. And yet, this suit, too, accuses Microsoft of anti-competitive behavior. Sun's suit, filed just two weeks before the Justice Department set in motion the legal events leading to the impending Government antitrust trial, stems from a license Sun granted to Microsoft in 1996 to use and distribute Java -- a Sun technology and programming language for use on the Internet. One of the key features of Java is that programs written with it are supposed to work with any operating system.
But Microsoft made modifications to the Java code that allows its version of Java to work only with Windows computers. In Sun's view, this Windows tailoring negates the cross-platform purpose of Java and violates the terms of Microsoft's license. Last March in San Jose, Federal Judge Ronald Whyte made an interim ruling in Sun's favor, issuing a preliminary injunction that forbids Microsoft from using a Java-compatible logo on its products.
Sun is now seeking to to block all Microsoft shipments of Java-based products that do not meet its compatibility tests. At a hearing in San Jose on Sept. 10, Sun's attorney, Lloyd (Rusty) Day, argued that Microsoft wanted "to kill cross-platform Java and grow the polluted Java market" by encouraging software developers to abandon its cross-platform ability.
Mr. Day focused his remarks on a Microsoft Java product called VJ++ 6.0, a new software "tool kit" for creating Java-based programs. VJ++ 6.0, he said, forces outside software developers to create Java programs that are "locked into the products that Microsoft alone distributes."
But Microsoft's lawyer, Karl Quackenbush, said the case was fundamentally about a contract, in which he said "Microsoft got broad rights to modify, adapt, create, derivative works of the technology."
Mr. Quackenbush said the features added to VJ++ 6.0 did not violate the licensing agreement because software developers were free to turn them off if they wished and to create Sun-standard Java programs with the product. "Maybe Sun wishes Microsoft would not have gone forward and made these enhancements," he said. "That doesn't mean it's a breach of contract."
The most recent suit alleging anti-competitive behavior against Microsoft came from Bristol, which filed on Aug. 18. The suit contends that Microsoft injured Bristol and the rest of the software industry through "predatory" control of the Windows application programming interfaces -- the bits of codes that outside programmers use to assure that their products will work properly with the Windows operating system.
At issue is Bristol's product Wind/U, a program that lets Windows programs run on computers that use the Unix operating system. Bristol executives said they had initially developed Wind/U without access to Microsoft application programming code, but modified it after Microsoft granted Bristol a license in 1994. Although Microsoft then publicly endorsed Bristol's products for several years, Bristol said Microsoft was now refusing to update the license to cover Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, Windows NT 5.0 and subsequent releases -- at least not under terms that Bristol says are technically or economically viable.
"I think that what happened was NT got this big share of the market, then Microsoft said now that we've got this foothold we no longer want people to run Windows applications on Unix," said Keith Blackwell, Bristol's president and chief executive.
Microsoft, however, says that Bristol's private antitrust suit, like the Government's case, is groundless. Jim Cullinan, a Microsoft spokesman, said Bristol had sought to license Windows NT 4.0 and 5.0 at the same terms as it paid for NT 3.0, even though the later programs are considerably larger.
"We thought negotiations were ongoing until Bristol filed this suit," Mr. Cullinan said, adding that Bristol's primary competitor, Mainsoft Inc., "has signed a contract accepting terms very similar to what we offered Bristol."
Bristol seeks an injunction, pending a trial, that would prevent Microsoft from blocking Bristol's access to Windows source code. A hearing in Bridgeport is scheduled for this Wednesday -- less than a week before Microsoft's trial is to begin in Washington next Monday.

Even as Microsoft gears up to defend itself against a Government antitrust lawsuit, the company is also facing three lawsuits from competitors.
 
COMPETITOR -- Caldera
ACCUSATION -- Predatory practices
Caldera says that Microsoft used its market muscle and unfair pricing practices and licensing agreements to thwart sales of DR-DOS, a computer operating system that competes with Microsoft's MS-DOS.
 
COMPETITOR -- Sun Microsystems
ACCUSATION -- Breach of contract
Sun says that after it allowed Microsoft to license its Java programming language, Microsoft made unauthorized modifications so that the software would work only on computers running Microsoft's Windows operating system.
 
COMPETITOR -- Bristol Technology
ACCUSATION -- Predatory control of the Windows programming code
Bristol licensed the Microsoft code for creating Windows programs so that Bristol's software, Wind/U, could enable programs to run on Unix systems. Now that Microsoft has a competitor to Unix, Windows NT, Bristol says that Microsoft has made it impossible to update the license.

A long-sought compromise to let high-technology companies hire more foreign workers has been derailed in the Senate, and infighting in the final hours of the 105th Congress is threatening final passage of two other cornerstones of the information-technology industry's legislative agenda.
Still in limbo as Congress's newest deadline for adjournment neared was a ban on Internet taxes and landmark legislation to protect copyrights in the digital age. 
 The breakdowns, late Friday, came just two days after industry leaders joined House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Republican leaders at a news conference in what turned out to be a premature celebration of the bills' passage.
"It does show that you cannot let up your guard," Marc Pearl, general counsel and senior vice president of government affairs for the Information Technology Association of America, said yesterday. "You must remain vigilant until the bill is signed. Until the measure you don't want is absolutely positively dead. You just can't let go."
Indeed, Andrew S. Grove, chief executive of the Intel Corporation, had foreshadowed the snags on Wednesday, when, appearing via video hookup at the Gingrich news conference, he told the speaker that, at Intel, an order is not complete until the product is shipped. "These bills haven't shipped yet," Mr. Grove said, "and I hope and trust that they do."
Mr. Gingrich replied that the bills were on their way to the loading dock. But time is now running out.
Congress was supposed to adjourn at midnight Friday. Budget disputes, however, forced an extension of that deadline until midnight Monday. And while House members are in a hurry to go home for campaign season, more extensions could be necessary.
For now, the only major information-technology bill that has actually passed is one involving Year 2000 liability, which encourages companies to share information about whether their computer systems are prepared to handle calendar dates beyond 1999, and about how any related problems can be fixed; the companies would be exempt from lawsuits that are based on the information they have disclosed.
Besides the Internet tax bills and the copyright measure, still pending are a half-dozen measures covering matters like Internet gambling, protection of children on the Internet and shielding technology companies from lawsuits based on their fluctuating stock prices.
"We are very concerned," Mr. Pearl said of the last-minute delays. "It is always difficult to predict what Congress will do when we are in this kind of breakneck speed to get into a recess. Sometimes good things fall through the cracks."
One of the victims, apparently, will be the bill sponsored by Senator Spencer Abraham, a Michigan Republican, to nearly double the number of visas available to highly skilled foreign professionals. Both the House and Senate had passed versions of the bill earlier this year, and a compromise was worked out with the White House last month.
But late Friday, a small group of senators blocked a final vote on the compromise measure, effectively killing it for this year. Opponents argue that the industry has exaggerated claims of a worker shortage so it can bring in cheaper foreign labor to keep wages down.
"The programming shortage never materialized," said Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat whose opposition helped blocked passage of the compromise measure. He noted that a number of high-technology companies have reported layoffs. "There is simply not the shortage that some say," Mr. Harkin said.
In the House, a dispute over the appointment of a former Democratic lawmaker to a key high-technology trade group delayed final passage of a comprehensive digital copyright bill.
That measure, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, would make it a crime to break through the technologies that secure digital copies of software, music and videos and literary works from Internet pirates. It was drafted to implement world treaties for protecting intellectual property on the Internet.
But lobbyists and congressional staffers said that Republican leaders yanked the copyright measure from the House calendar late last week, to express their outrage that Dave McCurdy, a former Democratic Representative from Oklahoma, had just been named to head the Electronic Industries Alliance, a lobbying group that has been involved in the copyright legislation.
"This piece of legislation should not be an issue that is subject to petty politics," Mr. Pearl said. "It has always been one that has had a global implication to it, one that is generally viewed as a tremendous beneficial step forward. So we are just hoping that the leadership will realize that before they pack it in."
Final passage of the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which would impose a three-year moratorium on any new state or local taxes on Internet commerce or access to the network, was threatened by disputes between House and Senate leaders over changes made to the bill in the Senate on Thursday.
The bill is considered crucial for the growth of electronic commerce. Without it, supporters say, there are more than 30,000 state and local taxing entities that could try and lay claim to transactions on the Internet.
 
Chart: "A Roll Call of Technology Bills"
The 105th Congress has been working on a number of bills of importance to the high-technology and Internet industries. But as the deadline for adjournment neared, some key issues remained unresolved. Here is the status of the main measures:
 
HAS PASSED
 
Y2K liability disclosure
Encourages companies to share information about methods of solving the Year 2000 computer problem by protecting them from lawsuits based on the information they disclose.
 
STILL PENDING
 
Digital copyright protection
Protects software, music and literary work on the Internet. The bill, which puts into effect worldwide agreements on digital copyrights, makes it illegal to circumvent technologies that protect digital works.
 
Internet Tax Freedom Act
Places a three-year moratorium on new state and local taxes on Internet commerce and Internet access until a commission studies whether, and how, to implement a uniform national tax structure.
 
Research development
Extends the research and development tax credit through February 2000.
 
Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act
Closes legal loopholes that had exposed many high-technology companies to frivolous securities litigation.
 
On-line privacy
Requires World Wide Web site operators to get parental permission before collecting any personal information from children under 13.
 
On-line pornography
One version would require commercial Web sites to restrict access to material deemed harmful to minors. Another would require schools and libraries that receive Federal funds to install software to filter out that type of material.
 
Internet gambling
Outlaws gambling on the Internet. The bill requires Internet service providers to block customer access to gambling sites.
 
SET ASIDE OR DEFEATED
 
H1-B visas
Raises the cap on visas for skilled foreign workers from 65,000 to 115,000 in 1999 and 2000 to relieve what the high-technology industry says is a critical shortage of technical workers.
 
Encryption
Although high-technology executives had identified it as their top priority, legislation to eliminate current Clinton Administration export controls on data-scrambling technology never made it to a vote.
 
Unsolicited commercial E-mail
The Senate passed a bill to regulate junk E-mail, but the House backed off, asking that the issue be studied further next year.

Translating a British Paperfor the U.S.

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
Almost every weekday morning, Jerri Wildrick pulls her gray van up to the headquarters of Berkshire Hathaway, and delivers a salmon-pink copy of The Financial Times destined for Warren E. Buffett, Berkshire's founder and the nation's best-known and richest investor.
Getting Mr. Buffett his paper means adding a 300-mile weekday round trip to the normal Chicago-area delivery routes. That extra effort is emblematic of Pearson P.L.C.'s, desire to make the year-old expansion of its flagship newspaper a success. The goal is to bring North American circulation up to 100,000 by the end of 1999 by marketing The Financial Times as the single-malt scotch of international financial journalism -- then to offer advertisers worldwide the lure of an American readership with a taste, and income, for the finer things. 
 But it may also show what a stretch it could be to pull this off. The audacious effort to push outward from the Financial Times's longtime beachheads in Washington and New York, the home base of The Wall Street Journal, was started a year ago. Now, measured against itself, The Financial Times -- known familiarly as the F.T. -- is doing quite well, thank you.
Spurred by substantial price cuts, the Financial Times's circulation in the United States and Canada has risen to nearly 60,000 from about 37,800 a year ago. (Of the 60,000 about 12,000 are distributed free by airlines or hotels.) Worldwide, the newspaper's circulation is about 354,000, and early this year, for the first time, it sold more copies outside Britain than on its own ground.
But measured against the Wall Street Journal's circulation of 1.8 million, The Financial Times is still a pipsqueak.
That, the Financial Times's editors say, is not the point. Look at the journalism, urged Robert Thomson, United States managing editor, who pointed out that some early warnings on the Asian financial crisis, including skeptical pieces on Thai lending policies ran in 1994, 1995 and 1996, when "tiger," not "meltdown," was the word most frequently used in discussions of Asian economies.
"President Clinton's speech last month about global problems and global solutions and a global summit -- that was an F.T. speech," said Richard Lambert, the newspaper's editor. "Those issues are what we're trying to address." Mr. Lambert spent the last year in New York helping guide the Financial Times's expansion in North America -- where it now has printing plants and distribution networks around New York, Chicago and Los Angeles -- before turning over control of United States coverage to Mr. Thomson.
"We only have a small portion of the niche we're after -- business people, policy makers and academics interested in international business," Mr. Lambert said. While the weekday editions and the expanded Saturday newspaper, with its wide-ranging political and cultural coverage, are read by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan and people on Wall Street like Robert Hormats, a vice president at Goldman, Sachs & Company, the editors want more.
In some regions of the world, The Financial Times is struggling. In Asia, where The Journal started an Asian edition in 1976, it outsells the Financial Times 59,000 to 14,000, a 4-to-1 margin. But in Continental Europe, The Financial Times outsells the Journal 102,000 to 54,000. Still, in both continental Europe and Asia, the Journal fields more full-time reporters.
In the United States, where The Financial Times first began printing a North American edition in 1985, the newspaper has doubled its reporting staff in the last year and will soon add bureaus in Houston and Atlanta. But the new total is just 22 reporters, compared with several hundred at The Journal.
Limited staff resources can push newspapers to mimic wire services, with reporters writing two or three stories daily. Mr. Thomson is putting more emphasis on longer-term reports. "A story done well that is original, that nobody sees anywhere else, is far more valuable than two or three ordinary stories," he said in an interview last week.
With an eye to offering an alternative to the news judgment of American-based publications, the editors of the Financial Times's American edition have recently played down their coverage of the Clinton-Lewinsky affair. Some subjects that are barely mentioned elsewhere, like the Chinese central bank's decision last week to shut down one of the country's largest financial institutions, received front-page display in The Financial Times.
Mr. Thomson acknowledges that the built-in difficulties of remaking his newspaper's American editions for an American audience inevitably conflict with the daily push to get presses rolling. It is hard, he said, to get London-based editors to think like Americans.
Marjorie Scardino, the Texas-born chief executive of Pearson, is widely credited with making The Economist magazine a should-read among Americans with an interest in foreign affairs. It is the success she achieved as chief executive of the Economist Group -- which is 50 percent owned by Pearson -- that Financial Times executives hope to emulate, although a newspaper with daily deadlines faces different challenges than a glossy weekly magazine.
The 1997 Pearson annual report says that the company committed more than $25 million to the international expansion of The Financial Times, which began publication in Britain in 1894. Last year's expenditures were the first portion of a $160 million investment. Thus far in 1998, advertising revenues have increased to more than $1 million, from $600,000 in all of 1997.
But the same financial troubles that The Financial Times has covered, from Thailand to Japan and from Russia to Brazil, may torpedo its plans for growth. A year ago, it cut its American street price to $1, from $1.50, and its annual subscription price to $184 for an introductory one-year offer (the cost doubles on renewal), from about $450. Even so, with profits falling on Wall Street, will financial institutions like Merrill Lynch, Bankers Trust and others be able to justify pricey reading material for their executives?
"There is an audience of people who will undeniably buy The Financial Times," said Karen Elliott House, the president of Dow Jones's International Group. "But the audience for all that British news in the F.T. and the rest of their global news is limited."
But if compared to The Journal, the Financial Times seems a mouse scurrying at the feet of an elephant, it is a mouse with attitude. While Ms. House, a former foreign editor of The Journal, notes, "We print a ton of international news," Mr. Thomson coolly replies: "We'll never go head to head with The Wall Street Journal in covering U.S. corporate news. Because we're a global business newspaper, we are selective. People want a guide to the international events that matter."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY;
Microsoft Memo Offers A Glimpse Of Gates 2.0

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
The Federal Government and the Microsoft Corporation may be nearing a historic antitrust showdown. But William H. Gates, the man who co-founded Microsoft, has largely disengaged himself from the company's legal defense to concentrate on new ways to extend the world's largest independent software company's influence into the next century.
And instead of a corporation struggling to stay a step ahead of technological obsolesence -- the argument with which he has tended to rebut his anti-monopolist critics in recent years -- Mr. Gates boasts in a recent memo to his staff that Microsoft's position in the computer industry is stronger than it has ever been. 
 In fact, the memo contends, one of the company's biggest challenges will be finding ways to continue motivating employees who in many cases are so wealthy from their Microsoft stock that they no longer have an economic need to work.
The 14-page, single-spaced memo -- whose title, "The Era Ahead" evokes his 1995 best-selling book, "The Road Ahead" -- spells out the main opportunities and threats that Mr. Gates sees for Microsoft in the next five years.
Still, in many ways, the future according to Bill Gates looks very much like the present.
The personal computer, in his view, will remain the main business and technology platform from which Microsoft stretches upward toward the province of big mainframe systems, while reaching downward into the realm of hand-held consumer-electronics devices.
And the Internet will continue to provide the ties that bind these various products into a Microsoftian whole -- but only, the memo warns, if the company continues to ward off the threats posed by the perceived nemeses of I.B.M., Netscape Communications, Oracle and Sun Microsystems, all of which the memo cites by name.
Distributed within the company in early September, the memo was supplied to The New York Times last week by Microsoft on the condition that it not be quoted directly. Mr. Gates declined to be interviewed for this article. The memo's release, presumably, was meant to demonstrate that he is concentrating on Microsoft the business enterprise even while the Justice Department is intent on exposing Microsoft as a marauding monopolist.
Yet the memo implicitly also provides further indication that Mr. Gates, who at 42 years old is possibly the world's richest man, is withdrawing from operational management of Microsoft to return to his programmer-geek roots and become the company's chief technologist.
It is a personal and professional transition that became evident in July when he gave the position of president to his longtime friend and colleague, Steven A. Ballmer, who now shares most day-to-day responsibilities with the company's chief operating officer, Robert J. Herbold.
"This is vintage Microsoft and vintage Bill Gates," Mr. Herbold said in an interview last week. "It's all about the core issue for Microsoft, which is developing product."
Mr. Herbold said that the responsibilities Mr. Gates had turned over include mundane tasks like the mid-year review of the budget. "Guess what," Mr. Herbold said drily. "Steve Ballmer and I can handle that."
Before July, according to colleagues of Mr. Gates who spoke on condition of anonymity, he had been showing signs of increasing job stress, as Microsoft's battles with the Justice Department and several state attorneys general appeared to overshadow the company's focus on product development and marketing.
In a get-away-from-it-all restorative he prescribed for himself, Mr. Gates, after deputizing Mr. Ballmer, took a summer vacation with friends who included Warren E. Buffett and William Randolph Hearst 3d and activities that included glacier watching by boat near Juneau, Alaska, and a train trip through the Pacific Northwest.
"The fun-to-work ratio for Bill is going up," said a Microsoft executive, one of several who noted that Mr. Gates seems more relaxed lately than he has in years.
And yet, the pace of his work does not seem to have slowed much.
Last week, for example, he spoke at industry gatherings in San Diego and Denver and he recently traveled to Europe to speak at industry events and visit Microsoft customers. Back at corporate headquarters in Redmond, Wash., he still schedules meetings at his executive offices from 9 A.M. to 7 P.M., colleagues said.
And while his September memo presents a deeply confident view of the company's competitive status, Mr. Gates also voices dissatisfactions in it that have been part of the Microsoft litany for nearly two decades.
As early as 1981, Mr. Gates's stated corporate quests included the development of software that was simpler to use. He is now making that a top priority, to deflect growing criticism that as Microsoft has added supposedly beneficial features to its software, the products are increasingly awkward.
True, he places much of the blame on the software that other companies produce for use with Microsoft's Windows operating system. But he directs his own company to solve this problem by writing more rigid programming rules and guidelines for outside software developers.
Along with this implicit charge to his engineers to bring the industry to heel, there are also hints at future industry clashes. Mr. Gates's memo, for example, describes a new service that may be introduced as Windows Tone, or Wintone -- a computing analogy to the concept of a telephone dial tone. Sun Microsystems has already introduced a similar concept, one based on its so-called Jini software, which is designed to enable different hardware devices to communicate over the Internet.
As Mr. Gates sees the future, Wintone will assign Microsoft the job of managing PC data over the Internet, which will allow for automatic backup of that data on network storage computers while at the same time employing the Internet to provide automatic updates of the software on users' own machines.
To create accessible network "storage lockers" for this vast amount of data, Mr. Gates describes a new system to be called Megaserver, which will provide computer users with access to their personal information and electronic mail wherever they have an Internet connection.
He also notes that in the future the operating system -- the basic command-and-control software of a computer -- will play an increasing role in protecting intellectual property from data piracy by tracking the use of information and preventing illicit copying.
Perhaps the most significant revelation, in light of a Government lawsuit that posits the monolithic dominance of Windows, is the memo's grumblings about the operating system's various technical shortcomings. He also notes that programs to remove Windows are among the best-selling PC software products and cites that fact as evidence of a fundamental failure by Microsoft to keep its customers satisfied.
Mr. Gates also discusses, even if he seems to gloss over them, the competitive threats to Microsoft that are coming from outside the personal computer industry.
He writes, for example, that a recent agreement involving the three leading wireless telephone makers -- Ericsson, Motorola and Nokia -- and Psion, a small British developer of software for hand-held devices, represents serious competition. And yet he appears to believe that the company's Windows-based Win CE operating system, which is beginning to appear on a variety of information appliances, will stave off the threat the agreement might pose.
At the end of his memo, Mr. Gates calls for the help of his Microsoft colleagues in meeting the challenges he spells out. He alludes to the sense of privilege he feels in being part of the positive impact he says the company's effort will have on the way people work, learn and communicate. He even suggests a source of further reading, a Web site on Microsoft's internal network.
But nowhere in the 10,000-word tome does he mention the one external force that could alter Microsoft's future more fundamentally than the forays of any software competitor: the Federal antitrust trial scheduled to begin in Washington a week from today.
Then again, this is the new, less-engaged, more geeky Bill Gates, who leaves such vexations to his operational subordinates.
"He's not preoccupied with the legal case," Mr. Herbold said of Mr. Gates. Referring to the company's general counsel, Mr. Herbold added that "Bill Neukom will tell us when we need his input."

HEADLINE: Voskresensk Journal;
Russia's Factories, Prey of Bankers, Rust Away

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

DATELINE: VOSKRESENSK, Russia

 BODY:
Slender birch trees, their leaves turning gold and orange in the early autumn air, line roads leading to this humble, fraying town about 50 miles southeast of Moscow.
But closer to Voskresensk, the fresh country air turns acrid with the noxious odor of fumes belched from smokestacks atop one of Russia's largest fertilizer plants. 
 Menatep, a Moscow bank that is now insolvent, bought the decrepit plant in 1995 and was supposed to modernize it, bringing it into the vanguard of a march into modern capitalism. But little has changed.
"I've worked here a long time, and it's never gotten better no matter who owns it," said Vasily Yevdokimov, 70, a machinist who has worked at the plant, now know as the Voskresenskiye Joint Stock Company, for 50 years. "They haven't spent anything renovating this factory."
There are legions of workers across Russia who can make the same claim.
When Russia began a vast selloff of formerly state-owned companies three years ago, Russian banks were among the biggest buyers. Today, there is little evidence to suggest that banks did anything other than use the factories to fill their own coffers. Indeed, many in Russia suspect that more money was taken out of the companies than was ever put in.
Modernizing Russia's antiquated industrial base is in fact a Herculean task. Many factories are too outmoded and have long since passed the point of becoming profitable. And decades of state subsidies for workers and their families in factory towns cannot be undone without creating wrenching social problems.
Even so, Russian banks accepted these challenges when they began buying the factories, and Voskresensk, a town of about 150,000, offers one example of the human impact of this squandered opportunity.
"Sometimes I visit my friends working there, and it's gotten much worse since I left," said Aleksandr Devyatkin, who worked at the fertilizer plant from 1994 to 1996 and is now a local fireman. "The air was very polluted and it was very hard to breathe. Acid was everywhere. I think you make a lot of money if you own the factory but not if you work there."
Menatep, and Mikhail Khodorkovsky, chairman of Rosprom, the holding company that controls the bank, declined repeated interview requests. The management of the fertilizer plant refused requests for a tour.
Voskresensk is a well-known hockey town, and residents proudly remind visitors that Igor Larionov left here to become a star center for the Detroit Red Wings. When Menatep bought the fertilizer plant, it also got the title to Khimik, the local hockey team. An outwardly impressive hockey stadium dominates the center of town and residents' social calendars.
But Khimik is struggling from a lack of funds. Inside the hockey stadium, above large, colorful murals depicting the team in action, tiles are peeling away from the ceiling and pockmarks are visible in the roof.
"This is the only thing in town that we take pride in," said Vladimir Vasilyev, the hockey team's coach. "There is nothing to be proud of about the chemical plant. The most important thing in Russia now is to be paid, and the plant is hardly paying people anything."
Mr. Yevdokimov, the machinist, said the average salary at the fertilizer factory is the equivalent of about $100 a month, although he said he is paid about $47 a month. Or at least that was what he was once paid. Mr. Yevdokimov said his wages are now a month overdue.
He also said that about 50 percent of the plant's 5,000 workers had been laid off since Russia's economic crisis began in mid-August, a much larger number than the town's elders acknowledge.
Yevgeny Simonov, Voskresensk's Mayor, said that only about 100 people had been laid off from the plant. He enthusiastically distributes a brochure published by the fertilizer plant. The leaflet shares the Mayor's rosy outlook, noting that the factory houses "remarkable imported equipment and state-of-the-art technologies."
Yet while Mr. Simonov notes that a French company took over a nearby concrete factory and made great strides modernizing it, he is hard pressed to offer comparable examples of how the Voskresenskiye plant has been upgraded. Indeed, Mr. Simonov eventually became angered by repeated requests for a tour of the plant and hustled visitors out of his office.
But walks around the outside of the sprawling factory, and interviews with residents of Voskresensk, indicate that there is very little that is state of the art about the plant. Large parts of its superstructure are rusting and some heavy equipment visible through the gates looks as if it has been idle for a long time.
"Things are very hard because of the ruble's collapse and now fewer people are working at the factory," said Yevgeny Ovsyankin, another local fireman who knows workers at the plant. "It is not an up-to-date factory. It has lots of problems."
Now, with most of the country's largest banks insolvent and the overall economy in tatters, it is unlikely that Russia will have the resources it needs to do anything with its sagging factories and the towns they anchor. Russians have a well-known ability to endure both disappointment and hardship, and few of them seem surprised that the country's factories were poorly served by the banks that still own them. After all, many Russians note, there is very little they can do about it anyway.
"Menatep was supposed to invest money in the plant, but they took money out of it," said Vladimir Petrov, who sells construction materials in Voskresensk. "But what can we do? We can't force them to give the money back."

HEADLINE: Gustavo Petricioli, 70, Mexico's Ex-Envoy

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Oct. 11

 BODY:
Gustavo Petricioli Iturbide, who served as Mexico's Treasury Secretary during the debt crisis of the 1980's and who was later Ambassador to the United States, died on Saturday. He was 70.
Mr. Petricioli died of a heart attack in Los Angeles Hospital in Mexico City, the official news agency Notimex reported. 
 President Miguel de la Madrid appointed Mr. Petricioli the Treasury Secretary in June 1986. At that time, Mexico's foreign debt was near $100 billion, largely as a result of the collapse of oil prices at the start of the decade.
He served as Ambassador to the United States from January 1989 to January 1993 during the Administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari as Mexico negotiated the restructuring of its debt.
During that period, Mexico also began negotiations with the United States and Canada on the North American Free Trade Agreement, which went into operation on Jan. 1, 1994.
Mr. Petricioli, who received a master's degree from Yale University, had also held positions at the Nacional Financiera development bank and the Bank of Mexico.
He is survived by his mother and by four children.

HEADLINE: A Politician Stands Accused as Villain in South Korea's Economic Disaster

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea

 BODY:
Kang Kyong Shik used to have this nation at his fingertips, and as Deputy Prime Minister and a renowned economic planner he enjoyed influence and glory that seemed able to take him anywhere.
They did -- to prison. After South Korea's economic collapse late last year, the country turned angrily on its top economic officials, and Mr. Kang was arrested for economic mismanagement and neglect of duty. Now he is on trial, facing the possibility of many years in jail. 
 Mr. Kang, 62, released on bail in September, is a broken man. Puzzled by the country's ire, and deeply hurt by it, Mr. Kang has spent many days asking God why he is being vilified for what he remembers as the most hectic and productive eight and a half months of his public service life.
"People are fingering me; it's very convenient for them," said Mr. Kang, his voice measured and filled with resignation as he spoke in his fluent English. "I lived through those times, anyhow. And I still succeeded in keeping my health."
Mr. Kang's trial underscores not only the depth of suffering and anger in South Korea, as it struggles to comprehend how a miracle economy faltered, but also the efforts of a young democracy to figure out how to apply the rule of law, even to its leaders. It would be difficult to imagine an American Cabinet official going on trial for policy failures, but South Korea has already sent two former Presidents to jail for corruption and is reluctant to accept excuses for catastrophes.
So prosecutors have charged Mr. Kang on several counts, focusing on neglect of duty while he ran Korea's economy but also including abuse of power, for pressuring a bank to lend to his friends. South Koreans seem to feel overwhelmingly that Mr. Kang is partly responsible for the country's pain and that he should bear the penalty.
"We think that we could have escaped economic disaster if the then-Government had had the right direction, made the right decisions in the economic crisis," said Chung Dong Young, the spokesman for the governing National Congress for New Politics. He insisted that it was appropriate for Mr. Kang to be tried.
Newspaper editorials have excoriated him, unemployed workers blame him for their predicament and even scholars argue that the nation's elite bureaucrats -- long protected and insulated from insult and injury -- should be held more accountable for their actions.
Kim In Ho, the former chief economic secretary to the President, is facing similar criminal charges.
"Kim Dae Jung inherited a very difficult situation," Mr. Kang said, referring to the new President, who took office in February. "It's quite natural he should find someone to blame for the economic situation."
Mr. Kang, a solid man who is very subdued these days, asked that this interview be held in his office in the National Assembly. He said it was the first time in many months that he had come to his office, and he wore a somber black suit, a drastic change from the blue uniform, with No. 1199 sewn onto it, that he wore for 110 days in prison.
He had his own cell, and his wife, Cho Sam Jin, 58, brought him books every day -- gifts of food were not allowed -- and took his laundry to spare him the task of having to wash it himself.
During those dreary days, Mr. Kang says, he pored over economic literature to see if scholars believed that Korea's economic crisis was the result of his actions. He says he was deeply relieved that experts did not seem to blame him.
Still, many Koreans say he lied to the nation, painting a picture of a basically healthy economy just as it was falling apart beneath him. Some say that he delayed confronting the problems and seeking help in part to improve the prospects that his party would win the presidential elections last December.
If that was his intention, it failed. He was fired in late November as the economy continued to sink, and in December South Korea reached agreement on a $58 billion economic rescue package from the International Monetary Fund. Partly as a result, Mr. Kang's party lost power and Kim Dae Jung became the first Korean opposition leader to be elected President.
"Koreans feel that he deceived the public by telling them that Korea would not have to go to the I.M.F., even though he knew clearly then that Korea was headed that way," said Hwang Joo Hwan, a 36-year-old advertising account executive.
For some, though, putting Mr. Kang and Mr. Kim on trial sets a frightening precedent and could potentially inhibit policy makers. Others say that some compromise should be attempted.
"I am very much perplexed," said Moon Chung In, a politics professor at Yonsei University. "We've got to see bureaucrats held accountable, so this sends a very good political signal. But on the other hand, was it fair to arrest him and put him in jail?"
As for Mr. Kang, one of his frustrations is that the focus on him and Kim In Ho is drawing attention away from tackling the reforms needed in the economy, and he worries that very little political effort seems to be going in that direction.
"If I go through these difficulties and we go to the right track, then I'll accept the difficulties," Mr. Kang said. "This is the most frustrating to me. Even though I have a hard time, this difficulty is not contributing to the good of the future economy. It's only a waste."

HEADLINE: A Win-Win on Housing

 BODY:
Ever since the Republicans took control of Congress, the new majority has struggled with the Clinton Administration over the issue of low-income housing. Last week the two sides came together and passed a measure that blends conservative and liberal concerns. It is a major achievement for both the Administration and Congress.
Republicans have long wanted to give low-income working people a greater share of subsidized housing, while Democrats wanted to favor the poorest of the poor, who have no resources to obtain shelter at market rates. Both sides had a point. Housing projects need to include stable families with working adults who can serve as role models for other residents. When homelessness exploded in the 1980's, too many apartments in some projects were turned over to extremely indigent families, tipping the community balance. 
 But the Republicans' proposed solutions went too far. One particularly bad idea was to change the income mix eligible for rent subsidy vouchers, a program that does not suffer from the same problems as traditional housing projects. Unlike public housing residents, who live in a closed community, people who receive the vouchers are dispersed throughout the private housing market. To the delight of housing advocates, the final bill creates 90,000 much-needed new vouchers and requires that 75 percent go to the poorest of the poor. The bill relaxes some of the income limits for housing projects to make room for more of the working poor, although many units must still be reserved for the very poor. In New York City, 40 percent of project residents would have to have incomes at or below $15,000, but other residents would be able to make up to $40,150.
Other compromises were equally sensible. The Republicans got concessions aimed at rewarding effort, including very modest community service requirements. Democrats got additional controls to make sure that allowing more high-income families does not lead to racial or economic segregation. The bill bows to the animal lobby's demand that all public housing residents be allowed to keep animals, but officials in cities like New York, where vicious dogs have long terrorized residents of some large projects, will now apparently be able to impose reasonable restrictions.
Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo and Representative Rick Lazio of Long Island, the Republican point man on housing issues, have represented two poles in this long struggle. This bill is a win for both men. Mr. Cuomo, and his predecessor Henry Cisneros, have given what was known as the Federal Government's worst-run bureaucracy some credibility with Congress. Mr. Lazio has finally won his long battle to make public housing a bipartisan issue. While some Republicans will always have an ideological objection to Federal housing subsidies, Mr. Lazio has always argued that many others can be brought around, once they are convinced that the system is well run and aimed at encouraging self-sufficiency. We believe he is right, and this bill may be a big step in that direction.

Shattering Shibboleths

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Let's cut to impeachment's chase.
Impeachment myth No. 1: Congress will never vote to impeach or remove a President in the teeth of opinion polls. 
 Reality: Here comes the impeachment election. If Democrats take the House, Clinton's conduct is effectively condoned. Contrariwise, if Republican majorities grow, that vote would stand as the voice of the people no matter what opinion polls show.
2. The shortened attention span of the American people dictates Henry Hyde's "New Year's Resolution" -- hasty hearings and a snap decision from this Congress this year.
No Thanksgiving break? No Christmas? This sordid story is hungry for heroes, and as Congress provides new household names, a new cast of characters -- white hats as well as villains -- will achieve fame and fascinate us all. The civic debate should become more elevated and less prurient as weighty constitutional issues unfold on television.
3. The Judiciary Committee will limit itself to digesting and acting upon only the evidence submitted so far by the Independent Counsel.
A Republican House ignoring new information about abuses of power in Travelgate and Filegate and obstruction in Whitewater? A newly expanded Judiciary staff refusing to examine evidence of bribery (a most impeachable offense) in illegal campaign fund-raising from Asia? C'mon.
4. People are tired of lies about sex and want to move on.
That may be what people say while transfixed by the drama of egregious misconduct at the top. Sex perjury by itself may not be cause enough to remove a President, but abuses add up, and the prospect of Jane Doe No. 5 or Intern No. 2 or some other "harassed from the past" gives Democrats the Willeys.
5. Democrats will call Ken Starr as a witness and turn hearings into a circus investigating the investigator.
The maligned Independent Counsel may turn out to be a cool, persuasive witness and not a priggish Savonarola. Monica may exhibit unexpected dignity. And if prosecutor and chief witness are called before Congress, why not the grand jury forewoman -- on the theory that seeking truth about a potential Presidential conspirator takes precedence over indictments?
6. The simple pleasures of Monicagate can't hold a candle to the serious abuses of Watergate.
That's because we've only just begun. Watergate is remembered for Nixon's cover-up that came to light long after a break-in he knew nothing about. Starr has much to report or miscreants to indict after Nov. 3. The committee has not yet started taking depositions, and Clinton cannot claim privilege for aides like Lindsey and Blumenthal, or his lawyers' hired privacy-penetrators Terry Lenzner and Jack Palladino, without adding fuel to the impeachment fires.
7. Democrats will easily find 34 loyalist votes in the Senate to resist removal in the spring.
The most ominous sentence of last week came from the veteran Democratic Senator Robert Byrd, leading preserver of the legislative branch's prerogatives. After Clintonites foolishly tried to assemble 34 senatorial signatures to prejudge and moot a House impeachment inquiry, he warned: "Don't tamper with this jury." On constitutional matters, Byrd has a small but respectful Democratic following in the Senate club; they are not in anybody's bag.
8. With Asia and Russia in economic turmoil, refugees about to freeze in Kosovo and Saddam building weapons while thumbing his nose at the U.N., we cannot afford the distraction of firing our reckless leader.
A superpower should be able to walk and chew up a President at the same time. Turn the myth on its head: Mr. Clinton, who studiously avoided dealing with these crises before the impeachment inquiry, may finally have an incentive to address them -- if only to look Presidential. Advocates of his ouster will support him -- if only to appear nonpartisan.
9. Cool heads will prevail to levy punishment short of removal.
Congress may cluck-cluck at, but is forbidden to punish, a nonmember. Clinton, who still thinks he can deny his way out of anything, will not further weaken the Presidency by bargaining for extra-constitutional humiliation. He stands ready, to his credit, to take his chances on a Senate trial. If he loses, he will gain what he has sought all his life: a unique and indelible place in American history.

HEADLINE: Beijing-Taiwan Talks: Intimate Rivals to Meet

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: XIAMEN, China, Oct. 10

 BODY:
From the bluffs along the edge of this booming Chinese city, you can easily peer into Taiwan's western frontier, a small island only half a mile away.
From the early 1950's to 1979, artillery here ritually pounded the nearby islands of Jinmen, known in the West as Quemoy, and other locations. 
 On these same bluffs today stand giant red characters that repeat, for the benefit of nearby islanders who might gaze west with binoculars, China's proposal for luring "renegade" Taiwan back into the fold: "One Country, Two Systems to Reunify China."
Across the water Taiwan, in response, has put up a huge white billboard calling for reunification according to the "Three People's Principles" propounded early this century by the founder of the Republic of China, Sun Yat-sen: nationalism, democracy and better livelihood.
The dueling signs, erected last year, express the continuing test of wills between China and Taiwan -- a struggle that will enter a new phase on Wednesday with the first high-level contact in five years between the two sides.
Although Taiwan and China these days exchange symbolic gestures, even smiles, rather than artillery shots, the visit of a senior Taiwan official to Shanghai and Beijing is so sensitive that the two sides have not publicly agreed on what they will discuss.
Wary officials on Taiwan insist on calling this "a visit, not talks." They may agree on little more than to talk again in the future. But because the stakes are so high, people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, and in Washington, will be scrutinizing every inflection.
China sees recovering sovereignty over Taiwan as the unfinished business of the civil war that brought Communist victory on the mainland in 1949. China ceaselessly calls the recovery of Taiwan its overriding foreign policy goal.
Taiwan, which has created prosperity and democracy, no longer claims, as it once did, to house the true government of all China. More and more, its 22 million people say they feel an independent identity.
Taiwan's leaders, mindful of the glowering colossus nearby, still profess to want reunification -- some day far in the future, when China, too, is prosperous and democratic. For now they insist that China and the world must recognize Taiwan as a separate entity.
In a typical speech on Saturday, the President of Taiwan, Lee Teng-hui, called for a "gradualist approach" toward unity.
"We are looking forward to constructive dialogue between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait based on the reality of divided rule," he said, promising continued efforts to break free of the diplomatic strangulation pursued by Beijing.
Visiting China from Oct. 14 to 19 will be Koo Chen-fu, head of the semiofficial Straits Exchange Foundation. He is to meet with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Daohan, head of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait. In what is seen as a good-will gesture by Beijing, Mr. Koo is also to meet the Chinese President, Jiang Zemin, on Oct. 18.
Mr. Koo and Mr. Wang held their first, and only, official talks in Singapore in 1993. Their next scheduled meeting, in 1995, was canceled by China when it was angered by President Lee's visit to a class reunion at Cornell University, seen as a perfidious effort to bolster Taiwan's independent status.
The next year, relations became more tense when China conducted missile tests near Taiwan during the island's presidential election and the United States sent aircraft carriers into the region.
Since then the United States, worried about being dragged into a conflict, has encouraged both sides to resume talks.
Despite their diverging goals, both sides may feel that their interests are served by meeting, said a Western diplomat in Beijing. "For Taiwan, if China is talking it's not attacking, and for China, if Taiwan is talking then it's not declaring independence," the diplomat said.
China has called for immediate discussions of the political future, offering a deal looser than Hong Kong's in which Taiwan could keep its democracy and even its army but come under Chinese sovereignty. Taiwan wants to fend off political negotiations, limiting talks for now to practical issues like fishing and immigration disputes.
Complicating the matter, China and Taiwan are increasingly intertwined economically and socially, a process China encourages and Taiwan is struggling to limit.
The ties are apparent here in Xiamen, one of China's thriving "special economic zones" that is host to many Taiwan factories, real estate developments and tourists.
In the last few days, among hundreds of visiting "compatriots," as they are always called here, were 24 members of a Taipei golf club who came to play Xiamen's three golf courses and sightsee. Also visiting, at the invitation of the Elders' Society of Xiamen, were 21 men and women from a Taiwan senior citizens' group, who are performing folk songs and dances in several cities.
More than a million business executives and tourists from Taiwan visit China each year, and some 50,000 live here, the Western diplomat said. In contrast, Taiwan strictly limits visitors from the mainland.
Taiwan's investment and trade in the mainland are large and climbing, even as its Government tries to enforce its slogan of "Go slow; be patient."
The Taiwan Government has refused to allow large, showcase investments like multibillion-dollar petrochemical and power projects in Fujian Province that were planned by the giant Formosa Plastics Group.
Many Taiwan businesses are chafing at the policy, and the Formosa Group's chairman, Wang Yung-ching, has publicly urged his Government to relax it. "We fear we will lose our opportunity" in China, he said in a recent speech.
Most important, Taiwan does not allow direct transportation, postal or communications links with the mainland. This slows cross-strait business by adding costs and forces travelers to spend hundreds of extra dollars looping through Hong Kong or Macao.
Capt. Yao Ming-fu of the Taiwan-owned ship Uni-Pioneer, in Xiamen harbor this weekend to pick up cargo that will eventually go to Japan or Southeast Asia, expressed the frustrations of shippers and businessmen.
Taking goods directly from here to Taiwan's main harbor takes about 12 hours, he said. But his ship can only carry Chinese-made goods for reshipment onward; none can be imported into Taiwan.
Transporting Chinese goods to Taiwan itself requires a 24-hour boat trip to Hong Kong, some bothersome paperwork, then another 14-hour journey to Taiwan, said Captain Yao. His parent company, the Evergreen Group, is one of the world's largest shippers.
Taiwan officials have not been able to contain small-scale direct commerce in both directions among islands around Xiamen, and people from Taiwan even make one- to five-day visits across these waters, say local press reports and scholars.
How long this strange dance between China and Taiwan can continue is unknown. China has warned that if Taiwan formally declares independence, it will mount a military attack -- a regional catastrophe. Short of such a declaration, what action by Taiwan might touch off a harsh response? How long will China's patience hold?
Major agreement in the next three to five years seems unlikely, Fan Xihou, director of the Taiwan Research Institute of Xiamen University, said in an interview. But after that, he suggested, "time will be against Taiwan" as China's military and economic strength builds.
Taiwan, for its part, hopes that it can continue mustering enough strength at home and abroad to shape the terms of its future relationship with the would-be motherland.

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Leader Tries To Cope With the Crisis

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Oct. 11

 BODY:
After a year of economic despair, relentless criticism and growing doubts about his leadership, Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, finally got a break last week.
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, making his first visit here since this former British colony reverted to China, praised Mr. Tung for how steadily he was leading Hong Kong through the Asian financial crisis. 
 That the chief executive's most prominent defender these days is the former colonial ruler of this territory must be cold comfort to Mr. Tung, 61, a former shipping tycoon who took over Hong Kong when it was the pulsing heart of the Asian economy and has watched as it has gone into cardiac arrest.
"Am I frustrated?" asked Mr. Tung in a rare interview on Friday. "At times, I would say. But the important thing is to zero in on the things you can do and also zero in on the long-term perspective, because the turmoil will be over."
As if to underscore his point, Mr. Tung showed off a scroll that China's President, Jiang Zemin, painted and gave to Hong Kong as a gift during the handover. "Hong Kong will be better tomorrow," it says in Chinese calligraphy.
But to many people here, the economic crisis has settled into a debilitating illness, with little hope of a cure. Hong Kong's stock market has fallen by roughly half since its peak in August 1997, property prices have plummeted by as much as 60 percent and unemployment is soaring.
"People respect Tung as a sincere, elderly person," said Joseph Cheng, a professor of political science at the City University of Hong Kong. "His heart is in the right place, but people are looking for results."
As the man China chose to run Hong Kong, Mr. Tung faces a quandary unique among Asian leaders. He does not have a popular mandate, yet he must serve two very different constituencies: the 6.6 million people of Hong Kong and the Communist bosses in Beijing. Unless he comes to grips with the economic crisis, his critics say, Mr. Tung risks losing the faith of both groups.
With its economy in a free fall, some observers said they also feared that Hong Kong was turning away from the global market. In August the government intervened in the stock market to foil overseas hedge funds, which it accused of manipulating Hong Kong's markets.
In defending the intervention, senior officials played heavily on fears of unnamed "foreign traders," while a prominent member of the legislature referred to foreigners by a derogatory Cantonese word.
Mr. Tung said such remarks reflected public frustration with the hedge funds, which he said had destabilized Hong Kong's economy. But as someone who lived in Boston and New York for nine years and watches the football games of his favorite team, the San Francisco 49ers, on videocassette, Mr. Tung seemed disturbed by suggestions that Hong Kong had become xenophobic.
"The whole of Hong Kong overwhelmingly understands that Hong Kong is an international city, and the future of Hong Kong, the success of Hong Kong, is closely tied to being an international city," he said.
When it comes to domestic issues, critics said Mr. Tung seemed to miss the forest for the trees. In his annual policy address last week, he proposed to turn Hong Kong into a center for Chinese medicine, but he offered no major remedies for restoring the property market. During a radio call-in show with Mr. Tung after the 135-minute speech, one caller bluntly told him to resign.
"Obviously, you can understand it when the public is unhappy," Mr. Tung said. But he added, "Hong Kong is a very free-market economy, and what the government can do is really not a lot."
Some politicians here say Mr. Tung may be miscast in his role. Before the transfer to China, when Hong Kong was booming, a conservative businessman might have seemed an obvious choice to keep the cash registers ringing. Now, with the economy in a shambles and Hong Kong's confidence shaken, people here are yearning for more than Mr. Tung's gray-flannel style.
"He would make an excellent chief executive in Singapore, where the people are Chinese but are more old-fashioned," said Martin Lee, Hong Kong's most prominent pro-democracy politician.
Unlike his British predecessor, Christopher Patten, who was a Tory party leader before coming to Hong Kong, Mr. Tung does not relish kissing babies, glad-handing on the street or racing to accident scenes.
"This is one area in which I really have to learn a whole lot more -- transforming myself from a businessman," Mr. Tung said. "Could I communicate better? Yes, I can and I will communicate better."
But while Mr. Tung wants to hone his political skills, he is not about to embrace the rough-and-tumble of democracy. Hong Kong held direct elections for one-third of the seats in its legislature in May, and pro-democracy candidates, who did well, are pressing for a speedier transition to full democracy.
Mr. Tung said the economic crisis made him more determined to stick to the timetable, which would not put his job or the full legislature up for election until after 2007.
"Right now we just have too many things going on," he said. "If you look at the changes that are around us, we need a stable environment."
In the final analysis, Mr. Tung's future depends on his relationship with the leaders in Beijing. And despite Hong Kong's travails, there is no evidence that he has lost their faith. Likewise, Mr. Tung's support among Hong Kong's powerful property tycoons remains generally solid.
Mr. Tung has worked hard to establish his credentials as the leader of a Chinese city. In his speech last week, he said Hong Kong people should be inspired by their brethren in China, who built earthen walls to hold back the waters during the recent floods on the Yangtze River.
But critics say the flood would not have been so calamitous if China had protected its environment. Hong Kong, they say, needs policies that avoid disaster, rather than appeals to heroism after disaster has struck.

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11

 BODY:
With President Clinton distracted and besieged and his moral authority questioned after an affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, there is much room for America's allies, its Congress and even its energy companies to ignore, deflect or defy his will.
The President has been forced to drag NATO closer and closer to the brink of bombing Serbia, an outcome no one wants, to have President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia take Washington seriously. 
 In the midst of a global economic crisis Mr. Clinton was negotiating down to the wire this weekend with Congressional Republicans to fulfill American financial obligations to the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations, organizations that Washington insists on trying to lead even though it will not pay its bills to them.
Mr. Clinton appears to have lost his two-year campaign to persuade major oil companies to build a pipeline from the Caspian Sea through Turkey, even though he had declared it an American strategic priority.
And this week, in what Mr. Clinton will hail as a foreign-policy triumph, he is expected to preside over an interim Israeli-Palestinian agreement that is coming so late, and is being accomplished so grudgingly, that both sides fear that it will fall apart a few weeks after it is signed.
"Sometimes moments of truth arrive," David Calleo of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies said. "It's hard to distinguish between a lack of credibility that comes from the discrediting of an individual President and that coming from a certain accretion of realism. The Administration has been trying to make water run uphill and make policy by declaration. But both the President and the policies are running out of gas."
Examples abound of how it is simply easier to say "no" to a wounded President, to delay, misconstrue or even reject his declared policies.
In the case of the Caspian pipeline the oil companies argued that at today's petroleum prices the multibillion-dollar project made no economic sense. But a stronger or more focused President might have made a persuasive case, perhaps directly to the public, that the pipeline was not about transporting oil today, but about America's energy security and its political influence well into the next century. And such a President might have organized the financial resources required to make it happen.
This President's commitment to foreign policy has always been secondary. Mr. Clinton has rarely shown much boldness or even the willingness to punish those like Mr. Milosevic, Saddam Hussein of Iraq or even Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel who taunt and defy him. That is especially true with Israel, because White House punishment of Israel threatens core Democratic Party constituencies.
In dealing with the Caucasus region and the Middle East, Mr. Calleo said, "the world doesn't see much leadership of a sustained positive kind." The Middle East encompasses issues other than the Israeli-Palestinian relationship, "and to be on the outs with both Iraq and Iran at the same time isn't much of a strategy, and yet it just goes on and on," he said.
In the Balkans the American effort to recreate a kind of multiethnic Hapsburg empire is too ambitious, but would certainly require lots of troops on the ground in Kosovo. "We have these policies but don't want to pay the price to sustain them, and everyone knows it," Mr. Calleo said. "If you can't or won't follow through on your threats, it's not much good to make them."
Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, bluntly said today in a discussion of Kosovo on "Fox News Sunday": "I think we have been diverted by the Lewinsky matter. There is still no long-term plan, a good description of what our objectives are."
Mr. McCain added about Mr. Clinton: "He is putting our young people in danger. Any President must go to the American people and explain what is going on."
Of course, to order a bombing campaign because of the Kosovo crisis would be a failure of American and NATO policy, which is to threaten Mr. Milosevic into meeting some set of American objectives. But bombing would only make it harder to stave off a humanitarian disaster among the nearly 300,000 ethnic Albanian refugees and make it more likely that NATO ground troops would have to be introduced, senior Administration officials concede.
"NATO knows this, but Milosevic knows it, too," one senior American official said, who insisted on anonymity. "Add that to Lewinsky and you get a real credibility problem."
Robert Kagan of the Carnegie Endowment said the lack of decisiveness inevitably produced an unwillingess of other countries and actors to follow.
"It would be simple to say that because of Lewinsky this President is distracted," Mr. Kagan said. "But the problem of credibility transcends the Lewinsky affair, though it only exacerbates the problems."
The problem is especially acute in an altering world of economic crisis where bilateral policies are less important than multilateral ones, "when we really do need some concentrated leadership of an unusual kind," he added.
International indecisiveness in NATO, the United Nations and global financial institutions starts with American indecisiveness, Mr. Kagan said.
"You have a Cabinet Secretary" -- such as Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright -- "issuing threats, while it is soon clear that the Administration will not follow through," he said, whether the topic is the Middle East or Kosovo. "You have the Secretary of Defense speaking for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and they don't want to go into Kosovo."
And Mr. Clinton, Mr. Kagan added, "doesn't have the moral authority to order them to go on the one hand or provide them the budget that makes it easier for them to go."
He described the situation as "a simple paradox -- if it were clearer that we were prepared to take action it would be easier for others to get on board."
For Richard N. Haass, foreign policy director for the Brookings Institution, Mr. Clinton's "unwillingness to level with Congress and the American people over Bosnia has a bad aftertaste" and resonates with negative implications for Kosovo, where "we've dithered for months," Mr. Haass said.
There are similar gaps between oratory and action over Iraq, Mr. Haass said. He compared Mr. Clinton's statements in February, when he talked of going to war over access for arms inspectors, to the Administration's willingness now to let the United Nations solve the problem.
"They blinked in February," Mr. Haass said. "And now we're reluctant to bring the crisis to a head."
In general "we've allowed matters to drift in the Middle East, and Clinton has lost respect," Mr. Haas said. "He hasn't been willing to blow the whistle or speak the truth publcly.
"The cumulative effect is that this is an Administration that friends and foes alike can ignore. That is dangerous."

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeks Input on New Rules for the I.M.F.

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11

 BODY:
The Administration has begun to consult foreign governments about changes that will be demanded of the International Monetary Fund under a deal with Congress to provide the fund with $18 billion, Administration and Congressional officials said today.
The Administration requested the infusion of capital to deal with the global economic crisis. 
 Officials said compromise legislation now being hammered out by the White House and Republican Congressional leaders would provide full financing for the fund, but would also demand greater openness in its decision-making and new restrictions on its loans.
The fund has traditionally made its decisions about loans to foreign governments in secret.
The White House has portrayed the $18 billion as vital to the I.M.F. as it seeks to avert an international financial meltdown.
After a weekend of negotiations, White House officials and members of Congress said they were optimistic about a deal as part of a larger budget agreement that is meant to prevent a shutdown of the Federal Government.
"There has been constructive bipartisan discussion," said Gene Sperling, President Clinton's national economic adviser. "All parties are increasingly confident that both full funding and substantial reforms will be part of the final agreement."
Representative David R. Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat involved in the talks, said he believed a deal would be announced soon.
"You can see a solution to that on the horizon," he said, describing the talks on the fund as the "one area" in the budget talks "where we're moving much closer to agreement."
The details of the compromise have not been made public, and Administration and Congressional officials said at least a handful of issues remained unresolved, specifically about the lending conditions that the United States can try to impose.
House Republicans, who had blocked all but $3.4 billion of the $18 billion request, have been seeking changes in how the fund is run, including an end to loans at below-market interest rates and a requirement that loans be repaid within a year.
Republican leaders say new lending conditions would provide more incentive to foreign governments to pursue sound economic policies.
The Administration has warned that some of the Republicans' demands would be impossible to force on the I.M.F., which has 182 members.
Administration and Congressional officials said the Administration had begun to consult with other nations that are key donors to head off the possibility that the I.M.F. might balk at new lending conditions.
The $18 billion from the United States would replenish accounts depleted by the fund's efforts to bail out the economies of Russia and three Asian natons. Other important donor nations are waiting for Washington to act before chipping in their shares.
Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House Republican majority leader, said today on the ABC News program "This Week" that the talks between the White House and Congress were still a "very rigorous business."
He did not predict when agreement might be reached. "We're working out the details now," he said. "We're working hard on the language and we'll just have to see."
Mr. Armey led efforts in the House earlier this year to block full financing for the I.M.F., and today he repeated the criticism often heard on Capitol Hill, both from Republicans and Democrats, that the fund had mishandled the financial crisis that has swept across much of the world in recent months.
"There seems to be now a growing consensus of understanding, even given lip service by the President himself, that the I.M.F. has very likely done more harm in places like Thailand and Russia than they've done good," he said.
"Everybody understands the I.M.F. can have American tax dollars if the I.M.F. is responsible and productive in the world economy. But we will not continue to give them money to do the kind of harm they've done. If you've got a fire, you don't subsidize the arsonist."

HEADLINE: Questions Arise About Swiss Report on Raul Salinas's Millions

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

 BODY:
Almost from the moment that detectives in Switzerland found a huge hidden fortune belonging to Raul Salinas de Gortari, brother of Mexico's former President, Mr. Salinas has said the money was from an investment fund that he had assembled with big Mexican entrepreneurs.
But now investigators in Switzerland have arrived at a different explanation. They say although some of Mr. Salinas's millions did come from executives, much of that was drug money that he had laundered with help from an old friend who is one of Mexico's richest figures. 
 In a secret report the Swiss police suggest that the friend, Carlos Peralta Quintero, helped hide protection money that they assert drug traffickers had paid to Mr. Salinas. Mr. Salinas is the elder brother of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"The transactions described by Carlos Peralta were designed in their entirety for one purpose only, namely, the laundering of money," the report states. A partial copy of the 369-page document was obtained by The New York Times.
The case was bolstered this month, when Mexican officials announced that they had linked Raul Salinas to an additional $119 million in a maze of Mexican and foreign accounts.
Officials in Mexico said they would try to interview the witnesses whom Swiss and American investigators developed, raising a possibility that they might add drug-trafficking accusations to the murder and graft charges on which Mr. Salinas has been jailed there since 1995.
But the investigative report and other documents suggest that the Swiss explanation of the money may have problems of its own.
Mr. Peralta, 46, heir to an industrial and telecommunications conglomerate, denied the allegations, calling them outrageous.
Lawyers for Mr. Salinas describe the Swiss accusations against the industrialist as one of the most obvious fictions among what they say are a litany of unsustainable claims against their client.
"The money of Carlos Peralta is absolutely legitimate," Raul Salinas's lead lawyer, Eduardo Luengo Creel, said in an interview. "We have demonstrated its movement from start to finish. But the stance of the Swiss prosecutor and the police is to ignore any evidence that contradicts their theory."
Based on the investigators' report, the Swiss authorities are expected to confiscate the more than $100 million that they have kept frozen in Mr. Salinas's 15 accounts there. After that happens, Mr. Salinas's lawyers said, they will go to the Swiss Supreme Court to sue for its release.
The Swiss report quotes witnesses who recount meetings at which Raul Salinas and other Mexican politicians reportedly cut deals with drug traffickers and picked up suitcases filled with cash. Most of those informers appear to be convicted drug traffickers or former aides, security guards and associates of the Salinas brothers, and nearly all are identified only by pseudonyms.
Although it often refers to appendices that may give further details, the report itself has accounts of Mr. Salinas's purported dealings that are often general and sometimes vague. There is little explanation of how he might have exercised influence with police and military agencies to allow the smugglers to operate freely.
The case of Mr. Peralta is something of an exception. That part of the report quotes a convicted drug trafficker, Marco Enrique Torres, as saying he gave Mr. Peralta a kilogram package of cocaine -- 2.2 pounds, or $20,000 worth on the New York wholesale market -- as a Christmas gift from Raul Salinas in 1993. Mr. Torres said he handed the drugs to Mr. Peralta on Dec. 25 "in front of the Restaurant Casserola on the Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico City."
The restaurant, however, is in a different part of town. And travel documents provided to the Swiss by Mr. Peralta appear to show that he was on vacation in Florida from Dec. 19 until Dec. 26, when he took off with relatives on a weeklong Caribbean cruise.
A spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Andrew Lluberes, confirmed that Mr. Peralta entered the United States on Dec. 19, but said the agency did not record his departure.
On the Swiss' larger claim, that Raul Salinas gave Mr. Peralta $50 million to hide the fact that it came from drug traffickers, the Swiss do not appear to have hard evidence.
Mr. Peralta said he had loaned the money to Mr. Salinas for investments. The report raises doubts about that.
The report also says Mr. Salinas, Mr. Peralta and the other executives who supposedly joined the fund never discussed what investments they would make. The report also says Mr. Salinas's wife once told a Swiss banker that her husband had obtained the money by selling stock in Mr. Peralta's cellular-telephone company, Grupo Iusacell.
Whatever investments Mr. Salinas might have planned, the report states, he gave $10 million of the Peralta money to his wife as a wedding present.
"The transactions in the loan-investment business of Carlos Peralta make no economic sense and cannot be reconstructed in any logical way," the report states.
Nonetheless, the report takes no note of the 500 pages of documentation that Mr. Peralta's lawyers presented to the Swiss. Among other aspects, that evidence indicates that Mr. Peralta received the $50 million that he sent to Mr. Salinas from the sale of Iusacell stock to the Bell Atlantic Corporation and that he paid $10 million in Mexican taxes on the money.

HEADLINE: Mayor Faults Pataki Approval Of Harlem Minister's Support

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani publicly questioned Gov. George E. Pataki's decision to accept the endorsement of the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d yesterday, saying the prominent black minister "plays the worst kind of race politics."
It was not surprising to hear Mr. Giuliani denounce Mr. Butts, the pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, who infuriated the Mayor last spring by calling him a racist who was on the verge of creating a fascist state. But it was highly unusual for Mr. Giuliani to question publicly the judgment of Mr. Pataki, who is seeking re-election this fall and is a fellow Republican. 
 The Mayor's statement served to detract from the endorsement, which Mr. Pataki's campaign had presented as a political coup.
"If I were in Governor Pataki's position, I would refuse to take his endorsement," Mr. Giuliani told reporters before marching in the Hispanic Day Parade up Fifth Avenue. "I would not take the endorsement of someone who throws around the term 'racist' as loosely as he does, and for such blatant political purposes."
A campaign spokesman for Mr. Pataki, Michael E. Marr, would not respond on the record to Mr. Giuliani's comments about Mr. Butts, but he did say Mr. Pataki had no second thoughts about accepting the endorsement.
"We are unequivocally thrilled to have Reverend Butts's endorsement," Mr. Marr said. "He is an important leader in his community."
Mr. Butts formally endorsed the Governor at a news conference outside his church, about an hour after Mr. Giuliani made his remarks. He said that he had not always agreed with Mr. Pataki's social policies, but that his economic policies had been good for Harlem.
"In terms of providing jobs and hope, I think it deserves another four years," Mr. Butts said. "I can have someone I disagree with, but who helps me a great deal with projects that are important for our community."
Mr. Butts, a registered Democrat, said Mr. Pataki's Democratic challenger, Speaker Peter F. Vallone of City Council, was a "fine legislator" who would make a good governor. He invited Mr. Vallone to speak at his church "anytime he wants," but said Mr. Pataki deserved another four years in office.
"Perhaps Peter Vallone would like to be mayor," Mr. Butts said. "Maybe he will run for that."
Mr. Butts said he had not decided whom to support in the United States Senate race, although he was critical of some policies of the Republican incumbent, Alfonse M. D'Amato.
Before receiving Mr. Butts's endorsement, Governor Pataki addressed about 1,600 congregants inside the church. He spoke about his efforts to provide health insurance for every child in the state and said that economic development projects financed by the state had provided hundreds of jobs in Harlem.
Mr. Butts did not support Mr. Pataki in 1994, but he invited him to speak at his church during that campaign, saying he wanted to "get out of one party's pocket." He endorsed Mr. Giuliani in 1993, but said in May that he could no longer support the Mayor's policies, which he said had harmed the city's black communities.
"I don't believe that he likes black people," Mr. Butts said at the time. "And I believe there's something fundamentally wrong in the way we are disregarded, the way we are mistreated, and the way our communities are being devastated."
Mr. Giuliani referred to those comments yesterday, saying that Mr. Butts used "the word 'racist' so loosely that it portrays something substantially wrong with him."
Asked about the Mayor's comments yesterday, Mr. Butts said he did not want to "engage in any divisive rhetoric."
Mr. Butts also said he hoped to work with Mr. Giuliani in the future.
"The Mayor of the City of New York is a man who has a very difficult job," he said, "and in doing his job he is often faced with those of us who may disagree with him from time to time. I pray that God will strengthen him to do the best job possible."

HEADLINE: Affluent Buyers Show Signs Of Caution About Spending;
Wall Street's Gloom Has New York Tense

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON with JULIAN E. BARNES 

 BODY:
Was it really only three months ago that the economic sky was blue? That life was lush? That everything was coming up roses, even in the asphalt jungle of New York?
Now, storm clouds seem to be piling up on the horizons of many New Yorkers, especially the well-to-do suits who populate much of Manhattan. Vacations are being postponed, apartment prices are being cut, purchases are being put off. The elegant Four Seasons restaurant is trying to come up with a cheaper menu. 
 The cause of all this anxiety is, of course, Wall Street, which is suffering one of its worst patches in a decade. Blue-chip stocks have fallen more than 15 percent since July, bond markets around the globe have imploded and some big Wall Street firms have admitted to losing hundreds of millions of dollars in the last three months.
Things have suddenly gotten so bad in the world of stocks and bonds that Merrill Lynch, a major New York employer and the biggest brokerage firm in the country, is widely expected to announce this week that it will lay off 1,000 workers or more. Other firms are expected to follow suit next week. (Spokesmen for the firms declined to comment.)
This is bad news in a city where securities firms employ almost 164,000 people in the metropolitan region. While these workers account for less than 5 percent of the labor force here, they make an enormous amount of money (an average of $172,000 a year, as opposed to $43,000 for the average worker in other industries, according to statistics from the Governor's office). That money gets spread around through the taxes they pay, the things they buy, and the restaurants and bars they frequent.
And many New Yorkers work at companies that do a lot of business with Wall Street firms. Accountants, office cleaners, lawyers, printers, caterers, limousine drivers, computer technicians, temporary workers, all depend in large part on financial firms for their livelihoods. From 1995 to 1997, the boom of Wall Street resulted in $1 billion of additional sales for suppliers and created 7,800 jobs outside the securities industry, according to a recent report by the State Comptroller's office.
Even those whose jobs have little to do with Wall Street may well be feeling gloomy over the stock market's malaise. Almost half of Americans have some money in the stock market, directly or through their retirement plans. For the first time in many years, their accounts are starting to show big losses, prompting a decline in consumer confidence among the well-to-do, according to surveys of American sentiment.
Anyone who owns a co-op apartment in Manhattan is probably aware of the effect Wall Street's gloom is having on the high-end housing market. In September, sellers cut their asking prices on 1,292 apartments -- almost 19 percent of the listing of the Corcoran Group, a real estate brokerage. In August, the number was just 734.
The mood among sellers has changed, said Barbara Corcoran, chairwoman of the company. Although few are jumping at the low bids put in by potential buyers, at least now they are listening, she said. "Before, they weren't even civil."
The declines on Wall Street may even affect people who are impoverished or otherwise in need. That is because many charities in New York depend heavily on donations from the financial sector.
The American Red Cross of Greater New York is worried about the state of its donors. "If they feel less wealthy, they feel less able to make major gifts," said Dolores Swirin, the senior director of development. "We are counting on the stock market, which until now was making people feel more charitable."
Stores that sell expensive items, from silk ties to personal computers, are already seeing a decline. Sales at Neiman Marcus, which also owns Bergdorf Goodman, fell more than 7 percent last month.
Some of the art auction houses are expecting strong sales of masterpieces, which is how they make most of their money. But they are worrying about what, for their customers, are almost impulse purchases. "The real question is not how the great Renoir will do, but how a good Renoir, at a half million, will do," said Diana D. Brooks, the chief executive of Sotheby's.
New Yorkers appear to be cutting back on other luxuries, like the rare cigars that Richard Hu sometimes gets in stock at his shop, Wall Street Humidor. In August, Mr. Hu said, he was able to unload a shipment by calling just seven of his best customers. But in recent weeks, he has had to make 25 or 30 calls. "A lot of my investment bankers are starting to worry about their jobs," Mr. Hu said.
This sudden surge in gloom may prove to be an overreaction to temporary trouble. After all, some firms on Wall Street, including Lehman Brothers and the giant Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, say they have no plans to cut jobs.
It may simply be that New Yorkers are coming down to earth, with a bit of a Champagne hangover, after an astounding period in which hundreds of Wall Street executives received annual bonuses of $1 million or more.
Sales of luxury cars at BMW of Manhattan, which stalled in August and September, are now now on an upswing as new models come in, though customers are in a slightly more cautious mood, said William F. Kehoe, president and general manager. "We don't notice people looking for less expensive models," he said, "but they are a lot more calculating and conservative in shopping.
Some economists and government officials say that all this emphasis on Wall Street is overblown. Sure, businesses that depend on financial firms for orders will be affected, as will those that depend on spending by people with very high incomes, said Stephen Kagann, chief economist for Gov. George E. Pataki. "But not by a long shot does that define the typical New York City resident," Mr. Kagann said.
Nevertheless, there is no denying that in lower Manhattan, anxiety is on the rise. Richard Nemeroff of Garden City, N.Y., who works in technical support at Merrill Lynch, said on Friday that he was not sure whether he would take his wife on a vacation to Key West in Florida early next year. "I'm going to hold off and see what happens in the fourth quarter," he said.
Among the investment bankers and hotshot traders, the mood is more like panic. Not only have securities firms' profits tumbled, chopping the money available for bonuses, but their stock prices have plunged by more than half since July. This is a blow to executives, who have much of their net worth tied up in their employers' stocks.
"Everybody lost their bonus in August, and they can't believe it," said one executive, who spoke on the condition that neither his name nor that of his firm appears in print. He had just come from a meeting in which he was told his division was cutting back on hiring and was "reviewing staffing," which he said was code for contemplating layoffs.
A sort of defiant gloom has set in among some of Wall Street's younger workers, like the men drinking late on Friday night at the Cub Room, a popular SoHo nightspot. "I'm an analyst at Merrill Lynch, and I'm sure I'm going to lose my job next week -- positive," said one man, who would not give his name because, he said, appearing in the newspaper would doom any chance that he would keep his job.
"I don't care if they fire me," he added. "I'm just going to go to law school. I'll be making money again in another few years."
Another worker, John Cogland, said that his firm, which he would not name, is not firing people, but he has heard rumors of layoffs elsewhere. "Maybe I should make dinner tomorrow night and save some money, just in case," he said. "I probably should -- but I won't."
Those who have been watching Wall Street the longest sound the gloomiest. This month's round of layoff announcements "will be neither the last nor the largest," said John Keefe, a former Wall Street analyst who now works as a consultant to the securities industry. "It'll continue for some time, all over different companies, different departments, big people and little."
Isn't that forecast a little, well, dire? "I've seen it before," Mr. Keefe said.
The financial firms did indeed slash employment after 1987, when the stock market fell 20 percent in one day, and made further cuts after the bond market collapsed in 1990. Between July 1987 and January 1990, Wall Street employment fell by 20,000 jobs, to 142,000; by October of 1991, employment dropped by an additional 14,000 jobs, to 128,000.
The city suffered, too. Overall employment in the private sector fell from more than 3 million in 1987 to about 2.7 million in 1991. Businesses failed, stores went bankrupt, office towers stood empty. Pessimism seemed almost universal.
Those days may seem long gone, but in some parts of New York, they are hard to forget. Take Delmonico's, the fabled restaurant on Beaver Street in the financial district that folded in 1990, in part because its Wall Street customers could not pay their tabs. After reopening five months ago, the restaurant has been booming, though lunch was a little slow late last week, said Patricia Economo, the catering manager.
This time, the restaurant is being very careful about allowing young traders to open house accounts, she said.
The Four Seasons in midtown is far less dependent on Wall Street for its customers, who have been packing the place, said Julian Niccolini, one of the restaurant's owners. Nevertheless, on Friday he met with his chef to discuss a new menu for the grill room, where a prix fixe meal costs $75, a price he hopes to bring down to between $55 and $65.
The reason for the change, Mr. Niccolini said, was his experience after the stock market crash of 1987, when his sales fell substantially. "In the past, we waited too long to react," he said. "And we had a very hard time."

HEADLINE: Confidence Buckling as Markets Plunge

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The global financial crisis and the plunging stock market are beginning to unnerve the nation's more affluent families and make them more cautious in their spending.
Consumer spending, particularly among families with annual incomes above $50,000, is far and away the biggest source of economic growth in the United States. Through months of turmoil, this consumption has remained strong, even as other pillars of economic growth have faded: exports and profits, for example, and spending on the machinery and equipment that allows business to thrive. Now the first crack has appeared in the will to spend. 
 The crack is most evident in recent consumer surveys that ask specifically about a household's "financial situation"; that is, its savings, stock portfolios and real estate holdings -- its wealth -- as well as its income from wages. Over the last several months, families with lower incomes, and little exposure to the stock market, have shown no change in their level of optimism. In sharp contrast, households with incomes above $50,000 were optimistic about their financial situation before the summer's sharp selloff in the stock market, but then in September their optimism fell significantly.
"We are starting to see consumers who feel nervous about the stock market and are becoming more cautious in their spending behavior," said Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's Consumer Surveys, whose monthly polls are widely followed by economists as the most reliable indicators of consumer sentiment. "What we have found consistently over the years is that such changes in sentiment precede significant changes in actual spending by six to nine months."
As such, this would point to a considerable slowdown in the economy sometime next spring.
The consumers in question are people like Ellen Elias, a partner in an upscale Manhattan appliance store, Elgot, at 937 Lexington Avenue, a woman in her forties who says she "owns enough stock to be concerned." She is hoping that stock prices will rebound by the time she needs the money, closer to her retirement. Since mid-July, when the selloff began, American stocks have lost $1.5 trillion of their value, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, estimated last week. If this decline continues, Ms. Elias said, she may have second thoughts about some of her spending.
Doubt has already touched Andrew Kozinn, a 46-year-old men's suit manufacturer and haberdasher, with a store at 350 Park Avenue in Manhattan. He has a stock portfolio approaching seven figures, he says, but he lives within his annual income from his business, not his stock market gains. Besides, he said, his stocks are still worth more than they were a year or so ago, before the big run-up in stock prices that ended in July. Still, Mr. Kozinn admits to a glimmer of uneasiness.
"I have just bought a new car, and I am putting a new bathroom in my summer home," he said, "and you start to wonder what you should have done."
Higher-income families, the people who invested most heavily in stocks and felt wealthier as stock prices rose, account for only 28 percent of the nation's households. The remaining 72 percent, all families earning less than $50,000 a year, invest their savings mainly in their homes, not the stock market, various studies show, and their feelings about their financial situation have not shown any change in recent consumer polls.
But they are not the biggest spenders. Higher-income households are. Those with incomes above $50,000 a year account for nearly half of all consumer spending, the Census Bureau and Labor Department report. Households earning above $70,000, while less than 20 percent of all households, account for nearly 30 percent of all the spending. At signs of economic trouble, their mood swings are much more pronounced.
During good times, more affluent families are notably more optimistic about the economy than lower-income Americans, according to Thomas Riehl, a partner at Peter Hart Research Associates, a public opinion polling firm. In June 1997, for example, Hart Research found that only 12 percent of those earning $50,000 to $100,000 a year expected a recession in the next 12 months, while 25 percent of those with incomes under $20,000 saw recession around the corner. The 12 percent shot up to 33 percent in a similar poll last month, but the outlook among poor families hardly changed -- 27 percent saw recession within a year.
"When a good period for the economy ends," Mr. Riehl said, "optimism at the high end comes down closer to what lower-income people express, even in the best of times."
And high-end spending is the first to be affected. The nation's total consumption is still strong, and many luxury goods -- Volvos and Mercedes-Benz cars, for example -- are still being snapped up. But hints of weakening at the high end have begun to appear. Discount stores, catering mainly to the less affluent, reported last week that September sales climbed smartly. But stores like Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus that sell more luxury goods said sales fell last month.
Land's End, whose catalogues offer high-priced casual wear, says its sales, after posting strong gains earlier in the year, "have been relatively flat in recent weeks." ISI Group and Goldman, Sachs, Wall Street firms that track retail sales on their own, both report a softening. And the U.S. Home Corporation, based in Houston, which builds 9,000 homes a year at an average price of $176,000 apiece, says that while sales are still rising, they are doing so "at a declining rate of increase."
"The traffic count of potential customers through our model homes is down, and we are not converting as many of them to buyers," said Robert J. Strudler, chairman of U.S. Home. "With mortgage rates so low, that is more a reflection of a decline in consumer confidence than afford ability."
Mr. Curtin, director of the University of Michigan survey, agrees. The nation's two major consumer confidence surveys, Michigan's and one conducted by the Conference Board, a business organization, both find that while consumer confidence is still at a high level, there were significant declines in August and September. Mr. Curtin blames the September drop on families with annual incomes above $50,000.
All year, he notes, more than 60 percent of the households in this category had expressed optimism about their own financial situation. And then in September, the percentage suddenly fell to 50. That mood change did not show up among households earning less than $50,000. From January through August, the proportion of optimistic households in this category ranged between 40 percent and 48 percent, and in September the number was a typical 46 percent.
"For the less than $50,000-a-year crowd," Mr. Curtin said, "their primary concern is not the stock market, but the impact from falling exports and layoffs, and that they have not felt yet."
The main issue for this group is jobs, and the demand for workers until now has been quite strong. Layoffs have begun to pick up lately, but the nation's unemployment rate is still at an unusually low 4.6 percent.

HEADLINE: Friction Seen in Future Talks On City Labor

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Unhappy about the two-year pay freeze in their contracts, New York City's municipal unions are warning that they will not accept such a freeze again, while several labor leaders are demanding an end to pattern bargaining, in which every union receives the same percentage raise.
After a three-day meeting last week in which they mapped their bargaining strategy, municipal union leaders said their members were angry that they had not reaped any benefits from the city's record $2 billion budget surplus, which their pay freeze helped create. 
 Indicating another area of friction in future labor talks, leaders of the powerful teachers and police unions vowed to increase their efforts to scrap pattern bargaining, insisting that it has left their members earning considerably less than their suburban counterparts.
These leaders insisted that unless the city gives teachers and police officers larger percentage raises than other municipal workers, the city would find it increasingly difficult to attract qualified teachers and police officers.
But an end to pattern bargaining faces major obstacles, including the opposition of many city unions and the likelihood that City Hall would tie any raises above the pattern to concessions that the police and teachers would find hard to accept.
With contract negotiations expected to begin next year, the leaders of the city's unions signaled a tough new stance, insisting they would seek higher raises now that the city's finances have improved.
Under their current five-year contracts, the municipal unions, representing more than 200,000 city workers, accepted a two-year pay freeze and then a 13 percent wage increase during the final three years.
"We will not take any more zeroes," said Stanley Hill, chairman of the multi-union bargaining committee and executive director of District Council 37, the giant union representing 120,000 city workers. "We made a tremendous sacrifice in this contract, and we feel very strongly that now there is a surplus, we should be rewarded because we have helped make this a better city."
The tougher tone comes after Mr. Hill was embarrassed by an investigation into allegations of kickbacks and embezzlement at the District Council's 56 locals. It also comes at a time when many union members are complaining that their wage increases have not kept up with prices or the city's soaring rents.
City Hall officials said it was too early to discuss negotiating strategy because any resumption of bargaining was months away. They also noted that District Council 37's contract does not expire until 2000.
One city official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the union leaders were indulging in sour grapes because they accepted a frugal contract in 1995, when the city faced tough budgetary times, only to see the city's coffers fill up soon after the negotiations, thanks to the multi-year boom on Wall Street.
"They're in the middle of a contract," the official said. "This sounds like general posturing."
Union leaders said they fear that with Wall Street's current troubles and the economy slowing, the city, notwithstanding its current surplus, will argue in future negotiations that economic times are difficult and the workers must again make sacrifices.
The push by the police and teachers unions to end pattern bargaining could become the biggest difference between the next round of negotiations and the previous round.
Not every municipal union is eager to eliminate pattern bargaining, however. Mr. Hill supports it, knowing there could be a civil war within his district council if some of the 56 locals in the council were to receive higher raises than others. Mr. Hill is chairman of the Municipal Labor Committee, which coordinates bargaining for the city's unions.
His view differs from the committee's co-chairwoman, Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, which represents the city's 70,000 public school teachers. Ms. Weingarten said pattern bargaining has ill-served the schools by depressing raises in teachers' pay. As a result, the city has difficulty attracting well-trained teachers, she said, because the starting salary remains under $30,000, far less than in many suburbs.
"Each union has different needs," she said. "The public-employee, unionized sector needs flexibility. The pattern bargaining, as currently construed, stops us from being able to bargain a competitive rate so that we can attract and retain teachers who meet the higher standards of today."
The police unions also want to end pattern bargaining, insisting that it has prevented the police from being rewarded for helping to reduce crime.
Thomas J. Scotto, president of the New York Detectives Endowment Association, which represents 5,800 police detectives, said: "How does the city justify that police officers, who have reduced crime by 40 percent throughout the city in almost every aspect, were limited to the same raise as everybody else? Whether police officers reduce crime by 40 percent or let it increase by 500 percent, it will have no bearing on our salaries. We'll be treated like cafeteria workers or anyone else. It doesn't make sense."
City officials noted that most other cities have pattern bargaining for their unions. Jettisoning the pattern, they said, would create huge political strains between City Hall and the unions, and among the unions themselves.
Deputy Mayor Randy Levine said: "I don't see any way the city will do anything but pattern bargaining, because without it everything will get out of control. The city could not get the job accomplished and protect the public fisc without pattern bargaining."
Mr. Levine noted that in previous years the teachers and the police have rejected the pattern and ended up in arbitration, only to have the arbitrators rule that the unions must accept the pattern.
But Mr. Levine did not rule out finding ways for a union like the teachers to obtain higher raises than those of other unions. "We'll give them over the pattern if they agree to do more work, which, in the end, is beneficial to the city," he said.
As an example of this, he noted the city's recent offer to give school principals a 30 percent raise if they agreed to drop tenure, worked more weeks and accepted more responsibility. He said the city might consider paying teachers more than the pattern if they agree to drop tenure or some preparation periods.
Several labor experts suggested that the city's unions might not even push seriously to reach a new contract with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, figuring that they might obtain a more generous deal from whomever succeeds him as mayor after the November 2001 election.
More than 100 of the city's labor leaders traveled to Atlantic City last week for a three-day Municipal Labor Committee conference on bargaining strategy. At a time when District Council 37 is under investigation on allegations of misusing members' money, some city workers criticized their leaders for spending tens of thousands of dollars to hold the conference at an Atlantic City hotel. The labor leaders, these critics say, could have easily met in an auditorium at one of the union headquarters in New York.
But Mr. Hill and several other union leaders said it was much more productive to meet outside New York City because when they meet at home, aides constantly interrupt them, making it hard for them to hold in-depth discussions. These leaders said going to Atlantic City helped create an atmosphere in which they could talk informally.

A few days before Election Day, Mr. Lewis, who is 88 years old, will don a vampire's cape, apply enough makeup for a suitably ghoulish cast, and help the Fairfield Garden Center promote its sale of Halloween costumes and lawn ornaments.

New Rail Route to Open
A new section of track that skirts the southernmost tip of the Bronx along the Harlem River is opening to rail traffic after nearly 20 years. Built at a cost of more than $100 million per mile, the section, known as the Oak Point Link, is the linchpin to decades-old plans to expand rail freight traffic in New York City and on Long Island, get thousands of diesel fume-spewing tractor-trailers off the highways and allow freight trains to bypass commuter tracks. It is also the central component of one of the largest industrial projects seen in New York City in 30 years. B1
 
City Unions Seek Pay Thaw
Unhappy about the two-year pay freeze in their contracts, New York City's municipal unions are warning that they will not accept such a freeze again, while several labor leaders are demanding an end to pattern bargaining, in which every union receives the same percentage raise. B1

Financial Crisis Hits Home
The global financial crisis and the plunging stock market are beginning to unnerve the nation's more affluent families and make them more cautious in their spending, the biggest source of economic growth in the United States. Recent economic surveys show that households with incomes above $50,000 were optimistic about their financial situation before the summer's sharp selloff in the stock market, but their optimism fell significantly in September.

HEADLINE: Brazil's Economy Doesn't Need Shock Tactics

 BODY:

To the Editor:
As President Henrique Cardoso begins critical steps to solve Brazil's severe economic woes (editorial, Oct. 8), it is understandable that Brazilians fear an immediate and perhaps uncontrolled devaluation of Brazil's currency, the real.
This fear should not be confined within Brazilian borders. A devaluation of the real will significantly lessen trade among all Latin American countries and cause increased economic havoc across the continent. Moreover, given the United States' own export levels in the region, this crisis will also have an adverse effect on the American economy.
While an International Monetary Fund intervention will serve as a short-term solution to stop the bleeding of Brazil's reserves, it is imperative that the world financial community encourage President Cardoso to enact mini-devaluation, followed by controlled spending, improved income-tax collection and other reforms.

HEADLINE: Derivatives Aren't Always Risky Investments

 BODY:

To the Editor:
An Oct. 8 Business Day article on the riskiness of bank investments does not take into account the fact that many banking institutions routinely use derivatives to reduce risk rather than to speculate. While the recent troubles with hedge funds rightly remind us of the dark side of derivatives, these investments remain important to bona fide hedging. 
 In a detailed study of the foreign exchange risk of United States and Japanese banks, my colleagues John Howe and Sandra Chamberlain and I found that the use of foreign exchange derivatives by United States banks was associated with lower, not higher, foreign exchange risk.

HEADLINE: CONNECTIONS;
The New $20 Bill Says More Than Its Weight in Gold

BYLINE: By Edward Rothstein

 BODY:
I don't really have anything against new money. I haven't been around enough old money to get snotty about its patina of tradition, its noble character and its good breeding.
But now things have gone too far. 
 No, I'm not talking about the nouveau riche. I'm talking about the new $20 bill beginning to creep into our pockets. The recently redesigned $50 and $100 notes haven't mattered much; for me, they have remained pretty much out of familiar reach. But soon these crude, brash and ill-proportioned $20's will be everywhere. And their ruder, cheaper cousins are on the way.
Why am I making so much fuss? Look at the elegant endowments possessed by old money. At the back of the old $20 is the graciously curvedSouth Portico of the White House, with the building set back, allowing space for the lawn, surrounding trees and hints of textured sky.
The image is not sharply bounded but fades gracefully away. And surrounding it is a frame that resembles an elaborate proscenium from a century-old theater, ornamented with banners, rosettes and elements derived from classical columns. Even the identifying numbers are elegant: two enclosed in octagons, two in ovals.
Now look at the new bill. The South Portico's curves are exchanged for a head-on, close-up of the Grecian north entrance. No lawn is visible, only shrubs. The leaves are detailed, but the sky is artificial, without texture. The image does not wash into the bill's background; instead, it is briskly cropped and bounded by a draftsman's oval. And around that oval are disorienting expanses of vacuum.
Meanwhile, the once ornate frame has shrunk into a thin molding. Two of the identifying 20's hang down as if by accident. A third pushes up from below, while in the right corner another 20, grotesquely large with a typeface new to American money, bursts through the frame and bubbles into the bill's empty space.
It is as if the new design were pieced together from spare parts, and there weren't quite enough to go around. The almost belle epoque reverence of the old, with its sense of looking through some nobly decorated portal at a building of charm and authority, is replaced by the cavalier recklessness and rudeness of the nouveau riche.
And I haven't even mentioned the face of the bill, where the formal grace of the top and bottom borders is undercut by the blown-up medallion of Andrew Jackson with its matinee idol slickness. The portrait is off-center, even breaking apart the once subtle identifying label: the word "Federal" is pushed to one side, leaving "Reserve Note" to fend for itself. This bill looks like money that doesn't care too much about looking like money. It looks like play money.
All right, maybe I'm making too much of this. After all, until we use it, paper money is play money. This is its genius: instead of actually using valuables to exchange for other valuables -- nougats of silver or gold, bags of barley or precious-metal coins stamped with their weight -- something absolutely worthless is used, worthless and, by its very nature, transitory, subject to rips, wear and decay.
But a delicate drama takes place within these slips of paper. Their fragility is almost part of the point. The authority that distributes them is so powerful that it can confer the greatest value on what is most valueless. The bill also relies on a social contract between its users, who agree to accept that governing authority and trust that others will as well.
That is why, as economists have long noted, paper money is so vulnerable; it relies on intangibles like trust, faith and power. Alexander Hamilton objected to the stuff. "In times of tranquillity it might have no ill consequence," he wrote about paper money. "But in great and trying emergencies, there is almost moral certainty of its being mischievous."
The mischief, of course, is that more can be printed at will, offering a fraudulent promise of value. And if the authority behind the paper weakens, or has no influence with a neighboring authority, the bills become useless scrip. In 1860, for example, there were more than 1,600 private American banks offering their own paper money in 10,000 basic note types. One estimate is that 5,000 counterfeit types were also circulating. The evolution of the Federal Reserve and the centralized American monetary system was not merely an economic reform, but a social transformation.
So the design of bills is not a casual matter. Large forces are being invoked. The inscriptions are almost magical: when they appear in precisely the right way, they accomplish an alchemist's dream, as if turning lead into gold. And called into play are all the weighty icons of the social covenant and its governing authority, which are -- to alleviate Hamilton's anxieties -- portrayed as eternal, immutable, even divine. Mythic or ancient images proliferate on almost every nation's currency (look at the Latin inscriptions and the hovering eye over the pyramid on our $1 bill). So do the iconic portraits and buildings of a country's earthly presence.
But the new $20 bill seems indifferent to all this. The guiding strategy, according to the Treasury Department, was to further foil counterfeiters with watermark images, color- shifting ink and a labeled security thread. But that seems to have been the only concern; elsewhere all density of detail and intricacy of connection are tossed aside. As in so many new American stamps, almost every design element has been dumbed down, turned almost cartoonish, even condescending. The Treasury even boasts of the "easy to read" numeral slapped on the back. Why not just print the number over the entire surface of the bill if that's the point? The 20's on the back of the old bill were actually easier to read because the eye was drawn to them: they formed the stable corners of the note's architecture.
Finally, while it may seem as if the national icons are given more importance -- in Jackson's enlarged portrait or the zoomed-in view of the White House -- this assertiveness could be a sign of inflation. The bill's stilted decorations, blank spaces and mixed typefaces actually weaken the icons, which seem to have no secure place in the overall fabric. The White House in particular seems like part of an out-of-place curio hanging on a blank wall. And isn't all this an unsettling allusion to the nature of contemporary public life?
But the new design, with its almost casual disregard for the dense meanings of paper money, may also be unwittingly revealing another imminent transformation. Consider the currency now being designed across the ocean: the euro. That currency won't rely on the authority of individual countries because its guarantor will not be a country at all, but an economic association. Its bills will be adorned not with national capitols but with nonexistent buildings meant to broadly symbolize the evolution of architecture in Europe.
The euro will start being used for electronic transfer of funds on Jan. 1, three years before bills are even available.
What a peculiar situation: the euro will begin as abstract money and then take form in bills decorated with the abstract architecture of a newly imagined realm. And instead of being created by a government, the euro is creating a government. It is as if money had been freed of all material constraints, attaining untested powers.
Perhaps the new American bills also bear hints of this. We can barely associate money with national boundaries anymore (60 percent of American currency is probably circulating in foreign countries), so why worry about national icons and their meanings? As for design, why be concerned when currency is becoming increasingly abstract, dissolving into a digital stream of ones and zeroes, making encryption more important than inscription? Paper money, with all its mythic invocations and heroic portraits, may become superfluous. The real new money may be personalized versions of the EZ-Pass.
There goes the neighborhood.

HEADLINE: Kava May Soothe Jagged Nerves, but Is It Safe?

BYLINE: By DENISE GRADY 

 BODY:
A pill that calms you down without making you dull, sleepy or addicted? It may seem too good to be true, but the prospect of inner peace with no strings attached is tempting more and more Americans to try kava, an herbal product derived from the roots of a pepper plant grown in Fiji, Vanuatu and other Pacific islands.
To many people who suffer from anxiety and insomnia, kava might seem an ideal "natural" alternative to Valium and the other potentially addicting drugs prescribed to soothe ragged nerves. Kava is said to have been used for thousands of years in the Pacific to help people relax and socialize. Unlike alcohol, which can make people boisterous or belligerent, kava users report that the herb calms them without dulling the mind or causing hangovers. 
 There have been no scientific studies of kava in human beings in the United States. Nonetheless, Americans spent $15 million on kava in 1996, and twice that much in 1997, according to the Nutrition Business Journal, which projects sales of almost $50 million this year. Ed Smith, president of Herb Pharm, in Williams, Ore., one of about 40 American companies that sell kava, said, "Kava was virtually unknown three years ago, and now our sales are going through the roof."
The wholesale price, $14 to $20 for a kilogram of dried root (2.2 pounds), nearly doubled in the last few years, Mr. Smith said. Kava has become the subject of several popular books, and numerous Web sites sell it.
Scientific trials of kava have been conducted overseas, especially in Germany, and have found it helpful in alleviating anxiety and easing symptoms of menopause, like hot flashes, sleep disturbances and emotional problems. The active ingredients are chemicals called kavalactones, which have a mildly depressing effect on the nervous system. The German researchers found no side effects or withdrawal symptoms when people stopped taking kava.
But important questions about kava have yet to be answered. It is not known whether the products sold in the United States have the same properties as the ones tested in Germany or the traditional kava-based drinks prepared fresh in the Pacific. Researchers also do not know whether kava can be used safely for a long time or whether it can be combined with other drugs or natural products. Because it depresses the nervous system, some doctors warn patients not to take it with alcohol or drugs like Valium that have the same effect.
Kava is not totally benign. Road signs on some Pacific islands warn people not to drink kava and drive. In addition, there have been rare instances of kava abuse among Pacific islanders, resulting in problems with the skin and liver. All apparently clear up when the person gives up kava.
The original kava is a far cry from the hermetically sealed bottles now stocked in American health food stores. An 18th-century traveler to Polynesia wrote that kava was prepared in a "most disgustful manner." The freshly dug roots were cut up and chewed (preferably by virgins), spat into a communal bowl and mixed with coconut milk or water. The resulting fluid was then strained and passed around. People had such a good time drinking kava that Christian missionaries tried to ban it.
On some islands, kava was pounded rather than chewed. Traditionally, only men drank it. Westerners who have tried kava say it is bitter and tastes like dirt. It also numbs the mouth. In his book, "Kava: Medicine Hunting in Paradise" (Park Street Press, 1996), Chris Kilham wrote that he was glad he had worn shoes to a kava bar on Vanuatu, because the patrons did so much spitting to get the taste of kava out of their mouths that there wasn't a dry spot on the floor.
Needless to say, the kava sold in the United States is not prepared in the traditional manner. The roots are dried and ground by machines into a powder that can be sold as is, for blending into drinks; put into pills or capsules, or made into an alcohol-based extract.
Dr. Michael J. Balick, curator of the Institute of Economic Botany at the New York Botanical Garden, said the demand for kava was leading growers in Micronesia to begin cultivating upland forests that should be preserved as watersheds. The Nature Conservancy, he said, is trying to encourage the growers to use low-lying tracts that are not so critical to the region.
Kava is sold not as a drug but as a dietary supplement and, as a result, is largely exempt from the control of the Food and Drug Administration. Supplements, unlike drugs, do not have to be proved safe and effective and are not tested or inspected by any regulatory agency. The F.D.A. does not usually investigate a supplement unless people report problems. The agency has no evidence of health problems caused by kava, a spokeswoman said.
Under F.D.A. rules, manufacturers may not claim that their supplements can treat or prevent disease. They can, however, make so-called structure-function claims, saying, for instance, that a product promotes strong bones or supports the immune system.
For kava, Mr. Smith of Herb Pharm said: "We can make somewhat nebulous claims. We can say it enhances well-being, but we can't say it relieves anxiety." Nonetheless, he said, people are buying it in the hope that it will ease anxiety.
If he could say anything he wanted, Mr. Smith said: "I would love to put on the label that it could be used for relieving anxiety. I know it does."
An Internet site devoted to inquiries about kava listed 660 messages in early October. The writers ranged from people seeking help with anxiety to those looking for a new way to get high. Some described the results as pleasant, but others called kava useless. One wrote: "Got nothing from the first few small hits, then I downed the remaining two-thirds of the bottle and got a very mild, slightly relaxing effect for a couple hours."
Dr. Roberta Lee, an internist in Tucson, Ariz., who became familiar with kava while practicing medicine in the Pacific, was not surprised by that story. There is no way of knowing how much active ingredient was in the product, she said, or how high the person's anxiety level might have been.
Still, Dr. Lee recommends kava to some of her patients. She said its effects were subtle, and that she urged her patients to use brands from large European manufacturers, which she declined to name. Because kava is considered a drug in Europe, she said, it is more carefully regulated than in the United States.
"I worry about patients having access to these herbal medications without a prescription or any regulation or even general advice," she said. "People in health-food stores are giving advice, and they're not pharmacists or medical people."
Dr. Lee would like to see the European studies of kava repeated in the United States. "I want to know what works on a sort of moderate anxiety level," she said. "My hunch is that it probably wouldn't be appropriate for someone with very major anxiety."
Ultimately, she said, if kava does prove useful, it will be "just one tool" in treating anxiety, along with diet, exercise, counseling and other forms of therapy.

Photo/Chart: "Remedy for Anxiety Has Long History"
 
Although kava is emerging now in American stores as a natural remedy for stress and anxiety, it has had a long and important role in societies of the South Pacific Islands.
 
THE HISTORY
Early uses
The kava root has been used in the South Pacific Islands for more than 3,000 years in ritual ceremonies for spiritual, medicinal and recreational purposes. It is deeply integrated into the culture of these societies.
 
The Captain Cook travels
Kava was first described by a Swedish botanist who accompanied Capt. James Cook in his maiden voyage to the South Pacific from 1768-1771.

A Harvest of Gold
 There may be gold on them thar hills. A team of New Zealand scientists has induced plants to accumulate gold in their tissues by growing them on ore. If the price is right, the researchers say, it may be economically feasible to "mine" gold by growing chicory, say, on a pile of mining waste. The idea of using plants to remove metals from soil is not unheard of. Certain species known as "heavy accumulators" have been used to clean contaminants from polluted sites. But the researchers, reporting in the journal Nature, say their studies appear to be the first evidence of significant accumulation of gold by plants. 
 The researchers grew chicory, mustard and other species on gold ore treated with ammonium thiocyanate, used in mining to make the metal soluble. After several weeks, the plants were harvested and tested. Depending on the plant, the ore and the amount of compound used, gold was found in concentrations up to about 20 parts per million. At that rate, with current gold prices of about $300 an ounce, a field of greens would yield enough gold to more than pay the cost of treating the soil, the researchers say. If the price rises, they say, gold farming could become even more feasible.
 
Color Switch
How does a butterfly change its stripes? Scientists at the University of Wisconsin have found a biochemical switch that does the job.
The researchers studied the Eastern swallowtail butterfly, which usually develops a pattern of yellow and black stripes on the wings. But some females appear in basic black, mimicking another kind of swallowtail that is unpalatable to birds.
Butterfly wings are made of tiny scales that are colored individually, just before the butterfly emerges from its chrysalis. Colored pigments are deposited first, then black ones. The researchers isolated an enzyme, DDC, that controls the pigmentation process. In the Eastern swallowtail, it is active early in yellow tissues and later in black ones. But in the all-black variety, it shuts down during the early phase, preventing the production of yellow pigment. The scales that would have been yellow are then colored black when the enzyme "switch" turns on again.
 
A Methane Rain
Intermittent clouds with a chance of methane showers. That is the forecast for Titan, Saturn's huge moon, astronomers in Arizona and Hawaii say.
From the Voyager 1 observations of Titan in 1980, the moon is known to have a thick atmosphere of nitrogen and methane. But all that gas has also obscured what goes on in the lower reaches of the atmosphere. Scientists have theorized that the moon might have a liquid cycle with clouds, rain and seas, of methane rather than water. But more recent analyses indicate that Titan's climate might be drier and less dynamic than previously thought.
The new data, gathered with a telescope and a spectroscope that use narrow bands of near-infrared wavelengths to "see" through the upper atmosphere, indicate the presence of transient methane clouds at 5 to 25 kilometers above the surface.
 
Moving to New Fields
Most people with degrees in science and engineering do not have science or engineering jobs, according to a study by the National Science Foundation. Using 1995 data, the foundation reported that 2.6 million people with science and engineering degrees held jobs in the field, while 4.7 million with the degrees worked outside the field.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
What upheaval in the world's financial markets? National advertisers are upbeat on the economy.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

DATELINE: NAPLES, Fla.

 BODY:
A LUXURY hotel on the Gulf of Mexico has little in common with a home on the range. But the 89th annual conference of the Association of National Advertisers, held at the Ritz-Carlton here, shared with that little house on the prairie the absence of discouraging words.
The recent events that have rocked the world's financial markets, which have newspapers publishing and newscasters uttering phrases like "unnerving panic," "how low can it go?" and "rapid selling," were barely mentioned at the general sessions of the conference, which ended on Sunday night. 
 It was only in response to a question after an upbeat speech, for instance, that Robert A. Eckert, president and chief executive of the Kraft Foods unit of the Philip Morris Companies, confirmed a report this week in the trade publication Advertising Age that his company had "scaled back some brand advertising" spending for the fourth quarter.
And when the worldwide financial difficulties were discussed, as in a speech by Harry S. Dent Jr., a financial consultant and author, the outlook was uniformly rosy; Mr. Dent, for example, burbled about the Dow Jones industrial average reaching 35,000 by 2008.
Still, with increasingly common forecasts of a slowdown in economic growth, if not outright recession, the topic was on the minds of attendees at the conference. In interviews, they described themselves as cautiously optimistic that the damage would be contained.
Next year "will be a softer year relative to other years," said Ave Butensky, president of the Television Bureau of Advertising, "with a very modest increase in ad rates of 2 to 3 percent for television stations. But we see a pretty good 2000."
"You're not supposed to advertise when business is coming in over the transom," he added. "You're supposed to advertise when business is hard to get."
Joseph W. Ostrow, president of the Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau, said that if a recession led to cutbacks in spending on advertising, "I could even argue the point that cable would get a bigger share of a diminished pie" because of the growth in cable network ratings.
"The astute marketer looks at a recession as a time to build share," he said, "when the competition may be pulling in their horns."
Marnie Delaney, senior vice president and director for advertising and marketing communications at Bank of America, a unit of the BankAmerica Corporation, agreed.
"Everyone recognizes the value of brands these days," Ms. Delaney said. "I'm not sure we can afford not to invest in our brand very aggressively."
David G. Ropes, director for corporate advertising and integrated marketing at the Ford Motor Company, said the auto maker "remains committed to brand-building advertising regardless of the economic climate."
"The company has become a strong believer in branding, so there's absolutely no intention to cut spending," he said.
Several parts of the conference were devoted to interactive advertising and marketing, which prompted this thought: If the economy falls into recession, will spending on pitches on the Internet be reduced in a variation on the last-hired, first-fired school of recession employment attrition?
"Most new enterprises need to be protected," said John H. Costello, the 1998-99 chairman of the Advertiser Association, who is also senior executive vice president and general marketing manager at Sears, Roebuck & Company.
"What I worry about," he added, "is if we as an industry will continue to experiment with and test" new media "when we have tough times."
"We're entering our Darwinian period in marketing, where results will be king," Mr. Costello said. "Boom times or recession, those media that demonstrate return on investment will capture a greater portion of marketing dollars."
Denis F. Beausejour, vice president for advertising at the Procter & Gamble Company, is at the forefront of interactive marketing as the catalyst for FAST Forward, an Internet industry coalition dedicated to accelerating the development of digital advertising.
"It's hard to say what will actually happen" with the economy, Mr. Beausejour said. "I don't think any of us has a clear sense of where bottom is."
But he added: "We normally don't cut experimentation and research and development when times are tough. We're more likely in times of trouble to look at extremely different ways to solve problems."
And "if consumers cut discretionary spending," Mr. Beausejour said, staying home rather than going out, "I would bet time on line might go up."
Whatever the outcome of the current economic problems, some things never change. Among them are the annual election of officers and bestowing of awards at advertising industry conferences.
Mr. Costello, who had been the 1997-98 vice chairman of the association, was elected chairman on Friday morning.
He succeeded James J. Garrity, senior vice president for advertising and brand management at the First Union National Bank, a unit of the First Union Corporation, who had been the 1997-98 chairman.
Joseph V. Tripodi, executive vice president for global marketing at Mastercard International, was elected vice chairman for 1998-99.
On the awards front, Matthew J. Dee, advertising production director at Wendy's International Inc., was presented the Robert V. Goldstein Award for his work as volunteer campaign director for the 4-H public service ads from the Advertising Council. The award is named for a former board member of the association and the council.
The conference also featured the presentation of the third annual Casie Awards for effective interactive advertising and marketing. Casie is the Coalition for Advertising Supported Information and Entertainment, founded by the Advertiser Association and the American Association of Advertising Agencies.
P.& G. won for best interactive product ad for a campaign for Scope mouthwash designed with Blue Marble ACG, a unit of MacManus Group, which had a "click rate" among computer users of 30 percent. The John Hancock Variable Life Insurance Company, part of Hancock Mutual Life Insurance, won for best interactive service ad for work produced by the Modem Media.Poppe Tyson unit of True North Communications.
The award for the best packaged goods Web site went to Avon Products Inc. for a site that was developed by Think New Ideas, part of the Communicade unit of Omnicom Group.
The award for the best corporate Web site went to the Dell Computer Corporation for a site by the Grey Interactive unit of Grey Advertising, which now generates an average of $6 million a day in computer sales.
And the trade publication Brandweek presented its Marketer of the Year Awards for 1998 at a dinner at the conference. The top honor, Grand Marketer, chosen from among winners in 16 categories, went to Steve Wilhite, senior marketing executive for the Volkswagen of America unit of Volkswagen A.G., for the introduction of the new Beetle.
It turned out to be a farewell honor for Mr. Wilhite; Advertising Age reported that he would be leaving Volkswagen after nine years, effective on Jan. 1, and would move to his hometown of San Diego from the Detroit area.

Chanel to Start a Line: Beige
Karl Lagerfeld, who is not about to let Chanel become a fashion relic -- a fate that has befallen many French houses -- will introduce the Chanel Beige label collection for fall and winter 1999. 
 Mr. Lagerfeld said he hopes to bring a fresh, casual spin to the Chanel line. "Today, you need sportswear-looking things," he said. "It's for another way of dressing. I wanted to do a sports line because I want to use modern materials."
Chanel has stood alone among major labels without a lower-price category; this move is sure to attract the attention of retailers and customers.
Talks with Daryl Kerrigan, who is based in New York, to collaborate on the line, fell through, Mr. Lagerfeld said. But another collaborator has been found, and Mr. Lagerfeld said he would announce the name after the Chanel show scheduled here for Oct. 16.
The introduction comes at a moment when several designer collections are lowering prices to cope with the economic turmoil in Asia. This line will help expand Chanel's price range, which is typically well over $1,000 for an outfit.
The name Beige grew out of the lore of Coco Chanel. "It's Beige label because Chanel in the 20's was called the queen of beige," Mr. Lagerfeld said.
"I hate to say it's second," he added. "I hate everything that's second -- second in line, second rate. It's a sport line."
 
Designer Raises His Profile
Up the street from the hip store Colette, and the hipper still Hotel Costes, Marcel Marongiu has opened his first shop at 203 rue St.-Honore. Mr. Marongiu has been a reliably innovative designer on the French fashion landscape for almost 10 years, even if his name has not zoomed to its uppermost reaches.
In New York, his clothes are carried in If boutique in SoHo. His new store, which opened yesterday, gives Mr. Marongiu the opportunity to present his whole vision, including ready-to-wear, sleek architectural handbags, shoes and CD wallets.
Mr. Marongiu's clothes fall within that hard-to-find middle ground of urban edginess and utter wearability. Early on, he made stretch sportswear one of his signatures, and the store features ink-black, body-conscious sleeveless sweaters and asymmetrically cut accordian-pleated skirts with diagonal zippers.
"Today, a shop is really important for a designer line," Mr. Marongiu said. "Everything becomes clearer to the customer. Otherwise, you just have a few racks in the corner of a store somewhere."
 
Calvin Klein's Photographer
Calvin Klein has hired Mario Testino, the photographer best known for his sexually charged work with the Gucci advertising campaigns, to shoot the Calvin Klein spring 1999 campaign for his top collection, as well as for CK and the jeans line for men and women.
This is the first time the designer, whose campaigns are often a fashion and cultural bellwether, will work with Mr. Testino.
Their new alliance ends, at least temporarily, a long-running collaboration between Mr. Klein and the photographer Steven Meisel.
"I want to be able to communicate the feeling of sensuality of the woman in this campaign," Mr. Klein said. "I felt this is a moment when I can say what I want to say with Mario."
Mr. Klein said he has been deeply involved with the new ads, speaking with Mr. Testino almost daily and flying to the set in Paris.
By contrast, he did not go on shoots with Mr. Meisel, who is well known for making his sets off-limits to designers. "I've always found it best if I'm on the shoot," Mr. Klein said. "I'm involved with the photography, the styling. This is the way I worked with Irving Penn and Dick Avedon."
Mr. Testino's star has been rising in fashion circles in the last two years: he first shot for Gucci and then did several spreads for Vogue.
The Calvin Klein campaign, which is being styled with Carine Roitfeld, a frequent collaborator of Mr. Testino's, is something he was eager to work on, he said.
"I've always said to my brother, who is my agent, that I wanted to work with Calvin because he likes modern, sexy girls," Mr. Testino said. "When I think of Calvin, I always think of Brooke Shields."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Chrysler Net Rises 54%, Beating Forecasts

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 12

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation posted a much-better-than-expected 54.6 percent increase in third-quarter net profits today as the turmoil in global financial markets seemed to be having surprisingly little effect on the Big Three auto makers' domestic sales and profits.
Chrysler announced that it had earned $682 million in the third quarter, or $1.02 a share, up from $441 million, or 65 cents a share, a year earlier. According to First Call, which tracks earnings estimates, the consensus forecast was for Chrysler to earn 87 cents a share. 
 Gary C. Valade, Chrysler's chief financial officer, said that with the auto markets strong the company had spent less than expected on discounts. Warranty expenses and other costs also dropped, he added, and the introduction of the redesigned Jeep Grand Cherokee went smoothly.
Chrysler benefited little from a strike last summer that left General Motors dealers with few cars and light trucks to sell, said Thomas T. Stallkamp, Chrysler's president. Chrysler was already selling its popular sport utility vehicles as fast as it could build them and had little ability to increase production, he said.
Chrysler executives said today that the stock market's contraction had not yet hurt auto sales. James P. Holden, the company's executive vice president for sales and marketing, said at a luncheon last week that he had begun racing the company's chairman, Robert J. Eaton, to the fax machine each morning for the daily sales report and had found no weakness yet in sales.
The General Motors Corporation is expected to announce strike-depressed earnings on Tuesday. The Ford Motor Company is widely expected to post an increase in profits on Wednesday. At a lunch with reporters today, John G. Middlebrook, the general manager of Chevrolet, G.M.'s biggest division, said that Chevrolet had found no correlation so far between sharp drops in the stock market and the level of auto sales in the following days.
"We had an extremely strong close to the month of September right in the middle of the turmoil in the market," Mr. Middlebrook said.
Wendy Beale Needham, an auto analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, the New York investment bank, said that while the market turmoil may be causing some people on Wall Street to worry about their jobs, overall employment is high across the nation and people are spending money on cars accordingly.
"I don't see any evidence of a slowdown," Mrs. Needham said. "You keep thinking it has to change, but there hasn't been any change yet."
Chrysler's sales outside the United States and Canada tumbled 21 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier. But that barely hurt the company because only 7 percent of its sales are overseas. Chrysler's total sales rose to $15.0 billion in the third quarter from $13.2 billion in the comparable period a year earlier.
Although the average discount per vehicle in the United States rose to $1,280 from $1,140 a year earlier, it was down from earlier this year.
Chrysler is scheduled to merge next month with Daimler-Benz A.G., which would make today's earnings report Chrysler's last as an independent company. Some version of Chrysler's profits will still be calculated, though, because the company's profit-sharing plans require it, Mr. Valade said.
Mr. Stallkamp said that Chrysler had focused on further cost reductions and new model introductions, "even while the three-ring circus of the merger is going on around us."
With fierce competition preventing auto makers from raising prices in line with inflation, the Big Three have all been cutting costs vigorously. Mr. Valade said during a conference call with reporters that Chrysler had cut pretax costs by $300 million in the third quarter from the second quarter, notably through lower warranty expenses and lower costs for raw materials and other outside purchases.
Chrysler's profits in the third quarter of last year were depressed by a $25 million after-tax charge for the closing of its Eagle car brand. Excluding that charge, profits would have risen during the third quarter of this year by 46.4 percent from a year earlier.
Ford, which is also expecting strong profits, announced today that it would develop one of the broadest programs ever to link employees' compensation to their personal performance and the attainment of various companywide goals, as well as the corporation's overall results. Ford already gives bonuses linked to performance and profits to its 5,000 top executives. Existing profit-sharing plans for an additional 50,000 white-collar employees will now vary as well with the attainment of individual and corporate targets, such as quality and customer satisfaction, Ford said.
Ford's blue-collar employees already have a profit-sharing plan, the details of which are specified by a contract with the United Automobile Workers union.

HEADLINE: The Icarus Complex

BYLINE: By Edward Tenner; Edward Tenner, a visiting researcher in the geosciences department at Princeton, is a speaker and the author of "Why Things Bite Back: Technology and the Revenge of Unintended Consequences."

 BODY:
We've seen "Taxes for Dummies" and "The Complete Idiot's Guide to DOS." This year many leading intellects seem to need a simplifying book or two of their own.
It was surely an omen when in January the first commercial cloning proposal came not from some shady clinic operator but from a Chicago physicist who described himself as a "near-genius." More recently, the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, run by people so venerated that many investors didn't feel the need to know the details of their operation, ran into multibillion-dollar trouble. Meanwhile, Alan Greenspan, the equally venerated Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and legions of gifted finance ministers and central bankers have not begun to resolve the underlying crisis. 
 How could high intellect go so wrong? Easy. Brilliance is dangerous. It tempts those who have it to pronouncements that outrun experience and even common sense. President Clinton, close to the top of his Yale Law School class, will now have months to explain how he outsmarted Paula Jones's lawyers with his ingeniously crafted, technically accurate statements.
In the hard sciences, overconfidence led the physicist Lord Kelvin to argue against the feasibility of heavier-than-air flight, and the transistor pioneer William Shockley to assert genetic racial superiority. In economics, it drew one of America's outstanding thinkers, Irving Fisher, into the 1920's stock market boom; a week before the October 1929 crash he proclaimed that equities seemed to have reached "a permanently high plateau." The 1930's were not kind to Fisher, whose bold proposals for recovery perhaps understandably went unheeded and whose well-earned professional reputation has only recently been restored.
Brilliance has other pitfalls, too. It can dangerously override tact, as the often acerbic J. Robert Oppenheimer discovered when some previous previous targets of his intellect left him to his fate in the McCarthy era.
And when enough smart people compete with each other, they drive returns down for themselves: expert race track handicappers, according to one study by Canadian psychologists, make no more money than random bettors, probably thanks to the parimutuel system, in which all winners divide one pot. Long-Term Capital, whose principals included the Nobel Prize winners Myron Scholes and Robert Merton, may have suffered some of this fate. Their prize citation lauded their options pricing method for making possible "more efficient risk management in society." The spread of sophisticated models makes it difficult to retain a proprietary advantage for long.
Indeed, technology gives leverage to pride. Consider racing drivers, the elite of the road in brains, reflexes and experience. It's not surprising that they get more speeding tickets than others; what's interesting is that they also crash more often, according to studies summarized by Leonard Evans in "Traffic Safety and the Driver." Their sense of confidence is usually justified, but their training may encourage them to take risks that others would shun. (Of course, as Dr. Evans points out, racing attracts risk-loving people.)
Computer technicians are equally brilliant in their own territory: the cluttered but delicate innards of a PC case. But a friend in the business reports that it isn't the intimidated novice who inadvertently destroys chips and other equipment with static electricity; it's the self-assured pro whose knowledge encourages him to cut a corner when pressed for time.
The perils of hardware are nothing, though, compared with the traps that software sets for the elite user. The problem is seldom a bug in the computer code. More often it is the overconfidence that the speed and power of computers can give to flawed calculations. Brilliant people almost certainly make fewer routine errors than ordinary users. But their intellect lets them build models so complex that intuitive, back-of-the-envelope tests are impossible.
The brilliant person may well be right in the long run, but may be unable to weather a short-term anomaly like a steep market drop followed by a rebound. And the smarter people are, the more they are able to borrow, the greater their exposure. No wonder the former head of British Mensa, the organization for people with high I.Q.'s, is trying to start a rival organization for people gifted in more than pure intelligence.
Back in the 1950's, Monsanto, now a colossus of biotechnology, circulated a documentary film promoting careers in chemistry and featuring a laboratory with three young men in white coats conferring and the voice-over, "No geniuses here, just a bunch of average Americans working together." Now, steady, corporate types seem to be coming back into fashion. Pundits are rediscovering the virtues of William Howard Taft.
But the brilliant need not hide their light under a bushel. It's not brains or even pride that's the real problem. It is the crucial and neglected role of assumptions in technologically driven systems where surprises are multiplying. To thrive, intelligence must retain a relentless capacity for wonder. Napoleon's downfall began, as the poet Paul Valery observed, when he was no longer astonished.

HEADLINE: And Then There Will Be Two;
Set toSplit Its Last Units, Tenneco Tries to Please Wall St.

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
Just how focused must a company be? And how much does it have to cut before Wall Street is happy?
These are the questions that the directors of Tenneco Inc. will ponder when they meet today at the company's headquarters in Greenwich, Conn. No one expects them to announce any decisions yet. But as the day wears on, they will most likely decide how to jettison Tenneco's money-losing corrugated and containerboard mills. Then the board will probably set a timetable for splitting the remaining businesses -- specialty packaging and automotive parts -- into two companies. 
 It will be Tenneco's final attempt to slim down to fighting weight. The company, founded in 1940 as the Tennessee Gas and Transmission Company, a pipeline company, spent its first 50 years growing into a sprawling conglomerate with businesses as far-flung as shipbuilding, energy and agricultural equipment. And it has spent the last five years whittling itself down, from six businesses to four and now two.
Each time, Tenneco figured Wall Street would embrace it as a stronger, better-focused company. Each time, Wall Street declared it an out-of-step hodgepodge doing too little, too late. Even in July, when Tenneco first publicly floated the idea that it would split, its stock rallied just a bit, then sank.
This time, the board is expected to call it quits on the whole conglomerate notion, probably by spinning the remaining two businesses to shareholders.
"I thought investors would see a mini-conglomerate made up of two superb performers, and think two plus two equals five," said Dana G. Mead, Tenneco's chief executive. "They still think two plus two equals three. So we are probably looking at the holding company's liquidation."
Tenneco is unlikely to carry out, or even publicize, a decision to rip itself in two until the stock market improves. But clearly, it is poised to join ITT and Westinghouse in the dustbin of conglomerate history, reduced, like the Cheshire Cat in "Through the Looking Glass," to a fading smile.
There is no guarantee that investors will apply more favorable equations to the separate companies. But history should give them cheer. The Case Corporation, once Tenneco's agricultural equipment subsidiary, did a lot better after Tenneco overhauled it and sprung it loose in 1994. And while Case's stock has slipped badly in the last six months, analysts say investors were reacting to the turmoil in the company's Asian markets, not to its management.
"Individual companies are always more focused, and thus more formidable competitors," said George L. Staphos, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.
Still, automotive parts and packaging are cyclical, slow-growth businesses. Moreover, diversified companies generally have higher credit ratings than single-business ones, and it remains unclear which of the two spinoffs will acquire the lion's share of Tenneco's $3.2 billion in debt.
"They might run into problems meeting debt obligations if they are split apart," warned Brian L. Eisenbarth, an analyst with the brokerage firm of Collins & Company.
For now, the businesses seem robust. Both units enjoy above-average margins in their industries. Tenneco Automotive, whose brands include Monroe shock absorbers and Walker mufflers, has acquired some 20 other companies since 1994, and earned $407 million on $3.2 billion in revenue last year. Tenneco Packaging, which makes Baggies and Hefty bags, has also grown rapidly, earning $372 million on $4 billion in sales last year.
Spinoffs generally do better, both in profits and share price, when freed from their parents. Lucent Technologies, for example, has been able to capture a higher stock valuation after it left AT&T, and many chemical companies have done better without their pharmaceutical parents.
"Analysts have difficulty understanding multi-industry companies," said Robert F. Greenhill, chairman of Greenhill & Company, an investment bank which is advising Tenneco.
Maybe so -- but that has not depressed multiples at General Electric, Allied Signal, Textron, or other modern-day conglomerates. Some investors say it is Tenneco itself, not its diversity, that is the problem.
"The moment Case spun off from Tenneco, its performance started to improve," said Warren E. Spitz, a portfolio manager of the Prudential Equity Income Fund, an investor in Case. "Tenneco just never seems to wring profitability out of businesses it keeps."
The prospect of a Tenneco split has not whetted investor appetite for Tenneco shares. Since December 1996, when the company became two businesses, the stock has fallen 26.5 percent, to $33.4375, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has risen 34.7 percent. Tenneco's price-earnings ratio is 14.4, trailing the 23.7 average for the S.& P. 500.
"Their multiple stinks because Wall Street understands exactly who they are and what they are doing, and none of us buys into it," said Joel Tiss, an analyst with Lehman Brothers Holdings.
Such harsh criticism is not universal among analysts. Many others say that Mr. Mead and his troops have worked wonders with what had been a badly managed company. "They squeeze the most profits out of their revenue dollars," Mr. Eisenbarth of Collins said.
If that is so, then the dissolution of Tenneco as a conglomerate shows that once Wall Street loses confidence in a company, even a cost-conscious, investor-sensitive management cannot always regain it.
Tenneco's actions this decade could have come out of a how-to manual for appeasing shareholders. Under the supervision of an independent board -- Mr. Mead is the only inside director -- Tenneco has peeled off layers of businesses.
Out, too, went many of the corporate frills for which Tenneco was known in Houston, its former hometown. The 85-foot yacht, the two country clubs, the 30-story headquarters building -- all are gone. Gone too are 10 of its 13 aircraft. Its headquarters staff, once 350 people, is down to 70, and Mr. Mead is aiming for 45 by the end of the year.
Free company cars and other such luxuries have been replaced by executive compensation programs that include mandatory ownership of stock. Mr. Mead took his bonus in Tenneco options last year, and says that he will not profit on them until Tenneco stock reaches $52 a share.
With roughly $13 billion in cash available, Tenneco has since 1992 paid down $9 billion in debt, bought back $1 billion in stock and shored up its remaining businesses with nearly $3 billion in acquisitions.
Mr. Mead has pledged to keep pruning and reinvesting. In July he promised to cut another $100 million out of Tenneco's annual costs. He says he will probably sell the old 80,000-square-foot Henry Luce mansion in Greenwich, which Tenneco made its corporate home in 1996.
It is the kind of streamlining that Tenneco's board had begged, in vain, for management to carry out in the 1980's. In 1988, Tenneco sold its oil business for more than $8 billion in cash -- and promptly sank most of it into expanding Case, just as demand for agricultural equipment was falling. Soon after, Tenneco expanded its Newport News Shipbuilding division just as the cold war was ending. And it refused to drop its Albright & Wilson chemical subsidiary, which was plagued with environmental liabilities.
By the end of 1991, Tenneco was trying to service $11 billion in debt with just $13 billion in revenue. The board ousted the chief executive, James L. Ketelsen, and recruited Michael H. Walsh from Union Pacific to take his place.
"Mike was a charismatic, mesmerizing executive who knew how to turn a business upside down," said Felix Rohatyn, then a partner of Lazard Freres, once Tenneco's investment bankers, and now Ambassador to France.
Mr. Walsh hired Mr. Mead, then an executive of the International Paper Company, and charged him with solving the Case problem. Mr. Mead cut the number of tractors Case made, trimmed overhead and reduced production errors.
Tenneco continued whipping subsidiaries into shape. It got Newport News back into the market for submarines, then spun it, and $600 million in Tenneco debt, to shareholders. The company negotiated a tax-free merger of its remaining energy business with the El Paso Energy Corporation, receiving $900 million in El Paso stock and shifting $3.4 billion in Tenneco debt to El Paso.
"They got one hell of a lot more for all these businesses than any of us had expected," said W. Michael Blumenthal, a Tenneco director since 1985 who was Treasury Secretary in the Carter Administration.
The breakups were torturous. Like so many multinational conglomerates, Tenneco had organized itself for maximum tax benefits, not operational efficiency. "We'd form companies to hold assets, and we'd have subsidiaries of subsidiaries," said Robert T. Blakely, Tenneco's chief financial officer.
Case operated as a stand-alone company in several foreign countries and had to be unified before it could be sold. Many other subsidiaries had interlocking assets, so that a subsidiary in Germany owned Tenneco's real estate in California.
All of those problems landed at Mr. Mead's feet in 1993, when Mr. Walsh developed brain cancer. Mr. Mead, who had been Mr. Inside to Mr. Walsh's Mr. Outside, became chief executive in February 1994 and chairman three months later, when Mr. Walsh died.
Mr. Walsh is still missed by Tenneco old-timers, but many say Mr. Mead fills his shoes well. "Mike had the vision, the personality, the leadership skills," said Peter T. Flawn, who just retired from Tenneco's board. "But Dana was always better at execution, and he has really grown into the C.E.O.'s role."
It may be a short tenure nonetheless. Mr. Mead could become chairman of either packaging or automotive when they are split apart. Or he could be non-executive chairman of both. But he is 62 years old, and people close to him say he is most likely to retire after a split.
Assuming the debt burden remains manageable, the businesses should be able to fend for themselves. Most automotive-parts companies were hurt by the General Motors strike this summer, and the packaging industry has been hurt by Asia's economic meltdown. But analysts say that Tenneco's units have weathered the problems at least as well as their competition.
"We've taken advantage of consolidation opportunities all over the globe, and we're probably just one big acquisition away from doubling our sales," said Thomas E. Evans, president of Tenneco Automotive.
Tenneco Packaging has been a high flyer since 1995, when it bought the Mobil Corporation's plastics business and its Hefty and Baggies brands, for $1.27 billion. Tenneco has since added a zipper-lock bag, the Hefty One Zip, and has persuaded many delicatessens to use it for take-out sandwiches. Tenneco has also expanded its protective packaging and flexible packaging lines.
"We're going to double this business by 2001," said Paul T. Stecko, Tenneco's chief operating officer. "We'll do it if we're part of Tenneco or of another company. But being a pure play will still be the best thing for our stock."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Still Another Hedge Fund Seems to Be in Financial Peril

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
Turbulence in the bond markets continues to wreak havoc among some of the most sophisticated investors. Ellington Capital Management, an Old Greenwich, Conn., investment firm created by a star mortgage bond trader, has unloaded hundreds of millions of dollars of mortgage-related securities in the last two days.
In response to margin calls from its lenders, the firm appears to have been forced to liquidate much of the holdings in its hedge funds, while developing a plan with some of its lenders that would allow it to remain in business. 
 Ellington manages about $1 billion in capital, although it invests more by borrowing additional funds. Like other hedge funds, which are aimed at wealthy individuals and institutional investors like pension funds, Ellington is secretive about its investment strategy and has tended to disclose little about how it achieves its results.
Founded late in 1994 by Michael Vranos, a former senior managing director at Kidder, Peabody & Company, the firm specializes in investing in mortgage-related securities. Mr. Vranos's skill at trading mortgage bonds won him fame and a staggering pay package reported to be about $15 million in 1993, before higher interest rates the following year helped cause sizable losses at the firm. Kidder was later sold to Paine Webber.
Ellington, which declined to comment specifically on the events of the last few days, confirmed that it had been selling many of its holdings. A spokesman said the firm was "involved in a concentrated effort to respond to liquidity constraints in the mortgage-backed securities markets." Ellington "conducted an orderly sale of certain of its holdings that will produce proceeds far in excess of dealer-financing claims on those securities, when cleared," the spokesman said.
Mr. Vranos, who did not comment on the recent events, did say that the firm's partners were "doing everything we can to protect our investors."
Like other prominent managers, including John W. Meriwether of Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund that just received a multibillion-dollar bailout, Mr. Vranos has proven no match for a rough ride in the bond markets. By borrowing money in hope of enhancing returns, many of these managers have instead amplified their losses at a time when skittish investors were retreating to Treasuries. That has caused the value of a variety of bonds, whether in emerging markets or tied to mortgages, to fall sharply.
Ellington's sales appear to have been conducted under pressure from lenders; margin calls were made last Friday after the price of the firm's holdings dropped earlier in the week. In order to meet those calls, and prevent future ones, the firm began selling some of its holdings, holding three auctions.
The list of securities offered for sale was extensive and seemed to be widely distributed, according to Steven R. Point, a bond manager at the Glenmede Trust Company in Philadelphia. "There was everything, including the kitchen sink in it," he remarked.
Lenders, like banks and brokerage firms, which normally might lend a hand in scooping up some of these investments, seemed eager to find other buyers, he noted. "Dealers are nervous about the extension of financing to these institutions," Mr. Point said.
Ellington's crisis appears to have developed suddenly. One of the firm's funds, Ellington Mortgage Partners, which accounts for roughly a third of its capital, had been reporting a gain of roughly 8 percent through September, according to Hedge Fund Research, a Chicago consulting firm. It had returns around 22 percent last year and 48 percent in 1996.
The mortgage-bond area has been among those hardest hit as interest rates plunged. The possibility that Long-Term Capital, which has also been forced to sell many of its holdings, could unload several billion dollars more in securities is further depressing the market, according to George P. Van, the chairman of Van Hedge Fund Advisers International in Nashville.
Like Mr. Meriwether at Long-Term Capital, Mr. Vranos had been through difficult times in the bond market before. But in previous tough times, both men worked for huge brokerage firms, which had substantial resources at their disposal, perhaps allowing them to weather rockiness. "The firm's capital surrounded them like a comforting cocoon," Mr. Van said.
In contrast, there is precious little protection in the current market environment, where worried lenders and investors alike are forcing managers to sell, pushing prices lower. "It is not over," Mr. Van said. "We have a domino effect."

HEADLINE: Lawsuits by Rivals Accuse Textile Makerof Corporate Espionage

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
John Hickey became suspicious as he reviewed the 16 detailed questions faxed by a graduate student.
For months, the student, Justin D. Waldrep, had been quizzing executives at his company, NRB Industries, a textile manufacturer, for what he said was a business school research paper. But the new questions seemed far more detailed than any student would need. Increasingly uncomfortable, Mr. Hickey decided to find out more about Mr. Waldrep. 
 With a few telephone calls, Mr. Hickey discovered he had reason to be concerned, according to a lawsuit filed by his company. Mr. Waldrep was not working on a research paper. He was not attending business school. He was not even a student. In its suit, the company reached one conclusion:
Mr. Waldrep was a corporate spy.
NRB Industries, which filed its lawsuit last year and has since settled, and another textile company, Johnston Industries, which filed a lawsuit last week in an Alabama state court, say that they were the targets of a corporate espionage operation conducted for a top competitor, Milliken & Company. According to the two lawsuits, Mr. Waldrep posed as a graduate student and another consultant posed as a representative of Swiss investors in order to steal confidential information from various manufacturers on behalf of Milliken, the largest private textile company in the nation.
Milliken paid the consultants more than $500,000 for detailed information on the customers, suppliers and manufacturing operations of nine textile companies, according to NRB's lawsuit.
Johnston executives say that Milliken used the stolen information to lure customers away after first reducing prices on some Milliken products. Milliken also introduced a fabric very similar to one manufactured by Johnston and then marketed it to Johnston's customers. Johnston executives say the small, publicly held company, whose products include fabrics for automobile and airplane seats, has lost millions of dollars in sales.
The accusations against Milliken are emerging as corporate espionage increasingly receives attention from lawmakers and executives. Some Government estimates put the total cost of such spying to American business as high as $250 billion a year. The two lawsuits also underscore that the biggest security threats faced by companies typically do not involve hackers electronically sneaking into corporate computers. Rather, the threats are often the people who are invited in.
"The area of greatest concern is letting people in the front door and giving them the keys to the kingdom," said Michael D. Allison at International Business Research in Princeton, N.J. "Companies forget that people can take information home in their heads."
In the case of NRB and Johnston Industries, the knock on their front doors came from Mr. Waldrep and his boss, Rodney A. Taylor. In a 24-page sworn statement filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, Mr. Waldrep, who agreed to cooperate with NRB after he was sued, detailed how Milliken had repeatedly hired the consulting firm, R. A. Taylor & Associates of Atlanta, to get information from its competitors and how he and Mr. Taylor then obtained that information.
In a statement, Milliken said it had hired R. A. Taylor "to obtain, through proper means, information about Milliken's markets and some of its competitors."
"When claims were made about the propriety of the collection techniques being used, Milliken ceased doing business with these consultants," the statement said.
But according to Mr. Waldrep's statement, Mr. Taylor told Milliken executives in late 1994, soon after the company hired him, that he would pretend to be an investment banker seeking investment opportunities on behalf of a Geneva bank. And in the spring of 1996, at a meeting at Milliken's headquarters, Mr. Taylor told other Milliken executives that the consultants would use a "two-pronged" approach in trying to get information from another textile company, Fab Industries, according to Mr. Waldrep's statement. Mr. Taylor had explained to the Milliken executives, Mr. Waldrep said, that he would try to get information from Fab executives by playing the role of an investment banker, while separately Mr. Waldrep would approach the company with claims of being a student.
Mr. Taylor said yesterday that he had not yet seen the Johnston Industries lawsuit. "So it would not be appropriate for me to comment," he said.
Mr. Waldrep did not return several messages left on his answering machine last week and yesterday.
NRB said it had "amicably resolved" its lawsuit against Milliken, Mr. Waldrep, R. A. Taylor and Mr. Taylor earlier this year. The terms were not disclosed.
In their statement, Milliken executives said they had been in discussions with lawyers for Johnston Industries about its claims and that they were "very surprised" to learn about the new lawsuit, which they plan to defend vigorously. A company spokesman said yesterday that he could not comment further because of the pending lawsuit.
Milliken, based in Spartanburg, S.C., is owned by Roger Milliken, a wealthy industrialist and frequent contributor to Republican and conservative causes.
According to NRB's lawsuit, Milliken hired the consultants to obtain information on at nine of its competitors, and told the two men not to tell anyone for whom they were working. Milliken and the consultants had code names like Project Gingko and Project Coconut for their attempts at gaining information for each company.
Jere Beasley, a lawyer representing Johnston Industries, said the company would not have discovered that its trade secrets had been stolen if NRB had not learned of a Project Meteor from Mr. Waldrep. Under that project, Mr. Waldrep asked a number of Johnston executives for information while posing as a student from Georgia State University. At the same time, Mr. Taylor had requested information, saying that he was representing a group of Swiss investors.
Executives at another textile company that Milliken had hired the consultants to get information on, Interface Inc. in Atlanta, said yesterday that they had also learned that it too had been a target of the consultants from NRB's lawsuit. Ray Willoch, the company's general counsel, said Interface was investigating the allegations.
For the NRB project, according to Mr. Waldrep's sworn statement, Mr. Taylor sent Mr. Waldrep to New York in the fall of 1996 to learn more about Columbia University so that he could act more convincing as a graduate student when he visited NRB's headquarters in the Empire State Building. For a few days, Mr. Waldrep toured the campus, sat in classes and obtained a temporary library card from Columbia's library.
When Mr. Waldrep first met Mr. Hickey, the NRB executive, he told him that he was involved in a transfer program that allowed Georgia State students to attend classes at Columbia. Mr. Waldrep said he was preparing a research paper for a corporate finance class and that he wanted to do the paper on NRB's recent merger.
Mr. Hickey gave Mr. Waldrep some of the information he requested after he agreed to sign confidentiality agreement. Mr. Waldrep promised that only his professor would see the information. When Mr. Hickey's secretary later requested proof that Mr. Waldrep was a student, the consultant produced a Georgia State University identification card that he had been issued as an undergraduate and one of Columbia's temporary library cards.
Two months later, Mr. Waldrep faxed Mr. Hickey a list of questions that he said his professor had requested. The questions, which had instead been requested by Milliken executives, included one asking about NRB's "new customer pursuits" and one on how NRB fostered their relationships with key suppliers, according to Mr. Waldrep's statement.
In a cover sheet faxed to Mr. Hickey with the 16 questions, Mr. Waldrep asked the executive to meet with him again. "I know you are busy, so I promise not to take up much of your time," he wrote. "My professor suggested that I bring a tape recorder with me so I don't have to waste time writing."
Experts say that corporate espionage is more common than the public knows because many cases are settled privately by companies seeking to avoid publicity and because most companies do not realize that information has been stolen.
In 1996, Congress made stealing trade secrets a Federal crime. So far, Federal prosecutors have pursued few such cases.
"Intellectual property is the only corporate asset that can be misappropriated, copied and intercepted although nothing may appear to be missing," said Richard J. Heffernan, a management consultant in Branford, Conn., who focuses on protecting against economic espionage.
Mr. Heffernan helped prepare a study for Congress that estimated that American companies may be losing $250 billion annually because of information that gets into the hands of competitors.

HEADLINE: Costly Fight Rages in California Over Indian Gambling Measure

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: HIGHLAND, Calif., Oct. 8

 BODY:
More than a century after Indian wars roiled the West, another battle is raging here over a ballot measure that would expand the state's $1.4 billion Indian gambling industry. It pits California's gaming tribes against an unlikely coalition of Nevada casinos, unions, church groups and other businesses in what may become the most expensive fight in California political history.
A visit to the San Manuel Indian Bingo and Casino on a patch of tribal land 60 miles east of Los Angeles makes the stakes clear. The afternoon sun is still high but the parking lot is filling fast, and inside the smoky 90,000-square-foot gambling hall, the hopeful already sit glued to most of the 1,000 video slot machines and to row after row of bingo tables. 
 This 24-hour no-frills casino is an economic miracle for the tiny San Manuel tribe, which once scratched out an income raising apricots and lived in shacks and trailers on a dusty 648-acre reservation. Now, 40 landscaped houses dot the hillsides behind the casino's walls, and security officers on bicycles patrol newly paved roads.
But the San Manuel Indians have a problem: They and about 40 other California tribes began installing slot machines over the last decade without first reaching compacts with the state, as required by Federal law. So Gov. Pete Wilson and Federal prosecutors consider their casinos illegal and have moved to shut them down.
In response, the gaming tribes are sponsoring a hotly contested ballot measure in the Nov. 3 election that would allow broad expansion of casino-style gaming on Indian lands statewide.
Already, the two sides have raised about $60 million and spent about $53 million, mostly for a barrage of competing television commercials. About $43 million has been raised by tribes, $22 million of it from the San Manuel tribe alone, while opponents, led by the casino operators at the Hilton Hotels Corporation and Mirage Resorts Inc., who fear untaxed Indian competition, have raised $15.5 million and spent $1 million more. The previous spending record for a single measure was $57.5 million on a securities fraud proposal two years ago.
Public polls have shown the gambling measure, Proposition 5, winning majority support among voters, many of whom are sympathetic to decades of Indian privation in a state that paid bounties for Indian body parts in the 1850's.
The gaming tribes contend that nothing less than their sovereignty and economic survival is at stake, and their advertisements feature members attesting that Indian gaming has broken the cycle of poverty.
"This is our livelihood," said Ken Ramirez, 38, vice-chairman of the San Manuel tribe, who grew up on the reservation when it held only a few families, with water too fetid to drink.
Mr. Ramirez declined to disclose the tribe's revenues from gaming, but noted that about 110 people now live on the reservation, where, with gambling proceeds, the tribe has drilled 16 deep wells and plans to market bottled water commercially.
Opponents of Proposition 5 accuse the gaming tribes of scare tactics. They say the tribes' campaign exaggerates the threat to Indian welfare and obscures the real menace of a measure that would allow the spread of gambling throughout the state, something many church groups oppose. Privately operated theme parks, race tracks and card rooms say Indian casinos would divert business from them yet provide few economic benefits over all because Indian casinos pay no taxes on their profits, though gamblers pay income taxes on their winnings.
"Frankly, I think it's an incredible con game," said Frank Schubert, who is managing the "No on 5" campaign for the Coalition Against Unregulated Gambling. "We've had millions and millions in TV ads bombarding the state for months now about reservations getting electricity and being able to have linoleum on a dirt floor, when in fact it's a handful of tribes spending a fortune to keep a special deal."
About one-third of the 557 Indian tribes around the nation, including tribes in Connecticut, Minnesota and Wisconsin, now offer some form of gambling. The 1988 Federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act affirmed tribes' rights to offer bingo, and, subject to negotiated compacts with individual states, slot machine games. But some governors have complained about vagaries in the law and Congress has debated clarifying it.
"From a national perspective, many states and tribes have already resolved this," said John Dossett, general counsel of the National Congress of American Indians in Washington, which represents 250 tribes. "If this issue were to be resolved in California, there'd be less pressure in Congress."
But resolution here seems unlikely any time soon. Opponents of Proposition 5 warn that if it passes, it will be tied up in years of litigation, and could well violate the California Constitution's ban on "Nevada or New Jersey-type casinos."
"We're in for a long battle here instead of a politically negotiated solution in which both sides say, 'Let's make this work,' " said Cathy Christian, counsel to the Coalition Against Unregulated Gambling.
The gaming tribes say they are prepared to fight. They complain that they have been caught in an impossible situation because, eager for revenue, they began offering gambling while their right to do so was still being litigated. But Mr. Wilson, a Republican and a foe of gambling in general, has refused throughout his eight-year tenure to negotiate a compact allowing slot-machine style gambling with any tribe that was already doing it.
"Without Proposition 5, the gaming that currently exists on Indian lands in California could be taken away from the tribes," said Waltona Manion, a spokeswoman for the tribal alliance known as Californians for Indian Self-Reliance. "Why remove something that's working and that's proven to have taken these tribes off of welfare dependency and put them on the road to self-sufficiency?"
Last spring, Governor Wilson reached his first gambling compact, an agreement with the Pala Band of Mission Indians in San Diego County that would allow a new form of video slot machine but outlaw those now used by gambling tribes. In the months since, 10 more tribes, some under threat of Federal action, have signed the Pala compact, which limits each tribe to 199 of the new machines but allows them to lease rights for unused machines to other tribes, up to a maximum of 990 for any tribe, with a statewide cap of 19,900. The State Legislature ratified the agreements in August.
Most of the gaming tribes contend that Mr. Wilson refused to negotiate in good faith, as required by the 1988 Federal law. So Proposition 5 leaves little to chance, flatly requiring the state to grant a compact allowing slot machines in perpetuity for any tribe that wanted them.
Opponents of the measure contend that it is not needed to protect Indian gambling, and they are running television advertisements featuring Paula Lorenzo, head of the Rumsey Band of Wintun Indians, which signed the Pala compact and is expanding its Cache Creek Casino 45 miles northwest of Sacramento.
"We're doing all this without Prop. 5," Ms. Lorenzo says in the 30-second commercial as she walks through the construction site. "No tribe needs Prop. 5 to operate casinos."
For their part, supporters of the measure have accused their fellow tribes of being turncoats recruited by "the big Nevada casinos" to oppose the proposition.
At the San Manuel casino, which draws 3,000 to 4,000 gamblers a day and where the card dealers now wear bold "Yes on 5" T-shirts, players said they supported the measure.
"What's going to happen to these people if Proposition 5 doesn't go through?" asked Ruth Kennedy, a retired nurse who comes every day to play bingo and the slots. "Why is Vegas and them so upset with the Indian halls? You can't tell me this place doesn't do things for the community."
In fact, said Steven Lengel, the casino's customer services director, the casino sponsors school and community programs in Highland and the neighboring cities of San Bernardino and Redlands, and its uniformed security force of 250 is bigger than those of the three local cities combined. It sells no alcohol, allows none on the premises and employs more than 1,400 people, the vast majority of them local residents.
Opponents of the measure, including the California Labor Federation A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the United Farm Workers, complain that Indian casinos, on sovereign tribal lands, are exempt from environmental and worker health and safety laws. They also complain that the measure calls for distributing a maximum of just 2 percent of the winnings from casinos with more than 400 gambling machines to non-gaming tribes.

HEADLINE: A Change in the Air

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 12

 BODY:
The centerpiece of the Clinton Administration's economic policy this year has been a demand that the Republican-controlled Congress forgo tax cuts and set aside the projected Federal budget surplus until the nation shores up the Social Security system.
It was a move that proved politically successful in blocking a main element of the Republican agenda, and it made economic sense against the backdrop of strong growth and incipient inflationary pressures. But with the global financial crisis rapidly changing the economic outlook for the worse, there are growing questions from both the left and the right about the wisdom of putting fiscal rectitude ahead of the potentially more pressing need to sustain growth. 
 Indeed, with the Administration facing the possibility of a recession for the first time since taking office, the White House could face tough choices about whether the market-friendly policies that defined its approach during economic boom times are the best way to approach a more difficult period.
"Bill Clinton's most memorable legacy apart from his White House dalliance will be balancing the budget," said Robert B. Reich, who was Labor Secretary in Mr. Clinton's first term.
"Now that there's a budget surplus, the Administration has committed itself to saving the surplus for Social Security rather than succumbing to Republican tax cuts," Mr. Reich said. "But this has put fiscal policy into a veritable straitjacket. It's not possible for the White House to talk seriously about stimulating the economy through tax cuts or spending when it has bound itself so tightly to the idea of fiscal discipline."
Administration officials said that it was premature to be talking about a recession and that the United States would have more flexibility and strength now that the deficit had been eliminated. In particular, they said, the Federal Reserve now has considerably more leeway to reduce interest rates to counter any downturn than it did the last two times the economy slid into recession, in 1990 and 1981.
"The basic momentum of economic expansion should continue," said Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary. "And with a budget in surplus and lower inflation expectations than any time in more than three decades, the economy is well positioned to respond to any challenges that may arise."
But just the possibility of a downturn is likely to unleash pressures on the Administration to re-examine the principles behind its policies.
Mr. Clinton took office in 1993 planning to give a traditional Keynesian boost to a sluggish economy through a big deficit-spending package. But he soon abandoned the effort under pressure from his economic team, which convinced him that there would be a considerable payoff in the form of lower interest rates if he could convince the financial markets that he was serious about reducing the budget deficit.
Mr. Clinton also adopted a hands-off policy toward the Federal Reserve, showing considerable deference to its chairman, Alan Greenspan. Again the intent was to win the confidence of the markets.
The Administration's international economic policies have also been distinguished by a belief in the benefits of bringing down barriers to trade and investment.
The approach, embodied most notably by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin has paid off, in the Administration's view. Interest rates have come down. Inflation expectations have been dampened. Seeing a stable environment ahead, businesses have invested heavily in technology and equipment to increase productivity, helping to create new jobs.
In addition to helping the country, the strategy has built Mr. Clinton a base of political support, and the economy has remained his primary source of political sustenance as he has battled the threat of impeachment. So Administration officials say that for now they have no intention of changing course.
But the turmoil in world markets has forced the Administration to defend the merits of unfettered flows of money around the world and left it scrambling to keep the problems from derailing the domestic economy. And while still hypothetical, the specter of a recession in the United States already has both parties thinking about how to respond.
Republicans have seized on the economic uncertainty in the last several weeks as further justification for a big tax cut.
"Given the weakness in the global economy, now is exactly the right time to cut taxes," said Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
Among liberal Democrats in Congress, there is a pent-up demand for more spending. A downturn in the economy, they said, would only increase the pressure to use some of the surplus on job training, education and other programs to help the unemployed and low-income people.
There has also been growing criticism of the Federal Reserve for not moving more forcefully to head off the possibility of a downturn by cutting interest rates more deeply. The criticism has come from the left and the right, but not from the Administration. If anything, the Administration has been working more closely than ever with Mr. Greenspan in addressing the global crisis.
To the extent that it sticks to fiscal austerity and deference to the Federal Reserve's cautious approach to reducing interest rates, the Administration would in a sense be taking the same advice it is giving to countries like Brazil.
To those countries that are doing the right thing economically but are still being pounded by the financial turbulence that has swept around the world from Asia over the last year, the United States has had a consistent if not wholly reassuring message: Ride out the short-term disruptions and bank on the long-term benefits from sound policies.
The situations, of course, are not directly comparable; the United States is in far better fiscal condition than almost any other country. But that does not mean that political pressures would not play a role in determining how long the principles of austerity and silence on monetary policy would continue to guide the Administration if the economy stalls.
"As Keynes said, in the long run we're all dead," Mr. Reich said. "In the political world the short run is the election cycle. The Democrats are potentially vulnerable in 2000 if the economy tanks, even if austerity is the right medicine over the long run."

Asian Markets, With Japan Leading, Continue Rally

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Oct. 12

 BODY:
Buoyed by a stronger Japanese yen and expectations of interest rate cuts at home and abroad, stock markets rose throughout Asia today in what has become a surprisingly vigorous and sustained rally, although there is no guarantee that it will last.
Hong Kong posted the greatest gain, jumping nearly 6 percent, or 483.48 points, to 8,990.27. Stocks continued to rise early Tuesday, and were up around 1 percent.] Since last Wednesday, the benchmark Hang Seng index has jumped 19 percent. Shares also rose in Bangkok, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta. 
 Analysts attributed much of the rally to the stronger yen. Its gains have taken the pressure off other Asian currencies, particularly the Chinese yuan and the Hong Kong dollar. With a new round of devaluations less likely, experts said local investors were once again dipping into the stock market.
For overseas investors, Asia may no longer seem so risky, and may even have a certain appeal, given the slowing growth in Europe and the United States, and the problems in other emerging markets, like Brazil.
"Asia is still showing signs of illness, but we've diagnosed the patient, and we can now move forward," said Miron Mushkat, the director of strategy at Indocam Asia Asset Management in Hong Kong. "Elsewhere, we're still doing the diagnosis."
For all the robust numbers, analysts caution that Hong Kong and other Asian markets still have deep economic problems. They said this rally was fragile and could falter quickly -- if, for example, the slowdown in the United States and Europe meant fewer purchases of Asian goods.
"Bear markets are characterized by extremely powerful, short-lived rallies, where the gains are given up later," said Marc Faber, the head of Marc Faber Ltd., an investment advisory firm in Hong Kong.
As has so often been the case in this crisis, the rest of Asia took its cues today from Japan. Tokyo's stock market surged this afternoon after Japanese politicians reached an agreement on a plan to tackle that nation's debt-ridden banking system.
Analysts said that another reason for the bounce was that hedge funds and other investors had built up huge short positions in both the yen and the Tokyo stock market. When the yen rose against the United States dollar, these investors began buying shares as a hedge against their short positions.
Hong Kong's market was also rife with short sellers, who are now buying shares to offset those positions. In a short sale, an investor borrows shares from a brokerage firm and sells them on the open market, with an agreement to repay the loan later with more shares, for which he hopes to pay less than he received for the borrowed shares. The investor is betting that the market will decline.
Although Hong Kong's market has turned bullish in the last few trading sessions, there is still no shortage of pessimism. In a new survey of 150 Hong Kong-based companies, more than half said they believed the economy would get worse before it got better. Only 11.9 percent expected an improvement in the next six months, according to the survey, which was conducted by The South China Morning Post and Nomura International.
Those results echo the glum economic assessment given by Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, in his annual policy address last week. Speaking in an interview on Friday, Mr. Tung said his Administration could do little to alleviate the pain of the recession or to bring a swift recovery.
"Salaries are being adjusted, companies are downsizing and unemployment is going up," he said. "So it is a very painful time."
One broker argued that investors should not discount a rally, even if it is not based on economic fundamentals. Hong Kong's market is so psychologically driven, this broker said, that merely the appearance of better times might be enough to set off a more secular recovery.
And Mr. Tung can take solace from something else: the Hong Kong Government intervened massively to prop up the market in August. The action drew fierce criticism from investors and regulators around the world. But after gaining more than 1,400 points since last Wednesday, Hong Kong is sitting on a tidy profit.

JAPAN PARLIAMENT PASSES RELIEF BILL FOR AILING BANKS

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 12

 BODY:
Japan's Parliament approved landmark banking legislation today that will allow the Government to nationalize failing banks, and political parties announced that they had reached a new accord to provide several hundred billion dollars in new money to try to revive the banking system and set the country on a path toward economic health.
The accord on providing money, reached between Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party and most of the opposition forces, could lead to the injection of huge amounts of public money -- more than $400 billion, or four times the amount proposed a week ago -- into the nation's banks. The Liberal Democrats hope that the political alliance holds long enough for them to win passage in the Parliament for the new accord by Friday, when the current session ends. 
 The possibility of a way out of the financial crisis sent stocks surging today, with shares of the nation's banks jumping an average of 8 percent. The Nikkei index of 225 shares rose 5.24 percent, to 13,555.01, in a big comeback after last week's plunge. United States markets also rose on optimism about a solution to Japan's financial problems. Page C1.
 At midday on Tuesday, the Nikkei was down 30.44 points, or two-tenths of a percent, to 13,524.57.
"They are like the wheels on both sides of a car," the Prime Minister, Keizo Obuchi, said at a news conference, referring to the two pieces of legislation. "When both of them pass the Parliament, it will mean that we can send out a clear and strong message to the world that a global depression will absolutely not begin in Japan."
The law enacted by Parliament today allows the Government for the first time to deal with large, failing banks by nationalizing them, liquidating them or transforming them into publicly owned "bridge banks," which take over the good loans and good borrowers and try to collect on the bad loans. It would establish a public institution to resell the good assets and deal with the bad ones in a process also used by the American Resolution Trust Corporation, which helped clean up the savings-and-loan crisis in the 1990's.
The accord announced tonight, if enacted and carried out, would amount to a bold attempt to revive lending by cash-strapped banks and thus bolster a recovery.
With Japan's economy in its deepest recession since World War II, the recent wild gyrations in the stock market and the sudden and sharp surge in the yen against the dollar, politicians have become a bit jittery that the financial crisis both here and abroad could worsen and that the economy could sink even further.
In Washington, Clinton Administration officials said they were encouraged by the new legislation, but were still waiting for the Japanese Government to carry out the steps and deal forcefully with its economic problems. The United States has grown increasingly impatient with Japan for failing to clean up its banking system and revive its economy, and while the new legislation and today's accord move toward those goals, it is unclear how successfully Japan can carry out these steps.
Other analysts were also skeptical, partly because Japan has announced agreements in the past, only to have them not live up to promises. One key criticism has been the worry that Japan's major banks will not apply for an injection of taxpayers' money, particularly if it means they will be punished through controls on management or reductions in shareholder capital.
The Democratic Party, the main opposition to the new accord, has demanded that the Government force the banks to take public money. Politicians disclosed few details of the agreement, but after the Democratic Party protested, the Liberal Democrats decided to bolster the amount of the bailout.
For many, though, Japan is at a critical juncture.
"If Japan is able to adjust, it can become a locomotive to pull Asia out of its troubles," said Kenneth Courtis, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Group Asia Pacific, at a conference today in Singapore. "Otherwise, it could become a Titanic that pulls the rest of Asia under."
The new accord, a second set of bills to revive the banking system, is intended to provide banks with sorely needed new capital so that they can lend to corporations throughout Japan. Last week, politicians had proposed a bailout of 10 trillion yen, or nearly $90 billion. Though no amounts were specified tonight, politicians said the accord could provide between $435 billion and $585 billion, or about 10 percent of annual economic output. The money, however, is not expected to be spent all in one year. International banks could receive taxpayers' money if they agreed to absorb another failing institution, if there was a severe credit contraction or if more capital was needed in a merger.
Masaru Hayami, the governor of the Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, warned officials in Washington recently that all the banks were short of capital and that the resulting credit squeeze had helped stifle economic recovery. With a weak capital base, large international Japanese banks have been trimming their lending to meet capital requirements set by the Bank for International Settlements. Banks with only domestic business must conform to Government rules.
The international banks say they currently meet those standards, but just as troublesome is the level of equity capital -- a narrower measure of capital -- that could absorb real losses arising from writing off unrecoverable loans. The amount of the nation's bad debt could be anywhere from $670 billion to $1 trillion.
In addition, the tumbling stock market, which is flirting with 13-year lows, hurts the level of capital at the banks. Recent banking proposals by politicians highlight just how low the levels of capital could tumble at the banks if their bad loans were dealt with right away.
According to the guidelines in one proposal, the core amount of equity capital at the banks could fall by nearly half if the top 19 banks disposed of problem loans in line with internal findings of the Bank of Japan. The Democratic Party and others have demanded that the banks address these problem loans by setting aside a portion of profits to absorb losses in the expectation that one-fifth of these loans go bad, a proportion based on findings by the Bank of Japan.
The difficulty, however, is that most banks contend that these loans are currently in fine shape, and they have created virtually no cushion of profits for them.
The precarious level of capital is why many analysts are calling on the politicians to put the money in first and then tackle the rebuilding of the sticky principles that govern the system. For years, analysts and economists here and abroad have been demanding greater financial disclosure, tougher accounting standards and more market-oriented rules in the financial system.
"I am for disclosure," said Ryuji Konishi, a former bank executive who now teaches economics at Tokyo University. "But this is not a time of peace."
Chikara Sakaguchi, a member of Parliament and a leader in the New Peace Party, has said that his party supports the Liberal Democrats' bill. Yoshio Suzuki, a senior member in the Liberal Party, which was instrumental in tonight's agreement, said that the Liberal Party would also vote to pass the bill and that the bill was assured passage.
"We have finally succeeded in establishing a scheme which is essential to overcome the present financial crisis," he said.
Not everyone is happy with the bills, though. Some senior bankers say that Japan may be passing up the chance to make the financial system and its institutions much more competitive through the kind of change that can emerge only from a crisis.
In the words of one Japanese banker, Japan needs "the hands of the devil and the heart of a Buddha," so that painful revamping may be done now to bring long-term benefits.
Others say that the Liberal Democrats' version is barely different from the plan that is being replaced because of opposition from the Democratic Party. Under that plan, a bailout of $260 billion, Japan's banks received public money worth about 1.8 trillion yen, or $15.7 billion, in March, but the plan failed to inspire worldwide confidence in the banking system.
"I'm very pessimistic," said Ka tsuya Okada, a Parliamentary member for the Democratic Party, the main opposition whose views are being edged out of the second set of legislation.
"The philosophy and the method are not so clear yet. It seems as though the Government is forcing the vote."

HEADLINE: Russia Sees NATO Raids as Imperiling Cooperation With West

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 12

 BODY:
Russia mounted a last-ditch campaign today to avert NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia, warning that such strikes could bring an end to cooperation with the Western alliance.
The intensity of Russia's diplomacy reflected the ascension of Yevgeny M. Primakov, the Foreign Minister turned Prime Minister, who has often cast Moscow as a wounded great power in an open-ended struggle with the West. 
 As Foreign Minister, Mr. Primakov had no higher goal than to circumscribe NATO's influence and contest American dominance. He repeatedly described the Balkans as historically an area of Russian influence.
Today Russia orchestrated a full-court press. First Mr. Primakov told Italy's Acting Prime Minister, Romano Prodi, that NATO strikes would be a "tragic mistake" that threatened cooperation between Moscow and NATO.
Then Russia underscored its unhappiness by recalling its representatives to NATO headquarters. A Russian general even engaged in a bit of saber-rattling by threatening to ship arms to Serbia.
In reality, Russia's leverage is somewhat limited.
Russian cooperation with NATO had never amounted to very much. Its representatives at NATO headquarters are primarily interested in fighting old wars over NATO expansion, not finding new ways to work together.
The sole exception has been the deployment of Russian peacekeeping troops in Bosnia, an arrangement that is widely regarded as successful but not indispensable.
Russia's Parliament could vote down the second strategic arms reduction treaty, and obtaining Russia's approval of the accord is a high American priority.
But the fate of the treaty is already in doubt in the Communist-dominated Parliament. And Mr. Primakov has publicly said approving it is in Russia's interest, as its missiles are getting old anyway.
NATO has never been popular with the Russian public. But with the economy in a state of near collapse, Western intervention in the Balkans appeared to be primarily an obsession of the political establishment.
Still, Mr. Primakov has proved to be very skillful at playing a weak hand. As Foreign Minister he helped negotiate the Founding Act, which set the terms of NATO's expansion to the East.
Mr. Primakov's strategy today appeared to be to influence some of the waffling members of the alliance by threatening a rupture in NATO-Russia cooperation. The approach also distances Moscow from NATO in the event the strikes go ahead.
Igor S. Ivanov, Mr. Primakov's former deputy and his successor as Foreign Minister, today described NATO military intervention as "a very dangerous decision which brings us to the red line, after which, from our point of view, some very hard consequences may follow."
Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the Communist leader, said NATO military action would lead to an annulment of agreements between Russia and the alliance.
Grigory A. Yavlinsky, the leader of the liberal Yabloko faction, was a rare voice of moderation.
From the hospital where he is being treated for a heart attack, he said the Yeltsin Government had not been tough enough with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia and urged Russia and NATO to find common ground.
Yugoslavia, for one, seemed to appreciate the Kremlin's help. Today it announced that Borislav Milosevic, the President's brother, would be its next Ambassador to Moscow.

NATO Order Clears Way For Bombing of the Serbs
The United States and its allies approved an order opening the way for NATO to begin a bombing campaign against Yugoslavia over Kosovo in four days' time, but White House officials said an agreement to end the crisis appeared imminent. Senior American and NATO officials said the envoy Richard C. Holbrooke, above, had made significant progress in talks with the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic. A1 

Russia mounted a campaign to avert air strikes, warning that they might signal an end to cooperation with the Western alliance. Yevgeny M. Primakov, Russia's Prime Minister, recalled his country's representatives to NATO headquarters. A10
 
NATO forces in Bosnia and Croatia are needlessly paying millions of dollars in rent that is winding up in the coffers of the governing political parties, say financial experts who have studied the two governments; diplomats say those parties are often the principal obstacles to peace. A10
 
Economy Hurts Chinese Women
Women over 35 are bearing the brunt of the pain as China struggles to convert to a market economy by closing and shrinking state-owned industries. The women are far more likely to be laid off and far less likely to find a new job than any other group in China. Many of them learned few skills under the old system, and they face outright discrimination. A1
 
Concern Over Yeltsin's Health
President Boris N. Yeltsin abruptly cut short a three-day visit to Central Asia after his doctor announced that Mr. Yeltsin was suffering from bronchitis and a slight fever. The announcement compounded the sense that the nation lacked a fully functioning leader during one of its gravest crises. A8

The White House and Republican Congressional leaders were said to be close to a deal to provide $18 billion to the International Monetary Fund in exchange for new conditions on loans to foreign governments. A10
 
U.S. Holds 6 in Legal Limbo
Newly declassified Government documents show that the United States has relied on weak and unsubstantiated evidence that has never been fully investigated to detain six Iraqi dissidents who worked with the C.I.A. against President Saddam Hussein. The six have been held for more than a year and a half based on circumstantial allegations of espionage that the Government has never tried to prove, declassified F.B.I. interviews and reports and formerly secret court testimony show. A9
 
New, Conservative Priests
Young American men entering the priesthood are more conservative and tradition-bound than many of their elders and most American Roman Catholics, according to bishops, priests and church surveys. Some older priests, in Rome and elsewhere, worry about a rift developing between clergy and congregation. A3

Gay Man Dies From Attack, Fueling Anger and Debate
Matthew Shepard, the gay college student who was kidnapped, robbed and pistol-whipped in Wyoming, died, five days after he was rescued from a ranch where he had been left tied to a fence for 18 hours in near-freezing temperatures. The announcement fanned the outrage that followed word of the attack, spawning vigils, producing a call from President Clinton for Federal hate-crimes legislation and fueling debate over such laws in Western states, like Wyoming, that have resisted them. A1
 
3 Americans Receive Nobel
Three American pharmacologists -- Dr. Robert Furchgott, 82, of the State University of New York in Brooklyn; Dr. Louis J. Ignarro, 57, of the University of California at Los Angeles, and Dr. Ferid Murad, 62, of the University of Texas Medical School in Houston -- were awarded the Nobel Prize for for physiology or medicine. The award recognized their surprising discoveries of how natural production of a gas, nitric oxide, can mediate a wide variety of bodily actions, such as widening blood vessels, helping to regulate blood pressure, initiating erections, battling infections, preventing formation of blood clots and acting as a signal molecule in the nervous system. A14
 
6 Killed While They Sleep
Six people believed to be illegal immigrants from Mexico were hit and fatally injured by a freight train as they slept on a desolate stretch of tracks in southern Texas. Officials said they believed that the immigrants might have been victims of a belief that the rails would keep them safe from snakes. A12
 
H.M.O. Ruling Is Challenged
The Clinton Administration is asking a full appeals court to overturn an August ruling that gave new rights and consumer protections to six million Medicare beneficiaries in health maintenance organizations, saying that the Government should not be held accountable for the actions of H.M.O.'s that sign contracts with Medicare.

No Accord in Budget Talks
Republican leaders in Congress and White House negotiators ended their talks on the Federal budget without reaching agreement, but pushed back their deadline to midnight tomorrow to work out their differences.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Deal Is Reported To Be Near

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 12

 BODY:
The White House and Republican Congressional leaders are close to an agreement to provide $18 billion to the International Monetary Fund in exchange for new conditions on the fund's loans to foreign governments, Clinton Administration and Congressional officials said today.
The officials said the deal, which they expect to be announced this week as part of an overall budget settlement, would require that the I.M.F. raise the interest rates on most loans and shorten the repayment periods. 
 Congressional officials said although some details of the legislation were under negotiation, the package would probably require that loans be repaid in two and a half years.
The lending conditions had been sought by House Republicans, who opposed the full $18 billion in financing that the Administration had requested to help the fund as it tries to avert a global economic crisis.
The money would go to replenish accounts that were depleted by efforts to bail out the economies of Russia and three Asian nations.
Prominent Republican lawmakers have contended that billions of dollars that went to the bailouts were squandered and that liberal lending had encouraged some nations to pursue reckless policies.
The legislation is widely expected to single out South Korea, one of the three Asian nations that received a bailout, and to demand that the monetary fund bar further loans to Seoul if the Government tries to use any of the money to underwrite specific domestic industries that have been especially hard hit.
The Clinton Administration has begun to consult other nations that are large shareholders in the I.M.F. about what lending conditions to impose.
Gene Sperling, who heads the White House's National Economic Council, spoke over the weekend about "a growing sense that there will be both funding for the I.M.F. and significant I.M.F. reforms." But longtime critics of the fund were known to be pressing for even tighter restrictions than those that have been tentatively agreed upon.
Fulfillment of Mr. Sperling's twin predictions would follow many months of debate over the I.M.F. Its critics have complained not only of its loan practices, which they say contribute to economic instability, but also of what they see as excessive secrecy that has made the fund all but unaccountable.
One aspect of the emerging accord would require the fund to issue written summaries of its board meetings and other significant documents, with some exceptions, within three months.
Nations borrowing from the I.M.F. would be compelled to liberalize their trade policies, cease government-directed lending on preferential terms and cut out favoritism in bankruptcy proceedings.
In pressing for full financing, the Clinton Administration has insisted that $18 billion is essential to replenish reserves exhausted by the financial turmoil in Asia and Russia, and to enable the fund to combat continuing crises in other regions.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Stocks in Broad, Sharp Rallies as Bank Bill Passes in Japan

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stock prices rose yesterday after Japan's parliament approved legislation to revive its moribund banking system, setting off rallies in Asian and European markets.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 101.95 points, or 1.29 percent, to 8,001.47. It was the first close above 8,000 for the Dow since Sept. 29. 
 Volume in the United States was light, and the bond market was closed for Columbus Day.
"This is a good rally and a continuation of what went on Friday," said Bill Allyn, head of stock trading at Jefferies & Company. "But because the bond market was closed and volume was down, Tuesday's session might be more telling."
Broader indexes also registered sharp gains. The Nasdaq composite index, which has been pounded recently, completed its biggest two-day advance since October 1987. It climbed 53.59 points yesterday, or 3.59 percent, to 1,546.08, after gaining 73 points on Friday. Still, the two gains have not completely reversed the nearly 200-point decline recorded earlier in the week. And for the year, the index is still down 1.55 percent.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 13.32 points, or 1.35 percent, to 997.71. The New York Stock Exchange composite index increased 6.25, to 492.95. And the Russell 2,000 index of smaller companies rose 7.22 points, to 325.62.
Volume on the Big Board was 691 million shares.
Optimism about a solution to Japan's financial and economic problems had sent stocks in Tokyo up 5.24 percent. Revitalized banks in Japan could lift the world's second-largest economy out of recession, helping the rest of Asia in the process and easing the world financial crisis. The news spurred Hong Kong's Hang Seng index higher by 5.68 percent. In London, stocks in the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 index rose 4.4 percent. German stocks climbed 7.5 percent. And equity prices on major exchanges in Latin America also registered big gains.
Still, some traders said they were not convinced about the Japanese plan, adding that with companies reporting third-quarter earnings, United States stock prices are vulnerable. "I think the Japanese plan is a Band-Aid," said one block trader who asked not to be identified. "What has happened over the last couple of days is nice, but we are not out of the woods. If we get more bad news, we will be back in the doldrums again."
Other analysts said recent developments had raised their hopes about the future.
Peter Canelo, a United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company, said a global move toward lower interest rates started by the Federal Reserve Board should help reliquefy the international economy. Nearly as important, he added, has been the recent decline in the value of the dollar, a drop that should help emerging market countries whose currencies are tied to the dollar. The reforms in Japan should also help, he said.
"Our feeling is that the Dow would have a tough time moving above 8,400," he said. "I am feeling a little bit better about things than I was a week or so ago. But third-quarter earnings numbers are going to be very, very important."
The Chrysler Corporation helped to bolster optimism about third-quarter earnings when it surprised industry analysts with a profits report that exceeded expectations. Shares of the company, which is being bought by Daimler-Benz A.G. of Germany, gained 2 1/2, to 44 1/4, after it said it had earned $1.02 a share in the quarter, up sharply from 65 cents in the period a year earlier. The consensus estimate among analysts polled by the First Call Corporation was 87 cents a share.
Hopes that earnings at technology companies may have bottomed out helped to fuel gains among a number of the industry's leaders.
The Intel Corporation, which is expected to report third-quarter results after the market closes on Tuesday, rose 1 5/8 yesterday, to 85 7/16. Microsoft gained 2 7/8, to 99 3/4. And Dell Computer jumped 3 1/4, to 56 1/16.
Worries about the stability of the financial system persist, however.
Prices of many bank and brokerage stocks rose again yesterday, but there were some notable exceptions.
Merrill Lynch, which is expected to release third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, fell 1 3/4, to 43 7/8. Citigroup lost 1/2, to 34 15/16. And Bankers Trust Company slumped 4 5/8, or nearly 8 percent, to 54 1/4, after Fitch IBCA, the debt rating agency, lowered its rating on the company, citing concerns about its earnings prospects.
The financial sector was also the venue for the session's most spectacular trade, a 2.5-million-share block of Wells Fargo.
The bank, which is completing its $30.7 billion merger with the Norwest Corporation and is expected to report third-quarter earnings next week, saw its stock price plummet 16 3/4 yesterday, to 319 15/16. The 2.5 million shares were sold when the stock was trading at 315 a share.

HEADLINE: Is Loss of Credibility a Crime or Misdemeanor?;
A Remote Prospect

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re Thomas L. Friedman's assessment of our need for a President to lead the world in responding to its growing economic crisis ("Oh, by the Way . . .," column, Oct. 10): 
 I question Mr. Friedman's apparent assumption that President Clinton, even if freed from legal responsibility for his behavior in the Lewinsky affair, would retain the authority and credibility sufficient "to galvanize the process, explain it and press it forward."
The prospect of effective leadership's being exercised in any context over the next two years by a disgraced, discredited and disreputable President seems remote, to say the least.

HEADLINE: Candidates Risk Little With Harsh Ads

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
At a Sunday morning service recently, the Rev. Floyd H. Flake went to the pulpit of his church in Queens and urged the candidates for the United States Senate, Alfonse M. D'Amato and Charles E. Schumer, to cease their "dirty campaign." They were doing themselves a disservice and would ultimately turn voters away from an important political contest, Mr. Flake told the congregation, which included Mr. D'Amato that morning.
Mr. Flake got the answer to his plea two days later. Senator D'Amato released three new advertisements attacking Mr. Schumer ("Chuck Schumer consistently votes against us," the announcer says in one), while Representative Schumer slashed into Mr. D'Amato's environmental record, asserting that "people are wise to his act." 
 Civic leaders like Mr. Flake, and some voters, might frown on such politicking -- thrashing the opponent, rather than advancing one's own accomplishments -- but the candidates and their advisers in this pivotal Senate race have concluded that they have no other choice.
The unrelenting attacks -- on voting records, on ethics, on political ideology, even on the place that Mr. Schumer calls home -- are the inevitable result of a competition that features a relatively unpopular Republican incumbent fighting for re-election in a Democratic state, and a relatively little-known challenger trying to knock out one of the most resourceful figures in politics.
Mr. Flake's concerns notwithstanding, the candidates and their strategists have decided that the risks of "going negative," as it is known, are far outweighed by the effectiveness of such politicking. The finger-pointing between Mr. Schumer and Mr. D'Amato about who started it, and who has been more negative, might present intriguing questions for historians one day, but it is unlikely to influence many voters in November.
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll underscores their judgment. By any objective measure, the campaign between Mr. Schumer and Mr. D'Amato is about as negative as they come -- it is, arguably, the most negative Senate race in the nation this fall -- yet 54 percent of voters said it was no more negative than Mr. D'Amato's last contest, in 1992, against Robert Abrams. In fact, 14 percent said it was more positive.
More voters blame Mr. D'Amato for the tone of the race, by 34 percent to 26 percent, and slightly more are inclined to think Mr. D'Amato's attacks are unfair, instead of the ones offered by Mr. Schumer, the Times/ CBS News Poll found. But there is no evidence of voters punishing the candidates for what they see as tactical transgressions. Three weeks of punch-for-punch campaigning have produced a statistical dead heat for the candidates, the Times/CBS News poll found.
The telephone poll of 1,066 registered voters in New York State, taken from Oct. 1 to Oct. 6, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
The fact that the campaign has devolved to this level so fast is certainly not a surprise to anyone familiar with the dynamics of the race or its two tenacious contestants. "Neither of these guys had a choice; it was inscribed the day before the primary," said Norman Adler, a political analyst from New York who is not affiliated with either candidate.
But though both have embraced the same tactic, they have done it for different reasons, and that is revealing of the shortcomings and political positions Mr. Schumer and Mr. D'Amato find themselves in this year.
Mr. D'Amato's motivations can be determined from a cursory reading of any public opinion poll: The Senator invariably scores less than 50 percent against his opponent. In the Times/CBS News Poll, 41 percent of registered voters said they would support him. That is not good for an incumbent who has been in office for 18 years, since by this point, there is little that Mr. D'Amato can tell undecided voters to win them over.
That means that Mr. D'Amato must provide them with reasons not to support Mr. Schumer, which he has been doing since the night Mr. Schumer won the Democratic primary (and as the Senator has done in all of his statewide races in New York). To this end, Mr. D'Amato has combed through 23 years of Mr. Schumer's legislative record, picking out votes -- some on major pieces of legislation, and others on procedural or inconsequential matters -- to portray the Brooklyn Representative as liberal or hostile to upstate New York. Most recently, he has seized on the fact that Mr. Schumer, who has for most of his career had a strong attendance record in Congress, missed more than 100 votes this year as he attended to his campaign needs.
Mr. Schumer's attacks on Mr. D'Amato have been no less brutal. Mr. Schumer's challenge has been built on one overarching theme: that Mr. D'Amato is a chronic liar. ("Too many lies for too long," is the last line of most commercials, a slogan so harsh that it appears to have taken even Mr. D'Amato's breath away).
It is a broad pre-emptive attack intended to inoculate Mr. Schumer against any criticism Mr. D'Amato might come up with between now and Nov. 3, by stirring what polls suggest are strong doubts about Mr. D'Amato's trustworthiness.
As an all-encompassing theme, Mr. Schumer's approach pushes the horizon of negative campaigning, and could, if Mr. Schumer wins, be remembered as a political benchmark one day. Early indications are that it is successful. The Times/CBS News Poll shows that Mr. Schumer continues to have a generally favorable rating among voters, suggesting that Mr. D'Amato's attacks have yet to stick.
Mr. Schumer's confrontational strategy has two other unstated purposes. First, it was designed to catch the attention of Democratic contributors across the country who were deciding where to send their checks in this year's 34 Senate contests, by signaling that Mr. Schumer would run the campaign against Mr. D'Amato that some Democrats believe Mr. Abrams failed to do six years ago. And the unusually sharp cast of the attack -- even some Democrats describe it as a little over the top -- is intended to be splashy enough to win Mr. Schumer a few newspaper articles and some television coverage.
Mr. Schumer and Mr. D'Amato are executing the kinds of campaigns that have been part of American politics for the better part of 200 years, but which really came into focus with the 1988 Presidential contest. That year, Vice President George Bush and the Republican Party devastated Michael S. Dukakis with a searing run of ads that questioned Mr. Dukakis's fortitude, ideology and even his patriotism. It is often cited by analysts as evidence of the potency of such tactics.
There are some notorious examples of negative campaigning this year as well. In the Nebraska Republican primary for governor, Representative Jon Christensen accused Mike Johanns, the Mayor of Lincoln, of condoning child pornography after a cable television channel in his city showed some nudity. Other Republicans assailed Mr. Christensen, and he went on to lose the primary.
But viewed by the three best measures of a campaign's negativity -- the sharpness of the attacks, their sheer volume, and the mix between positive and negative -- the New York race stands out this year. Mr. D'Amato's menu of television is almost entirely negative. Mr. Schumer has leavened his mix with a handful of positive advertisements and is expected to produce more upbeat ads as Election Day approaches.
That has formed the backdrop for a second subject of dispute between Mr. Schumer and Mr. D'Amato: which candidate is responsible for the attacks, and who is the most negative. That may sound like an academic question to viewers bombarded with one attack ad after another, but it is particularly relevant this year because Mr. D'Amato has -- once again -- tried to portray himself as a victim of unfair attacks.
Mr. Schumer notes, correctly, that Mr. D'Amato was the first to run attack ads, starting the day after the primary with one that asserted: "Liberal Chuck Schumer. Wrong on taxes. Wrong on welfare. Wrong on crime. Wrong for us." (Mr. D'Amato actually began attacking Mr. Schumer in a Dec. 30, 1997, letter to supporters, in which he said, "I've listened to this guy for 17 years and I still can't figure out what they taught him at Harvard. It wasn't common sense!") Mr. Schumer knew Mr. D'Amato's history well enough to be ready with his own attack ad the moment the Senator ran his.
Finally, the two are now quarreling about what is fair in political discourse. Mr. D'Amato contends that Mr. Schumer crossed the line. "Campaigns aren't always gentlemanly-like," Mr. D'Amato said yesterday at a news conference in Manhattan in which he assailed Mr. Schumer's attendance record. "However, I do believe it is one thing to point to a person's record and it is another thing to use pejoratives that have been used in this campaign that go beyond." He said he was referring specifically to Mr. Schumer's having described him as a liar and a bully.
Mr. Schumer responded by mocking Mr. D'Amato. "When he finally gets someone to answer him back, he starts whining," he said.
In truth, even the Representative's supporters acknowledge that calling someone a liar is extraordinary by the standards of American politics. Still, the Senator's bid for sympathy based on Mr. Schumer's perceived excesses arguably runs up against his own history.
Mr. D'Amato played a very prominent role in writing the book on attack politics in this country over the past 25 years. He helped produce a seminal snippet of campaign advertising 18 years ago. "And now, at age 76 and in failing health, he wants six more years," the announcer said as the screen showed a crumpled Javits poster fluttering to the ground. The subject of the attack was Senator Jacob J. Javits, a Republican. Mr. D'Amato defeated him in the Republican primary by 70,000 votes, and went on to win the general election.

'Absent'
ANNOUNCER --This "year alone, Chuck Schumer missed over 100 votes in Congress. The worst attendance record of the 31 New York congressmen. He missed the vote to hire 100,000 new teachers. He missed the vote to save Social Security. The vote to improve breast cancer screening. He even missed the vote on health care for veterans."

 "And because he's from New York City, he said we should raise gas taxes even if we don't need the money. On Election Day, send Chuck Schumer a message. There's more to New York State than just Brooklyn."
 
'Facts Don't Lie'
ANNOUNCER --"The facts about Chuck Schumer's record on crime are very clear. Chuck Schumer voted to allow violent criminals to leave jail before serving their full sentence. He voted against mandatory sentences for criminals who use guns. And in the Assembly, Chuck Schumer even voted against tougher penalties for child pornographers. The facts don't lie. Chuck Schumer is a New York City liberal. Chuck Schumer. Wrong on crime. Wrong for us."

ANNOUNCER -- "D'Amato's lying about Chuck Schumer and upstate. Why? After D'Amato's 18 years in the Senate, the upstate economy is about the worst in the nation."
"D'Amato. Too many lies for too long."
 
'92 Percent'
ANNOUNCER -- "Al D'Amato's lying again. The truth? Chuck Schumer has a 92 percent lifetime attendance record. And unlike Al D'Amato, who votes against education, against Medicare and against new cops, Chuck Schumer votes for New York's working families."

Mall Builder Says 60% of Space Taken

 BODY:
Glimcher Realty Trust has signed leases or obtained letters of intent to lease 60 percent of a 1.3 million-square-foot mall it is building on a former landfill in Elizabeth, N.J., the developer said yesterday.
Retailers that have signed leases include Annie Sez, Bed Bath and Beyond, Daffy's and Foot Locker, said Marie Izzo Cartwright, a spokeswoman for Glimcher, a real estate investment trust based in Columbus, Ohio. Ms. Cartwright declined to discuss lease terms or say how much space had been leased or was still under negotiation. 
 The Gardens Value Mega Mall is being built at a cost of $363 million just off the New Jersey Turnpike near Newark International Airport. Financing includes $140 million in tax-exempt economic development bonds and government grants, a $163 million loan from Bankers Trust and Huntington National Bank, plus $56 million in equity from Glimcher. Construction began in April, and the mall is scheduled to open in the fall of 1999, Ms. Cartwright said.
Despite recent signs of declining consumer confidence, Ms. Cartwright said the mall would include bargain outlets like Off 5th-Saks Fifth Avenue Outlet, and should be attractive to the cost-conscious.
Jeffrey Feiner, a retail analyst at Lehman Brothers, said the mall's favorable location was more important than the short-term economic outlook. "I think consumer spending is likely to slow down," Mr. Feiner said. But he added, "One could easily argue that from a longer-term standpoint, this could be viewed as an intelligent move."

HEADLINE: Waving Her Cultural Magic Wand

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
In her wheelchair, facing a roomful of work by the likes of Donald Judd and Barnett Newman, her back to the magnificent view of San Francisco Bay afforded by her apartment in the Pacific Heights section, Phyllis C. Wattis seemed braced by what she loves: modern art and this city. At 93, her hearing is poor and a recent leg infection has curtailed her mobility, but she wears her hair jauntily in a silver pageboy and she has an unmistakably mischievous smile. In deference to company, she wasn't listening to Stravinsky, turned up loud. "I play 'The Rite of Spring' all the time," she said.
It was a rare interview for Mrs. Wattis, one of the nation's great cultural philanthropists -- "California's Brooke Astor," in the words of David A. Ross, the new director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art -- whose generosity, mostly to local arts institutions, has amounted to an astounding $100 million. She squeezed the interview in between a board meeting at the modern art museum and a visit to the San Francisco Art Exposition, where she viewed almost all the 100 booths, a sampling of galleries worldwide. 
 The October afternoon was one that her husband, Paul Wattis, a construction and mining magnate whose philanthropic interests were more science-oriented, would have indulged but not understood. He died in 1971; his company, Utah International, which in its early days was the primary contractor on the Hoover Dam, was bought by General Electric five years later, a merger that greatly enhanced Mrs. Wattis's wealth.
"We always gave whatever we could," she said. "You have to give. But my husband thought all artists were robbers if they tried to sell their art. They were decorators to him."
She laughed at the memory, just one of myriad anomalous elements of her long life. Arts donors, after all, are rare enough. But perhaps no one is like the independent-minded Mrs. Wattis, a great-granddaughter of Brigham Young who moved here from Utah in 1936 and has, particularly in the last part of her life, treated her adopted city in the manner of a tough, doting mother determined to rear a cultured child.
"I can imagine Phyllis as a pioneer woman," said Lotfi Mansouri, the general director of the San Francisco Opera since 1988. "My favorite story about her is that when I was appointed, some of the board members had a dinner party to introduce me, and they had me sitting next to Phyllis. At dessert, she turned to me and said, "Damn it, usually these parties are so boring I didn't bring my hearing aid. But I think you might be saying some interesting things."
Admired not just for her generosity, but for her discernment, she is known for her thoughtful gifts, from an English horn for a teen-ager in the San Francisco Youth Orchestra to the more than $20 million that recently helped the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art buy 13 works by Robert Rauschenberg and others by Duchamp, Mondrian, Anselm Kiefer and Wayne Thiebaud when its collection was being criticized as unworthy of its new building.
"She believes a great museum needs to be based on masterpieces," Mr. Ross said. "She unabashedly believes in the power of great works of art, and she gives unqualified support, an increasingly rare thing."
The cultural life of this city owes much of its profile to her. In the early 1980's, after Mrs. Wattis gave $3.25 million to the San Francisco Symphony to help build its new home, she also donated $750,000 more so the hall could have an organ, a particular yearning of its music director at the time, Edo de Waart.
"I don't think she cared about it so much, but she sensed that he cared about it," said Peter Pastreich, the symphony's executive director. "Others were asking, 'How often will you play this thing?' And the truth is, you don't play it every week, but when you do, you want it to be great. That's an argument that Phyllis Wattis understands and others don't."
Without her, the San Francisco Opera would not have been able to commission contemporary works like Sir Michael Tippett's "Midsummer Marriage" and Hans Werner Henze's "The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With the Sea." Nor could it have staged several productions of Alban Berg's "Wozzeck" and "Lulu," or, with anything resembling the lavish care it received, its current production of "A Streetcar Named Desire"; she paid for the entire production and the rehearsal time.
"I've had the same seats at the opera for 30 years," Mrs Wattis said wryly. "I felt it was my duty to get them out of 'La Boheme.' "
It was just a decade ago that she surprised the San Francisco cultural world by suddenly dissolving the foundation she had founded with her husband in 1958 and run since his death, distributing all its $26 million in assets. Since then, she has given away some $70 million of her personal funds. She donated $20 million to the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco for a new building yet to be built and acquisitions. She gave $5 million to the city's Museum of Modern Art for its new building, now four years old, before her gift for acquisitions. The California Academy of Sciences received $10 million, the Exploratorium $5 million, the Berkeley Art Museum $2 million.
"Obviously it can't be a bottomless pit, but I don't think she intends to die with any money," said Nancy Bechtle, the president of the symphony board. "Most philanthropists don't give away their capital, but that's what she does, and she gives graciously and gladly."
What makes Mrs. Wattis that much more unusual is that she grew up with no interest in the arts and no encouragement to pursue them. She was born Phyllis Cannon in 1905 in Salt Lake City. She was the third of six children whose father was a sugar company executive and mother a homemaker.
"I grew up as a tomboy in a big family, and I don't think I ever thought about art," she said. "I don't ever remember going to a museum. My mother thought she could sing. I was sent to take music lessons with my uncle. It didn't take."
Her parents' families, though not her parents, were polygamous. Her paternal grandfather, George Q. Cannon, had five wives and 35 children; a fanatic about education, he sent all of his children east to school. His 22 sons all went to M.I.T. The girls, "whatever number that leaves," Mrs. Wattis said, "went to Fannie Farmer's cooking school." Her own father, she said, enjoyed travel. "He took us to Europe, a family of six," she said. "And I remember he put us on a plane from Paris to London, in 1925, two years before Lindbergh."
Mrs. Wattis attended the University of Utah, then finished her degree, in economics, at the University of California at Berkeley before returning to Utah. She married, and when her husband's company moved its headquarters to San Francisco in 1936 she settled there.
Despite her husband's antipathy toward artists, he was an opera fan, and the couple attended together. Still, though the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art had been founded, by Grace L. McCann Morley, the year before they arrived, Mrs. Wattis said she did not bother with the museum until the early 1950's.
"That was the first time I saw modern art," she said. It wasn't until 1964, however, when a driving tour of Europe brought her and her husband to Kassel, Germany, home of the Documenta art fair, "that I understood what Grace had been talking about all those years."
In three days at Documenta, "it was all in front of me," she said. "I saw everybody for the first time. Calder, Max Ernst, Emil Nolde. That was my real introduction." She added, shyly, "I did some drawing myself." And she began to buy art. Her first acquisition, an abstract marble sculpture by Max Bill, stands today in her foyer.
When Paul Wattis died, he left his assets in the foundation, which had grown from what Mrs. Wattis described as almost an afterthought -- "everyone was starting foundations back then" -- to an organization that was regularly solicited by scientific and artistic causes. She ran it nearly single-handedly; her son and daughter and two nephews, who were nominally on the board, showed little interest. Finally, in 1988, fearful of its management in the future, she decided to liquidate.
"I thought, 'What's going to happen to it?' So I just decided to distribute it all."
The latest flurry of gifts, those who know Mrs. Wattis say, has been motivated by her failing health. "She has finally focused on her mortality," said Gary Garrels, chief curator at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. "She's saying, 'I want to do things while I'm here.' I mean, how much fun is a bequest?"
And she does, evidently, have fun. At the Art Exposition, accompanied by Mr. Garrels and Ella King Torrey, president of the San Francisco Art Institute, she greeted dealers from all over the country; remembered one, Linda Durham, a woman from New Mexico she had met 20 years earlier who called Mrs. Wattis "the first person to ever be kind to me when I started out in business," and impressed another, Perry Rubenstein, from New York, with her questions about an abstract painting by Gerhard Richter.
"Most people are buying trophies," Mr. Rubenstein said when she was gone. "She's not. She has real intellectual curiosity, which is what distinguishes the lookers from the great collectors."
Afterward, as she sipped champagne and discussed with Mr. Garrels the work of the painter Sigmar Polke, Ms. Torrey recalled last year's Christmas party at the Art Institute, where the tree was topped with a puppet made by two students; it was Mrs. Wattis's likeness, in a long gown, holding a wand. Mrs. Wattis had given the school $5 million for the faculty retirement fund, physical resources and equipment.
"She gave generously, but not lightly," Ms. Torrey said. "She was very tough on me about it, wanting to know exactly how the money would be used. But it was everything we needed. And the students knew it."
Hence the puppet, which they presented to her. "Fairy-God Phyllis," they called it.

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
The Line Between Loving and Cursing

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:

LIKE NEVER BEFORE
By Ehud Havazelet
268 pages. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $23.
 There is a moment in Ehud Havazelet's new book, "Like Never Before," that incarnates the distilled bitterness, the melancholy sting, of this quietly powerful collection of stories. Max Birnbaum, the distracted and ineffectual son of a famous rabbi from Cracow and the father of two disappointing children, is in his living room in Queens speaking to his wife, Esther, who is dying of cancer. 
"I love them," he says abruptly, speaking of his children, David and Rachel, whose estrangement from their parents exemplifies Mr. Havazelet's view of human relations as battles nearly to the death.
"Tell them that," Esther replies. And then:
"Tell them," he sneers. "That I never will understand them, how they live?" Max thinks about his long-dead brother, killed by the Nazis, and he has Job-like thoughts of God: "That every morning I curse him for a traitor and I curse them for the unhappiness they bring." His hands make a gesture of futility. "You too," he says, "for tricking me like this, for leaving. Every morning I curse you all, and then I curse myself. I should tell them that?"
Mr. Havazelet, who got respectful attention for "What Is It Then Between Us?," his first collection of stories, proves himself again an impressively talented writer in "Like Never Before," a book that lives on the precarious edge between loving and cursing. A series of independent but related stories, the new book consists of intense, often searing scenes from three generations of a spiritually wounded Polish Jewish family living in Queens.
Mr. Havazelet writes with a kind of anatomical precision, his scalpel slicing at his characters to expose the dark reality beneath. He has a sharp, almost grotesque wit, a fine ear for the eccentric cadences of lower-middle-class New York Jews and an unsentimental compassion for the scars they bear.
The first story, "Six Days," sets the scene, etching in the relationship between Birnbaum and his son that will emerge as the central conflict of Mr. Havazelet's collection of vignettes. Birnbaum teaches in a Hebrew day school, living in the shadow of his father, the rabbi of an Orthodox Brooklyn congregation. One Yom Kippur, in his father's synagogue, prayers are interrupted when David and a friend, playing ball outside (already a sacrilege), break a synagogue window with a ball.
"The boy saw his father's eyes, the look in them. He's going to kill me, he thought. Birnbaum leaned over, grunting words he didn't recognize. He tried to reach with his fists, but he couldn't, so he began using his feet on the red-faced creature scuttling away from him on its back near the wall."
In "Light of This World," which describes a day in the life of three truants from the Hebrew Day School, it becomes clear that there is a cruelty in David that goes beyond the normal cruelty of children. Mr. Havazelet provides a flashback in the next story, "Lyon," where Birnbaum, then 16 and known as Maxim Birnboym, and his older brother, Rachmil, both refugees from Cracow, collect money to pay for Jews to be smuggled across the border into Switzerland. This brief excursion into Birnbaum's past is all the more powerful because it is so brief, and only once more referred to -- in Birnbaum's acrid comment to his dying wife.
The brief incident, written with a kind of verbal suddenness reminiscent of Isaac Babel, tells almost all one needs to know about the troubled fate of the Birnbaum family. It is not only the sins of the fathers that are visited upon the sons, Mr. Havazelet seems to be saying. It is more importantly the wounds that have been inflicted upon them and that they struggle without success to keep to themselves.
The most brilliantly executed piece in the collection may be "Leah," which is the story of Rachel, David's sister, told through her relationship with a female cousin exactly her age, a kind of inverse doppelganger. While Rachel shares David's rebelliousness, she is more lost than vengeful. David, whose look is one of "quiet outrage, detachment, the aloof expectation of pain," is a disturbed and disturbing figure, shown by Mr. Havazelet in an almost luridly bright and unforgiving light.
In "Leah" we see him as a 17-year-old full of mockery, contempt and self-punishment, a boy who spreads a dark shadow around him. We later glimpse his marriage to a non-Jewish woman named Maura, who fails to evoke a sympathetic response in her husband when a neighbor is murdered. David by now has become an architect, intelligent and ambitious, but he is so damaged and self-punishing as to be unwitting in his cruelty. He falls in love with a young woman at work, comes home late one night and wakes Maura to tell her the news. "What was happening to him was unusual," he thinks in his solipsistic way; "if it happened to you once in your life you were lucky. Could she try and see that?"
Mr. Havazelet tells these stories with a remarkable economy and stylistic precision, the characters emerging in just a few quick strokes. "His mouth, through his thick ungainly beard, was a wet red hole glistening with teeth," he writes of an early suitor of Rachel's cousin Leah. When Birnbaum is introduced to David's second non-Jewish wife, he takes it as "one more signal that his life, so meagerly lit, was about to get darker still."
There is very little in the way of redemption in Mr. Havazelet's vision of subtly but irrevocably afflicted lives, only a small flicker of possible understanding between David and Rachel near the end. When Birnbaum, his wife dead, goes to Seattle to try to settle his accounts with David, living there with his wife and two young children, even the effort of the two men to embrace is a failure. The experience of reading Mr. Havazelet's stories is one well on the dark side of poignancy, but it is also one of pleasure at the realization of a striking talent.

HEADLINE: Ford to Produce Gearless Car Transmission

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 13

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company announced plans today for mass production of a new, gearless car transmission to be produced in a joint venture that could also become a new model for labor relations in the auto industry.
The new transmission, which uses a system of pulleys instead of gears, allowing many subtle gradations of power to speed, improves fuel economy by 10 percent to 15 percent, Ford said. Large-scale installation of the new transmission would help Ford meet Federal fuel-economy regulations in the United States and compete in foreign markets where gas prices are high and fuel economy is important to car buyers. 
 Ford said that it would form the joint venture with ZF Friedrichshafen A.G. of Germany, which had patented a design for a so-called continuously variable automatic transmission. Ford will own 49 percent of the venture and ZF will own 51 percent. The two companies said they would begin installing the transmissions in 2001 model-year cars and would install a million of the new transmissions annually by 2005 at a Ford transmission factory in Ohio.
The transmissions would be installed mainly in small Ford cars in the United States and abroad. But Ford also planned to sell some to other auto makers overseas, said Jacques Nasser, the president of Ford's worldwide automotive operations, who will become Ford's chief executive at the end of the year.
Ford's choice of a joint venture to build the new transmissions also opened the door for it to make the first use of an unusual provision in all of the Big Three's labor contracts since 1996. The provision allowed the auto makers to pay lower wages in any new auto parts businesses that they enter through joint ventures.
Mr. Nasser said that all current employees at the company's transmission factory in Batavia, Ohio, would remain Ford employees. But any future hires would be employees of the new joint venture, and Ford would eventually like to have a separate labor agreement at the factory, he told reporters today.

HEADLINE: Prototype of Peace via Trade in Gaza

BYLINE: By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr. 

DATELINE: GAZA, Oct. 9

 BODY:
The grandly named Gaza Industrial Estate, an unprepossessing 120-acre collection of vacant factory sheds and water towers rising from the ragged flatlands east of Gaza City, is an unlikely focus for the highly charged, high-stakes Middle East peace negotiations.
Fenced off from potential markets by the barbed wire of the Israeli border, the park has been ready for business for nearly a year. But security-conscious Israeli officials had been unwilling to guarantee the unimpeded flow of goods that an industrial park needs to attract and sustain investment. 
 Now, hailed by all sides as the first tangible achievement of the current phase of the tortuous Israeli-Palestinian negotiating process, the Gaza Industrial Estate is expected to be operating before the end of the year. It will employ up to a thousand Palestinians, and eventually more, in several small-scale manufacturing ventures.
What was hailed here as a diplomatic and economic breakthrough would almost anywhere else in the world be an unexceptional, small step in industrial development.
Still, it is a measure of the Gaza Strip's isolation and economic desperation that this tentative, modest project looms so large for Palestinian planners.
"This is very, very important," said Abdel Rahman Naim, head of the Gaza office of the Palestinian Directorate for Free Zones and Industrial Parks, part of the Palestinian Authority. "This will be the first concrete outcome of these negotiations, the first project with real benefits for people here."
At the same time, the Gaza project has been embraced by Israeli officials eager to demonstrate some visible progress and flexibility in the talks. "Karni seems like a little item on the agenda, but it can have great ramifications," said Natan Sharansky, Israel's Trade and Industry Minister, using the Israeli name for the border crossing known to Palestinians as Montar.
Opening the park for business has also been a key short-term goal of American mediators, who are acutely aware of the steady economic deterioration here since the signing of the Oslo accords between Israel and the Palestinians five years ago.
The United States has pledged some $6 million for items like a water treatment plant on the Palestinian side and the improvement of Israeli border inspection sites.
Gaza now has little to offer a labor force that expands by an extraordinary 5 percent yearly, propelled by what for 15 years has been the highest recorded birth rate in the world. Emigration from Gaza to Israel or to Palestinian areas in the West Bank is forbidden by the Israeli authorities.
Depression-scale unemployment -- averaging 37 percent last year, the United Nations has reported -- is worsened by Israeli denials of daily work visas for the 25,000 Gaza laborers who are authorized to cross the border for jobs in construction and agriculture. Israel cites security as the reason for the visa denials.
As they concluded talks in Jerusalem and Gaza in recent days in preparation for the coming round of peace negotiations in Maryland, American officials said optimistically that they anticipated 17 initial private investors and an eventual 40,000 workers at the park, a figure equivalent to a fifth of the current Gaza labor force.
The Palestinians managing the project are more cautious, reporting that they have received a dozen serious proposals -- one from an Israeli company, the rest from Palestinians -- for projects ranging from garment making to the manufacture of steel security doors.
If all of the projects go forward, they say, the park will employ about 3,000 people within 18 months and as many as 20,000 within five years.
"As an industrial zone, this is very small," acknowledged Awni Abdul-Rahim, the general manager of the Palestinian Industrial Estates Development Company, or Piedco, the local company running the park.
And its economic viability, he added, is contingent on the cooperation of Israeli customs and security officials, who will ultimately control access. "Everything depends on Israel," Mr. Abdul-Rahim said.
Gaza's exports are routinely obstructed by border closings and security checks, further skewing a chronic trade imbalance. For every five trucks that arrive here from Israel, only one goes out, and it typically goes out very slowly.
On a recent afternoon at the border checkpoint next to the industrial park, six Israeli customs inspectors examined a truckload of Gaza potatoes for hours, pallet by pallet, bag by bag, with hand-held metal detectors.
American advisers hope to smooth these bottlenecks with computerized scanners, bonded inspections and other high-tech customs systems developed for the border between the United States and Mexico.
"If they want it to be a successful business it cannot be interrupted," Mr. Sharansky said. "Yet one of the biggest explosions of the last year in Tel Aviv started with a truck from Gaza, so we can't take the security issue lightly."
While the agreement to open the industrial zone is being trumpeted by American diplomats as a done deal, Palestinians and Israelis are still haggling over legal and technical details and, perhaps more important from the Palestinian viewpoint, how it is portrayed in an eventual peace accord.
The Palestinian Industrial Estates Development Company, which says it is investing $10 million in the industrial park, is controlled by the powerful Masri clan from Nablus in the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority, which has leased the land for 49 years, will receive 10 percent of Piedco's profits, Mr. Abdul-Rahim said.
The Palestinians acknowledge that their ultimate goal is to attract Israeli joint ventures, both for immediate business reasons -- Palestinian industry "is weak on marketing," Mr. Naim said -- and as a long-term survival strategy.
A precondition for any Palestinian export venture is secure access through Israel to other foreign markets, and the Palestinians hope to build an allied constituency of Israeli industrialists equally dependent on open borders.
Palestinian officials, some of whom once preached socialist self-sufficiency, promise a laissez-faire paradise for prospective export manufacturers. They say there will be no corporate taxes, minimal regulatory oversight and workers who will earn $300 to $400 a month, the prevailing unskilled pay rate within Gaza but about half of what Palestinians earn in Israel.
"There will be no interference from government or from unions," Mr. Naim said.

HEADLINE: Bill to Increase Work Visas for Foreigners Gets New Lease on Life

BYLINE: By JERI CLAUSING 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 13

 BODY:
Congressional leaders revived legislation today that would nearly double the number of employment visas available for skilled foreign workers.
The measure, which is sought by high-technology industries, appeared dead on Friday night, but budget negotiators agreed today to include it in the omnibus spending bill that Congress is trying to finish this week so it can adjourn. 
 "This is a big victory for the economy, which is being fueled in large part by our high-tech industries," said the author of the legislation, Senator Spencer Abraham, a Michigan Republican. "The legislation strikes the right balance in safeguarding America's competitive edge and protecting U.S. jobs."
The final proposal represents a hard-fought compromise with the White House, which had opposed Senator Abraham's original measure because of concerns that it lacked proper protections for American workers.
Silicon Valley companies have pushed hard for the visa legislation, contending that they cannot find enough skilled Americans to fill crucial jobs.
The industry won another victory today with the passage of the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act, which is intended to protect technology and other start-up companies from lawsuits in state courts over stock price fluctuations. The compromise measure, now endorsed by both houses of Congress, imposes a single national standard for such suits.
The legislation to increase the number of so-called H1-B work visas, a result of months of wrangling with the White House, appeared to have been killed on Friday night after Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, questioned the validity of the high-technology industries' claims of worker shortages and blocked a final vote.
The final version increases from 65,000 to 115,000 the number of H1-B visas available in each of the next two years and sets the number at 107,500 in the third year.
It requires that if 15 percent or more of a company's work force consists of employees on H1-B visas, it must attest that they have not replaced American workers.
Companies hiring H1-B workers with master's degrees or higher or at salaries of $60,000 or more would be exempt from that requirement. There are also special exemptions for small businesses and start-up companies.
The legislation also authorizes the Labor Department to investigate suspected abuses of the program and imposes a $500 filing fee on visa applications and renewals. The more than $75 million raised by these fees would be used for training and scholarship programs for United States citizens.

No Need for World Rate Cut, European Bank Chief Says

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 13

 BODY:
Despite growing anxiety that global financial problems might soon affect Europe, the president of the new European Central Bank rejected demands today to relax monetary policy in an effort to spur economic growth.
In a toughly worded message aimed in part at European political leaders, the central bank said there was no need for worldwide reductions in interest rates or other forms of "policy activism" to jump-start economic growth. 
 "There is certainly some kind of slowdown, but not a crisis," said Wim Duisenberg, who as president of the European Central Bank now oversees monetary policy across the 11 countries that will adopt the euro as a single currency on Jan. 1.
"Proposals for a reassessment of capital controls as an acceptable policy option, or recent calls for worldwide, uniform interest rate reductions, are inappropriate as they do not address the very nature of the problems," he said.
Mr. Duisenberg's remarks, which came after a meeting of the bank's governing council, underline a growing divergence between monetary policy in Europe and the United States. While the Federal Reserve has begun lowering American interest rates amid fear of a significant slowdown in the economy, the European bankers are barely flinching from their original course and remain preoccupied with establishing the new currency's credibility.
A surprising effect of that policy has been the strength of existing European currencies, like the German mark and the French franc, which essentially mirror expectations for the euro.
Traders, far from being skittish about an untested currency in the offing, have begun buying the current national currencies as a haven from global shocks in Asia, Latin America and Russia. The mark and the franc are nearly 10 percent stronger against the dollar than they were in August.
In recent days, the European Central Bank has come under increasing pressure from national leaders to either reduce interest rates or support other measures to keep European growth from slipping.
In Germany, Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroder has called for lower rates, and his designated finance minister has repeatedly assailed the German central bank's, and by extension the European bank's, tight-money policies as misguided. The French Cabinet continues its complaints against those policies.
Most economists predict that growth in the so-called euro zone will remain above 2.5 percent through the end of 1998 but will substantially slow next year. The continuing problems in Asia and Latin America are expected to curtail demand for European exports, and the recent shift in exchange rates will dig more deeply by making European exports more expensive in dollar terms.
Signs of slowing growth are already becoming apparent in Germany, where industrial exports have been the economic engine in the last 18 months. Machine-tool and engineering companies have lowered their forecasts for exports next year. Hoechst, the chemical and pharmaceutical giant, warned on Monday that its profits in the second half of this year would fall below those in the period a year earlier.
European banks are also reporting big setbacks and are eliminating thousands of jobs because of losses in securities trading, soured foreign loans and heightened competitive pressure. In the last 10 days, the chairmen of two leading financial institutions -- UBS of Switzerland and ING Barings in the Netherlands -- have resigned in the wake of big losses. Some analysts expect more bad news in the months ahead, predicting that banks will be forced to write off more foreign loans than they already have.
Mr. Duisenberg acknowledged that financial crises elsewhere would affect Europe. "The number of signs suggesting that the world economy will slow down in 1999 is increasing," he said at a news conference here today. He also noted that uncertainty had been heightened by the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, the American hedge fund, and by the losses at individual banks.
But he insisted that "proposals inspired by policy activism" must be avoided. He said he was not concerned about the recent plunge in the exchange value of the dollar, which could hurt European exports. And he said European interest rates were about where they should be. "There are no signs of a credit crunch in Europe," he maintained.
The European Central Bank is still struggling with the tools it will use to set monetary policy, torn between basing it simply on the growth of the money supply or on inflation targets. In principle, many central bankers would prefer to follow the example of the Bundesbank, which bases lending rates almost entirely on the growth of the German money supply. In practice, money statistics vary considerably between countries in the new currency union, and new forms of financial transactions have further complicated the definitions of money.
After months of debate behind closed doors, Mr. Duisenberg announced that the bank would use both money supply and inflation targets. The overall goal will be to keep inflation under 2 percent.
Mr. Duisenberg acknowledged the bank was under pressure. "The political pressure could increase -- I would not deny that," he said. "But it is pressure against a strong institution. We will make our own judgments, use our own analysis and reach our own decisions."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
General Motors Posts Loss of $809 Million

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 13

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation lost $809 million in the third quarter, mainly because of a nearly eight-week-long strike that ended on July 29 and crippled G.M.'s production in North America, the auto maker announced today.
G.M.'s loss of $1.28 a diluted share was slightly better than analysts' expectations. The company's North American operations continued to cut costs aggressively, paying less for auto parts and making factories more efficient. But today's report also showed that the company had been discounting its vehicles heavily in North America while its foreign operations were beginning to suffer from economic troubles overseas. 
 Auto analysts said that the strike at two G.M. auto parts factories in Flint, Mich., had caused so much disruption that it was hard to draw firm conclusions from the quarter's results. "The best thing about the third quarter is it's over," said Michael Ward, an analyst at Paine Webber. "Going forward, the news should get more positive."
G.M. said the strike cost it $1.2 billion in the third quarter, the same amount it lost to the strike during the second quarter. Michael Losh, G.M.'s chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview that the $2.4 billion in after-tax losses from the strike should be pared to roughly $2 billion by the end of the year as factories continue to work overtime to make up lost production.
G.M. earned $1.04 billion during the third quarter of 1997, or $1.34 a share, but those figures included aerospace operations that G.M. has since sold. Excluding the aerospace operations, the strike and a $271 million after-tax charge for the disposal of some auto parts factories, G.M.'s profits fell 28.4 percent during the third quarter, to $697 million, compared with $973 million in the quarter a year earlier.
G.M.'s sales in the third quarter plunged to $34.42 billion, from $41.89 billion in the quarter a year earlier, partly because some operations were sold but mainly because of the strike.
Mr. Losh said that with the third quarter behind it, G.M. was well positioned for the fourth quarter. The introductions of new pickup trucks in North America and the new Opel Astra sedan in Europe were expensive during the third quarter but should start helping the auto maker's results, he said.
While G.M. spent an unusually high average of $1,732 a vehicle in discounts in the North American market during the third quarter, that figure fell to $1,400 for sales at the end of September, Mr. Losh said. Full-sized pickup trucks require virtually no discounts to sell, and G.M. had very few of them until the end of the quarter because it was changing the design.
The weakening of the dollar this month may also make it harder for foreign auto makers to offer discounts, easing the pressure on G.M. to provide large discounts. "One of the things that ought to help us is the yen is not 135 or 145" to the dollar, Mr. Losh said. The dollar was trading at 119.15 yen late today in New York.
Financial analysts generally accepted G.M.'s predictions that with the strike more than two months in the past, discounts might dwindle. "Once you get your '98 models cleared out and your floor traffic back, then you can cut the incentives," said Greg L. Salchow, an auto analyst at Roney & Company, a brokerage house here.
Investors had little reaction today to G.M.'s results. Shares of G.M. fell 87.5 cents, to $51.0625, in a falling market.
G.M. announced plans in August to sell or spin off a 20 percent stake in Delphi Automotive Systems, its huge auto parts subsidiary, early next year, and Mr. Losh reaffirmed those plans today. G.M.'s longstanding intention to wait until next year may allow enough time for financial markets to settle down, he said.
The strike pushed G.M.'s cash reserves down to $11.5 billion on Sept. 30 from $14.6 billion a year earlier and $12.1 billion on June 30. Mr. Losh said that G.M. expected the reserves to rebound soon to the company's target of $13 billion. When that happens, G.M. will resume the $4 billion share buyback program that it announced in March and suspended last summer in response to the strike, he added.
One of the sharpest tumbles in G.M.'s earnings occurred in the unit handling automotive operations in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. Mainly because of the high interest rates and weak economy in Brazil, previously one of G.M.'s most profitable markets, the division reported a loss in the third quarter of $64 million after a $165 million after-tax profit a year earlier.
G.M. automotive operations in Europe earned $50 million in the third quarter after losing $21 million in the quarter a year earlier. G.M.'s tiny Asian automotive division made $2 million in profits in the last three months after losing $7 million in the third quarter of last year. The General Motors Acceptance Corporation, which makes car loans and leases, earned $313 million in the third quarter, virtually unchanged from a $312 million gain in the quarter a year earlier.

Excluding just the Delphi transactions, the loss would have been $538 million, or a loss of 87 cents a share.

The cause was a stroke he suffered visiting Rochester, said Helene Snihur of the University of Rochester office of public relations. 
 Mr. Wallis was the university's president and chief executive from 1962 to 1970 and its chancellor and chief executive from 1970 to 1975, Ms. Snihur said.
A former president, Robert L. Sproull, said that in those 13 years, "Allen Wallis was the principal architect of the University of Rochester as we see it today."
The university, which opened in 1850, is known for the Memorial Art Gallery, the Eastman School of Music, its schools of dentistry and medicine and its library, which is especially strong in the fields of medicine, history and music.
It has 4,400 full-time undergraduates, 2,650 full-time graduate students and 1,010 faculty members.
While he was president, Mr. Wallis began a fund-raising campaign that raised $46.7 million, nearly $10 million more than its original goal, from 1965 to 1968. From 1968 to 1978, the university's extensive expansions and improvements of its physical plant included remodeling the Eastman School and expanding the library and the Medical Center.
From 1962 to 1975, the university's annual budget rose to $200 million from $33 million, its faculty grew by 37 percent, its number of graduate students doubled and its number of undergraduates increased by 45 percent.
From 1975 until he retired from the university in 1982, Mr. Wallis was its chancellor.
Before going to Rochester, Mr. Wallis, who was a statistician as well as an economist, was the dean of the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business from 1956 to 1962. .
As an economist, Mr. Wallis was known for his firm faith in minimal government intervention and in free markets. His writings included the 1976 book "An Overgoverned Society," a collection of his speeches and essays, in which he argued that Government regulations and rules were fettering individual liberties as well as the economy.
He served in the Administrations of four Republican Presidents -- Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford and Ronald Reagan -- although he said in 1959, "I'm not actually a Republican." Instead, he said, he was an "independent" or even "apolitical." He also served as a consultant to numerous governmental and business groups.
From 1959 to 1961 he was special assistant to Eisenhower, and concurrently he collaborated with Vice President Nixon on the report of the Cabinet Committee on Price Stability for Economic Growth. In the 1970's, Mr. Wallis served in the Nixon and Ford Administrations as chairman of the President's Commission on Federal Statistics and of the Advisory Council on Social Security.
From 1982 to 1989 he was Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, mostly during the Reagan Administration.
George P. Shultz, a Secretary of State in the Reagan years, said Mr. Wallis was "our truth teller."
Much of Mr. Wallis's work as Under Secretary involved international summit meetings. "I relied on him," Mr. Shultz said. "His contributions to our work were immense."
Mr. Wallis was born in Philadelphia, received his bachelor's degree in 1932 from the University of Minnesota and did graduate work there, at the University of Chicago and at Columbia University. He taught at Yale, Columbia and Stanford, and worked in World War II for the United States Office of Scientific Research before joining the University of Chicago business school faculty.
Mr. Wallis was chairman of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in 1977 and 1978.
His wife of 59 years, the former Anne Armstrong, died in 1994. He is survived by two daughters, Nancy Wallis Ingling of Gambier, Ohio, and Virginia Wallis Cates of Wagon Mound, N.M., and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Reverberations of a Fading Boom

 BODY:
There are great advantages for New York in being the financial capital of the world. But there is a downside. When financial markets are roiled, and investors grow hesitant, Wall Street inevitably cuts back. Those cuts are likely to have a larger impact on the New York region than on other areas. It would be wise for city and state officials to start planning now for reduced tax revenues.
The rounds of Wall Street layoffs are just beginning, and could be larger than those that followed the 1987 stock market crash. Merrill Lynch, which yesterday announced plans to lay off 3,400 employees and 900 consultants -- about 1,500 in the metropolitan area -- believes it erred in 1987 by not reacting quickly enough. 
 Wall Street is being hurt by more than lower stock prices. Securities firms make much of their business underwriting new securities and selling them to investors. But the volume of such under writings has fallen sharply as investors have shunned bonds from all but the safest companies. Merrill pointed to bond markets and to emerging markets -- Asia and Latin America -- as the areas where the cuts would be steepest.
By one measure, the securities industry is not a very big part of the local economy. Stephen Kagann, Gov. George Pataki's top economist, notes that just 3.3 percent of the people with jobs in the city and its New York suburbs work for Wall Street firms.
But Wall Street's economic importance is far greater than that figure would indicate. Not only are there workers in related industries, such as banking and insurance, but the Wall Street jobs have been both the best-paying and the fastest-growing. The average income for those who work in the securities business in New York was $172,000 last year, or about four times the average for all downstate New York employees. That figure is inflated because many of Wall Street's lower-paying back-office jobs are now in New Jersey, but it remains impressive.
That figure is likely to fall. Much of the Wall Street payments come in the form of bonuses paid early in the calendar year. Even for those who keep their jobs, next year's bonuses are likely to be sharply lower. That has negative implications for high-end retailers and expensive home sales, as well as for state and city income-tax collections. New York politicians accustomed to the budget surpluses that have been generated in part by the Wall Street boom had better trim back their expectations.

HEADLINE: Pfizer Shares Ebb as Johnson & Johnson's Rise

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Shares in Pfizer Inc. dropped in post-session trading yesterday after the pharmaceutical company reported third-quarter earnings below Wall Street expectations, but Johnson & Johnson met expectations and saw its stock climb.
The stock of Pfizer, which makes the anti-impotence drug Viagra, fell $6.75, to $89 on the Instinet electronic trading system after hours. It reported third-quarter earnings a diluted share on a continuing basis of 51 cents. 
 Analysts had expected the company to earn about 57 cents, according to First Call. Revenues jumped 21 percent, to $3.33 billion in the quarter, including a $141 million contribution from Viagra.
But third quarter per-share earnings growth was crimped six percentage points because results were compared with a quarter last year that had an unusually low tax rate.
And it said worldwide sales would have been 4 percent higher if not for the strong dollar, which reduced the value of products sold overseas.
Pfizer said it was confident of delivering per-share earnings of $1.95 to $2 in 1998 from continuing operations, noting it had previously cited a range of $2.05 to $2.10. It said it was lowering its guidance because of its divestiture of several medical device businesses.
Johnson & Johnson, the big health products company, reported a 12 percent increase in third-quarter profits yesterday, as strong American drug sales offset weakness in its medical device and consumer products units.
The company, based in New Brunswick, N.J., said worldwide growth reflected the strong performance of Risperdal, an antipsychotic medication; Procrit, for the treatment of anemia; Duragesic, a pain-treating skin patch for chronic cancer patients, and the oral contraceptive line of products, including Ortho-Novum. Johnson & Johnson, which also makes popular consumer products like Band-Aids and Tylenol, reported net earnings of $961 million, or 70 cents a diluted share, matching the average estimate from analysts polled by First Call, and up from $855 million, or 63 cents a share, a year earlier.
The impact of the stronger dollar relative to foreign currencies cut quarterly sales 2.3 percent, reflecting "particularly difficult economic conditions in Asian markets," the company's statement said. Total domestic sales rose 3.8 percent, to about $3.08 billion in the quarter, while international sales rose 0.9 percent, to $2.65 billion, after the currency effects.
Worldwide pharmaceutical sales rose 9.4 percent, to $2.1 billion in the quarter, with domestic sales up 16.1 percent, while international sales rose 2.2 percent. Worldwide consumer products sales reached $1.59 billion, essentially flat versus a year ago, led by continued strength in its Neutrogena skin- and hair-care lines and strong performance from its Motrin analgesic products.
Johnson & Johnson stock rose $1.3125, to $77.75, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: U.N. Tries to Cajole Iraq Into Cooperating on Arms Inspections

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 13

 BODY:
The Security Council called on Iraq today to resume cooperation with United Nations weapon inspectors, alluding to prospects for faster progress on easing economic sanctions against Baghdad if it heeds the call.
That and several somewhat conciliatory statements by various members of the 15-member Council followed a periodic review today of Iraq's compliance in eliminating its weapons of mass destruction. 
 Such encouragement was clearly aimed at giving Baghdad some way of climbing down from a confrontation with the United Nations after Iraq suspended arms inspections on Aug. 5, and as President Saddam Hussein contemplates his next move.
Talks to resume cooperation failed last week when Baghdad charged that several Council members, notably the United States and Britain, were bent on maintaining sanctions.
Speaking at the end of today's four-hour review, the President of the Council, Sir Jeremy Greenstock of Britain, said that in the matter of Baghdad's chemical weapons and missiles, "there are not many items still to be resolved if that cooperation is forthcoming."
He was preceded by Mohammed el-Baradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, who said his Vienna-based organization had "no indications that Iraq has nuclear weapons, or nuclear-weapons-usable materials or the capability to produce such items."
But Mr. Baradei emphasized that the United Nations assessment was "credible" but "not absolute," asserting that it depended on the resumption of Iraq's opening its factories to monitoring.
For its part, the United States appeared lonely in its insistence that nothing should change. The United States representative to the Council, Peter Burleigh, said that despite the qualified clean bill of health given Iraq by the atomic energy agency on nuclear weapons, the American position on the need for continued intrusive searches "has not changed."
The attempt here last week to resolve the dispute failed when a high-level Iraqi delegation headed by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz left after two weeks of negotiations.
Secretary General Kofi Annan had suggested a compromise by which the United Nations would conduct a "comprehensive review" of Iraq's efforts, which Baghdad favored in the belief that the review would demonstrate that it had gone a long way toward eliminating its chemical and nuclear weapons and its missiles and in return should have some of the sanctions modified or lifted.
France, China and Russia have expressed considerable sympathy with that position. But Iraq remains mired in a dispute over its elimination of biological weapons, particularly the nerve gas VX, and the question of whether it has installed the gas on some of its missiles.
That issue will be the subject of another United Nations review set for Oct. 22 and 23, when France, Switzerland and the United States are to submit the results of examinations conducted on the missiles.
The United States has asserted that its scientists found evidence that Iraq loaded the gas onto some of its missiles. Switzerland said it had found no proof, and France has yet to deliver the results of the testing of samples that it has examined.
Richard Butler, who heads the United Nations Special Commission, charged with disarming Iraq, also gave the Council a confidential report. And a senior United Nations official, Prakash Shah of India, is due in Baghdad this week to try to resolve the dispute as a special envoy of Secretary General Annan.

HEADLINE: U.S. Unveils Plan to Revamp South Florida Water Supply and Save Everglades

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 13

 BODY:
The Army Corps of Engineers today released a plan to transform South Florida's fresh water supply and restore some of the flow of the Everglades -- "the River of Grass" -- to the course it followed for centuries.
The proposed $8 billion network of reservoirs and channels was received enthusiastically by environmentalists, who say that without it, the unique ecosystem could be ruined. Some agricultural interests also spoke approvingly of the plan, which is meant to stave off growing water shortages. 
 The 20-year project, which was years in the making, would radically alter how fresh water is stored and how it flows south from above Lake Okeechobee to Everglades National Park and Florida Bay. It would capture up to 85 percent of the fresh water -- hundreds of billions of gallons a year -- that is now channeled out to sea during the wet season, leaving the Everglades parched when the rains cease.
Under the plan, the water would be stored in massive lagoons and in underground aquifers, some to be released in the kind of sheet-like flow that used to seep across the gently inclined landscape, regulated only by the seasons, until settlement and development interfered.
And some of the water would continue to be used for irrigation or to slake the thirst of urban areas.
After a few months of public comment, the corps will revise the plan and present it next summer to Congress, which has to approve it before the work begins, probably not before 2002. Half the expense would be paid by the Federal Government, and the other half by the State of Florida.
Vice President Al Gore made the the plan public today in a visit to Florida, two days before its scheduled release by the Corps of Engineers, which manages Federal water projects. Budget negotiators in Washington were still arguing over how much to spend for related water and land acquisition projects in Florida, a sign that the proposal remains far from a certainty.
Environmental advocates embraced the plan enthusiastically.
"It is important because it is an endangered ecosystem, because there is no other ecosystem like it in the world, because it is our most endangered national park and because it is a test case of our interest in living sustainably with a natural ecosystem," said Stuart Strahl, executive director of the Everglades office of the National Audubon Society.
Even big agriculture companies that have been leery of plans to remove land from farming spoke approvingly, noting that unless something is done they will face water crises in the years ahead.
"Over the next 50 years we are going to have significant problems and we are not going to survive if we don't do something to re-engineer the system," said Malcolm S. Wade Jr., senior vice president of the United States Sugar Corporation, one of the region's biggest landowners.
About 170,000 acres of agricultural land will be replaced by storage reservoirs and storm water treatment plants, the corps study said.
The plan has several major features, many of which reverse the corps's practices going back for decades as it ditched and drained the Everglades, including these:
*Large water reservoirs will be built north of Lake Okeechobee, in the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie basins, in the Everglades Agricultural Area and along western Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade Counties.
*Water will be stored underground, recharging the aquifer, by pumping it into more than 300 wells that may accept as much as 1.6 billion gallons a day. It could be pumped back up when needed.
*Fresh water would be sent southward on more natural patterns by removing more than 500 miles of canals and levees and rebuilding the Tamiami Trail (U.S. 41) to let water flow beneath it more naturally.
But many of these techniques have never been used on such a vast scale or in regions like the porous flats of Florida, and much testing lies ahead before the wells and reservoirs can be proven feasible.
The plan is intended to address problems that stem from existing water management practices: the loss of 1.7 billion gallons a day of fresh water into the ocean, the resulting damage to estuaries where the balance of fresh and salt water is disturbed, the over-regulation of Lake Okeechobee as a reservoir, the erratic pulsing of water into the Everglades at the wrong times and in the wrong amounts, the lack of fresh water flowing into Florida Bay, the pollution of water by cities and farms and the dwindling supplies of fresh water for all purposes.
If nothing is done, the study said, water shortages will increase as the population grows, and the whole ecosystem will be "vastly degraded." Wetlands that store and cleanse flood waters and provide wildlife habitat will be lost, driving more animals into extinction, while inland and coastal water quality will continue to decline. In a state so heavily dependent on fishing and tourism, the economic effects would be profound, the study said.
Although environmental groups praised the plan, they said its success was far from assured.
"We are perhaps at the end of the beginning phase of coming to the critical decisions," said Ron Tipton, a senior program officer of the World Wildlife Federation. Among the obstacles he cited were the failure of Congress to provide the money that has already been pledged for Everglades projects, opposition by the sugar industry, uncertainty over the policies of Jeb Bush, the front-runner in the race for governor, and hostility in the Florida Legislature.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Dow Off 63 Points as Eastman Kodak Revenue Declines

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stock prices fell as the flow of third-quarter corporate earnings reports began to intensify.
Many companies have prepared investors with pre-announcements about a slide in profits, but investors showed yesterday that they are looking at more than just the bottom line. 
 Shares of Eastman Kodak were pounded after the company reported a 10 percent drop in revenues, largely as a result of a decline in sales to consumers in emerging markets like Russia and China. Even though revenues sagged, Kodak's net income figures beat analysts' expectations, in part because of cost reductions.
That sort of report might have cheered Wall Street at other times, but these are not other times.
"People are suspicious when companies can't pull out top-line growth," said Henry Herrmann, the chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed, a mutual fund company in Overland Park, Kan., with $26 billion in assets under management.
Kodak's stock fell by 11 3/16, or 13 percent, to 72 3/8. That result was responsible for 73 percent, or 46.1 points, of a 63.33-point decline in the Dow Jones industrial average, which closed at 7,938.14. It also contributed to a much smaller 2.91-point fall in the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which closed at 994.80.
"Two or three years ago, if a company showed improving earnings growth through lower costs, the market rejoiced," said A. Marshall Acuff, an equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. "Now the market senses that the world economy is slowing down, and is focused on growth in the top line, as well as on profits. Kodak gave the market a kind of smack in the face."
Sagging computer share prices dragged down the Nasdaq composite index, which fell 36.63 points, or 2.37 percent, to 1,509.45.
Monsanto was another big contributor to the decline in the Standard & Poor's 500 index. Shares of Monsanto fell 13 3/8, or 26.55 percent, to 37, after it said its proposed $35 billion merger with American Home Products had been canceled. American Home Products fell 5, to 45.
Nasdaq stocks were dragged down by computer companies like Dell Computer, which lost 3 1/16, to 53.
Not every company that reported earnings yesterday saw its stock price head lower.
Johnson & Johnson rose 1 5/16, to 77 3/4, after a solid earnings report. And Merrill Lynch, which has been clobbered in recent weeks, rose 1 1/16, to 44 15/16, after it reported a net loss of $164 million and said it would lay off 3,400 employees.
"It is hard to imagine things getting a lot worse in the financial sector," Bob Gasser, head of block trading at J. P. Morgan & Company, said.
Some market analysts, a group that includes Mr. Acuff at Salomon Smith Barney, said conditions have improved over the last week or so, and that the Dow was not likely to successfully test its Aug. 31 low.
But Mr. Herrmann said he could be happier. "We have been doing some buying, especially in small- capitalization stocks, but nothing wholesale," he said.
To feel better, Mr. Herrman said he would like to see long-term bond yields rise above short-term interest rates.
"That would allow the banking sector to reliquify itself by extending credit rather than just holding bonds," he said. "I would also like to get a sense that the hedge fund world, which includes big money- center banks, has finished unwinding its money-losing trades."
But even those accomplishments would not do much to help corporate earnings.
"No matter what we do there is going to be material pressure" on earnings, he said. "There is such an incredible excess of supply that companies don't have any pricing power. It will take us a while to work through that."

Treasuries Close Higher

Bond prices rose for the first time in five days yesterday as investors bought Treasuries after last week's plunge in prices drove long-term yields to a two-week high.

CASPIAN SEA: WHITE HOUSE PRESSES PIPELINE PLAN The White House will try to persuade 15 American oil companies to adopt its plan for building a pipeline from the oil fields of the Caspian Sea through Turkey. The national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, scheduled a discussion of the project with the chief executives of the companies for Oct. 22. American officials say they consider the issue open. Some Administration officials, Congressional aides and oil executives said last week that the companies were expected to recommend building the pipeline from Baku in Azerbaijan to Supsa in Georgia. The United States wants the pipeline extended through Turkey to a terminal at Ceyhan.

JAPAN: APOLOGY TO CHINA -- Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said Japan was quite likely to apologize to China in writing for its wartime actions when President Jiang Zemin of China visits Japan this year. Last week a Foreign Ministry official said that China would receive an apology smiliar to the one for South Korea. (Reuters)
 
AFGHANISTAN: U.N. ENVOY GOES TO TALIBAN -- A special envoy from the United Nations will travel today to the headquarters of the militant Islamic Taliban movement in Afghanistan for a day of talks aimed at reducing tensions with Iran. A spokesman for the United Nations, Fred Eckhard, said Secretary General Kofi Annan had authorized the diplomat, Lakhdar Brahimi, to undertake the "exceptional" mission to Kandahar "in view of the dangerous level of tensions" between the Taliban and Iran. (Agence France-Presse)
 
KYRGYZSTAN: AMMUNITION SEIZED -- National Security Minister Misir Ashirkulov reported that the Kyrgyz secret police had seized 700 tons of ammunition on its way from Iran to the Afghan opposition commander, Ahmad Shah Masood, whose troops are fighting the Taliban in northern Afghanistan.

BRITAIN: CAMPAIGN FUNDS WOULD BE CAPPED -- A Parliamentary committee recommended a spending cap of $34 million for each party in a national election, well below the $91 million that the Conservative and Labor Parties together spent last year. The long-awaited report also proposed public disclosure of contributions that exceed $8,000 and called for tax deductions on gifts up to $850 to spur small donations. The main recommendations are quite likely to become law next year. Lord Neill, chairman of the committee, said the lack of spending limits had given rise to "something of an arms race." Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
RUSSIA: YELTSIN REPORTED RECOVERING -- President Boris N. Yeltsin will stay at his country house until Friday to recover from bronchitis, the Kremlin said today. The Russian press has speculated that the Kremlin is covering up the seriousness of the President's illness. The Kremlin press service said it would not issue regular assessments of Mr. Yeltsin's health because he is merely suffering from a cold. Michael R. Gordon (NYT)
 
RUSSIA: PLANS FOR FOREIGN BANKS -- The Government promised to expand the role of foreign banks and said it would print additional money to pay its bills unless international lenders delivered promised aid. Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov reiterated that his Government had no plans to nationalize domestic banks. But in a meeting with 24 top bankers he expressed concern about a huge capital flight, which he put at $1.5 billion to $2 billion since the latest economic crisis struck in mid-August. (AP)
 
SPAIN: BASQUES SEEK IRISH HELP -- Leaders of the political wing of the Basque separatist group ETA asked Ireland to help persuade the Spanish Government to seize the opportunity presented by the Spanish guerrilla group's cease-fire to hold inclusive talks on a political settlement like that achieved in Northern Ireland. (Reuters)
 
GERMANY: LEADER FROM THE EAST -- The Social Democratic Party said it would nominate Wolfgang Thierse as President of the newly elected Parliament. That would make him the first politician from eastern Germany to head the Parliament since Germany was reunified in 1990. (NYT)

ERITREA AND YEMEN: ISLANDS' SOVEREIGNTY -- Eritrea and Yemen are cultivating closer ties after an international court of arbitration last week resolved their sovereignty dispute over the Hanish islands. The two countries clashed briefly in 1995 over the small arid islands, which are in an important shipping lane of the Red Sea. The Permanent Court of Arbitration in London ruled on Friday that the islands belonged partly to Yemen and partly to Eritrea. (Reuters)
 
LEBANON: CLEAR ROAD TO ELECTION -- The Lebanese Parliament amended the Constitution to clear the way for the election tomorrow of the army chief, Gen. Emile Lahoud, as President.

KENYA: I.M.F. READY FOR TALKS -- The International Monetary Fund said it was prepared to reopen talks with Kenya over a suspended $250 million aid package if the country took a stronger stand against corruption. Kenya has been hobbled by pervasive corruption, and that has kept away investors and caused the United States and other countries to limit assistance. Ray Bonner (NYT)
 
The World Food Program has delivered 935 tons of food aid to Malanje Province in Angola, resuming operations that were suspended a month ago, after its convoys had been attacked. (Agence France-Presse)
 
Burundi's warring politicians began a third round of peace talks aimed at bringing peace to their central African country, which has been ravaged by ethnic conflict between Tutsis and Hutus. The talks are being held behind closed doors in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha. Around 150,000 people have been killed in Burundi in five years. (Reuters)
 
LATIN AMERICA
 
MEXICO: PROPOSAL FOR 2-ROUND ELECTION -- The president of the National Action Party proposed that electoral laws be amended to allow for a two-round presidential election in 2000. The leader, Felipe Calderon, said that by reducing the field to two leading candidates in the first round, the winner of a second round would be president with the backing of a majority of voters. President Ernesto Zedillo's governing party, the PRI, has opposed two-round balloting. Sam Dillon (NYT)
 
ECUADOR: INDIANS WIN ROUND AGAINST TEXACO -- Indians from the Oriente rainforest have won another chance to pursue a $1 billion suit against Texaco. The Indians say the oil company polluted their region in 20 years of pumping oil. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York reversed a dismissal of the case, sending it back to the District Court for review. Representing 30,000 residents of the forest, the suit asks Texaco to pay for health and environmental damage, cleanup and rebuilding its equipment to meet United States standards.

CANADA: SHOWDOWN IN QUEBEC -- Premier Lucien Bouchard of Quebec announced that a showdown election would be held between separatists and federalists, probably next month. Polls suggest an extremely close race between Premier Bouchard's Parti Quebecois, which advocates separation from Canada, and the antiseparatist Liberal Party, headed by Jean Charest.If the separatists win, they have promised to hold another referendum on secession from Canada whenever they believe that their chances for victory are good. Their last referendum, in 1995, failed to win. (AP)

HEADLINE: Republicans Meet Aides To Clinton On I.M.F.

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 13

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration and Congressional Republican leaders met today to hammer out the final details of compromise legislation that would provide the International Monetary Fund with $18 billion in exchange for new restrictions on its loans to foreign governments.
Congressional officials said that the deal, part of an overall budget agreement between the Administration and Capitol Hill expected to be announced this week, would require the monetary fund to stop making many of its loans at below-market interest rates and compel borrowers to repay the loans within two and a half years. 
 The fund currently makes most of its loans at below-market rates of about 4.5 percent a year, with pay-back periods of about 10 years.
Under the compromise, Congressional officials said, the fund would also be required to publish summaries of its board meetings, an end to years of secrecy over the fund's loan deliberations.
Before meeting today with Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, the House majority leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas said an agreement over I.M.F. financing was so close that "we're down to splitting infinitives." The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said that "we've certainly made significant progress" and that "we seem to have rounded the corner on the question of funding."
The new lending conditions had been demanded by House Republicans, who for months have blocked approval of the full $18 billion requested by the Clinton Administration to allow the fund to deal with the global financial crisis.
The Republicans have accused the fund of overly generous lending practices that encouraged some foreign governments, including those that requested bailouts over the last year, to adopt reckless economic policies.
Administration officials said that while some details of the agreement were still under negotiation, they believed the final plan would not put onerous restrictions on the fund as it attempts to avert an international financial meltdown.
The $18 billion would be used to replenish accounts that were depleted by the fund's efforts to bail out the economies of Russia and three Asia nations.
Administration officials had contacted other key donor nations to the fund, including Japan, Germany and Britain, to determine whether any would attempt to block the lending restrictions that would be demanded of the fund under the legislation.
While the United States is the largest and most influential donor to the fund, it cannot dictate policy to the 182-nation organization without the support of other large donor nations. "I don't think we have a problem with our allies on this," an Administration official who is involved in the negotiations with Congress said. "I think these reforms at the I.M.F. will have widespread support."
Under the agreement, Congressional officials said, the Treasury Department would be required to certify to Congress that the United States and other large donor nations are bringing pressure on the fund to limit its loans to nations that agree to open up their trade policies.
Republican leaders in Congress have asserted that bailout money from the fund has been used by some foreign governments to subsidize failing industries, creating unfair competition for struggling industries in the United States.
Representative Jim Saxton, a New Jersey Republican who is chairman of the House-Senate Joint Economic Committee and a leading critic of the fund, said that he was disappointed that the lending conditions being put on the fund were not tougher.
But he said he was pleased that the fund's activities were under such intense scrutiny on Capitol Hill. "We have begun a very serious discussion of this institution," he said, predicting that the next Congress would demand stricter reforms of the fund.

HEADLINE: BankAmerica Hedge Fund Loss Expected

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
The BankAmerica Corporation, the nation's fifth-largest bank, is expected to announce a big hedge fund loss today in the latest example of the dangers posed to financial companies from the risky, sometimes high-flying investment pools.
Some analysts estimate that the loss may be about $100 million, but others say that BankAmerica's overall exposure to the hedge fund, D. E. Shaw & Company, could be as large as $1 billion, taking the form of either loans or credit lines. It is not clear whether BankAmerica owned an interest in Shaw, and the legality of commercial banks holding such stakes is murky. 
 BankAmerica, which reports third-quarter earnings today, declined to comment on its hedge-fund exposure generally or its relationship with Shaw in particular. And a Shaw spokesman declined to comment on its relationship with BankAmerica.
Last month, BankAmerica, which recently disclosed large trading losses in Russia, said it had pretax trading losses around $330 million so far in the third quarter and that it expected its net-interest income in the quarter to be reduced by $65 million primarily because of "one borrower." Analysts and others close to BankAmerica widely believe that borrower to be Shaw.
Regulators, investors and members of Congress have become increasingly concerned about hedge fund losses -- and commercial and investment banks' involvement with the funds -- since the near-collapse of a giant fund, Long-Term Capital Management, a few weeks ago. Regulators contend that Long-Term Capital's brush with disaster threatened to undermine broader financial systems.
If more big banks are wounded by hedge funds and other lending losses, there is a strong possibility that commercial and investment banks will rein in lending and underwriting, thus slowing American economic growth.
"I think BankAmerica has a credit exposure to D. E. Shaw that could be substantial," said Judah Kraushaar, a banking analyst with Merrill Lynch & Company. "Ultimately, if you have a liquidity crunch, the Federal Reserve may have to take some dramatic action to make sure that capital markets can continue to function correctly."
Hedge funds are unregulated investment pools open only to wealthy individuals and big institutional investors. The funds' goal is to outperform market averages by trading stocks, bonds or other assets, and to weather market downturns better than other funds.
BankAmerica's hedge fund loss was first reported yesterday in The San Francisco Chronicle. In trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, BankAmerica's shares rose $1.125, to $53.9375, well below the 52-week high of $88.4375.
Shaw denies speculation that it is in serious financial trouble, and Shaw is not a big bond investor, as was Long-Term Capital. Also, analysts said Shaw was not carrying a huge amount of debt, as Long-Term Capital did.
"No Shaw entity has been, or is now, in any form of trouble financially," said Nick Gianakouros, the company's vice president. "Any reports that we are having financial problems are absolutely, unequivocally untrue."
Shaw, founded by David E. Shaw, manages about $1.7 billion in assets. It declined yesterday to answer questions about its performance; it has been reported that the fund has lost 12.6 percent so far this year.
BankAmerica's relationship with Shaw, a New York hedge fund that uses complex, technical mathematical formulas primarily for stock investments, was engineered in 1997 by David Coulter, BankAmerica's former chief executive. Mr. Coulter will be serving as president of the new BankAmerica, which was formed through its recent combination with the Nationsbank Corporation of Charlotte, N.C.
Analysts and others familiar with BankAmerica's operations said the bank lent about $1 billion to a proprietary investment portfolio managed by Shaw in exchange for 50 percent of the fund's profits or losses. One bank adviser said that BankAmerica's involvement with Shaw also included an equity stake. When Mr. Coulter received a bonus of $4.25 million last year on top of a salary of $987,500, BankAmerica cited the alliance with Shaw as one of the reasons for the bonus, and Shaw employees were trotted out at an analysts' conference that BankAmerica held last year.
Banks' interests in relationships with hedge funds go beyond the profits that can be gained from such investments. They also give banks insight into the types of trades made by hedge funds -- which until recently were considered among the savviest of investors -- in financial markets. This vantage allows banks a first look at where hedge funds are betting and enables them to use such information to make similar trades if they seem desirable.
But the relationships are risky, as BankAmerica has discovered.
"We backed off of BankAmerica a few weeks ago because of concern about the bank's hedge fund lending," said Michael Mayo, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. "It looks like the old BankAmerica is somewhat weaker than what was expected at the time of the merger. We wouldn't be surprised to see Nationsbank curtail some of the riskier activities of the old BankAmerica as it becomes part of the merged company."
Nationsbank officials declined to comment on the hedge fund losses or what impact they might have on Mr. Coulter's role in the combined bank. Mr. Coulter, who is a trained mathematician, has been designated as supervisor of risk management practices at the new bank.
"Shaw is a computer-model-technical-analysis-type approach to investing," said Charles Peabody of Mitchell Securities in New York. "If the loss got that big, it might be because human common sense said the loss could get bigger but the model said it was O.K."

HEADLINE: When Money Is Everything, Except Hers

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: DIXON, Ill.

 BODY:
Watching classmates strut past in designer clothes, Wendy Williams sat silently on the yellow school bus, wearing a cheap belt and rummage-sale slacks.
One boy stopped and yanked his thumb, demanding her seat. 
 "Move it, trailer girl," he sneered.
It has never been easy to live on the wrong side of the tracks. But in the economically robust 1990's, with sprawling new houses and three-car garages sprouting like cornstalks on the Midwestern prairie, the sting that comes with scarcity gets rubbed with an extra bit of salt.
Seen through the eyes of a 13-year-old girl growing up at Chateau Estates, a fancy name for a tin-plain trailer park, the rosy talk about the nation's prosperity carries a certain mocking echo.
The everyday discussion in the halls of Reagan Middle School in this city about 100 miles west of Chicago touches on computer toys that can cost $1,000, family vacations to Six Flags or Disney World and stylish clothes that bear a Nike emblem or Tommy Hilfiger's coveted label.
Unlike young people a generation ago, those today must typically pay fees to play for the school sports teams or band. It costs $45 to play in the youth summer soccer league. It takes money to go skating on weekends at the White Pines roller rink, to play laser tag or rock-climb at the Plum Hollow Recreation Center, to mount a steed at the Horseback Riding Club, to gaze at Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet at the Plaza Cinemas, to go shopping for clothes at Cherryvale Mall.
To be without money, in so many ways, is to be left out.
"I told this girl: 'That's a really awesome shirt. Where did you get it?' " said Wendy, explaining that she knew it was out of her price range, but that she wanted to join the small talk. "And she looked at me and laughed and said, 'Why would you want to know?' "
A lanky, soft-spoken girl with large brown eyes, Wendy pursed her lips to hide a slight overbite that got her the nickname Rabbit, a humiliation she once begged her mother and father to avoid by sending her to an orthodontist.
For struggling parents, keenly aware that adolescents agonize over the social pecking order, the styles of the moment and the face in the mirror, there is a no small sense of failure in telling a child that she cannot have what her classmates take for granted.
"Do you know what it's like?" asked Wendy's mother, Veronica Williams, "to have your daughter come home and say, 'Mom, the kids say my clothes are tacky,' and then walk off with her head hanging low."
This is not the desperate poverty of Chicago housing projects, where the plight of empty pockets is worsened by the threat of gangs and gunfire. Wendy lives in relative safety in a home with both parents. Her father, Wendell Provow, earns $9 an hour as a welder. Her mother works part-time as a cook for Head Start, the Federal education program.
Unlike students in some urban pockets, isolated from affluence, Wendy receives the same education as a girl from a $300,000 house in the Idle Oaks subdivision. The flip side of that coin is the public spectacle of economic struggle. This is a place small enough where people know the personal stories, or, at least, repeat them as if they did.
Even in this down-to-earth town, where a poor boy nicknamed Dutch grew up to become President, young people seem increasingly enchanted with buying, having, spending and status.
R. Woodrow (Woody) Wasson, the principal at Reagan Middle School, makes it a point to sit down with every child and ask them about their hopes and dreams.
"They want to be doctors, lawyers, veterinarians and, of course, professional athletes," said Mr. Wasson, whose family roots here go back to the 19th century. "I don't remember the last time I heard somebody say they wanted to be a police officer or a firefighter. They want to do something that will make a lot of money and have a lot of prestige."
He said a teacher in a nearby town has been trying to recruit high school students for vocational studies to become tool-and-die artisans, a trade that can pay $70,000 a year.
"The teacher can't fill the slots," Mr. Wasson said. "Nobody's interested in that kind of work."
It is not surprising that children grow up believing that money is so important, given the relentless way they are targeted by marketers.
"In the past, you just put an ad in the magazine," said Michael Wood, the director of research for Teen-Age Research Unlimited, a marketing consultant in suburban Chicago. "Now savvy marketers know you must hit them at all angles -- Web sites, cable TV shows, school functions, sporting events."
He noted the growth of cross-promotions, like the deal in which actors on the television show "Dawson's Creek," which is popular among adolescents, wear clothes by J. Crew and appear in its catalogue.
But young people get cues in their everyday lives. Some spending habits that would once have been seen as ostentatious -- extravagant parties for small children, new cars for teen-agers -- have become familiar trappings of middle-class comfort.
The stock market, although it is sputtering now, has made millionaires of many people in Main Street towns. Building developers here recently won approval to build a gated community, which will be called Timber Edge.
"Wendy goes to school around these rich kids," her mother said, "and wonders why she can't have things like they do."
A bright girl with a flair for art, writing and numbers, Wendy stays up late most nights, reading books. "The Miracle Worker" was a recent favorite.
But when a teacher asked her to join an elevated class for algebra, she politely declined. "I get picked on for my clothes and living in the trailer park," said Wendy, who never brings anyone home from school. "I don't want to get picked on for being a nerd, too."
Her mother, who watched three other daughters drop out of school and have babies as teen-agers, has told Wendy time and again: "Don't lose your self-esteem."
One time a boy at school was teasing Wendy about her clothes -- "They don't even match," he laughed -- and her humble house in the trailer park.
She listened for a while. He kept insulting her. So she lifted a leg -- clothed as it was in discount jeans from the Farm & Fleet store -- and kicked him in the shins.
He told the authorities. She got the detention.
It became clear to Wendy that the insults were not going to stop. It also became clear that shin-kicking, however deserved, was not going to be the solution.
She went to a guidance counselor, Cynthia Kowa Basler, a dynamic woman who keeps close tabs on the children, especially girls who fret about their weight and suddenly stop eating lunch.
"I am large," she tells the girls, "and I have self-esteem."
Wendy, who knew that Mrs. Basler held sessions with students to increase their self-confidence, went to the counselor. "I feel a little down," Wendy told her. The counselor gathered eight students, including other girls like Wendy, who felt embarrassed about their economic station.
In this school named for Ronald Reagan, the students were told to study the words of Eleanor Roosevelt.
One of her famous quotations was posted above the counselor's desk: "No one can make you feel inferior without your consent."
As a group, the students looked up the definition of inferior and consent.
And then they read the words out loud.
"Again," the counselor instructed.
"Louder," the counselor insisted.
Again and again, they read the inspirational words.
In role-playing exercises, the children practiced responses to taunts, which sometimes called for nothing more than a shrug.
"Mrs. Basler told us to live up to our goals -- show those kids," Wendy said. "She told us that things can be a lot different when you're grown up. Maybe things will be the other way around then."
Wendy smiled at the notion.
Life still has plenty of bumps. When Wendy gets off the school bus -- the trailer park is the first stop, so everyone can see where she lives -- she still looks at her shoes.
She still pulls her shirt out to hide a belt that does not quite make the grade. And she still purses her lips to hide an overbite. But her mother has noticed her smiling more these days. And Wendy has even said she might consider taking an advanced course in math, her favorite subject.
"I want to go to college," Wendy said the other day. "I want to become a teacher."
One recent day, she popped in to the counselor's office, just to say hello, then walked back down the halls, her arms folded around her schoolbooks.
Mrs. Basler stood at the doorway and watched her skip away, a student with so much promise, and so many obstacles.
For the girl from Chateau Estates, it is a long way from the seventh grade to college.
"She's going to make it," the counselor said, with a clenched fist and a voice full of hope.

HEADLINE: Merrill Lynch to Cut 3,400 Jobs In Big Setback for New York City

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
Merrill Lynch & Company, the nation's biggest brokerage firm, said yesterday that it would eliminate about 3,400 jobs, or just more than 5 percent of its work force, because of global economic turmoil.
The firm is the first big financial company to announce cutbacks linked primarily to the world's troubled markets. Other Wall Street firms, which along with Merrill Lynch had swelled their ranks on the fat profits of the rampant bull market, are expected to follow suit. Merrill Lynch said it expected "a much more challenging environment ahead" for financial companies. 
 The job cuts, which the firm said would save $500 million a year, are expected to fall heavily on New York City, where Merrill Lynch said it would dismiss up to 700 of its 10,500 employees. Altogether in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, the firm said it would lay off 1,100 employees and 500 full-time consultants and eliminate 400 more jobs through attrition. As many as 800 of the total cuts will be made through attrition.
But jobs will be lost across the company, Merrill Lynch executives said, with 2,000 coming in the United States and 1,400 coming overseas. In Europe, for example, the company plans to eliminate 400 jobs.
Merrill Lynch also said it would dismiss 900 full-time consultants, who are mostly involved in technology projects, although David H. Komansky, Merrill Lynch's chairman and chief executive, insisted in an interview yesterday that this would not hamper the company's ability to deal with either Europe's coming introduction of the euro or computer problems associated with the year 2000.
Merrill Lynch, like many financial firms, retains many full-time consultants, particularly for technology projects, who are not company employees.
Merrill also reported a loss of $164 million, or 49 cents a share, for the three months ended on Sept. 30 after taking a $430 million charge, or $288 million after taxes, to pay for the job cuts. Excluding that charge, Merrill Lynch showed a profit of $124 million for the quarter as earnings were squeezed by the slowdown in underwriting and securities trading and the fallout from worldwide economic turmoil. In the third quarter of 1997, Merrill Lynch earned $502 million. This year's third quarter represented its first quarterly loss since the fourth quarter of 1989, when the firm was in the midst of cutting the jobs of 9,000 people, or 18 percent of its work force, over roughly two years.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York expressed dismay in an interview yesterday about the layoffs at Merrill Lynch, which he said was the largest employer in the city. But he was sympathetic about the cutbacks, saying: "This is not something they're doing because they want to do it. This is something they're doing because they have problems on Wall Street right now." The city is better able to withstand a downturn on Wall Street than it was in the past, the Mayor said.
But the Mayor acknowledged that the layoffs were bad news for the city. "Wall Street also has a psychological impact on the City of New York because people who aren't directly affected by it make decisions about how much they're going to spend, when they're going to spend it, based on what's happening on Wall Street," he said.
Last year, Merrill Lynch received $28 million in tax incentives from New York City and New York State in return for agreeing to add 2,000 employees over 15 years to the 9,000 it had. Even after the current round of layoffs, Merrill Lynch will have 9,800 employees in the city, the company said in a statement, "and we are fully confident that our strategy for long-term growth in all of our businesses will enable us to meet our employment commitment."
Merrill Lynch's job cuts and its forecast of tougher times to come yesterday cast a shadow over Wall Street, which until July had enjoyed its most profitable years in living memory. "Those of us in the equity business say there but for the grace of God go we," said Sallie L. Krawcheck, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein & Company, the New York securities firm. But she added, "If Merrill is right, there will be more layoffs and more poor quarters for the industry," which is one of New York's biggest employers, and certainly its richest business.
The job cuts at Merrill Lynch, which are expected to fall heavily on bond specialists, were widely expected after Japan's economic problems deepened and Russia abrogated its debts in mid-August, casting a pall over the world's bond and credit markets. The company in recent weeks would say only that it was "reviewing the matter," but there had been news reports that the cutbacks would range from more than 1,000 to as many as 3,000 jobs.
Along with recently announced job cuts at the new Citigroup -- the combination of Travelers Group and Citicorp -- and others now being considered at several other financial companies, the cuts at Merrill Lynch are likely to affect the New York economy, particularly local consumer spending and the real estate market. The cuts at Citigroup, however, are in part related to the recent merger, although they also included a significant scaling back of the riskier bond businesses at Salomon Smith Barney, Citigroup's investment bank.
Merrill Lynch's financial results also seemed to disappoint analysts yesterday. "This is clearly not being viewed as a one-quarter problem," said Charles L. Hill, director of research at First Call, a research firm in Boston. "This came in way below expectations for the quarter, and analysts are cutting their estimates for the coming year."
Richard K. Strauss, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said, "We were all expecting the revenues to be weak, but the expenses were just very high across the board."
"This is partly the result of an aggressive expansion policy the year before the downturn in the securities markets," he added. Nevertheless, Merrill Lynch's stock price rose $1.0625 yesterday, to $44.9375, but is still well below its high of nearly $110 in July.
Mr. Komansky defended Merrill Lynch's rapid expansion of recent years, and particularly its adventurous acquisitions here and abroad. "Many of them were transforming the nature of this firm," he said, and "fit in with our global strategy."
Two other big brokerage firms -- Paine Webber Group and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. -- also reported lower earnings yesterday as they, too, suffered from the slower securities markets. At Paine Webber, which has a large nationwide brokerage business, earnings fell to $82.9 million, or 51 cents a share, from $112.8 million in the comparable quarter a year earlier, just beating a consensus of analysts' estimates. Donaldson, Lufkin reported earnings of $25.7 million, or 15 cents a share, for the quarter, down almost 80 percent from a year earlier.
"It's a bond market, credit crash round the world," said Donald B. Marron, the chairman and chief executive of Paine Webber. His firm, which has much smaller international and capital markets businesses than Merrill Lynch, is not scaling back, he said, but he expressed concern that the international economy might adversely affect the United States economy.
The Merrill Lynch cuts are likely to be followed by other firms in the coming weeks. "Notifications started going out today," Jonathan Humphreys, a Merrill Lynch spokesman, said yesterday. Mr. Komansky said he hoped that there would not be further job cuts down the road.
Some Merrill Lynch employees are angry that the firm is making deep job cuts so soon after it put up $300 million to help rescue Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund. A deferred compensation plan for Merrill Lynch's top executives, including Mr. Komansky, has money invested in the fund. "I can understand people who are being downsized and laid off feeling that kind of thing," Mr. Komansky said. "It's something I feel terrible about. It's not something that's easy, but it's about managing your cost base to maintain profitability."
At the World Financial Center in Manhattan, where Merrill has its headquarters, employees seemed glum but resigned to the cuts. "It's just the normal ups and downs of the market," said a worker who would not give his name. "Sometimes these things happen, you know?"

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Japan's Lower House Clears $508 Billion Bank Rescue

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 13

 BODY:
The lower house of the Japanese Parliament passed a bill today that would allow the Government to inject huge amounts of money into the nation's weakened banks, moving Japan closer to the start of repairs on its banking system after months of political wrangling.
The upper house is expected to approve the legislation on Friday, the last day of the current session of Parliament. It would provide a total of 60 trillion yen, or $508 billion, including $144 billion that had already been made available, to rescue banks and induce them to increase lending and stimulate the economy. 
 The Clinton Administration and leaders of other countries have called for strong action to bolster Japanese banks and to restore growth in the economy here, the world's second largest. Japan's problems have aggravated financial crises elsewhere in Asia, which have spread throughout much of the developing world. While officials in Washington are encouraged by the new legislation, they say it is urgent that Japan follow through and in fact carry out the program.
One of the biggest questions is whether the banks will apply for public funds, even though they need them. Banks appear reluctant to accept taxpayers' money, particularly if it means they will be punished for past mistakes or subject to harsh conditions, including disclosure of financial information they regard as sensitive. "The larger issue is whether or not the banks will actually go along with the deal," said James P. Fiorillo, banking analyst with ING Baring Securities here. If they do not, he said: "It could derail the whole package. It could derail the whole process of saving the system."
Indeed, the stock market slid here today, partly in response to remarks by Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa that he was not certain whether weak banks could be forced to accept public money. The Chief Cabinet Secretary, Hiromu Nonaka, suggested this morning that Parliament early next year could consider a proposal to force troubled banks to accept such funds, and the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues slid 2.3 percent, or 312.33 points, to end trading at 13,242.79. In trading Wednesday morning, the Nikkei index fell a further 114.06 points, or nearly 1 percent, to 13,128.73.
Japan's banks are precariously capitalized, and to strengthen their capital bases they have reduced their loans to corporations. Even though interest rates are the lowest in the world, the reluctance of banks to lend has created a credit squeeze, and bankruptcies are soaring.
By increasing banks' capital, the Government hopes to promote lending and stimulate the economy, which is in the worst recession since the end of World War II.
Today's vote came a day after Parliament enacted a law to nationalize failing banks. The bill passed in the lower house today was knitted together on Monday through intense negotiations with a fragile coalition of parties in Parliament.
The plan calls for the Government to buy common or preferred stock in banks to bring their capital base up to the 8 percent level, the international standard, or to a lower, Government standard in the case of banks that do business only at home. As a condition of receiving public funds, which could then be lent to credit-starved businesses, banks would have to disclose the amount of stock they hold in their portfolios, as well as to make progress reports on their plans for financial restructuring.
Even the stronger banks, which say they easily meet the capital standards of the Bank for International Settlements, can receive public money if they agree to acquire a failing bank or if there is a sharp credit contraction. Banks with insufficient capital will be forced to scale down their businesses, be shut down, or acquired.
The new legislation would replace a program enacted in February. That plan provides $254 billion in public funds with few conditions; it was scrapped because of protests by the Democratic Party, the main opposition group.
One reason for doubt about whether banks will want to take part in the latest plan is that few made use of money available under the previous one. In March, the top 19 banks drew a total of 1.8 trillion yen, or $15 billion, in public funds to increase their capital, a relatively modest amount, and no other banks have applied for tax money since then.
Their objection was the same as they are expected to have now: that the conditions are too stringent. Privately, they also concede it is highly embarrassing to accept tax money.
Under the new plan, the banks would be required to apply to a newly created independent panel, which would impose stiff requirements, and could require banks that use public money to set aside part of their profit to absorb losses from loans that become unrecoverable.
It is also possible that the panel may require bank officers to take responsibility for mismanagement, though it is not clear exactly what this might entail.
Of the 60 trillion yen, 25 trillion, or nearly $220 billion, will be used specifically for increasing the capital of the banking system. Seventeen trillion yen, or $144 billion, already available under the current arrangement, will continue to be used to guarantee depositors' accounts, and the rest would go to the nationalizing of failing banks.
As part of Monday's passage of the nationalization law, a new ministerial committee will manage failing banks and help draft plans to deal with financial turmoil. The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, one of the largest and weakest institutions, is expected to be temporarily nationalized under this plan. The bank could apply to be put under state control as early as next week.
The bank had originally announced plans to merge with the Sumitomo Trust and Banking Corporation, but that has fallen through, and it is not clear whether Long-Term Credit will survive the process of nationalization and be sold to another institution, or simply be put out of business.
