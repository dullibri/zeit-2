HEADLINE: President Of Albania Is Rebuffed On Charter

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TIRANA, Albania

 BODY:
The voters in what was once the most rigidly Communist country of Europe have dealt a sharp rebuff to their President, to whom they handed a landslide victory in their first democratic elections in 1992.
As a result, Albanians and diplomats fear that the infant democracy has lapsed into a deadlock that puts at risk the political and economic gains achieved since Communism began to crumble in 1991 in Europe's poorest country. 
 Early in November, Albania's voters rejected by 54 percent to 42 percent a draft constitution that President Sali Berisha had placed before the electorate. Dr. Berisha circumvented the Parliament, where approval by two-thirds would have been required, and chose a referendum in the belief that he was sure to win a majority.
The defeat is seen here as the low point in a steady decline in affection for the once hugely popular leader of the Democratic Party, not for what he has done but for how he does it.
Albania was repressively ruled by Enver Hoxha and his chosen successor, Ramiz Alia, from 1944 until the 1992 landslide by the party of Dr. Berisha, a cardiologist of boundless energy and impatience. For too many Albanians, Dr. Berisha resembles his dictatorial predecessors in style, although not in content.
Even leaders of the largest opposition party, the Socialist successors to the Communists, grant that the President has effectively led the transition toward democracy and a market economy. "The Democratic Party and Berisha have played a positive role," said Luan Hajdaraga, a vice president of the Socialists.
Mr. Hajdaraga and Arta Dabulla, a member of the party presidency, said the referendum showed that early Parliamentary elections were called for to reflect the present mood of the country. Parliament elects the President.
Dr. Berisha's disregard for Parliament, where defections from his own party have deprived him of the two-thirds majority he had obtained in the elections, and the one-man character of his referendum campaign proved counterproductive.
"Albanians were not against the constitution but against the style of the propaganda," said Ismail Kadare, a writer. "The television propaganda was frenetic. It recalled the days of Communism."
By all accounts, the President totally identified himself with the constitution, although it was drafted by a parliamentary committee with advice from Western experts. He campaigned for it with the same vigor and disdain for opponents that characterized his presidential race.
"He signed autographs on the constitution, as though it was his personal property," said Agim Isaku, director of the Open Society Foundation, which is financed by George Soros, the American financier.
Opposition politicians criticized the draft as giving too many powers to the President, but even they said the voters rejected the President's style rather than the charter.
In an interview, Dr. Berisha vigorously rejected all criticism, while still reflecting his personal identification with the charter, which he referred to as "my constitution."
He said there was no question of calling early elections or submitting a new draft to Parliament. In a round table with party leaders, he proposed that Parliament should name a new drafting committee. As alternatives, he suggested a non-Parliamentary group of experts or the adoption of a constitution modeled on that of one of the countries of the European Union. He excluded the French Constitution, which provides for a strong President.
"Berisha has a clear desire for a democratic society and a market economy," one ambassador said. "But does he know what these things mean?" He answered his question by recalling that like all Albanians, the President is a product of a system that denied its people any knowledge of open societies.
Mr. Kadare, the writer, said he saw a silver lining in the referendum: "It showed the people have truly progressed. Despite the frenetic television propaganda, the people calmly said no."

Ex-Leader's Sentence Reduced
 TIRANA, Albania, Nov. 30 (AP) -- The Supreme Court today reduced the nine-year prison term of the former President, Ramiz Alia, by three years, but gave no reason.
Mr. Alia is to be released in September, taking into account two years he spent under house arrest, reductions of his sentence by an appeals court and an amnesty announced on Sunday, court officials said. The Supreme Court also substantially reduced the sentences of other former top officials.
Mr. Alia was convicted of abuse of power in 1992 along with nine other members of the Politburo.

HEADLINE: Trade Talks In Miami: Momentum Isn't There

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30

 BODY:
The Administration raised the prospect of big things when it announced a summit meeting of the hemisphere's leaders last year, including a possible agreement on a trade zone embracing North and South America within 10 to 20 years.
But when leaders from 34 nations meet next week in Miami, the results will be far from bold: the leaders are not expected to agree on a firm plan or date for a trade area. 
 In a briefing today, Administration officials sought to put the best face on the talks, saying the leaders, from every nation in the hemisphere except Cuba, for the first time will call for setting up a trade zone from Alaska to Argentina.
Some Latin American and Caribbean officials are disappointed that the meeting will not accomplish more; but, showing how much expectations have dropped, many leaders say the most important thing is that the meeting will improve United States ties with Latin America, which has felt neglected by President Clinton, partly because he has not visited it as President.
"It's important for upgrading the political linkages between two areas that are so important to each other," said the Brazilian Ambassador to the United States, Paulo-Tarso Flecha de Lima.
Administration officials insist that the summit meeting, the first since 1967, will not yield just photo opportunities and hollow oratory. They say the leaders will plan high-level meetings over the next 15 months to explore how to remove trade barriers and how to harmonize rules in areas like foreign investment and telecommunications.
"This is not a trade summit," Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the senior White House counselor, said at a briefing. "It is an overall summit. It will focus on economic integration and convergence."
Peter Hakim, president of Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington research center, said: "As it stands now, the agreements that they're going to reach just aren't very inspiring. Nonetheless there's no sense that the summit will fail, because expectations have been falling."
For the Administration the summit talks, Dec. 9 through 11, have proved to be a headache. Brazil and Mexico have complained about the date because both countries have recently elected new Presidents.
Many countries have grumbled that having the meeting in Miami will force Cuba onto the agenda. Cuban-American groups are threatening protest marches to press for a condemnation of Fidel Castro and to urge President Clinton to admit 23,000 Cubans being held at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station.
The summit meeting has crystallized another set of tensions for President Clinton. Latin American nations want to use the talks to push for increased access to the huge United States market just when President Clinton is under fire on several fronts for opening the door too wide to low-priced imports.
Some Latin leaders are upset that the meeting is not expected to set a date for a trade pact even though the United States and 17 other nations in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum have set 2020 as the goal for their pact.
But United States officials played down the lack of a date. "The question of date is rather a subsidiary issue," said the deputy United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky. "It's the view of many countries that a date becomes rather superfluous" because "there is so much substance and direction with respect to both the vision and the manner" of moving to a trade zone.
Argentina wanted the leaders to agree to sign an accord by 2000 that would set up a trade zone by 2015. But that move was opposed by Brazil and several other nations, which fear that moving toward a hemisphere-wide trade zone would distract them from developing smaller trade areas like Mercosur, which includes Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.
"Some countries think that if you set a date that's just a short time away, it's unrealistic, and some think that if you set a date far away, it's too diffuse," said the Argentine Ambassador to the United States, Raul Enrique Granillo Ocampo. "We have decided on an agenda of concrete steps to move in that direction."

HEADLINE: Senate Seems Set to Approve Trade Accord

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration today received commitments from several key Senators to support the overhaul of a 124-nation free trade pact, and both Democratic and Republican leaders said they were now certain the Senate would pass the accord in a vote scheduled for Thursday night.
Working to build on their victory on Tuesday in the House of Representatives, President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and several members of the Administration spent all day cajoling the dozen or so senators still undecided. 
 By the end of the day their initial fear of falling just short of the needed votes had melted away. A simple majority of 51 is sufficient to pass the legislation to implement the agreement, but first proponents must get 60 votes to waive the budget rules that apply to any action that would increase the Federal deficit.
"We're in the mid-60's now, I think," said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is the floor manager of the bill. "I'm beginning to feel more comfortable."
Tonight, White House officials were feeling confident enough to tell some senators that as long as they voted in favor of waiving the budget rules -- a separate issue that will come to the floor before the actual General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- they were free to vote against the accord itself if they needed political cover in their constituencies.
In London, Senator Bob Dole, the future majority leader, who endorsed the accord last week after reaching a compromise with the White House, said, "I feel confident we have the votes."
The White House press secretary, Dee Dee Myers, predicted that "by the time the vote is cast tomorrow, we will have the votes."
Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, decided tonight to vote for the pact after long talks with Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative. "I don't want to see a single job lost in this country, especially to nations with low-wage workers," he said. "But with or without GATT, we face that reality."
Senator Lautenberg said the Treasury Department had told him that the agreement would create 18,000 jobs in New Jersey, though outside experts said they were mystified about how the Administration was making such calculations.
GATT, the most radical change in trade policy in 40 years, would lower American tariffs by about a third and submit American laws to review by a new trade-policing body, the World Trade Organization.
In several hours of debate today, senators described two very different visions of the nation's economic future. Proponents painted a future in which expanded free trade bolsters American exports around the world. Opponents predicted that cheap imports would drive more American blue-collar workers out of their factories, and that the World Trade Organization would become a huge, all-powerful bureaucracy, dictating changes in American worker safety and in environmental laws.
Mr. Moynihan mocked those who contend that the World Trade Organization will become "some kind of world government."
"To those who think it is a behemoth, consider this," Mr. Moynihan said. "The GATT," which is an organization as well as an agreement, "has 450 employees. The World Trade Organization is scheduled to increase that number by 15. That will bring it to roughly one-third the size of the Capitol police force."
As the Senate vote has neared, major American business groups have been lobbying heavily to win approval of the pact, arguing that a vote against GATT is a vote for isolationism. They have sponsored a series of advertisements carrying pictures of Senator Reed Smoot and Representative Willis Chatman Hawley, the authors of the Tariff Act of 1930, a law that many historians said contributed to World War II.
Ernest F. Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat who is the Senate's most vocal opponent of the pact, said: "That's a bum rap! Don't give me that war argument and Smoot and Hawley."
Mr. Hollings is from a textile manufacturing state, which will be hard hit by the pact's reduction in tariffs. But over the past few days he has been outnumbered by senators who have concluded that their states will gain more by exporting wheat, airplane parts or software than they will lose as aging industries fall by the wayside.
Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington, the home state of the Boeing Corporation, said, "My friends and family understand that international commerce is the lifeblood of our economy."

HEADLINE: Salinas Sunset: Triumphs, Setbacks

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 30

 BODY:
Barely a day before he is to resign his presidency, Carlos Salinas de Gortari was striking his usual poses on the television news: In one state, he was cutting ribbon on a new bridge; in another, a new hospital; in a third, a new subway line.
"He is working as though it were his first day!" the pro-Government anchor marveled for anyone who might have missed the message. 
 What could be said as easily, however, is that after six busy years in an office to which Mexico allows no re-election, there is still no end to the campaign for political legitimacy that followed a vote that many Mexicans thought Mr. Salinas won by fraud. The fact that he may stand as the man who most changed this country in the second half of the century has somehow seemed to get lost on the 46-year-old leader's way to his last inauguration.
With the striped sash he will hand over on Thursday to his chosen successor, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, 42, Mr. Salinas will deliver a restructured and strengthened economy, a political system in the throes of democratization, a society that overcame two centuries of nationalistic mistrust to join the United States and Canada in the North American Free Trade Agreement.
But as Mr. Salinas has prepared to leave office, he has been haunted by reminders of the challenges he sought to avoid.
While he has hurried around the provinces, the central square of the capital has filled with angry leftists camped out in protest against what they contend have been fraudulent state elections. Members of the federal elections board have joined the opposition in complaining that the last-minute reforms by the Government to the political system that its party has dominated for six decades were too little and too late.
In one Mexico City suburb, the young lawyer who quit last week as Deputy Attorney General was still railing today that corrupt old-guard leaders of Mr. Salinas's Institutional Revolutionary Party had blocked his investigation into the murder of his brother, the party's reform-minded secretary general. (The main target of his accusations, Ignacio Pichardo, the party president, was named today as Energy Secretary in Mr. Zedillo's new Cabinet.)
Brokers in the gleaming downtown stock exchange worried about a possible devaluation of the peso, which has come under renewed pressure as political uncertainty and a sluggish economy have slowed the flow of foreign capital needed to cover the huge deficit in Mexico's current account.
And across the city, politicians worried about Chiapas, the southern state where rebels claiming fraud in local elections there are threatening turmoil if the Governor-elect tries to take office as scheduled, seven days after Mr. Zedillo.
In Tabasco, another southern state, earlier this month, a thoughtful laid-off oil worker named Alejandro Padron summed up the Salinas administration's contradictions.
Wearing the black boots he worked in until his 11-year job became one of 100,000 sacrificed to modernize the inefficient state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos, Mr. Padron, 30, said he understood the need for the economic overhaul and could imagine other bright futures for himself and his family. In a year of searching, however, he had been able to find none in Tabasco.
"It has not been the success they say on television," he said of the upbeat advertisements that the administration often used to extol its triumphs. "He is leaving, but we remain. The problems remain."
Against what sometimes seemed this year like great odds, Mr. Salinas succeeded in consolidating the power of a new political generation.
The Cabinet that Mr. Zedillo unveiled today was filled with faces from the United States-trained ranks of the Salinistas. Jaime Serra Puche, 43, the Trade Minister who led the campaign for Nafta, won the post of Finance Secretary. The President's chief of staff will be a 36-year-old economist trained at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Throughout what has become a bitter political battle over Mr. Salinas's legacy, there has been little challenge to the notion that the new team will receive a far healthier economy than its predecessors did.
More than 1,000 state companies have been sold off or closed. Enterprises ranging from bus transportation to road construction have been deregulated. Debt payments have been slashed, the budget has run a surplus for the first time in memory, and inflation has plunged.
With Nafta as a glimmering lure, foreign investors have poured in $50 billion in six years. Each year, lists of the world's billionaires show more Mexicans.
But the latter fact has come increasingly to symbolize something gone badly wrong. While the richest fifth of the population has grown richer, getting more than 54 percent of the nation's income by 1992, the poorer half drew only 18 percent.
Mr. Salinas sought to ease the social and political impact of his austerity with a $4 billion-a-year antipoverty effort, the National Solidarity Program. But as late as the end of 1993, he did not plan significant political changes to meet swelling demands for greater democracy.
Even his sharpest critics, however, did not imagine the hundreds of peasants who marched into four provincial towns in Chiapas just as Nafta was taking effect with the New Year. Nor were they less than shocked by the still-mysterious assassination of the governing party's first presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, on March 21, or the slaying in downtown Mexico City of another prominent reformer, Jose Francisco Ruiz Masseiu, the party's secretary general, six months later.
In an interview this month, Mr. Salinas disputed the idea that the two assassinations suggested a failure to adequately confront corruption and drug trafficking within the ruling party. "Every time we had information and evidence, we acted," he said.
As for Chiapas, he argued that the proof of change in Mexico was in its ability to withstand the shock.
"If during five years we had not carried out social and economic reforms and made progress on the political side, an event like Chiapas would have become a source of general instability in the country," he said. "We had the means and the space to build a negotiated solution, when in the past the means had always been extermination."

HEADLINE: More Men in Prime of Life Spend Less Time Working

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
By all accounts, Americans are more overworked than ever. Unemployment has dipped to less than 6 percent, overtime is at a record high and many workers are holding down more than one job. So why are so many men -- healthy men in the prime of life -- working less than ever before?
Even as the powerful American job machine has churned out tens of millions of new jobs in the last two decades, a raft of recent studies disclose that men past college age and well before the usual retirement age of the early to mid-60's are working much less than men did 10 or 20 years ago. A rising proportion are neither working nor looking for work. 
 The most stunning change is the shrinking share of men who serve as traditional breadwinners -- the male who works full time, year-round, year in and year out. Among young and middle-aged men, the share performing that basic family role has dropped sharply.
In the decade of the 1970's almost 80 percent of men from 22 to 58 worked full time, year round in at least 8 of 10 years. During the 1980's, however, among that same age group, the fraction working under the same conditions -- call them the hard-core employed -- dropped by nine percentage points, to 70 percent.
Men's experience stands in sharp contrast to that of women, who are working more and for higher pay.
As America's economy increasingly focuses on advanced services and high technology, the growth in jobs that blue-collar men traditionally favored in factories, construction and transportation services has not kept up with the growth in the working-age population. Adjusted for inflation, the wages and benefits such men can command have plunged by as much as one-fifth since the late 1970's.
The result? Those men are not, as popular wisdom would have it, mostly working more to make up the lost pay. Instead, as the rewards of working have shrunk, they are mostly working less.
"It's the Achilles' heel in the American job success story," said Richard B. Freeman, a labor economist at Harvard University and editor of a book of articles, "Working Under Different Rules." "This is one of those long-term big shocks to the whole society."
The decline in work among men has worrisome implications, both liberal and conservative economists agree. All too often, the only available alternatives to steady, full-time work are off-the-books employment or even crime. The young, the poorly educated, school dropouts -- the same demographic group that is working less and whose opportunities and pay have contracted -- is the group most likely to get into serious trouble.
Indeed, the number of men in prison, on parole or probation now exceeds the number counted as unemployed. In 1993, according to Government data, there were 4.6 million adult men under such state supervision compared with the 4.2 million who were out of work.
"The equivalent of the long-term European unemployed who are on the dole is the U.S. prison population," Professor Freeman said. "They give them welfare and we put them in prison with free housing, food and TV. We haven't escaped the problem."
Indeed, the decline of work among men is not limited to the United States. European men are working less, too.
In contrast to the European situation, however, the American decline in men at work does not appear to have been caused by welfare payments, unemployment checks or disability payments that are so generous they tend to discourage employment, researchers say. Such alternatives to a paycheck have, if anything, become leaner and harder to get in the United States since the early 1970's. Instead, the drop is a result of lower pay and fewer opportunities for the kinds of jobs less-educated men have long filled.
By and large, the rise of a sizable nonworking class -- along with an even larger group of prime-age men who are frequently unemployed, work part time or do temporary work -- is concentrated among academic underachievers. Men with high school degrees or dropouts are being pushed out or are opting out of steady full-time work.
"There's been a huge decline in work for prime-age men," said Lawrence F. Katz, a labor economist at Harvard and the former chief economist of the Labor Department, "and it's concentrated among the nonwhite, less-educated and men whose pay is below the average."
So what is going on? Think of these men as the counterparts of the farmers who left the country for the big cities, starting at the turn of the century and stretching well into the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's. What makes this transition so much more traumatic is that factories and services no longer provide plenty of jobs for blue-collar men.
Today, most of the new jobs for people with less education and experience are considered "women's work:" clerical, sales, personal service. A new jobs study by McKinsey & Company, the management consulting firm, found that in the 1980's the United States created 27 clerical, sales and service jobs per thousand working-age Americans. At the same time, 16 production, transportation and laborer jobs per thousand working-age Americans disappeared.
Women with relatively little education and low pay have not experienced the same sharp pay declines that men have faced. And they are actually working more, not less.
But men, with rare exceptions, have not joined women in these growth sectors. The fraction of men who have moved into so-called pink-collar jobs like practical nursing or clerical work remains negligible. It is not just that women's work generally pays less or that it may require greater skill with numbers and words, men are often loath to take pink-collar jobs, regardless of the appeal, and employers are equally unwilling to hire them.
"For men, whether black, Latino or white, there are strong cultural and social norms about what is appropriate work," said Rhonda M. Williams, an economist at the University of Maryland. "Given the changes in the occupational and industrial distribution, there are clearly groups of men who are going to suffer more from adhering to those norms."
The decline in men's work requiring more brawn than brains is quite drastic. A recent study by Stephen J. Rose at the National Commission for Employment Policy, a Government study group in Washington, tracked the careers of a large number of prime-age men through the 1970's and 1980's. In the 1970's, 68 percent of men with less than a high school education, who make up 15 percent of the male work force, worked full time, year round in 8 of 10 years. By the 1980's, that fraction dropped to barely half the group, 51 percent.
The deterioration for black men was similarly startling. For that group, the proportion of "hard-core employed" dropped from 73 percent in the 1970's to 51 percent in the 1980's.
Other measures tell a similar story.
Since the end of the 1960's, the share of prime-age men who are not in school, on the job or looking for work has tripled, from 3 percent to 9 percent, according to Robert H. Haveman, an economist at the University of Wisconsin. He also found that in 1992 one-quarter of high school dropouts had no official job at all, not even for a single week.
For those with high school degrees, one of 10 white men did not hold a job last year, compared with only one of 50 at the end of the 1960's. Among nonwhites, 17 percent reported they had no job, compared with 3 percent 25 years ago.
In the meantime, the stereotypical overworked middle-class white-collar male, particularly the man who commands a sizable paycheck, is coming home late for dinner just as often as he ever did. Men with college degrees and those with more advanced education worked longer hours in the 1980's than in the 1970's. A solid 79 percent worked full time, year-round during most of the decade versus 77 percent in the 1970's. Men in the top 40 percent of wage earners -- those paid an average of $19 an hour or more -- also worked more.
Nor are women and minorities, the beneficiaries of more than a decade of affirmative action in the workplace, crowding this kind of male worker out of good jobs. That is true even though it is this relatively affluent male, not his blue-collar counterpart, who is far more likely to have a substantial cushion of savings to support early retirement if he wants. And many such men are married to professional women, whose commitment to working has grown the most and whose salaries might be thought to allow such men to take it a little easier.
There are some signs that younger men are responding to the travails of their fathers and older brothers. High school graduation rates for young black men are up. And college enrollment rates for males are at a record high.
But few economists are sanguine that the decline in wages at the bottom of the pay scale is over or that men will not continue to respond by working less.
"I don't see much," said Chinhua Juhn, an economist at the University of Houston and the author of two influential studies on the topic, "that indicates that technology is going to shift back in favor of less-skilled people."

HEADLINE: 3,000 Nurses Are Expected To Lose Hospital Jobs by '97

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
A new study of health-worker employment forecasts an accelerating decline in jobs in the next three years in New York City, even as the health-care system grows.
The study, prepared for the Bureau of Health Resources Development of the State Department of Health, predicted that about 3,000 registered nurses would lose hospital jobs between 1995 and 1997. Of these, the report said, 2,000 are likely to find work in nursing homes or in home care. But new nurses, arriving in the work force through graduation, would increase the surplus of registered nurses to 1,800. 
 "Our general conclusions are that hospital-based employment in New York City over the next three years will decrease substantially, with most of the decrease coming from registered nurses, laboratory technicians and food-service workers," the report said. "We cannot make predictions for overall hospital employment since we have not studied all hospital-based occupations, but we anticipate a decline in the demand for hospital workers roughly 10 to 15 percent over the three years."
The report said that as of November 1993, there were 291,800 private-sector health jobs in New York City, with 157,200, or 53.8 percent of them, in hospitals. Other jobs in nursing homes, doctors' offices and home health care, as well as 60,000 jobs in government agencies, brought the total to 350,000, or 12 percent of the 2.9 million jobs in the city.
The study was conducted under the supervision of Prof. Howard S. Berliner, the chairman of the department of Health Services Management and Policy of the New School for Social Research and Christine T. Kovner, a professor in the Division of Nursing at New York University.
The report also predicted that there would be an increased demand for nurse's aides, physical therapists and physician assistants; weak growth in demand for licensed practical nurses, and a decline of perhaps as many as 2,000 jobs for food-service workers.
"The major factor that will affect the health-care system in New York City is the downsizing of its acute-care hospital capacity, which will directly lead to a reduction in the number of people working in hospitals," the report said. "The reasons for the downsizing of hospitals include the growth of managed care, attempts by insurance companies to reduce expensive hospital use and changes in technology that allow more medical procedures to be done in office and clinic-based settings."
The report said, "Although the number and size of hospitals in New York City have been declining over the past decade, we expect this process to accelerate markedly over the next few years."
The study forecast that 2,000 to 4,500 acute-care hospital beds, or 7 to 15 percent of total capacity, could close in the city by the year 2000. "This decline in acute-care capacity will be accompanied by a reduction in the hospital work force," it said.
But, it continued, the health-care system in the city will be growing and providing new jobs. The report forecast growth in office jobs, in ambulatory and primary-care clinics and in the home health-care industry.

HEADLINE: Stocks Flat Despite Data On Economy

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
For once, good news on Main Street did not automatically lead to bad news on Wall Street. But yesterday's relative tranquillity, which may have been attributable to technical factors rather than real market sentiment, could give way to a more pronounced selloff of stocks by tomorrow, when job-growth figures are released.
The stock market closed mixed yesterday, despite evidence of an unexpectedly strong economy, slowed only slightly by the Federal Reserve's tightening of interest rates this year. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.68 point, to 3,739.23, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 1.48 points, to 453.69. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index fell 1.16 points, to 750.32.
The Commerce Department's second of three estimates for third-quarter gross domestic product, released yesterday, showed the economy growing at a robust annual rate of 3.9 percent. Private economists had expected only a slight increase, to 3.5 percent, from the initial estimate of 3.4 percent. That compares with 4.1 percent in the second quarter.
Business inventories were also revised down, probably signaling robust consumer demand and indicating further potential for inflation.
The renewed fears of higher inflation and the resulting plunge in stock and bond prices that typically follow such news of robust economic growth did not materialize. Even the dollar, which typically would have fallen, was relatively steady.
"What stocks benefited from is that bonds rallied despite the strong figures for the economy," said Gregory A. Nie, senior vice president, technical analysis, at Kemper Securities.
Bond traders seemed to be unconcerned about the strong economy. Bond prices rose slightly. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 8 percent, from 8.03 percent.
Tomorrow the Labor Department is scheduled to report November unemployment as well as changes in nonfarm payroll jobs. Some analysts say that if unemployment is low and job creation sufficiently high, those numbers may prompt a selloff in stocks.
Six stocks advanced for every five that fell on the New York Stock Exchange, with rising stocks outnumbering falling stocks by 1,263 to 1,011 Eighty-eight stocks established new lows, and 22 established new highs.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.49 point, to 248.41, and the American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.77 point, to 433.86.
Some stocks rose. The Apache Corporation, an oil and natural gas developer, bought some Texaco oilfields for $600 million. Apache rose 2 7/8, to 28.
Others stocks fell. Applied Materials, a developer of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, dropped 4 5/8, to 47 7/8, after the company said that production bottlenecks might hurt profits.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Deal Is Set On American Brands Unit

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Nov. 30

 BODY:
American Brands Inc. will sell its insurance unit to the American General Corporation for $1.17 billion, the companies announced today. They disclosed earlier in the week that they were negotiating a sale.
American General will buy the Franklin Life Insurance Company of Springfield, Ill., from American Brands. Analysts said American Brands, with assets of $45 billion, could afford both Franklin and Unitrin, a Chicago-based insurance company that is another planned acquisition, as long as the company did not take on too much debt. Unitrin's board has rejected American General's $2.6 billion offer as too low. 
 The A. M. Best Company and the Standard & Poor's Corporation, which rate insurers on their claims-paying ability, placed their top-notch ratings for Franklin under review today for possible downgrading.
The Franklin acquisition would mark further concentration by American Brands, based in Old Greenwich, Conn., on name-brand consumer products like Jim Beam and Old Grand-Dad bourbon.
The company also plans to sell its United States tobacco business. But its plans met a setback in Washington today when the Federal Trade Commission followed through on its promise to challenge the proposed $1 billion purchase of the American Tobacco Company by B.A.T Industries P.L.C. of London.
The commission voted 3 to 0 to file an administrative complaint that contends that the buyout would reduce competition in the cigarette industry in violation of antitrust laws. A hearing must now be held before an administrative law judge.
The planned sale of Franklin Life is the second time this month that a nonfinancial services company has said it is getting out of the insurance business, where values have been battered by rising interest rates.
"It takes a different set of skills for a nonfinancial services company to run an insurer that has to compete against banks, mutual funds and other insurance companies," said Michael Albanese, vice president at A.M. Best in Oldwick, N.J.
If the deal is completed, American General, based in Houston, will get a solid insurance company and become one of 10 biggest publicly held life insurers in the country.
The companies said they expected to complete the Franklin transaction in the first quarter of 1995.
"Franklin is an outstanding company, but it doesn't fit in with our products," an American Brands spokesman, Roger W. Baker, said, adding that American Brands might use cash from the sale to buy other consumer-products makers.
American General stock rose 25 cents, to $26.25, while shares of American Brands rose 87.5 cents, to $35.25, on the Big Board.

HEADLINE: Yearning for Yemen, Dying in Brooklyn;
Stray Bullet Breaks a Cycle of Work, Saving and Trips Home

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
He kept to a dichotomous, back-and-forth regimen, and it was the same way with his Arab friends. He would work behind the counter in one of the storefront Brooklyn delis, squirreling away money that he would mail to his expanding family in Yemen. When the separation would nag at him, he would return home for a few months. Then he would start the cycle all over again.
Some of his friends could endure years between visits with their families, but Nagi Al Qotaini would brood and could not go that long. Sometimes, he would last only four or five months. He had been doing this for nearly 12 years, since he was 18, but it never got any easier. 
 In the last go around, he arrived in Brooklyn in the middle of July and might have been ready to visit Yemen in a few months. As it turned out, he made his final trip home on Tuesday night in a casket. Today, he is being buried.
He was earnest and was hoping very much to make more of himself in the United States, but he ended up one of those freakish New York tragedies. He made news because he was hit by a bullet intended for someone else.
Last Friday evening, while walking down a bustling Crown Heights avenue to fetch fruits and vegetables for his dinner, he was struck in the upper chest by a bullet that the authorities believe was fired by a police officer. He was dead by the time he got to a hospital.
The officer, who was standing about 160 feet from Mr. Al Qotaini, was actually shooting at Keith Richardson, who the police said was reaching for a handgun tucked in his waistband. Mr. Richardson was also killed. The police said the weapon he was carrying was a BB gun.
The police said Mr. Richardson, 34, had been arrested numerous times since 1977, including on charges of armed robbery, rape, burglary and drug possession. He was convicted of one drug charge and a number of minor offenses and has spent time in jail on several occasions, they said. He was shot just outside the Flavor for Ya pool hall, one of his favored haunts.
Friends knew Mr. Al Qotaini as a serene man with classic aspirations that never shrank in scope. Like other immigrants, he was passionate about doing well enough so that his children would live a more satisfying life. He had four young children and his wife is pregnant with a fifth. They live in Bedin, Yemen, which is where Mr. Al Qotaini was born 29 years ago.
The lonely, cross-ocean life was imbued in him by his father, Abdo. In Yemen, the elder Mr. Al Qotaini has a small farm, where his wife and some of his 12 other children live. For 22 years, he has been working in delis and food stores in Brooklyn, most recently at the A & A Grocery on Kingston Avenue. About three years ago, he brought his wife to Brooklyn to see if she might want to live here. She stayed a few months but did not care for the city and went back.
Nagi Al Qotaini married when he was 14, and four years later he came to New York, full of raw energy. He found companionship among the dozens of Arabs from Yemen who live and work in and around Crown Heights, mostly in the jumble of delis and candy stores.
During interludes between shifts, when he sat and bantered with friends, he sketched out the high hopes he harbored.
"He always dreamed to live good, to have a nice business and a nice house," said Feisul Selah, a friend who worked near him at the Prospect Deli and Grocery. "He always dreamed for his children to go to good schools and to be a doctor or something like that. He always dreamed a big, good dream."
He added: "He hated problems. When he saw problems, he walked away. When he saw an argument, he would walk away."
Mr. Selah also lives the dual-continent life. In his case, he has not been home to Yemen to see his family for two years. "Nagi could never go that long," he said. "He was crazy for his family."
Mr. Al Qotaini and his friends came here to bring an upward spiral to their lives. "Everyone dreams to come to America," Mr. Selah said. "America is the best country. The land of opportunity."
But Mr. Selah said that it was hard for their children to go to American schools and they felt the neighborhoods they lived in were too dangerous for young children. So their families would usually remain overseas at least until the children were older. Mr. Al Qotaini talked of bringing his family over here at some point.
He worked at various delis, subject to their shifting economic circumstances. Two weeks ago, he started at the Taiz Supermarket and Deli on Nostrand Avenue. It is a narrow storefront grocery, like so many others spaced along Nostrand. On one side is the shuttered Superior Market and on the other is the Beauty Corner. The front window is ornamented with prices of sale items. Inside, there are the newspapers up front next to two-liter bottles of soda, a rack of bread, an ice cream case and a cold cuts cabinet.
George Maflahi, his boss, paid him $4.25 an hour, and he would work different shifts, eight hours a day, seven days a week. Mr. Maflahi said he was here legally and had a green card. He would operate the cash register, stock shelves, make sandwiches -- the deli life.
He shared Mr. Maflahi's apartment next door to the store. "He only worked and went home and slept," Mr. Maflahi said. "He was a nice, honest man, working hard like the other Arabs do."
Mr. Maflahi, who has been in America since he was 14, also has a wife and four children back in Yemen. He sees them sporadically, calls and writes as often as he can. "If you visit every two years, it's not a problem," he said. "That's life."
As it got past 7 that Friday evening, Mr. Al Qotaini was still on duty at the deli. He told Mr. Maflahi, "I'm going to get some fruit and vegetables." It was common for them to cook vegetables in the back of the store for their dinner. It was about 7:25 when he stepped outside the door. Carol James, who works at a nearby pharmacy and had just bought some food at the deli, walked along with him.
They strolled south down Nostrand toward a Korean grocery. They got to the Nostrand Travel Bureau, and that was as far as they would go. Shots rang out, and Ms. James cowered next to the wall. Mr. Al Qotaini dropped to the ground. When the shooting ceased, she told him it was safe to get up. Then, she realized he had been hit. She began screaming.
"I heard the shots," Mr. Maflahi said. "I was behind the cash register, and I had a lot of customers. One customer came back and said, 'Your friend got shot.' I went outside, and it was true. I saw my friend laid down."
On Tuesday afternoon, it was mild and sunny. Shortly before 1 P.M., a gray and black hearse backed up to the At-Taqwa mosque on Bedford Avenue. The light gray casket containing Mr. Al Qotaini's body was gently carried inside. About 50 people had shown up to pay their final respects, their shoes stored on racks at the door.
A short prayer was said, while the hearse waited outside. Then the casket was loaded back into the hearse and the driver headed off to Kennedy International Airport, so the body could be flown to Yemen to be buried today in Bedin.
Outside the mosque, Abdo Al Qotaini was morose and he was quiet. He did not have much that he wanted to say. He was traveling back to Yemen with the body. He was not sure when he would return. He said he was still trying to understand all this.
"What can I say?" he said. "He was a good son. A good person. What can I say?"

HEADLINE: G.D.P. Growth Is Raised To 3.9% for 3d Quarter

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30

 BODY:
The economy grew faster during the summer than had been previously estimated, pointing to a strong holiday shopping season, fresh Government figures showed today.
Total output of goods and services expanded at a 3.9 percent annual pace in the third quarter as business investment boomed in the face of progressively higher interest rates. A month ago, the rise in gross domestic product for the July-September period was put at 3.4 percent. 
 "This momentum is self-sustaining," said Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company, noting that today's revision showed a bigger contribution from business investment and personal consumption and no longer any contribution from goods moving into inventory.
A buildup of inventories, which helped drive G.D.P. during the first half of the year, typically represents a borrowing of activity from future periods when factories slow while stocks are pared.
Inflation associated with the G.D.P. accounts was revised slightly higher -- to 3.4 percent from 3.2 percent as gauged by the fixed-weight index of domestic prices -- but neither economists nor the bond market expressed anxiety.
In its initial tally of corporate profits for the quarter, the Commerce Department said profits from current production had climbed 2 percent, or $10.7 billion. While this was much less than the second-quarter surge of 7.5 percent, the earlier period benefited substantially from a rebound following the California earthquake in January. First-quarter profits slumped 4.8 percent.
In a separate Government report, a Federal Reserve revision showed American industry operating a bit further below inflation-threat levels than previously thought. Factories, mines and utilities ran at 84.6 percent of capacity during October -- still the highest since April 1989 -- instead of the 84.9 percent reported two weeks ago. A utilization rate above 85 percent or so is considered in the danger area for accelerating inflation.
As part of scheduled revisions of capacity and production data, the Fed said production was stronger in 1991 and 1992 than previously reported but slower in 1993 and 1994. The Fed also raised capacity growth for 1991, 1992 and 1993. But none of the changes significantly altered prospects for the economy, analysts said.
Two other reports today, from corporate purchasing managers in two regions of the country, showed rising cost pressures similar to those found recently in other areas but which have yet to be much reflected at the consumer level or in wages.
Purchasing managers in the Chicago area reported that the prices-paid component of its index had jumped to 79.4 from 72.5, while New York managers said the component there jumped to 77 from 70, nearly twice the average rise in the three preceding months.
Still, it was the surprisingly large upward revision of G.D.P. that captured most of the attention today.
For analysts, the 3.9 percent annual rate of expansion confirmed economic strength they had suspected. But the data also implied that vigorous growth would continue, and possibly accelerate, before higher interest rates take their toll on the economy in 1995.
"The numbers make me feel more confident about our 4 1/2 percent G.D.P. forecast" for the fourth quarter, said Michelle C. Laughlin, economist at Sanwa Securities in New York.
The biggest upward revision was in fixed investment other than housing, which soared $11.2 billion, to a 14.4 percent rate of gain instead of the 7 percent initially estimated.

HEADLINE: For the Toy King, New Challengers

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
At least 21 cents of every dollar spent on toys this holiday season will end up in the coffers of Toys "R" Us -- and many analysts suspect that the reigning titan of Toyland is really raking in more than that.
But a swarm of potential challengers are nipping at the toy industry's 800-pound gorilla. There's Noodle Kidoodle, Zany Brainy, Learningsmith and Baby Superstore, to mention a handful of nascent retail chains trying to nibble on Toys "R" Us's slice of the toy market. 
 At that suggestion, Michael Goldstein, the Toys "R" Us chief executive, waved his hand as if brushing aside a gnat. "Most of them will fail," he predicted.
He is less dismissive of more rapacious rivals like Wal-Mart Stores, the Kmart Corporation and Target Stores. "Five years ago, there were several toy supermarkets, and now there's just us," he said proudly. Then, his face clouded slightly as he added: "And the major discounters, of course."
The competition is getting fiercer just as the company's rate of growth is decelerating. For most of the 1980's sales at Toys "R" Us, which is based in Paramus, N.J., grew at a compound rate exceeding 20 percent, but between 1988 and 1993, the pace slowed to about 11.2 percent, according to Goldman, Sachs & Company.
With 618 stores scattered around the country, there are few new domestic markets to conquer. But since the United States stores account for roughly 80 percent of its operating profits, the company is looking for ways to increase their sales. "The most important challenge for us is to wring more productivity out of existing stores," Mr. Goldstein said. "That's what's driving us, not the competition."
For all Mr. Goldstein's sang-froid, it is clear that Toys "R" Us has not turned a blind eye to its competition. The special merchandise "boutiques" it has opened in some stores are a clear reaction to the lively ambiance of most of the new toy chains that have sprung up. The boutiques soften the warehouse atmosphere of Toys "R" Us stores and help make them easier to shop.
In the same way, the company has deployed coupon "catalogues" as a response to the cutthroat pricing of the big discounters. Just today, the stores will begin distributing a 32-page book with $500 in coupons for the season's most popular video games and electronic toys, which will also be distributed in 61 million newspapers this weekend.
Making these strategies work is even more important because the company's overseas expansion has proven more difficult than expected. Last year, operating profits at the 293 foreign stores rose a scant 1.8 percent, to $102.9 million, falling almost $50 million short of the company's goals as recession ate into sales in Japan and Germany. Analysts are confident the overseas operations will meet this year's objective of $150 million in operating profits, but they doubt those returns will ever equal the profitability of the company's North American and British stores.
Mr. Goldstein is not worried. "When you look back at Toys 'R' Us, the profitability was O.K. but it wasn't great," he said. "The surge in profitability came later, and it will come later over there, too."
Toys "R" Us has revved up its business before. A couple of years ago, as Wal-Mart and Kmart got more aggressive about toys, its sales per square foot slipped. But the company has fought back with low prices -- and sales per square foot have rebounded to the 1989 level of $220.
Discounters have managed to slow Toys "R" Us's market share expansion, though, and it now seems less likely that the company will ever live up to founder Charles Lazarus's dream of controlling 40 percent of the toy-retailing business.
And if the new rivals that have popped up in malls around the country do gain a toehold in the market, they will likely hurt Toys "R" Us before they hurt the discounters. Their stores are loaded with colorful fixtures, interactive displays and helpful sales people, in marked contrast to the no-frills ambiance of the typical Toys "R" Us store.
Several of those chains are already trying to chip away at pieces of the company's business that are most vulnerable to competition -- educational toys and software. Kids Source Inc., for example, does about one-quarter of its business in toys that Roy M. Cohen, its founder, calls "playthings with a purpose."
"We built Kids Source as a 'mom's needs' store, not a 'child's want' store," Mr. Cohen said. "There's no doubt that Toys 'R' Us is the child's want store in America, and no one is ever going to take that away from them."
But Toys "R" Us is not interested in sharing Mom with anyone, either. She, after all, is the one who makes the purchase.
To that end, the company has begun testing an educational boutique devoted to toys and software that promote learning. Like the Books "R" Us shops the company has opened in more than 300 stores, the educational boutiques have replaced floor-to-ceiling shelving with lower display fixtures for easier access, and the shop is staffed by a trained sales clerk. Tot-sized tables and chairs with computers invite children to test the software.
Educational software and computer games is a new category for the company -- but a critical one. "Of all the tests they're doing now, that's the most important," Sean McGowan of Gerard Klauer & Mattison said.
Mr. McGowan expects software to gradually supplant the video game business, which makes up about 13 percent of Toys "R" Us's sales. Additionally, if the company cultivates its young software customers, who now buy from traditional software retailers, it may be able to retain them as they get older and more affluent, he said.
Mr. Goldstein said the company was still trying to determine how big a market educational toys and software will be. But he issued a subtle warning to his new competitors: "Eventually, we're going to be in that business in a big way."
The company has also committed itself to putting boutique shops devoted to Lego and stuffed animals in more of its stores. The Lego store, in particular, brings a bit of F.A.O. Schwarz, the fabled premium toy-store chain, into Toys "R" Us, with interactive trains and planes built of brightly colored Lego blocks that tiny shoppers can operate with a control pad.
And a specialty shop featuring "plush" toys, industry jargon for stuffed animals, has even enticed upscale manufacturers like Dakin and Gunds, which would never sell to Toys "R" Us before. Those toys command hefty profit margins, too.
That is welcome, because the in-store shop concept does increase the company's costs. The shops must be kept neat and will require additional, better-trained staff, but Mr. Goldstein is hoping that the extra sales they generate will more than offset the higher expenses.
Not every boutique concept works: a Parties "R" Us shop was deemed a failure. But analysts consider the shops a must. "Even if the sales response was not sufficient justification, the emergence of capable new competitors may render such a remerchandising effort necessary for defensive reasons," David A. Bolotsky, a retail analyst at Goldman, Sachs, wrote in a report on the company.
Mr. Bolotsky estimated that a Books "R" Us shop increases book sales by 200 percent, which in turn raises the sales of stores in which they operate by about 2 percent. The Lego and plush shops will probably have more impact, he said, and over all, the three concepts could add 5 percent or more in sales to their host stores.
That may well accelerate growth. And the Toys "R" Us catalogues are a way of maintaining sales in the face of the discounters.
Last year, the company's coupon-filled "Big Toy Book" Christmas catalogue led to near-riots in stores as customers fought to get them.
This holiday season, the company came out swinging in October with a preview catalogue featuring $300 worth of coupons. That was followed by an even bigger catalogue with $600 in coupons in November.
The company now offers customers $500 worth of savings on video games and electronic toys that are good until Dec. 15. The hope is that the new catalogue will prod lagging sales of video games. Analysts say it will be hard for consumers to resist Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis cartridges, which usually sell for between $40 and $55, at $19.97.
The catalogues are clearly a message to Toys "R" Us rivals that the industry's giant is not sleeping. "We're trying to be aggressive like everyone else out there," Mr. Goldstein said. "This is our business."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
A venerable peanut subsidy may be a target of Republicans.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
THE new Republicans are on the prowl for spending cuts. And since some of the juiciest targets -- notably Social Security -- have been ruled off limits, they are making no secret of their wish to save billions on farm subsidies.
Once that political door is opened, though, it is likely that many farm programs will be challenged, including many that offend free marketers more than they drain the Treasury. And one of them, the half-century-old peanut program, could prove vulnerable once Congress takes aim at higher profile subsidies. 
 Talk, of course, is cheap. Votes against a program that diverts roughly $500 million a year from consumers to a few thousand well-connected land owners are not. But opponents of the peanut program, who include Dick Armey of Texas, the Republican House majority leader in waiting, may be on the verge of assembling a coalition strong enough to support the rhetoric.
Like most farm programs, peanut subsidies date from the New Dealers' response to the Great Depression. But over the years its original purpose -- to stabilize the incomes of small farmers -- was quietly laid to rest in the murk of interest group politics.
Each year, the Agriculture Department estimates the quantity of peanuts needed by makers of peanut snacks, peanut candy and peanut butter, and guarantees a minimum price (currently 34 cents a pound) for this tonnage. Since growers would be delighted to sell far more at the mandated price, quotas for sales at 34 cents a pound are parceled out to peanut growing states, thence to counties and individual growers within counties based on historical benchmarks.
To prevent the Government from ending up with millions of tons of unsold peanuts, imports are effectively barred. (Substantial quantities, though, are likely to come in from Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement. More about that later.)
It is not surprising that the peanut lobby has been able to brush aside efforts to trim back the largess over the last decade. The program costs the Government very little -- just $40 million this year -- making it an unworthy target for budget cutters on the lookout for heftier game. Food processors all face the same artificially high price, and can thus treat the program as a cost of doing business like sales taxes. Consumers, for their part, never know why a jar of Jif costs, say, $3 rather than $2.60.
By contrast, beneficiaries of the program know exactly how their bread is buttered and by whom. Quotas, freely tradable within counties, can be leased for cash. And most are: just one-third of the peanuts sold under quota were actually grown by the quota owner. Indeed, just 409 growers produced 665 million pounds of peanuts in 1991, fully 19 percent of all the peanuts marketed under the system.
Why, then, is there any reason for believing that the attack planned for next year will succeed?
For one thing large numbers of producers don't see a penny from the program since roughly a third of all the peanuts grown in America are sold at unprotected world market prices. Much of this surplus is exported; the rest ends up as oil or animal feed. And while jealousy alone might not motivate the growers of so-called "additionals" to lobby effectively against the program, they are convinced that the free-market price is depressed by overproduction on quota-protected acreage.
For another, the North American trade accord opens a hole in the wall against imports. Mexico is currently a minor producer of peanuts and peanut butter. But under the agreement, restrictions on the peanut trade are being phased out and will disappear entirely by the middle of the next decade.
The Department of Agriculture estimates that by 2000, 14 percent of the peanuts eaten by Americans will be imports. If, as many expect, Mexico invests heavily in modernizing agriculture, the figure could be much higher. And this raises the prospect that the Government will be forced to buy peanuts that cannot be sold at the minimum quota price.
Last but not least, peanut processors are becoming more militant. While they have never been thrilled to pay more than necessary for the raw material, they now fear being priced out of the snack market. Sales of peanut foods, which peaked in 1989, are down about 10 percent -- with most of the loss in peanut butter.
What form might the reform take? A coalition of peanut processors and peanut growers lacking quota rights wants to cut the price support to 25 cents a pound -- a price that would put very few peanut farmers out of business yet keep America competitive with Mexico.
Mr. Armey would prefer the reform to be short and, for those who share his perspective, sweet: his bill, introduced in February, would simply wipe the peanut program off the books.

U.S. Bonds, Municipals Post Gains

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday for the first time in three days as inflation concerns eased.
Municipal bonds staged their biggest rally in more than a week amid buying by insurance companies, mutual funds and other investors attracted by higher yields. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 9/32 , pushing its yield down 3 basis points to 8 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
"Inflation is fairly well under control," said Jim Fields, who helps manage about $3 billion at Wright Investors in Bridgeport, Conn. By the end of 1995, "we'll get a 100-basis-point drop" in bond yields, Fields said.
The Government revised its overall gross domestic product estimate up to 3.9 percent yesterday from 3.4 percent. More important, it said its price deflator, a broad measure of inflation that is a component of the G.D.P. report, grew at a revised 1.9 percent pace in the third quarter, up from its initial estimate of 1.6 percent, but down from the second quarter's 2.9 percent rate.
A firm dollar also helped lift bonds, traders said.
In the municipal market, "we've finally got to levels where people want to put money to work," said Richard Visconti, senior vice president at W. R. Lazard, Laidlaw & Mead Inc.
Tax-exempt bonds as measured by the Bond Buyer Municipal Index of 40 bonds rose 1 3/32 , or $10.94 per $1,000 face value of bonds, to yield 7.73 percent, 18 basis points lower than Tuesday. That was the biggest gain since Nov. 23, when municipal bonds as measured by the index rose 7/8 of point to yield 7.93 percent
Most investors were interested in new bonds sold by states and state agencies, traders said. In yesterday's largest sale, California sold $146 million in revenue bonds. Strong demand helped California lower yields by as much as 15 basis points.
Some investors have been unloading their mortgage securities in the last few days, either to raise cash before the end of the year or to allocate more money to Treasuries, traders said. By now, yield spreads widened enough to make mortgages attractive again, according to some investors and traders.
"At this point it's probably a better time to buy," said Michael Kennedy, who manages the $300 million Stein Roe & Farnham Intermediate Bond Fund. "We've seen some widening of spreads in the last few days."
Government National Mortgage Association 9 percent passthroughs delivered in December were up 3/32 at 100 13/32 for a yield of 9.01 percent, or 1.10 points more than the 10-year Treasury note, down from 1.11 points Tuesday.
In the corporate market, Eli Lilly & Company sold $450 million of notes in connection with its $4 billion acquisition of PCS Health Systems Inc.
Some corporate bond investors said they were not interested in the Lilly offering because the the company's decision to finance the PCS purchase partly with debt could prevent the new bonds from appreciating much and increase the risk its debt ratings would be cut.
"Whether the rating agencies will let them keep the double-A rating depends on how much debt they sell to finish this deal," said Barbara McCue, who helps manage about $11 billion at Keystone Fixed Income Adviseors.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 20-day cash-management bills:

HEADLINE: Mexico's President-to-Be Names Free-Market Cabinet

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 30

 BODY:
On the eve of his inauguration, President-elect Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon today named some of the prime movers of the outgoing administration to significant posts in his Cabinet, sending a signal of stability and continued Mexican Government commitment to a market economy.
Financial analysts reacted positively to the announcements, but investors seemed to have anticipated the moves over the last few days and decided to take some profits today. American depository receipts of Telefonos de Mexico, this country's benchmark stock, fell $1.375, to close at $52.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 The market here, the Bolsa, dropped 0.19 percent, to close at 2,591.34. In the four previous trading days, the Bolsa rose more than 7 percent.
Lawrence B. Goodman, vice president for emerging markets research at Salomon Brothers in New York, said the recent rise was "clearly a reflection of a market view that the Zedillo administration is going to pave the way for capitalizing on the substantial economic reforms" of the administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who gives way to Mr Zedillo on Thursday.
Jonathan Heath, director of Macro Assesoria Economica, a consulting firm, took a more cautious view of the market's strength. He said the national development bank had probably intervened in the last few days, buying stocks in timely fashion. "They're trying to to show the market that everything is fine," Mr. Heath said. "That's not bad; it's just a little dressing-up factor."
Mr. Zedillo's Cabinet contains names familiar to many United States investors. One of the most important positions, Finance Minister, will be filled by Jaime Serra Puche, an economist educated at Yale University, who was Mexico's point man for the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Serra, a strong free-market advocate, oversaw many attempts to deregulate and change Mexico's economy during the Salinas administration, including the creation of a Federal Competition Commission.
Another Nafta team member, Herminio Blanco, will fill the critical job of Minister of Commerce and Industrial Development, which Mr. Serra held in the Salinas Cabinet. Mr. Blanco handled detailed talks for Mexico and like Mr. Serra believes in vigorous competition.
Guillermo Ortiz, now Deputy Finance Minister, takes over the Communications and Transportation Ministry, which is expected to make some important policy decisions during Mr. Zedillo's six-year term. The ministry will oversee the end of Telefonos de Mexico's long-distance monopoly and the entrance of competitors, probably including AT&T, MCI and Sprint, into the Mexican market.
A name absent from Mr. Zedillo's list was that of Pedro Aspe, the current Finance Minister, who has been a favorite of international investors. Mr. Aspe has said that he wants to leave public life. Until the last few days, he had been considered a candidate for any number of positions in the Zedillo administration.
Analysts noted that Mr. Zedillo fulfilled a pledge to include the political opposition in his Cabinet. He named Antonio Lozano, a member of the conservative National Action Party, as Attorney General.
A sour note for reform advocates was the inclusion of Ignazio Pichardo, president of the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, as Energy Minister. Mr. Pichardo, a powerful politician, is a member of the party's old guard. Under a proposed reorganization, his Energy Ministry could assume control of Pemex, the state oil monopoly.
A week ago, Deputy Attorney General Mario Ruiz Massieu accused Mr. Pichardo of blocking the investigation into the assassination in September of his brother, the party's Secretary General, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu. The day he made the charge, the Mexican stock exchange dropped sharply until the development bank intervened. Mr. Pichardo has sued for defamation.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Silver Near Low for the Year As Inflation Concerns Abate

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Silver prices fell to their lowest levels in nearly a year yesterday as rising interest rates and waning inflation fears hurt the market.
Gold prices also fell, although not so sharply. Precious metals are often considered a hedge against inflation. 
 Silver led a broad decline in commodity prices that lowered the Commodity Research Bureau's index by 1.36 points, to 229.23. Hogs, soybeans, natural gas and orange juice were among the other losers. Wheat futures rose sharply.
Silver for delivery in December dropped 14.9 cents on the Commodity Exchange of New York to settle at $4.896 an ounce, the lowest daily settlement for a near-term futures contract since last Dec. 7. Gold for December delivery fell $1.30, to $380.70 an ounce.
The plunge in silver represented the market's third consecutive daily decline. The selloff followed a Government report on the gross domestic product that showed little inflation in the third quarter.
"Although the economic numbers showed the economy is strong, they also showed that inflation was certainly contained," said Peter Cardillo, research director for Westfalia Investments Inc. in New York. "As a result of that, there was no reason to hold the precious metals any more."
An analyst at Smith Barney, David Rinehimer, said easing inflation concerns had reduced speculative demand for silver.
A stronger economy could increase industrial demand for the metal, but supplies are ample. Warehouse stocks of silver registered with the exchange stood at 265.7 million ounces yesterday, up from 250.7 million at the end of February.
Analysts said the selling accelerated when the December delivery price fell below $5 an ounce, an important psychological barrier.
On other markets, hog futures fell sharply, reflecting large supplies of animals. The Agriculture Department estimated yesterday's hog slaughter at 366,000, about 3,000 above trade estimates. Live hogs for December fell 0.90 cent, to 30.67 cents a pound, on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange; frozen pork bellies for February fell 0.40 cent, to 36.25 cents a pound.
Near-term hog delivery prices are poised to drop below 30 cents a pound for the first time since Oct. 18.
Wheat futures rose strongly amid speculation about a possible Chinese purchase of American wheat. December wheat rose 7.75 cents, to $3.7225 a bushel, on the Chicago Board of Trade.

Dollar Is Steady on Report Of U.S. Economy's Strength

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar ended little changed yesterday, consolidating its recent gains on fresh evidence that the American economy is healthy enough to warrant higher short-term interest rates in the near future.
"The tide has shifted in favor of the dollar," said the chief economist at BankAmerica, John Wilson. "There is no reason for the dollar to remain as weak as it has been, given the strength of the economy." 
 The Commerce Department raised its estimate yesterday of the gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the goods and services output in the United States, for July to September. It said the third-quarter G.D.P. expanded at a strong pace of 3.9 percent, or a half-percentage point higher than the first estimate.
Also, final sales, a component of the G.D.P. on which economists focus because it shows what Americans actually spent, was revised even higher, to a gain of 4.2 percent, from 3.1 percent.
Mr. Wilson said the dollar was also helped by a growing market perception that the Federal Reserve was ready to tackle inflation pressures.
"There are expectations the Fed needs to tighten further," he said. "But certainly, the situation looks a lot better than it did in the middle of summer."
The dollar was depressed last summer by a trade dispute between the United States and Japan at a time when the Fed left monetary policy on hold for three months.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5710 German marks, compared with 1.5703 marks late Tuesday. The dollar ended unchanged at 98.97 Japanese yen.
The chief economist for Mellon Bank, Richard Berner, said global investors were looking favorably at the United States now that short-term interest rates were higher than those in Germany, and should remain that way for the near future.
Helmut Schieber, a Bundesbank director, said in an interview that "it's more difficult to see a scenario that would cause us to react with a rate increase," because he estimated that the German recovery was "two years" behind those in English-speaking countries.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A Confidence Meter Frowns on Clinton and Stocks

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Consumer confidence is reported to be sharply higher. That sounds good, but if history is any guide, the latest readings from the Conference Board survey may be a bad omen for both stocks and President Clinton. That is because consumers' views of the future are significantly less optimistic than their views of the present. And in the past, such a divergence has been a negative indicator for the stock market.
Had someone bought and sold the stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average based on an indicator derived from the consumer confidence data since 1969, the portfolio would now be up 515 percent. By contrast, a buy-and-hold investor would have gained 313 percent. And with this week's results, the indicator has issued its first sell signal since June 1987. 
 Looking only at the indicator in the survey closest to midterm elections, it has been a perfect forecaster of the results of the next Presidential election. If consumers felt the future looked better than the present, as they did in 1970, 1982 and 1986, they went on to re-elect the incumbent President, or his party's candidate if he did not run.
And when consumers felt the other way, as they did in 1974, 1978 and 1990, they voted the incumbent out of office two years later. It is that unfortunate group that Mr. Clinton is in danger of joining.
The latest poll by the Conference Board, which was released on Tuesday, produced an overall level of consumer confidence of 101.3 for November, the highest since July 1990, just before a recession hit the country, and up sharply from October's 89.1.
But the surge came mainly from very optimistic views of the present situation, which registered at 108.3, also the highest since mid-1990. The outlook for the next six months was only 96.7, less than it was just after Mr. Clinton was elected two years ago.
It makes sense that people would put more money into stocks when they think the future is better than the past, and would grow cautious when they fear the future will be worse. And it turns out that consumer confidence has been a fair indicator of the stock market.
The rule, first discussed in this column two years ago, is that if the expectations index is at least nine points below the index of current conditions, a sell signal is created. That signal continues until the expectations index is at least nine points higher than the current index, when a buy signal is given. That range keeps the indicator from flipping over on small changes.
When the Conference Board began its poll of consumers in February 1969, they were less optimistic about the future than the present, and so an investor would have stayed out of the stock market. By August 1970, when the future looked better, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 15 percent from where it had been when the first measure was taken. Over the succeeding years, the indicator would have called for selling at the end of February 1973, buying in December 1974, selling in May 1978, buying in June 1980 and selling in June 1987, shortly before the 1987 crash.
That crash shook consumer views of the future, and it was not until February 1991, well after the stock market had made up the losses from the crash, that it provided a new buy signal, which remained in effect until this week.
For purposes of computing the history, all buy and sell signals were considered to be executed on the last day of the month in which confidence moved past the trigger for buying or selling. Because the Conference Board sometimes revises its figures a month after they are released, it is possible that some of those signals were given a month later than indicated.
The figures for performance do not include dividend income, nor do they take into account the costs of moving in and out of the stock market. They also ignore the money that could have been made in Treasury bills while an investor was out of the stock market.
The Conference Board figures for November are preliminary, and will be revised next month. It is possible, although unlikely, that both the stock market and President Clinton's prospects might look better after the revision. There is, of course, no assurance that any indicator will work as it has in the past.
President Clinton might be pleased to learn that the overall consumer confidence index, at 101.3, is higher than at any previous midterm election. But history indicates that the more relevant factor for electoral success is the relative level of the current and expectations indexes.
The second highest overall level of confidence at midterm came in 1978, when the figure was 96.5 but the future appeared dimmer than the present. Two years later, Jimmy Carter lost his bid for re-election.

GRAPHIC: Graph: "Consumers Send a Sell Signal" tracks the Conference Board index of consumer expectations about future conditions, minus the Conference Board index of consumer attitudes about present conditions, plotted in index points. The resulting figure shows when consumers think the future will be significantly better than the present, or when the opposite is true. A difference of 9 points or more sends a signal to buy or sell stocks. The closing Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks is given for the month of each signal; for sell signals, the Dow's change since the last buy signal is also given. For both confidence indexes, the 1985 average equals 100; figures are six times yearly before July 1977 and monthly since then. (pg. D1)
 
Table: "Midterm Forecast"
 When it comes ot anticipating the next Presidential election, the overall level of consumer confidence in the middle of a president's term is not a reliable omen, but its components are. Only when consumers have felt better about the future than the present has the President's party kept the White House in the next election.

Salary Cap Taken Off Immediate Agenda

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LEESBURG, Va., Nov. 30

 BODY:
The mediator whom the Clinton Administration sent to save Major League Baseball from itself is viewed by labor negotiators as a master of good timing, and today Bill Usery Jr. put that talent to use.
At Usery's urging, the owners' negotiating team agreed to postpone a meeting next Monday in Chicago, where the owners had been expected to declare an impasse in negotiations and implementing their salary-cap proposal. 
 "I've asked the owners to put off the meeting, and they've agreed to do that," Usery said a little more than six hours after the two sides began meeting at the Lansdowne Conference Resort. "I've asked the owners to withdraw the threat of implementation and they've agreed to do that. It's in everybody's interest to change those deadlines and continue negotiating."
At the same time, Usery was persuading the owners to postpone implementation, he was working on the players' negotiators to develop a counterproposal at the union's executive board meeting in Atlanta next week.
"It's our intention to come out with one," Donald Fehr, the players' labor leader, said. "I can't say more than that."
The two sides agreed to meet in Rye Brook, N.Y., on Dec. 9. John Harrington of the Boston Red Sox, the owners' chief labor spokesman, said the owners would meet Dec. 15 or 16 at a site to be determined.
A key element of Usery's success was in inducing the owners to agree to postponement without a guarantee of a new proposal from the players.
When Jay Bell of the Pittsburgh Pirates, the National League player representative and a member of the union's negotiating subcommittee, left the meeting early, just before 6 P.M., he was asked about the players' plans.
"Whether we come out of there with a counterproposal or not I don't know yet, but that's something we need to discuss at the board meeting," he said. "We've been asked by our board members to negotiate, but because the board meeting is so close from now, we want to go there and caucus with them."
Asked if Usery was trying to persuade the owners to postpone their meeting, the shortstop said, "Yes, that's basically what he's doing."
As Bell headed for the door, Usery was meeting with the owners' negotiators to pin down their pledge to delay what would be the most critical step in the labor dispute since the players struck Aug. 12.
The agreement also involves postponement of one other date -- Dec. 7. That's the deadline for clubs to offer salary arbitration to their free agents to retain rights to them.
Harrington had said the clubs needed to implement their new economic system before that date. He said Tuesday night the clubs would consider postponement of the Dec. 7 deadline "under certain conditions," one of those presumably being the players' promise of a counterproposal.
The two sides agreed to put off the arbitration-offer deadline until Dec. 17. The deadline for response from players who receive offers was postponed from Dec. 19 to Dec. 23.
"I think this is a positive note for our negotiations," Harrington said. "I'm pleased we're agreeing to meet again."
The agreement to postpone could not be taken as a sign of progress, but as an effort to keep the talks going without disruptive actions. "If there is a window, both sides found a way to keep it open a few days more, and that's very important," said Lauren Rich, a union lawyer.
A 10-day delay in the owners' meeting would be enough time for the players to formulate and present a counterproposal and for the owners to decide if the approach would be worth pursuing.
If they saw no promise in the proposal, the owners would presumably act on impasse and implementation at their rescheduled meeting.
Another deadline, Dec. 20, was not discussed. That's the date by which clubs must tender contracts to the approximately 900 players who aren't signed for 1995. Neither side apparently wants to change that deadline.
Usery's plan to postpone implementation and give the players time to give a counterproposal makes eminent sense.
When the owners set their Chicago meeting, they knew the players' executive board was meeting the same week but gave no indication of a willingness to wait to hear what the union had to say before declaring an impasse. Usery could have tried earlier to get the owners to wait, but he obviously felt that he had a better chance of succeeding in his quest if he waited until after the two sides exhaustively discussed the new tax proposal that management made Nov. 17.
Members of the union and management staffs held several technical question-and-answer meetings on that proposal, in person and by telephone, between the series of bargaining sessions in nearby Herndon and this series. Full negotiating committees further discussed the plan for several hours Tuesday.
Upon reconvening today, they held a discussion of a different kind. Doyle Pryor, a union lawyer, said they were discussing "the gulf between us and how to bridge it."
The gulf is gaping and would grow wider with the owners' implementation of the salary cap they want. At the same time that they placed the tax proposal on the table, they gave the players a revised salary-cap proposal that they intended to implement as baseball's new economic system.
Implementation would trigger an arduous legal fight before the National Labor Relations Board and most likely in United States District Court. Both sides would concentrate their energies on that element of their dispute, and they would most likely have little time for the bargaining table.
The owners would also proceed with plans to open spring training camps and start the season with replacement players if necessary.
"We want to make a commitment to the fans that we're going to play the 1995 season with some caliber of professional baseball player," Harrington said Tuesday night. "We believe it will be entertaining and we believe that's what the fans want. The fans want baseball with the best quality player we can put out there. Our preference is to put major league players out there, but if they're unwilling to play, then we'll have to go with someone else who's willing to play."
Fehr, the union leader, said Harrington has said the same thing about replacement players in negotiating sessions. "Such comments do not make the process more simple," Fehr said. "They have the opposite effect."
Gene Orza, a union lawyer, said the idea of replacement players is "internally inconsistent because only major league baseball players can play major league baseball. In the absence of an agreement on opening day 1995, major league players will be on strike."

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
Players Hoping Tour of Europe Will Jar Owners

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 30

 BODY:
The effects of hockey's labor predicament will flare on two fronts Thursday as the lockout of players begins its third month.
Across a conference table in Chicago, negotiators for the National Hockey League and the N.H.L. Players Association will argue again over terms of a collective bargaining agreement in an attempt to end an impasse that has postponed the start of the season for 61 days. 
 If no deal is reached by the end of December, it is possible that the entire 84-game regular season, plus the Stanley Cup playoffs, could be canceled. Such a meltdown would be unprecedented in professional sports and could lead to the splintering of a major league that has survived for eight decades and seemed, until this fall, on the brink of an explosion in popularity.
Meanwhile, on the ice, in a suburb north of Detroit, a group of N.H.L. stars, led by Wayne Gretzky, will play an exhibition game against a minor league team. The match is a warm-up for a six-game tour of Finland, Sweden and Norway, which begins on Friday, but which would end immediately if a settlement is reached.
Officially, the trip is for goodwill and charity, but its larger agenda is much more complex and controversial.
"We're hoping the lockout ends and maybe this tour will put a little pressure on somebody to get it to end," said Gretzky, who has chartered an airplane for the tour. "Maybe it's showing that players can get out there and work and do some good things for the sport of hockey. I get mad when people say we're on strike. We're not on strike. We're locked out. Big difference."
Among those touring with him are some of the elite of the league, including Mark Messier of the Rangers, Brett Hull of the St. Louis Blues and Sergei Fedorov of the Detroit Red Wings. Although the N.H.L. has expressed its unhappiness with the plan, the cable television network ESPN2 announced today that it would carry two games of the tour, on Dec. 9 and 10, from Sweden.
Fedorov, last season's most valuable player, is one of three Detroit players who will voluntarily miss Thursday night's game, to be played at the Palace of Auburn Hills, Mich. He, Steve Yzerman and Paul Coffey are deferring to Mike Ilitch, the owner of the Red Wings.
Although Ilitch is among the owners supporting the lockout, the players are reluctant to offend him by playing in his market in a rival building. The Palace is operated by Bill Davidson, owner of the Detroit Pistons of the National Basketball Association, whose organization competes with Ilitch's Joe Louis Arena for sports and other entertainment shows.
Yzerman, the Detroit captain, seemed ill at ease today when trying to explain why he won't wear the union jersey alongside the rest of "Wayne Gretzky & Friends" Thursday night.
"No matter which way we go, we're going to get some criticism and some pressure," Yzerman said, after a practice in Fraser, Mich. "I think the majority of people understand, maybe not necessarily agree. We just think it's the right thing to do. It's not the N.H.L. Players Association against the Detroit Red Wings on this issue. It's a separate issue, which I don't want to get into."
He referred to Ilitch and his family as "our bosses" and said "we've been treated extremely well." A request for comment from Ilitch wasn't returned.
"It's been indicated to us that they wouldn't appreciate us participating," Yzerman said. "In the best interest of when the lockout is over, and we go back to play for the Detroit Red Wings, we want to go back to the atmosphere we had before."
For that to happen, the bargainers must settle at least three major issues: an entry-level salary structure, a reformation of arbitration rules and a restructuring of the formula for free agency.
Also looming over the talks is the possibility of a "luxury tax" to punish high payrolls, a concept the players say they won't accept because it is a salary cap in disguise. All changes are sought by owners to create a "drag" on salary inflation.
League lawyers and union officials met today with Gretzky and his teammates. They traveled to Chicago today. Someone with knowledge of their position said the union's offer to management on Thursday will be comprehensive, geared toward ending the lockout. Some players, including Jeremy Roenick of Chicago, have charged that the union has already conceded too much after first offering to play the season under a no strike/no lockout pledge.
On the management side, several owners have voiced anxiety about the length of the lockout. Bill Wirtz, the Chicago owner, said last week that Commissioner Gary Bettman needs to have a deal by Dec. 1. Joe Cohen, part-owner of the Los Angeles Kings, said Bettman's luxury tax "is the last thing we should be talking about."
Neither Bettman nor Bob Goodenow, the executive director of the Players Association, were available for comment today. Gretzky was, and he said only the luxury tax stands in the way of a deal.
"If they would eliminate that, every other issue is pretty much negotiable," he said. "I think the players have proven they are willing to bend on everything. Guys like Messier and myself, this whole thing has nothing to do with our life. We're never going to feel the effects of this.
"What we're talking about here is guys like Robbie Blake, guys like Brian Leetch, the up-and-coming superstars. The last thing we want to have happen is 10 years from now, those guys turn to us and say, 'You know what, guys like Gretzky and Messier sold us down the river.' "

HEADLINE: Gingrich's Politics Didn't Follow Fashion

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Gingrich's Life: The Complications and Ideals" (front page, Nov. 24) leaves the impression that early in his political career Newt Gingrich abruptly shifted his ideological posture from "liberal" to "conservative" because it became fashionable to do so. In fact, Mr. Gingrich is a classic neoconservative whose entry point into conservatism was via the "Kemp wing." It should be recalled that Ronald Reagan himself was a trade-union liberal Democrat who switched parties as the Democratic party moved leftward. 
 In his first two tries for a House seat, in 1974 and 1976, he was still in the liberal "Rockefeller wing" of the party. Between '76 and '78 Jack Kemp emerged in the House as a champion of supply-side economics, devoted to entrepreneurial capitalism, with government relegated to maintenance of the social safety net created by Democrats and approved by the neoconservatives.
As an editor at The Wall Street Journal between 1976 and 1978, I became aware of Mr. Gingrich's enthusiasm for this new movement, as he sent me campaign material he used in his successful 1978 race that reflected his own conversion.
In all the Gingrich profiles I've seen since the Nov. 8 earthquake, none have mentioned the most important event of his career, his 1990 decision as House minority whip to oppose the budget deal between President Bush and the Democratic Congressional leaders. It was that deal, which raised the income tax rates that President Reagan had lowered, that broke President Bush's "read my lips" 1988 campaign promise.
Mr. Gingrich was vilified by the Bush team for killing the budget the first time around. It was that act of political daring and principle, in a losing cause, that cemented Mr. Gingrich's hold on the hearts of the party faithful and the backbenchers of the House.
At a time of political realignment, Mr. Gingrich's beginnings as a liberal have been a source of great strength to him. He still has in his intellectual experience a liberal's appreciation of human weakness and our collective responsibility to leave no one behind in the kind of general economic advance supply-siders envision.

HEADLINE: Ending Bosnia's Endgame

BYLINE: By George Kenney; George Kenney resigned from the State Department in August 1992 to protest Bush Administration policy in the former Yugoslavia.

DATELINE: STEYNING, England

 BODY:
I never imagined I would find myself defending Serbian conquests. Yet the choices the United States and NATO have made throughout the Bosnian conflict have been so bad that there are no good choices left. It is better to end the carnage, even on unfair terms, than to have it continue for what could be a decade or more. The Europeans are right. The West should make the Bosnian Government settle against its wishes.
After the humiliation surrounding the Muslim defeat in the struggle for Bihac, the United Nations is deadly serious about withdrawing its peacekeeping troops, perhaps even this winter, unless the warring parties agree to a cease-fire across Bosnia and a new round of talks aimed at ending the war. The risks of withdrawal would be great, since NATO forces -- presumably including American ground troops -- would have to provide escort to retreating U.N. personnel. 
 Until his policy shift this week, President Clinton had been halfheartedly pursuing a strategy that did nothing to end the war while raising tensions with Britain and France: arguing for lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia, unilaterally ending American enforcement of the embargo and pressing for more NATO air strikes against Serbian positions. Finally, Mr. Clinton has backed away from these efforts now that Western forces have failed to stop the Serbs in Bihac. Now, the strategy should be formally dropped.
Despite the Muslims' recent losses, there are worrying signs that they are preparing another large offensive -- this time in central Bosnia. Such a move would be another fiasco. In the past, faint American encouragement has led to gross Muslim overconfidence. But has the White House learned not to underestimate the Muslims' irrational and dangerous belief that the West will eventually come to their rescue?
The last two winters in Bosnia, fighting abated. This winter, it may escalate as Muslims, Serbs and Croats anticipate the U.N.'s withdrawal and the possibility of capturing equipment left behind. In the last week peacekeepers have been de facto hostages of both Muslims and Serbs, while European governments insist that they will pull their troops out of Bosnia if the fighting escalates.
And what happens if the U.N. leaves Bosnia? Humanitarian aid will end. The Serbs will shut down Sarajevo. There will be no passage by road in or out; no electricity, no gas, no water. There will be violent shelling. The Serbs will no doubt grab all of eastern Bosnia and what's left of the Bihac pocket. The Muslims can maintain a stronghold in central Bosnia, but if they ever seriously threaten Serb-held areas, Bosnian Serbs can rely on allies in Serbia and Croatia to back them up.
If the U.N. pulls out, my guess is that the Muslims will surrender within six months, with less land than they have now. Bosnia would disappear, carved up between Serbia and Croatia. This scenario might improve somewhat if the Muslims got outside help, but the Bosnian Serbs would find benefactors, too. Jingoistic Russian legislators, for example, have said that Russia will arm the Serbs if the arms embargo on Bosnia is lifted. The Muslims, in short, have no winning strategy. Like it or not, they are looking at the war's endgame.
Before the Muslims' recent devastating setbacks, there was reason to believe that the Bosnian Serbs were ready to sign a deal -- one quite close to the plan the five-nation "contact group" proposed this summer. Although senior Clinton Administration officials dismissed this possibility, conversations I have had over the last two months with diplomats close to the negotiations have convinced me of the Serbs' genuine desire to end the fighting.
The Serbs' recent successes have shifted the terms in their favor, but their interests in a settlement remain the same. They don't want all of Bosnia; they know they couldn't control it. And they want to support the efforts of the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, to get international economic sanctions lifted from Serbia and Montenegro.
The Bosnian Serbs flatly refused the contact group plan for several reasons. They want to keep their northern corridor connecting Serb-held territory in eastern and western Bosnia at its current two-and-a-half mile width, rather than narrow it to one-and-a-half miles as the plan provides. As a military calculation, that logic is reasonable. They would trade Muslim-held land in eastern Bosnia, which the plan leaves with the Muslims, for Serb-held land around Sarajevo. The exchange carries both advantages and drawbacks for the Muslims, but also seems negotiable. The Serbs want most of the Bihac pocket; thanks to Sarajevo's intemperate, failed offensive, they are taking it.
Finally, they want the same rights of confederation with Serbia that the Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation enjoys with Croatia, a proposal that now seems to be on the table. Outsiders should note: the U.S.-brokered constitution of the Muslim-Croat federation gives no explicit rights to Serbs living in federation territory, whereas it does explicitly protect Muslims and Croats. (American officials privately admit that the arrangement was too hastily put together, and they are working to fix the problem.)
Uncritical condemnation of the Serbs and uncritical support for the Bosnian Muslims must be re-examined. Much has changed since the outbreak of violence in Yugoslavia in July 1991. What was once a clear-cut war of aggression -- some call it genocide -- gradually turned into the civil war many incorrectly thought it always was. What was once a genuinely multiethnic and legitimately elected Bosnian Government turned into a hard-line, anti-democratic Muslim entity.
Now we find ethnic cleansing by Muslims alongside that of the Serbs, and the senseless determination of President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia to wage war against his longtime rival, Fikret Abdic, the dissident Muslim leader of northwestern Bosnia, thus shattering the one region spared from earlier fighting.
It's all understandable, but it isn't right. In August 1992, when I resigned from the State Department, I said the West had a brief window of opportunity to intervene. Well, it shut a long time ago.
The clique of nationalist politicians around President Izetbegovic -- particularly hard-liners like Ejup Ganic, the Vice President -- don't want to admit that they will never govern all of the former Bosnia, because doing so raises questions about their legitimacy. Nor can they clearly explain what is to be gained by further fighting. These men -- inexperienced, corrupt, unable to fathom international politics -- hardly warrant U.S. support in a civil war that would destroy their country in order to save it.
I don't believe morality has an existential reality independent from the world: arguing that we must lift the arms embargo so the Muslims can defend themselves ignores the brutal consequences of arming them. In Bosnia, we have to recognize that the good is the enemy of the least bad, however tragic that may be. If there is anything to be salvaged from this debacle, Mr. Clinton must work more closely with the Europeans, not against them.

HEADLINE: SENATE APPROVES PACT TO EASE TRADE CURBS; A VICTORY FOR CLINTON

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
The Senate tonight approved American participation in the most ambitious global trade accord reached in four decades.
Approval of the 124-nation pact, by a far wider margin than expected, ended a dozen years of negotiations over the lowering of tariffs and the creation of the World Trade Organization, a new international body designed to police commerce among nations. 
 After two days of heated Senate debate, the broad expansion of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, passed by a wide margin, 76 to 24. Earlier in the evening, a crucial procedural vote to waive Senate rules against any bill that adds to the Federal deficit passed 68 to 32, eight votes more than necessary. The trade accord will cost several billion dollars in tariff revenues.
The House of Representatives approved the agreement on Tuesday by an even wider margin, 288 to 146.
Final passage of the accord, nearly a year after the world's trading nations initialed it, was the last action of the 103d Congress and the last business before Republicans take over both houses of Congress next month.
The passage of the pact also is a major victory for the Clinton Administration, building on the narrow margin by which the North American Free Trade Agreement passed last year. Since January the White House and the nation's biggest businesses and agricultural groups have pressed for the accord, warning that its defeat would jeopardize America's efforts to lead the world economically at a time when the nation's military power is diminishing in importance.
The Reagan Administration started negotiations on the accord, and it was supported by former President George Bush as well.
Appearing on the South Lawn tonight with Congressional leaders, including Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas and the incoming Senate majority leader, President Clinton went out of his way to praise Republican leaders for saving the accord. He called the vote "a bipartisan victory that really, really gives our country the boost we need to keep moving forward toward the 21st century to create more high-wage jobs for the American people."
"We said loud and clear that America will continue to lead the world to a more prosperous and secure place after the Cold War," he said. "Let's make the GATT vote the first vote of a new era of cooperation."
The outgoing Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington, who was defeated in the Republican landslide last month, declared that the much-criticized 103d Congress was "the most important congress in trade liberalization in decades."
GATT's supporters acknowledged that the pact falls far short of heralding an era of free trade. It fails to address many trade issues crucial to American business, including trade in most financial services.
"But we should not measure this trade agreement against a perfect and unrealizable ideal," Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the retiring majority leader, said in his last appearance in the well of the Senate. "These are the only trade partners we have. We don't trade with Mars; we don't trade with the moon; we don't trade with countries made in heaven."
Senator Dole sealed the pact's fate last week when he reached a compromise with President Clinton on a mechanism to involve Congress in abandoning the agreement if the new World Trade Organization acts unreasonably in actions against the United States. But today, Mr. Dole sounded like one of the pact's biggest supporters.
"Let's face it," he told his colleagues. "We're the big beneficiaries, the United States of America, any way you cut it."
Congress' action, taken in a lame-duck session called to approve the accord, clears the way for America's largest trading partners, including Japan and the European Union, to take similar actions in the coming weeks. They have refused to consider the agreement -- and to endure the wrath of their farmers and manufacturers who will be hurt by the gradual phasing out of many protections -- until Washington acted.
In the end, the United States, which had pressed harder than any nation for the accord, threatened to become the greatest obstacle to its adoption. An alliance of consumer groups, environmentalists and conservatives mounted a major campaign against the accord, arguing that the World Trade Organization would become an all-powerful bureaucracy, able to undercut American sovereignty by allowing panels of foreign judges to rule on whether Federal and state laws constituted impediments to trade.
Their arguments found an audience in recent weeks as callers flooded talk shows, saying that the issue should wait until the newly elected Congress could deal with it. Some callers were inspired by Ross Perot, Patrick J. Buchanan and Ralph Nader, all of whom called for the accord's defeat.
Such objections led many Democrats and Republicans to abandon their leaders on the vote, arguing that American workers would be undercut by more imports from countries that pay a fraction of American wages, and that the United States was signing away its sovereignty to the new trade organization without understanding the true scope of that organization's powers.
Thus, Senator James Jeffords, a moderate Republican from Vermont, declared from the Senate floor early this afternoon that while free trade was an admirable goal, it was not worth threatening the livelihood of his state's dairy farmers. "All protection for dairy farmers is eliminated," Mr. Jeffords argued. "We cannot abandon the American farmer."
In fact, the changes for most farmers will be gradual, and more will benefit than be harmed.
Until yesterday, it was unclear whether the Administration could garner sufficient votes, and as late as this morning President Clinton was cajoling wavering Senators over breakfast.
Under the accord approved tonight, tariffs around the world will be reduced by more than $700 billion over the next decade. Those cuts include ones relating to farm products, which raises an issue so politically sensitive in almost every nation that it was never covered in past trade agreements. New protections are afforded to intellectual property, including patents and copyrights.
In both chambers of Congress, the debate has really been over two differing views of the American economy: linking the future to exporting to developing markets in Latin America and Asia or nurturing traditional American industries and stemming the loss of jobs to foreign lands.Which members of Congress hold those views had more to do with where they come from than their party.

Chart: "HIGHLIGHTS: The New Trade Pact"
 
CREATES A NEW TRADE OFGANIZATION -- The agreement will replace the 47-year old GATT organization with a new umbrella group, knownas the WTO, with the power to enforce the new trade accordand assess trade penalties against nations that violate the accord. The United States has pressed for greater enforcement power for years, but in recent months environmentalists, comsumer advocates and conservatives have charged that the WTO's panels of foreign judges could order changes in American law. Congress or the states would have to enact those changes, however, and any country can withdraw from the WTO with six months notice.
 
REDUCES TARIFFS -- All countries have agreed to reduce their tariffs by an average of one third. Agricultural tariffs are included in the agreement for the first time since the initial GATT round in 1948. Because American tariffs are already relatively low, other nations will be forced to reduce their taxes more dramatically than the United States will, when measured in dollar terms. The Clinton Administration estimates that the tariff reductions will amount to $744 billion.
 
ELIMINATES QUOTAS -- The agreement bars countries from placing limitson the quantity of imports. Japan, for example, will have to end its ban on rice imports; the United States will have to end its quotas on peanuts, dairy products, sugar, textiles and apparell. The quotas will be replaced with tariffs, which will be reduced gradually over a number of years. The agreement also bans the widespreadpractice of requiring high local content for products like cars.
 
PROTECTS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY -- For the first time, the new world trade accord requires all signatories to protect patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks, which Washington hopes will curb piracy of movies, compact disks, computer software and presecription drugs.
 
ISSUES NOT ADDRESSED -- There was no agreement on limiting government subsidies to civil aircraft makers, on distributing movies, music and other cultural products in Europe, or on opening markets to most financial services. Shipping, steel and telecommunications are also largely exempted. (pg. A22)

HEADLINE: Mexican, Taking Office, Pledges To Fight Poverty and Corruption

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, a politically inexperienced economist thrust by tragedy into the leadership of Mexico's long-governing party, took office as President today, promising a new fight against poverty, "definitive" steps to democracy and sweeping changes in the corrupt justice system.
"Many have not benefited from the fruits of progress," Mr. Zedillo, 42, said in an inaugural address that was filled with implicit criticism of the previous administration's failings. "Now that we are able to build a more prosperous Mexico, we must -- and can -- make it a more just Mexico." 
 Standing before a vast audience of politicians and foreign dignitaries in the lower chamber of the congress, Mr. Zedillo paid a warm but brief tribute to his predecessor and political mentor, Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Then he immediately recalled the assassination that turned him from novice campaign manager into candidate.
Acknowledging widespread dissatisfaction with the Government's investigations into the murders of the governing party's first presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, and another party leader, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, Mr. Zedillo pledged to "significantly intensify" efforts to solve them.
He also held out a conciliatory hand to peasant rebels in the southern state of Chiapas who have vowed to prevent the scheduled inauguration next week of a ruling-party Governor whose election they maintain was fraudulent.
Reiterating his call for new peace talks with the rebels, Mr. Zedillo said the Government troops surrounding them would not break the cease-fire that has held since Jan. 12. But he also signaled that he would reject demands for new elections in Chiapas, insisting that the law must be upheld.
Underscoring the conflicts left unresolved by Mr. Zedillo's easy victory in the Aug. 21 election, dozens of people were reported injured this afternoon when left-wing protesters hurling bottles and stones set on riot policemen blocking their way to the central square where Mr. Zedillo was greeting well-wishers after being sworn in. A police car and a truck bearing advertising for the governing party were set on fire by protesters.
For the most part, however, the occasion was yet another lavish exercise in renewal for the party that has dominated Mexican political life since its founding in 1929.
The green, white and red that have blended the identity of the Institutional Revolutionary Party with that of the state were everywhere in the colonial heart of the city. Companies of soldiers in long coats and busbies goose-stepped around the central plaza.
The inaugural drew heads of state from throughout Latin America, including Presidents Fidel Castro of Cuba, Alberto Fujimori of Peru and Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina. Vice President Al Gore headed the delegation from the United States.
Mr. Zedillo's chest swelled beneath his new sash as he looked on from a balcony of the National Palace. The bespectacled, sometimes awkward, technocrat of the campaign seemed to begin giving way to the kind of commanding political presence that Mexican presidents have usually attained.
Among the many doubts that have been raised about Mr. Zedillo's ability to lead a country racked by social tensions and political turmoil, the questions of his authority and skill as a politician remain central. Despite the enormous challenge Mexico faces in creating millions of new jobs, revitalizing small and medium-sized businesses and sharing its wealth more equitably, his abilities as an economist have gone virtually unquestioned. Mr. Zedillo, who received a doctorate from Yale University, served in the last administration as Minister of Planning and Budget and of Education.
Members of Mr. Zedillo's own, deeply divided party have worried that he will never wield the extraordinary power that Mr. Salinas consolidated in the name of change.
But throughout a campaign largely focused on the authoritarian practices rooted in Mexico's one-party past, opposition leaders clamored for a greater balance among governmental powers, and Mr. Zedillo embraced the idea as his own.
Today he repeated his campaign vows to end the Government's traditional support for the Institutional Revolutionary Party, to cede budgetary oversight powers to the legislature, and to allow greater autonomy to state and municipal governments, which were long treated as executive pawns. He said again "emphatically" that he would renounce the traditional prerogative of the President of running his party and choosing its candidates for high office.
In describing a "definitive reform" of the political system, Mr. Zedillo said it must address a series of issues that he had only a few months ago described as settled: regulations on political party financing and campaign expenditures, fair access to the news media for all parties and fuller autonomy for electoral authorities.
"Mexico demands a reform which, based on the broadest political consensus, will eradicate the suspicion, recrimination and distrust that mar the electoral process," he said.
"Electoral democracy can no longer be at the core of the political debate or the cause of dispute or division," he went on. "We must resolve, in keeping with the most advanced practices worldwide, each and every one of the issues still causing dissatisfaction in terms of democracy."
Mr. Zedillo was not specific in his prescriptions for the country's final democratization, and the Government's critics were quick to note that the promises, the optimism and the sincerity of a new administration all rang familiar.
"He has good aims, and there are commitments there that are significant, but we have heard speeches like this before and they have disappeared into the air," Jesus Ortega, a leading congressman from the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party, said in an interview today.
Like other opposition leaders, however, he noted a different tone. Throughout most of his administration, Mr. Salinas often sought to flatten the leftists who questioned his legitimacy. Mr. Zedillo has moved quickly to take a different approach.
Last Thursday, he met with Mr. Ortega and other members of his party. Where Mr. Salinas filled many key posts with figures of the ruling party's old guard, Mr. Zedillo named a young congressman from the right-of-center National Action Party, Antonio Lozano, as his Attorney General.

HEADLINE: Clinton to Ask Billions More In Spending for the Military

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Trying to quiet Republican criticism that the military is underfinanced, President Clinton held a Rose Garden ceremony today to announce that he would seek a $25 billion increase in military spending over the next six years.
With Defense Secretary William J. Perry and the Joint Chiefs of Staff at his side, Mr. Clinton outlined plans to improve readiness and to support military personnel. Among the purposes of the new money, he said, will be the troops' annual cost-of-living pay increases that Congress has already authorized into the next century. 
 In addition to that $25 billion, Mr. Clinton said, he will ask Congress for an emergency increase in this fiscal year's Pentagon budget to help cover the costs of operations in Haiti, in Kuwait, in Bosnia and off the Cuban coast. Administration officials said later that this emergency request would total about $2 billion.
Senior Administration officials said Mr. Clinton's plan was recognition of a need to improve the readiness and the quality of life of military forces, which have been stretched so thin that the Pentagon last month conceded that 3 of 12 Army divisions were not at peak readiness levels.
But the Administration officials also acknowledged that the timing and the staging of today's event reflected a view that Mr. Clinton must do more to head off what has been a strong line of Republican attack: that cuts in military spending since he took office almost two years ago have left American forces incapable of carrying out their declared mission of fighting two major conflicts at once.
"We ask much of our military," the President said in presenting his initiative, "and we owe much to them."
Republican Congressional leaders described the plan as a welcome and important first step. Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican who is among his party's most influential figures in military matters, called it "the first sign of recognition on the part of this Administration that this nation's military readiness and ability to defend its vital national interests in the world is in question."
But Senator McCain and his fellow Republicans said the initiative was insufficient to heal what they called deep wounds in American military might. They said they would fight to halt the decline in the Pentagon budget, which has plunged to $252 billion a year from $281 billion since Mr. Clinton took office and would decline further, even under the President's new plan, before spending rises again later in the decade.
"This is a hemorrhage that needs a tourniquet," said Senator Robert C. Smith, a New Hampshire Republican who is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, "and the President is offering a Band-Aid."
The $25 billion in new spending that Mr. Clinton called for today would not reverse the current decline in the military budget until the 1998 fiscal year, a turnaround point he had previously set. It would postpone its largest budget increases until the turn of the century, and over the next four years would provide only $2.5 billion a year -- about 1 percent of the Pentagon budget -- over existing plans for military spending.
At a White House briefing after the announcement, Deputy Defense Secretary John Deutch pronounced the plan sufficient to allow the Pentagon to close a budget shortfall that had threatened to force deep cuts in weapons systems.
But Republicans immediately questioned Mr. Deutch's arithmetic. They said that even if his assumptions of low inflation were correct, and even given weapons systems cuts that he said still lay ahead, it would be impossible to make up a budget gap that the Administration estimates will total $48 billion over the next six years.
"We have a readiness problem now, and we will have a readiness problem after the President's initiative is implemented," said Representative Floyd D. Spence, the South Carolina Republican who is preparing to become chairman of the House Armed Services Committee in the new Congress.
A promise to restore military spending is a central feature of House Republicans' "Contract With America," which they have pledged to carry out once they take control next month. Representative Newt Gingrich, set to become Speaker of the House, has led a chorus of Republican attacks accusing Mr. Clinton of cutting military spending too deeply.
But Mr. Clinton, who has sought for the last two years to hold the line against the deeper military cuts sought by some Democrats, said today that it was "not right" to see his request for an increase in spending as an acknowledgement that his critics were correct.
"We have seen the military, frankly, have to deal with an amazing number and variety of unanticipated challenges," he said. "They have done so with great skill, but now they need the support that I think we ought to give them."

HEADLINE: Derivatives Loss Jolts Stocks; Dow Off 38.36

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Stock prices, already falling because of gnawing inflation fears, were staggered yesterday by a surprise -- that a wealthy Southern California county was facing a loss of $1.5 billion, in part because of buying risky investments known as derivatives.
The loss by Orange County, Calif., is the largest attributed to derivatives by an institutional investor this year. The disclosure hurt Merrill Lynch & Company, the nation's largest securities firm, in particular, because it has dealings with Orange County. 
 Stock traders spread rumors, denied by Merrill Lynch, that the brokerage house had itself lost more than $1 billion in related actions, such as a stock margin call or a derivative linked to municipal bonds. Merrill Lynch stock dropped 1 1/2, to 36 1/2, in unusually heavy trading of 1.8 million shares.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 38.36 points, or 1.03 percent, to 3,700.87. The broader stock indexes fell, too, with the Standard & Poor's 500 dropping 1.05 percent and the Nasdaq composite index falling 1.29 percent.
"Orange County was the straw that broke the camel's back today," said Harrison Roth, senior options strategist for Cowen & Company. "Tomorrow might bring an even bigger straw."
The Orange County news weakened prices in advance of today's closely watched employment figures, which traders use to guide their decisions on buying or selling stocks and bonds. "As I tell all my traders," said Anthony P. Conroy, managing director in charge of trading at Mabon Securities, "those are the most important numbers this week."
Traders use derivatives to bet on the performance of indexes or other investments, including stocks, bonds, options and loan swaps. The derivatives are used to mitigate, and sometimes profit from, swings in interest rates or other shifts in market conditions.
But because of derivatives' complexity, and the occasional use of huge sums of borrowed money, large losses can also occur. Some corporate clients have lost millions of dollars and sued brokerage houses that arranged the investments for them.
Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange, which had been quiet for most of the day, spiked in the last 15 minutes, as traders struggled to assess the implications of the loss by Orange County, the fifth-largest county in the country, with more than 2.4 million people.
By day's end, however, volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 288.3 million, about equal to the daily average for the year.
On the Big Board, two stocks fell for every stock that rose, with 1,553 issues declining and 692 gaining. Only 9 stocks established new highs, while 126 established new lows.
The market had been flat for much of the week, but began to turn down yesterday morning, with reports from the Commerce Department that Americans' incomes as well as personal spending had risen. Such reports suggest a potential for inflation that could lead to the Federal Reserve's raising interest rates, which in turn could hurt stocks and bonds.
At 12.4 million shares, Intel was the most active stock yesterday, declining 1/2, to 62 5/8, on traders' continuing concerns that the company may have to recall millions of flawed Pentium computer chips. In addition, stocks of many computer makers that use the chip in their machines were dragged down, a development that hurt the Nasdaq averages. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 9.71, to 740.61.
Then, when Orange County officials said about 2 P.M. Eastern time that they planned a statement by day's end disclosing their losses, the stock market turned down in earnest.
Along with the 38-point fall in the Dow, the broader Standard & Poor's 500 fell 4.77, to 448.92.
Best Buy, an electronics retailer, was one of the sharpest decliners yesterday, with shares dropping 11 3/8 to 32 7/8 after it predicted weaker-than-expected profits. J. C. Penney, the department store chain, established a 52-week low of 41 7/8 before closing at 42 1/2, down 3 1/2, also on traders' worries about its retail sales prospects.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.37 points to 246.04 and the American Stock Exchange market value index dropped 2.67 points to 431.19.
Of the Dow industrials' 30 component stocks, 23 fell, led by International Paper, which lost 1 3/8 to 70 1/8. Of the S.& P. 500's component stocks, 365 fell, led by Wal-Mart, which dropped 3/4, to 22 1/2.

HEADLINE: Paris Meeting Backs U.N. Program to Combat AIDS

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Recognizing that the global fight against AIDS has so far been largely ineffective, 42 countries pledged today to throw their political weight behind a new United Nations program to step up prevention campaigns and to fight discrimination against victims of the disease.
At a so-called AIDS summit meeting on World AIDS Day, a dozen prime ministers and other senior officials also agreed to work more closely with AIDS victims and carriers of the human immunodeficiency virus. Those who are infected often say their opinions and experience are ignored. 
 Yolanda Simon, an H.I.V. carrier from the Caribbean, told delegates today: "We're tired of the lip service we feel you have been paying to our communities. Why must there always be confrontation between us? Why not work in a spirit of partnership?"
Outside the conference hall, there were also signs of skepticism that today's meeting could make much difference. About 50 members of the militant group Act Up blocked traffic along the Champs-Elysees this morning to protest the gathering.
But the chief American delegate, Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, said the meeting had placed the AIDS crisis "higher on the world agenda." She added: "We're talking about a whole new partnership with non-governmental organizations and with people with AIDS."
In her address, she stressed that fundamental human rights were at stake. "The battle against AIDS is also a battle against racism, sexism and homophobia," she said. "As leaders, we must fight to protect the rights of people with H.I.V. and AIDS while we fight against the virus that is killing them."
Richard Burzynski of the International Council of AIDS Service Organizations, who also spoke today, denounced laws denying H.I.V. carriers the freedom to cross borders.
"This means that laws which criminalize or discriminate against homosexuals, drug users, migrants, refugees and sex workers must be abolished," he said.
This position was echoed in a final declaration that emphasized the rights of those with AIDS to health care, employment, education, travel, housing and social welfare.
The United States is among a score of countries that restrict the entry of AIDS victims or carriers of H.I.V. Inaugurating today's meeting, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur of France said, "It would be an illusion to think that certain countries can protect themselves alone by closing their borders."
Prominent in the plan adopted today was recognition of the special vulnerability of women to AIDS and the need to eliminate social, economic and cultural factors weakening prevention programs. "The pandemic is now spreading faster among women," warned Hiroshi Nakajima, Director General of the World Health Organization.
The main thrust of today's declaration, though, was for governments to recognize their responsibility to fight AIDS and to work more closely with one another and with a new United Nations program that aims to coordinate the activities of all international bodies.
But in a pessimistic review of efforts to date, the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, asked, "Why has our mobilization against AIDS borne so little fruit?" All too often, he said, there has been no linkage between global and national strategies, and at times there has even been rivalry.
"Given this situation, it is essential that we rethink our action and improve our coordination," he said.
Noting that 17 million people have so far been infected by H.I.V., he said that "the poorest people in the poorest countries" were the natural targets, with 70 percent of the infected people living in sub-Saharan Africa. "There is thus an obvious correlation between AIDS and underdevelopment," he added.

HEADLINE: Cuban Exiles Raise Cash To Resettle New Refugees

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Frustrated over Government delays in releasing Cuban refugee families held in detention camps at the Guantanamo naval base in Cuba and in Panama, Cuban exile groups are getting pledges to privately finance the transportation and resettlement of about 8,000 refugees in this country.
The money would also pay for schooling for more than 2,000 children. 
 Representatives of an ad hoc committee that has been pressing the Clinton Administration to release the families said they undertook the effort because they feared that costs of illegal immigration in Florida and an anti-immigrant mood in the country have delayed for weeks a Federal announcement on when the refugees could come to the United States. That announcement is now scheduled for Friday by Justice Department officials, an Administration official said.
"They're very generous," the official said of the Cuban-Americans' offer to underwrite the relocation. But the official added, "This is not going to turn on whether it's a burden to the state, but on humanitarian concerns."
But the cost factor has been an issue for Gov. Lawton Chiles, who has sued the Federal Government to get it to pay expenses associated with illegal immigration into Florida. Mr. Chiles ran for re-election, and won, stressing his success in keeping more than 30,000 Cuban refugees away from Florida last fall.
To appease the Governor and Federal officials worried about anti-immigrant sentiment elsewhere, Cubans in South Florida have been lining up help in the past few weeks to avoid a drain on public money.
They said they already had commitments from private institutions, corporations and individuals to cover at least half of the estimated $15 million needed to relocate the refugees. The pledges include free flights from a volunteer aviator group, scholarships from Christian schools and about 9,000 sponsors willing to take in families and guarantee that they will not become a public charge for at least a year.
The Cuban refugees have been held in detention camps since last August, when the Administration ordered their interception after thousands set out in boats and rafts for the United States because of worsening economic conditions in Cuba. The detentions marked the reversal of longstanding American policy of granting entry to refugees fleeing the Communist Government of Fidel Castro.
Although Cubans in the United States have always played a major role in the economic assimilation of each new wave of immigrants from Cuba, the plans for the Guantanamo refugees are the most ambitious and broad-based to date. That they even tried, some experts in Cuban affairs say, attests to the exile community's organizational and financial capacity, and its impatience with American policy on Cuba.
"It's almost an embarrassment for the Cuban community that Castro and divided families continue to be a major public policy issue," said Mark B. Rosenberg, acting dean of the College of Urban and Public Affairs at Florida International University. "The result is that the community tries to come up with its own solutions."
Last month Administration officials said they were leaning toward releasing the families on the ground that keeping children in Guantanamo for months was inhumane.
On Friday, Justice Department officials are expected to list the conditions under which the families would be granted entry. An Administration official said humanitarian need, as measured by the age and health of the child, among other things, would be determined case by case before anyone was allowed in.
Administration officials said the decision on the Cuban families was an expansion of a policy announced in October to allow the humanitarian parole into the United States of unaccompanied children under 18 in the detention camps, as well as the elderly and those with urgent medical needs. Already, more than 400 Cubans have been flown in and relocated by voluntary relief agencies under this policy.
Francisco Hernandez, president of the Cuban-American National Foundation, said the ad hoc committee lobbying for the release of the families has secured pledges to help pay for about $2.5 million in transportation costs and about $12 million for initial resettlement costs, including education, health insurance, food and housing.
Mr. Hernandez said about 9,000 people, mostly relatives or friends of the refugees, have applied with the foundation to sponsor the families. About 30 percent of them are expected to move to Cuban communities in New Jersey, New York, California and other states.
Most contributions are needed in Miami, which even Cubans who settle elsewhere eventually choose as their permanent home. Tom Willey, the South Florida director of World Relief, a service arm of the National Association of Evangelicals, said the agency was urging Christian schools in the Miami area to donate scholarships.
Mr. Willey said that one school had already agreed to take five students, and that he expected many others to follow suit.
The volunteer search-and-rescue group Brothers to the Rescue has committed its donations to fly the children in. Little Havana Activities and Nutrition Centers of Dade County, which finds jobs for immigrants in the health care and service industries, says it believes it can place most of the refugees.
Interest in helping the refugees has also come from commercial carriers like United Airlines and from the newspaper El Nuevo Herald and Roman Catholic schools, Mr. Hernandez said.
He also said his group had offered to pay for the 1,500 Haitian children who are being held in detention camps in Guantanamo. A Federal judge ruled last month that these children should be allowed into the United States in the same way that Cuban children are, but the Government has appealed that decision.
"Our purpose is to show that this is something that can be done," Mr. Hernandez said. "We're prepared to hold their hand for a year or a year and a half."
A spokesman for Mr. Chiles said the Governor had insisted that families be allowed entry only on four conditions -- that they also resettle in other states, that they have sponsors, that the Federal Government take full financial responsibility for them and that the group is counted against the 20,000 visas the United States has agreed to grant annually to Cubans who want to come to this country.

HEADLINE: 11-Year Sentence for Chief of Failed S.& L.

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Dec. 1

 BODY:
David L. Paul, chairman of the failed Centrust Bank, was sentenced today to 11 years in prison and ordered to pay $65 million for his part in the $1.7 billion collapse of the savings and loan institution.
Mr. Paul, 55, was convicted of 97 counts of racketeering and fraud in connection with the 1990 failure of Centrust, the fourth-biggest banking collapse in United States history. 
 The prosecution had recommended that Mr. Paul serve 17 to 22 years in prison, and the defense proposed a three-year sentence.
Judge Donald Graham of Federal District Court split the difference, citing Mr. Paul's abuse of trust, his central role and planning in the crimes, and the jeopardy to Centrust's financial soundness that his actions caused.
Although prosecutors strongly disagreed, Mr. Graham also concluded that Mr. Paul had accepted responsibility for his crimes, despite expressing concerns earlier in the day about Mr. Paul's attitude.
Along with the prison sentence, Mr. Paul was ordered to pay $60 million in restitution and a $5 million fine. He must report to prison in 30 days and wear an electronic monitoring bracelet until then.
Whether Mr. Paul can pay his restitution and fines is in doubt. After the bank's collapse, Mr. Paul pleaded poverty and his wife has filed for bankruptcy protection.
Regulators had attacked Centrust's extravagant spending on artwork and other luxuries.
Mr. Paul showed no reaction as he was sentenced. But later he said: "You take each day in stride. Right now I'm taking each day in stride."
His lawyer, Benson Weintraub, said, "I do think the sentence was excessive, but it was a very difficult sentencing decision for the judge,".
The prosecutor, Allan Sullivan, said after the sentencing that Mr. Paul "believes in his heart that he is an innocent man."
Judge Graham tentatively set a dollar loss of $62 million from the crimes committed in the 1980's when Mr. Paul was running Centrust, the biggest savings and loan in the Southeast, and hobnobbing with celebrities and politicians. The amount is the starting point for determining the length of a prison term in fraud cases.
The defense says the bank had $938 million in revenue when it was seized in 1990, while the prosecution has calculated a $371 million loss on junk bonds that were sold by regulators after the bank failed.

HEADLINE: Ex-Television Evangelist Bakker Ends Prison Sentence for Fraud

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HENDERSONVILLE, N.C., Dec. 1

 BODY:
Five years and two months after he went to prison for bilking thousands of contributors to his PTL ministry, Jim Bakker, the former television evangelist, became a free man today.
But Mr. Bakker, now 54 and divorced from his wife of 30 years, Tammy Faye, stayed out of sight in the modest ranch-style house he has been renting for the past three months while under house arrest. 
 He has refused all requests for interviews. On Tuesday he called the sheriff to have television camera crews removed from his property on the outskirts of this Blue Ridge city of 7,380 people.
"He's waited five years to gain his freedom," said Chris Nichols, a lawyer whose firm represents Mr. Bakker, "and a few extra days of waiting in the house for the press to leave won't hurt him."
A statement released by James H. Toms, a close friend and also a lawyer for Mr. Bakker, only hinted at the future. "Jim looks forward to rebuilding his life and being of useful service to others," it said. "He will remain in western North Carolina."
Friends who have spoken to Mr. Bakker in the last few days said he was overjoyed about his new status. He must still report periodically to probation officials.
Some friends said he was working on a book about his life. Others said they were urging him to return to the ministry in some form, even though he is barred by the terms of his sentence from conducting a ministry on television.
Mr. Bakker has reportedly told these friends that prison has been a humbling experience, one that has given him insights he wants to share.
Some who say they were victims of Mr. Bakker's excesses in his ministry are feeling charitable now.
"I was hurt like many others -- beside myself with anger and dismay," said Don Edwards Jr., a resident of Heritage USA, the 2,300-acre Christian-oriented retreat and entertainment complex in Fort Mill, S.C. Mr. Edwards became president of PTL Ministries after Mr. Bakker found himself facing Federal fraud charges.
"But I have healed," Mr. Edwards added. "He is most welcome in our home any time."
Others have found it harder to forgive. "It's a shame that anybody who took millions of people's savings should get off so easy," said Charlie Truax, 68, a retired postal worker. "I don't think he has paid his debt to society."
Mr. Bakker was convicted in 1989 of 24 counts of mail and wire fraud in bilking 116,000 supporters of $158 million they had contributed to buy shares Heritage USA.
Adding to the financial collapse of the ministry was the shock of the disclosure that Mr. Bakker had a sexual encounter with a church secretary, Jessica Hahn, and had diverted some $265,000 of church money to buy her silence.
Mr. Bakker was originally sentenced to 45 years and fined $500,000, but an appeals court reduced that sentence twice, first to 18 years and then to 8 years.
Many people here are still skeptical about Mr. Bakker.
Rebecca Castroman, a hostess at the Po'Folks Restaurant, recalled the Bakkers in their heyday, when they stopped here while traveling to one of their vacation homes in Tennessee and posed with big smiles for a photograph in the local newspaper while standing in front of their Lincoln Continental under a sign that blazed "Po'Folks.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Ebb; Buyers Await Data on Jobs

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were slightly lower yesterday in moderate trading, in advance of the important monthly employment report due today.
The benchmark 30-year bond fell 6/32 , to 946/32 , which pushed up its yield to 8.01 percent from 8 percent on Wednesday. Rates for shorter-maturity bills also increased as prices, which move in the opposite direction, were lower. 
 The market limited its losses despite a barrage of data showing strong economic growth -- the sort of news that has depressed bond prices out of fear of inflation. The reports were all close to expectations, and many traders awaited today's November employment figures.
Manufacturers reported brisk growth and higher prices last month, spurring concern that interest rates would go up. But sales reported by the nation's big retail chains were considered somewhat disappointing.
Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said yesterday's data showed that the economy was continuing to grow more strongly than desired "and put more pressure on the Fed to firm policy further."
She said she expected the Federal Reserve to next raise short-term interest rates at the Jan. 31 meeting of its rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, but she did not rule out an increase at the committee's Dec. 20 meeting.
Other data released yesterday included October construction spending, up nine-tenths of 1 percent, which was higher than expected. But strong October personal income and spending, and weekly jobless claims, had only moderate effects on the market. The weekly jobless claims fell to 317,000 for the week ending Nov. 26, compared with 329,000 for the previous week. Separately, the Conference Board said its help-wanted advertising index rose in October, suggesting that the demand for new workers had not slowed.
An increase in manufacturing, as seen in a survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management, underscored previous strong momentum in that area. The association's index rose for the 15th consecutive month to its highest level in 10 years. The gains were led by new orders and production, with employment edging up slightly.
Construction activity outpaced expectations in both September and October. But a rapid shift in construction activity, from housing to commercial and public building, is likely to have a negative effect on the fourth quarter's gross domestic product and probably on that in the first quarter of 1995, too. Some economists foresee that residential construction will fall at a 9 percent rate in the fourth quarter, while commercial construction surges 16 percent and state and local government spending remains strong.
But the most eye-catching news yesterday, traders said, was the surge in the Conference Board's help-wanted index for October, up 11 points to 128. The strength of the report stoked fears of a stronger-than-predicted employment report today.
Ms. Schaja said she expected the nonfarm payroll to show an increase of 250,000, with unemployment unchanged at 5.8 percent.
Also weighing on prices early yesterday were comments by the president of Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Cathy E. Minehan, who said on a Boston radio program that a tight labor market could spur inflation and that the economy was showing "very strong growth." Ms. Minehan is to become a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee at the January meeting.
Among traders in the corporate bond market, the reaction was similar to those dealing in Treasury securities -- a refusal to succumb to the stronger-than-expected consumption and personal-income data. October's income data indicated rises in both salaries and hourly wages.
Prices of municipal securities were little changed as investors vied for a limited quantity with relatively higher yields.
Last month, states, localities and agencies sold $12.1 billion in new securities, including negotiated and competitive ones, according to Bloomberg Business News.
The total amount of debt sold in November was slightly higher than in October, with $7.1 billion of municipal issues sold by negotiations with underwriters and $4.996 billion through competitive bidding.

HEADLINE: Pataki Warns Of Painful Cuts In State Aid To Close Deficit

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Governor-elect George E. Pataki said today that closing a projected $5 billion budget deficit while keeping his campaign pledge to cut taxes would involve more pain than he expected, and he suggested that to do it, he might have to break another campaign pledge: protecting state aid to local schools and governments.
On a day in which he was either meeting with jubilant Republican lawmakers or hunkering down with budget advisers, Mr. Pataki repeatedly said that he "had ruled out nothing" to close next year's projected deficit, except raising taxes. He said his options included laying off workers, consolidating agencies, slashing welfare and freezing or cutting state aid to schools and local governments. 
 During the campaign, Mr. Pataki, a Republican, said he could pay for his plan to cut state income tax rates by 25 percent over four years without laying off state employees. He also said that he wanted to safeguard aid to local schools and governments. "I would like to see education aid increase," he said on Oct. 3.
Today, that position shifted sharply. Mr. Pataki said he had won a mandate from voters not only to cut taxes, but also to cut spending.
"Until we have the courage and the commitment to take the action necessary to not just solve one year's problems but to break that structural imbalance, we'll have this problem," he said. "We want to take actions in 1995 that, for once and for all, control the spending that has been the problem for this state government."
Mr. Pataki began his day in the capital with an hourlong meeting with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, their first face-to-face session since the election. During the campaign, the two men did not debate, never crossed paths and essentially limited their dialogue to acrid exchanges via spokespersons.
But today, they were all smiles and kind words after a private meeting in Mr. Cuomo's conference room that was also attended by their closest advisers. During the meeting, which their aides called friendly and cooperative, Mr. Cuomo promised to make himself available at any time to help Mr. Pataki. Then, for the benefit of news photographers, he gave Mr. Pataki a brief tour of the ornate ceremony room adjoining his office, which is decorated with a 12-foot-high Christmas tree and a collection of wooden rocking horses.
Noting that he was feeling a little wistful at leaving the office he has held for 12 years, Mr. Cuomo, while standing at Mr. Pataki's side, said: "Of course, I would have wanted to win. And I regret that I didn't. But I'm very eager to see George Pataki succeed as Governor Pataki. He is Governor right now as far as I am concerned."
Asked if he felt he was leaving the state in capable hands, Mr. Cuomo, who during the campaign accused Mr. Pataki of dishonesty, said: "Oh yes. This is a great, great state. It survived me. It should do very well with Governor Pataki."
In an afternoon news conference, Mr. Pataki elaborated somewhat on their meeting, saying that he reiterated his request that Mr. Cuomo freeze state hiring and delay signing unessential contracts before Jan. 1. He said Mr. Cuomo did not commit to the freeze, but promised to try to reduce spending.
Mr. Pataki also said that Mr. Cuomo seemed to agree with him that an employee buyout program by the State Power Authority was too generous. Later, Mr. Cuomo released a letter sent by his counsel to Power Authority officials saying that the program might violate an executive order which, among other things, requires all compensation programs to be reviewed by Mr. Cuomo's budget division.
A spokesman for the Power Authority, Stephen Shoenholz, said he had not seen the letter and could not comment on it.
Mr. Pataki also hinted that he may not move his family from their large Victorian home in the Putnam County town of Garrison to the Governor's Mansion in Albany next year.
"We want to be as less disruptive as possible to our kids' lives," said Mr. Pataki, who has four school-age children. "We are leaning very strongly now toward having them continue the balance of this school year in the schools where they are. But even beyond that point, we haven't made any final determination."
Between his meetings with Mr. Cuomo and budget advisers, Mr. Pataki met with the Republican's two leading legislators, the new Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, and the Assembly minority leader, Clarence D. Rappleyea. He also addressed a meeting of the Assembly Republicans, receiving a rousing ovation from colleagues with whom he served for eight years.
After the meeting, one of Mr. Pataki's leading budget advisers, Assemblyman John J. Faso, said the projected $5 billion budget gap was mostly the result of increased spending, not anticipated tax cuts or declining revenues. For that reason, he said, Mr. Pataki should be able to fulfill his campaign pledge to cut income taxes rates by 25 percent in four years, a plan which would reduce state revenues by $5.6 billion per year by 1999.
Later, Mr. Pataki reinforced his intention to cut taxes. "The people of this state voted for change, and it's not simply enacting the tax cuts that we talked about during the course of the campaign, it's controlling the spending which has driven us to where we are: the highest taxed people in America," he said.
Mr. Pataki also said that before Election Day, he did not think layoffs would be necessary to produce a balanced budget. "But I don't believe anybody was talking about a budget deficit of the magnutude of four-and-a-half to five billion dollars prior to the election," he said.
Throughout the campaign, Mr. Cuomo charged that Mr. Pataki's tax-cut plan was economically unrealistic and that the state would be unable to pay for it except by reducing aid to local governments -- a move that could force towns and cities to increase property taxes.
But Mr. Pataki said that he would not allow that to happen, contending that he viewed the property tax as "the worst tax" because it can force people to give up their homes.
Yesterday, Mr. Pataki also announced the formation of a 15-member task force that will study ways to reduce utility costs for the customers of the Long Island Lighting Company. The group will be led by State Senator James L. Seward, a Republican from Oneonta, and Frank Zarb, an investment banker and former energy adviser to President Nixon.

Chart: "ADDING IT UP: How the Budget Deficit Grew for 1995-96"
 
FEBRUARY 1994: The state budget division projects spending will outpace revenues by $1.43 billion in the 1995-96 budget year, because of a slower economy and higher health care costs.
 
June 1994: The Legislature passes the 1994-95 budget, and in doing so, increases the deficit for the following budget year in two ways: by approving $635 million in business tax cuts for the 95-96 year, and by adding 1.2 billion in new spending in the 1995-96 budget. That puts the projected deficit to $3.27 billion.
 
FALL: New problems have arisen. The budget division projects that personal income tax revenues for the 95-96 year will be $500 million less than projected, and that revenues from a hospital tax will fall by $267 million. At the same time, prison costs are expected to rise an extra $75 million because of more inmates, school aid costs are estimated to go up by $47 million and other programs are projected to grow faster than expected, increasing costs by another $100 million. That brings the projected deficit to 4.25 billion.
 
DECEMBER: Governor-elect George E. Pataki says the cost of an income tax cut in the 1995-96 budget year would be about $800 million. Add that to the budget deficit and the shortfall hits $5.05 billion.

HEADLINE: Republicans Vow Dismissals, Audits and Reshuffling of House

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
The House Republicans said today that when they take over next month they will dismiss hordes of Capitol functionaries, reshuffle all their offices, audit everything, hire more waste-and-fraud watchdogs and make all decisions of any note in the light of public scrutiny.
They said this would save the Government money, though they could not yet say how much, and they said it would make for a leaner bureaucracy, though they allowed that 1,500 people who were told today that they would be dismissed could apply for their old jobs and that some might be hired back after some re-education. 
 The remainder will be let go without severance pay, a decision the supervisor of the Republican takeover, Representative Jim Nussle of Iowa, said was deemed "appropriate" by the party's leaders.
Such changes would amount to nothing less than a revolution in the House, a place which, despite its $728.5 million annual budget, operates more like a cross between the sitcom town of Mayberry and a Chicago alderman's ward. Push-button elevators are staffed with elevator operators, ice is delivered to every office every working day and politics -- Democratic politics, for the last 42 years -- dictates not just all action, but all inaction, too.
Denouncing Democratic "arrogance" and brandishing a plethora of flow charts and press releases, Mr. Nussle said those days were over, or would be on Jan. 4. He said notices of impending unemployment were sent out today to those who basically kept the House running -- janitors, cafeteria workers, accountants, doorkeepers and so on -- so they could have a month to decide whether to reapply for their jobs.
"We want to make sure that these people are dealt with as fairly and as quickly as possible," he said.
Democrats are incensed.
"What they are causing is going to be a major disruption," said Representative Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, a senior member of the House Administration Committee, the closest thing to a city council in this legislative company town. "This is an unfair thing they are doing."
Among other things, the Republicans propose to abolish the Administration Committee, which controls countless internal matters like the awarding of food-service contracts that bore voters stiff but interest House members intensely.
The Republican overhaul would replace the Administration Committee with a new Oversight Committee that would confine itself to broad questions of policy. Control over contracts, money and other meat-and-potatoes matters would fall to a new chief administrative officer of the House, to be appointed by the Speaker-to-be, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia. The proposal would concentrate virtually all day-to-day House operations under the new administrative officer, from printing to computer operations to janitors and the post office.
Mr. Nussle said Republicans would increase the House inspector general's staff to 11 workers, from 3, forward its findings to the Oversight Committee and the Justice Department when proper and give it control over outside audits of all House operations. Those audits and, probably, reports by the inspector general will be made public, he said.
He said public accountability would be the hallmark of the Republican "open House," in contrast to what he said were decades in which Democrats denied Republicans and voters information about the most basic House matters. That secrecy, he said, bred the corruption that came to light this decade in scandals involving the House bank and post office.

HEADLINE: $1.5 Billion Loss Seen For County

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
Orange County, Calif., one of the wealthiest counties in the nation, is facing one of the biggest investment losses ever -- $1.4 billion -- from purchases of highly volatile investments known as derivatives, which have fallen in value as interest rates have risen.
The Orange County loss appears to be the largest by an investment fund, either corporate or municipal, from these complex instruments. And it overshadows such well-publicized problems that derivatives have caused at Procter & Gamble, the investment firm of Piper Jaffray and, just last week, the Mellon Bank. 
 In a statement announcing the losses yesterday, Robert Citron, the Orange County treasurer, said they were still only on paper. But critics of Mr. Citron's investment policy assert that many of the securities may never recover in value. They estimate that the losses could rise to $2 billion or more.
"Orange County has joined the ranks of these problems in a big way," said Richard Y. Roberts, a commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission. "It's worrisome to the S.E.C. These securities, which were dreamed up more in a boiler room than a conference room, are sold to a broad range of investors and re sprinkled around the country."
Orange County is one of hundreds of municipalities, mutual funds, colleges and corporations that tried to increase their investment returns by buying highly complex securities that were, in effect, high-risk bets on the direction of interest rates. As interest rates have risen since earlier this year, the value of these instruments have tumbled in value.
Derivatives are securities that are linked to underlying assets, either stocks and bonds or financial indexes. The gain or losses on the derivatives depend on the performance of the underlying asset. Derivatives can result in losses that investors may never have imagined.
The $20 billion Orange County fund included some $8 billion in reserve money for future needs from more than 180 municipalities in California and $12 billion in borrowed funds.
The largest investors in the fund are the county itself, the county transportation authority, sanitation districts and California cities outside the county.
Mr. Citron, who did not respond to requests for comment, took some $8 billion in the money of these municipalities, borrowed some $12 billion more, and used it to buy a wide variety of securities that go by the name of floating-rate derivatives and reverse repurchase agreements."
As of August, $5.7 billion was invested in floating-rate instruments that decreased in value as interest rates rose. Also, about $7.5 billion was invested in government-agency four-year notes, which have also fallen in value. And some $12 billion was borrowed, in the form of reverse repurchase agreements, which added a high amount of leverage, or risk, to the portfolio.
The borrowed money, which was pegged to rising short-term interest rates, was used to buy the longer-term government agency notes, according to those who have seen the portfolio.
"All these securities have lost value and are not worth what they paid for them," said Joseph Mysak, editor of Grant's Municipal Bond Observer, an industry newsletter. "This county has taken a market hit. And then they borrowed to do that, so it's even worse."
Mr. Citron, in his statement, defended his actions. "In my 21 years of managing this fund, I have dealt with bear markets and bull markets, and am confident that we can deal with this situation," he said.
The county said it was assembling a team of county executives and securities consultants to develop a strategy to resolve the fund's problems.
Mr. Citron's actions came under sharp fire in June when he was challenged for the county treasurer's post. He won. But his opponent, John Moorlach, a Costa Mesa, Calif., accountant, made Mr. Citron's investments a campaign issue, calling them "junk." Following yesterday's announcement, Mr. Moorlach said: "The good news is that I was right. The bad news, too, is that I was right. Rising interest rates are the kiss of death for this investment strategy."
Merrill Lynch & Company sold Orange County many of the securities in the fund. A spokesman said the firm would experience no losses as a result of the Orange County problems. Merrill Lynch sharesfell by $1.50 to close at $36.50 in trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.
The exact impact of these potential losses on the operations of the 180 municipalities and agencies that put their money into this fund is unclear. The most vulnerable are school districts, including Orange County schools, because they could have more immediate needs for the money.
Nearly 60 percent of the money was put in on an involuntary basis, and the largest amount came from the county's transportation authority. Mr. Citron's office said yesterday that a number of the municipalities that voluntarily put their reserve money into the fund would continue to do so, although nine said yesterday that they were reviewing this situation.
The Orange County Sanitation District, which has $400 million in the fund, said it would stay. "It's not a problem for us," said Steve Kozak, the district's financial manager. He said the district has no upcoming needs for the money.
The fund is not intended to cover continuing municipal expenses. Instead, it is an investment pool where municipalities put their extra cash in order to earn more.
Karen S. Krop, an assistant vice president at Moody's Investors Service, a rating agency, said that it was having "ongoing discussions" with Orange Country officials to review the situation. It is too early to determine, Ms. Krop said, if the agency will downgrade the county's rating as a result of yesterday's announcement. The county's current rating is Aa1, just below the top rating.
Most of the county's debt is made up of general obligation borrowings, which are backed by the tax payments of county residents.
John L. Schiavetti, an analyst at Fitch's Investment Services, another rating agency, said that municipalities like Orange County are ill-equipped to make the complex financial analyses required to understand derivatives.
A warning to this effect was recently issued by the Government Finance Officers Association. "It's difficult to analyze such high-risk securities," Mr. Schiavetti said. "It takes a lot to understand these things and lots of municipalities simply don't have the expertise."

HEADLINE: Mammogram Interpretation Is Questioned

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY 

 BODY:
A new study has raised serious questions about radiologists' reliability in reading mammograms and making recommendations about what to do when a suspicious lesion is found in the breast.
The study, by researchers at the Yale University School of Medicine and published yesterday in The New England Journal of Medicine, found that radiologists who read mammograms can vary considerably in their interpretations of the X-ray films and in the advice they would give to women. 
 Where one radiologist might recommend an immediate biopsy, another looking at the same mammogram might suggest a repeat X-ray in three months, and still another might suggest waiting a year to do another mammogram.
The study, directed by Dr. Joann G. Elmore, an assistant professor of medicine at Yale, involved the reading of 150 women's mammograms, originally taken in 1987, by 10 radiologists from New York and Connecticut. Though all the radiologists were trained and experienced in reading mammograms, they disagreed on the diagnosis more than 20 percent of the time and disagreed even more often as to whether a biopsy should be performed.
In interpreting the mammograms of women who, in fact, had cancer, the radiologists' recommendations to do a biopsy ranged from 74 percent to 96 percent. And among the mammograms of women who did not have cancer, recommendations for an immediate biopsy ranged from 11 percent to 65 percent. In addition, in some cases the radiologists disagreed as to which breast should be biopsied.
The study does not question the value of mammography in detecting early cancers or the quality of the X-ray equipment used. It does suggest that it may be necessary to have more specific criteria for radiologists to use in interpreting the X-rays and in making decisions about what to do next. It also suggests that the training given to radiologists in reading mammograms might be improved.
In an editorial accompanying the report, however, a leading radiologist at Harvard Medical School took issue with the study's design and conclusions. The radiologist, Dr. Daniel B. Kopans, pointed out that the sampling of mammograms used in the study contained an unusually large proportion of "ambiguous" films. When these same mammograms were originally read in 1987, he wrote, "almost 30 percent of the cancers were incorrectly categorized."
He added that "mammography is not an accurate diagnostic test because there is a considerable overlap in the appearances of benign and malignant lesions on mammograms."
Dr. Kopans also suggested that the findings emphasized several well-known facts about medical practice, among them that even the most expert doctor will occasionally overlook an important abnormality and that doctors vary in their willingness to recommend additional procedures based on a single suspicious test result.
Among radiologists reading a mammogram that hints of an abnormality, some might suggest a repeat mammogram in three months while others, looking at the same X-ray, might suggest an immediate biopsy.
Dr. Kopans questioned whether this decision should be made by the radiologist alone. He suggested instead that the woman "certainly should be given the option" of deciding whether to have a biopsy if there is a 10 percent chance or even a 1 percent chance that a mammographic lesion indicates a malignancy.
The study's findings also raise an important economic issue. At a time when health care agencies are striving to reduce medical expenditures, the study suggests that the price of greater accuracy in detecting cancers through mammography may be to perform a larger number of breast biopsies, more of which will turn out to be benign.
In the study, the radiologist who detected the most breast cancers did so because he recommended biopsies for mammographic lesions that other radiologists chose to ignore or watch with repeat mammograms. This radiologist, however, also had a high rate of biopsies of lesions that turned out to be benign. On the other hand, the radiologist with the lowest rate of cancer detection had a very low rate of negative biopsies.
Dr. Kopans suggested that "since observers differ in what they miss," improved cancer detection through mammography could be achieved less expensively and certainly with less trauma to women by having two radiologists read every mammogram. He cited high-quality Swedish screening programs for breast cancer, which showed that "even among highly expert radiologists, double reading increases the rate of cancer detection by 15 percent."

HEADLINE: Maryland County Embroiled in Voting Rights Suit

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: POCOMOKE CITY, Md.

 BODY:
The flat, featureless countryside around here is dotted with the chicken farms that have brought economic renewal to Worcester County. To the northeast at the tip of the county sits Ocean City, a boardwalk isle that serves as a summer draw for the Middle Atlantic States.
But the county may soon become known throughout the nation for something else: It is becoming a prime legal battleground in the war over how to apportion political power fairly between whites and blacks. 
 The weapons have included the esoteric theories of C. Lani Guinier, President Clinton's onetime choice to be the nation's civil rights chief, as well as the threat of impatient civil rights leaders to hold Ocean City's tourist dollars hostage to their vision of justice.
The current round began in 1992 when some local black political figures, backed by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Civil Liberties Union, brought suit in Federal court charging that the county's electoral system discriminates against blacks in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
The case has since bounced back and forth between a Federal court in Baltimore and a Federal appellate court in Richmond, and will almost certainly end up in the Supreme Court.
Two of the principal adversaries in the case, one white and the other black, live a few blocks from each other in this small town at the southern end of the county. John (Sonny) Bloxom is a white member of the Worcester County Commission and a defendant in the suit. The principal black plaintiff is Honiss Cane Jr., who runs several small businesses and as such has used Mr. Bloxom as a lawyer.
At the bottom of the dispute is a divergent view of how the races get along in Worcester County.
Asked recently about race relations locally, Mr. Bloxom replied: "I think they're very good. But this suit is the kind of thing that brings lots of difficulty, lots of polarization."
To the same question, Mr. Cane said: "They are simply real bad. I couldn't survive here without relying on the black community for my businesses." The lawsuit, he said, could hardly damage race relations because "a huge polarization already exists."
Worcester County, which is on the Delmarva Peninsula and has been a government entity for more than 250 years, is bounded on the north by Delaware and on the south by Virginia. Blacks constitute about 21 percent of the population of 35,000.
The five county commissioners are elected in a system called post-at-large, which used to be common in the South but has become archaic because of extensive voting rights litigation. Worcester County has never had a black commissioner.
Post-at-large works this way: The county is divided into five districts and candidates run as the representatives from those districts. But every voter in the county gets to cast a ballot in each of the five districts. That means each voter gets to vote five times, once in the voter's own district and once for each of the other four districts.
Last January, Judge Joseph H. Young of Federal District Court ruled that the system diluted blacks' voting strength in violation of the Voting Rights Act. In April, he ordered the county to remedy the situation with a system of "cumulative voting."
Cumulative voting is an idea mainly associated with Ms. Gunier, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania whom Mr. Clinton nominated to head the civil rights division of the Justice Department, only to withdraw her name in June 1993 in the face of mounting opposition over her views on how black voters could increase their influence in elections. Cumulative voting has been used in settling some voting rights suits, but it has never been imposed by a judge.
In Worcester County, it was supposed to have worked this way: All candidates would run at large. Each voter would get five votes, which could all be cast for one candidate or divided among as many as five candidates. That means, for example, that black voters could concentrate all their votes on one black candidate, overcoming their numerical minority in the county.
Mr. Bloxom said he thought there were no elected blacks because no one had tried hard enough to win election. He said he himself had to run three times before being elected; no black, he said, has run for office more than once. He is deeply resentful of the suit, he said, because "they're saying they can't get elected without special treatment."
Mr. Cane, the plaintiff, said that without black commissioners, blacks got shut out not only from decision-making but also from patronage, the jobs and contracts the commissioners can dole out.
In September, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, upheld the ruling that Worcester County violated the Voting Rights Act, but said that cumulative voting was not acceptable either because it did not take into account local officials' desire to insure a system with regional representation. Under a cumulative voting plan, all the commissioners could come from one part of the county.
The likely result now is that the court will impose new regional boundaries to create a new district with a majority of black voters, a position supported by the Justice Department. The Supreme Court has been wrestling for two years with how far to go in creating special districts for blacks. A narrowly divided Court last year said in a North Carolina case that black majority districts with especially odd configurations could be unconstitutional.
If the Court imposes new boundaries, Worcester County would have a district that cuts across the county, picking up black neighborhoods in three towns. A map of the district would resemble a skinny dinosaur on its hind legs.
This fall, the commissioners began considering whether to appeal to the Supreme Court that part of the ruling they lost -- that there was a violation of the Voting Rights Act. They were suddenly confronted with a threat from the N.A.A.C.P. to organize a boycott of Ocean City on Memorial Day.
Edward H. Hammond, the lawyer for the county commissioners, said it was appalling that civil rights leaders would try to threaten the merchants of Ocean City to force the county to forgo its right of appeal. "We respected the plaintiffs' right to bring the case, they ought to respect our right to have our day in court," he said.
Mr. Cane said he saw nothing wrong with the boycott. "If they can use our taxpayers' money to work against the interest of the black community, we should be able to use a portion of strength, our economic power," he said.
The boycott threat has proved to be a clumsy tool, and the evidence of that came in October, when the county commissioners took up the issue of whether to proceed with the appeal. They voted unanimously to defy the threat.

HEADLINE: Republicans Elect Bruno Senate Leader

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 1

 BODY:
In a changing of the guard in the State Senate, Republicans formally elected Joseph L. Bruno of Rensselaer County as their new majority leader today.
"The people on Nov. 8 dictated to the people of this state that there be change," Mr. Bruno said at a news conference, where he was surrounded by his Republican colleagues. "The people in our conference recognized that call for change and have consequently supported me." 
 Mr. Bruno, a 65-year-old 18-year veteran of the Senate, pledged to work closely with his former Senate colleague, Governor-elect George E. Pataki, who held a round of meetings in the Capitol today with legislative leaders, budget officials and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. But Mr. Bruno offered few suggestions about how Mr. Pataki should restore the state's fiscal health, saying only that it was clear that the state had taxed and spent itself into an economic hole.
Instead, Mr. Bruno focused on the changes he would like to bring to the legislative process. He said he would ban the Senate's infamous all-night sessions, in which deals are cut and bleary-eyed legislators vote on bills they have never read. The Senate recessed last June at 11:20 A.M. after one such session, when a number of important bills died in the final hours.
Mr. Bruno also pledged to start Senate sessions and closed-door caucuses on time, a novel concept in his chamber. But he said he has not yet decided whether to propose to cut the legislative budget and staff, both of which are the largest of any state in the county.
Mr. Bruno's election was insured last Friday, after three days of furious lobbying, when he collected commitments from a majority of the 36 Republicans in the 61-member house. In doing so, he overthrew Ralph J. Marino, a Long Island Republican who had been majority leader since 1989 but who had opposed Mr. Pataki's candidacy earlier this year. Mr. Marino did not attend the closed-door session today at which Mr. Bruno was selected.
The full Senate is expected to confirm Mr. Bruno's election in a vote on the floor when it convenes next month.
Mr. Bruno said it was clear that New York has overspent and overtaxed, although he conceded that he voted for this year's budget, which he called "unconscionable" because it raised spending in the general fund by more than 6 percent over the previous year.
"It was the only document on the floor," he explained. "And if I'd had a choice my vote would have been otherwise."
Mr. Pataki was the only Republican senator who voted against this year's budget, which was negotiated by Mr. Marino, Mr. Cuomo and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver.

HEADLINE: New Video-Game Challenge: Cut the Budget, if You Dare

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Call it the political equivalent of "Mortal Kombat." It's the Government's budget game you can't win without spilling the blood of millions.
The lesson of the computer game released today by a Presidential panel on entitlement spending is that there is no easy way to keep these politically sacred payments -- Social Security and Medicare, in particular -- from consuming the entire Federal budget by 2030. 
 Senator Bob Kerrey, the Nebraska Democrat who is chairman of the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform, said "There will be a certain explosive nature" to the proposal for a cure he intends to submit next week.
Although budget specialists have long contended that that these giant programs will have to be curbed, the panel's much-heralded distribution of its interactive computer game dubbed "Budget Shadows" -- a model of policy options -- followed an election season in which virtually all candidates not only disavowed the notion of cuts but refused even to discuss the subject of Social Security.
"With the first keystrokes, people will confront the long-term fiscal imbalance caused by simple demographic forces: more people tapping entitlement programs with fewer working people to pay for them," said John C. Danforth, a Missouri Republican who is retiring from the Senate and who serves as the commission's vice chairman. "And they will see that the Social Security and Medicare trusts are on a course toward future insolvency."
The game, to be widely distributed on computer networks and on diskettes, does not even strictly aim to balance the budget. Instead, the goal is simply to hold the deficit to the same share of national output as at present, about 3 percent of gross domestic product.
And the game's implacable scorer gives zero points for many politically appealing items, like slashing Congressional retirement benefits.
But keeping a lid on the deficit is not easy. It takes 100 points to win "Budget Shadows," a point being roughly equal to 20 billion of today's dollars. But while the panel expressed some anxiety that the game was "too easy" -- that is, you can win with a heartless flick of a finger -- real-life budget analysts who played at the request of The New York Times this afternoon showed it to be quite difficult when the potential human toll was taken into account.
"What I could stomach added up to 41," said Max B. Sawicky, public finance specialist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal-oriented research organization, when asked for his list of options to reach a score of 100. Scott A. Hodge, principal budget analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation, did produce a list that added up to about 100, though not before complaining about a paucity of options.
Mr. Sawicky, who wrote a paper earlier this month declaring that reducing the deficit "is neither as important nor as urgent as is commonly believed," scored 17 points by only allowing deductions to be itemized at the lowest tax rate of 15 percent. He also scored 14 points for savings in health care -- 12 by lowering payments to doctors and hospitals and 2 by imposing a cap on spending for the acutely ill.
The rest of his points came from removing the Social Security wage base cap for employers (5), taxing Social Security like a private pension (3), and taxing capital gains at death (2).
The game allows tax increases related to specific programs -- but not income taxes -- and makes no allowance for options that would alter general economic or demographic conditions.
Mr. Hodge, though lamenting the absence of such options as the use of vouchers for medical care that he said would introduce needed market discipline, reluctantly met the game's 100-point goal.
Among his choices were to means test Social Security (9 points), raise the Social Security retirement age to 70 (5), require currently exempt state and local employees to join the Social Security system (2), raise eligibility for Medicare to age 70 (11), reduce payments to health providers (14) and both change the way various programs are indexed and the calculation of the Consumer Price Index itself.
"Budget Shadows," designed for people with minimal familiarity with computers, runs on personal computers with Microsoft Windows, version 3.1 or later, and Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows, version 4.0 or later. It will not run on Macintosh computers. Copies can be downloaded from the Internet.
The telephone number of the commission, which disbands around the end of the year, is (202) 224-2300.

HEADLINE: Port Authority Is Proposing A Toll Freeze For a Year

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey proposed a 1995 budget yesterday that would keep tolls on Hudson River bridges and tunnels at $4 for at least one more year. But officials said an increase is possible in 1996.
Stanley Brezenoff, the executive director of the authority, said losses at the New York City bus terminals and on the PATH train line would cause a $100 million deficit in the 1996 budget. If other revenues remain flat, Mr. Brezenoff said he saw no way to close the 1996 shortfall without raising tolls or the PATH fare, which is now $1. 
 "There is no place that I can see at this point where we can identify a large spike in revenue," Mr. Brezenoff said. "I don't see at this juncture how we close this gap in 1996."
The tolls on the Hudson River crossings were last raised in 1991, when they went from $3 to $4. An increase of a dollar would produce about $120 million more in revenue for the authority, officials said.
The $2.7 billion budget for 1995 calls for a slight increase in spending of $78 million to keep up with inflation. The authority's board of commissioners will vote on the plan on Dec. 15. The governors of New York and New Jersey can veto the plan.
"From our perspective, this is another hold-the-line budget," Mr. Brezenoff said. "Spending is at the same level as it was last year."
Still, officials said they had cut about $46 million worth of programs and delayed some capital projects to keep spending at a relative standstill. Mr. Brezenoff said the agency would continue cutting its staff next year by about 1 percent to bring the payroll under 9,000 jobs for the first time since 1986.
The budget contains $1.6 billion in operating money, a rise of about $100 million above this year's plan. That increase is fueled by inflation and by the reopening of the New York Vista Hotel, damaged in the February 1993 terrorist bombing of the World Trade Center. The authority owns both the center and the hotel. The spending plan also contains $669 million for capital projects at New York and New Jersey airports, port facilities, river crossings and the World Trade Center.
Among the $360 million in improvements to airports will be an extension to runways at La Guardia Airport and the completion of a monorail linking terminals and parking lots at Newark Airport. The agency also will continue planning rail links to all three area airports.
The authority also plans to spend $70 million renovating public spaces in the World Trade Center and $45 million on improvements to the marine terminals in Port Newark.
Despite spending cuts in recent years, officials said the agency has continued to lose about $265 million a year on its rapid transit trains and its two bus terminals, at 42d Street and the George Washington Bridge. So far, those losses have been offset by profits at the airports and from tolls.
Mr. Brezenoff said that if the authority seeks a toll increase in 1996, it would also seek to raise the fare on PATH trains.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A building products distributor opens doors with acquisitions.

BYLINE: By Robert Hurtado 

 BODY:
A CONSOLIDATION in the building products distribution industry has brought Cameron Ashley Inc. to the attention of Wall Street professionals.
The company, based in Dallas, has quietly become prominent in the distribution of residential building materials like roofing, millwork, vinyl siding and insulation. In Florida, its Ashley division is the dominant distributor of pool and patio construction wares. 
 The company went public in March at $12 a share. Its shares closed yesterday at $16 in Nasdaq trading, down 25 cents for the day and $2.75 below their high on Nov. 4. Nearly 70 percent of the stock is still held by management and directors.
Although new home construction is expected to ease because of higher mortgage rates, about 55 percent of Cameron Ashley's business is in the remodeling market. When interest rates rise, this market tends to grow because homeowners who are unable to sell often elect to build additions or to renovate.
But it is a growth-through-acquisition strategy that has raised investor interest in Cameron Ashley. In the last three years, the company has bought 12 new distributors for its system and plans to acquire 2 others. The company now has 67 distributors, with a goal of 160 by 1997.
"Cameron Ashley is well on the way to becoming a national factor in the building products distribution business through an aggressive acquisition program," said John H. Diffendal, an analyst with J. C. Bradford & Company in Nashville, the co-manager of Cameron Ashley's public offering.
A confluence of factors is spurring consolidation in the highly fragmented, $22 billion industry. Many proprietors of mom-and-pop shops, who already have trouble competing with the purchasing power of larger companies, want to sell their operations before their retirement. In addition, sophisticated management-information systems have given Cameron Ashley and other companies a big lead in on-line communication with customers, analysts say.
"The smaller distributors typically do not have the capital or management to develop these systems," said Wyatt A. Williams Jr., an analyst with William MacKay Jordan & Company of Houston. "Cameron Ashley has been very successful in acquiring smaller distributors and almost immediately improving their profit margins."
The company's most substantial acquisition has been the building products division of the Bird Corporation. The deal, completed in August, gave Cameron Ashley 12 locations in four new markets: Arizona, Kentucky, New England and the New York metropolitan area.
"I'd rather acquire a company in a new location, than in a market where we already have a presence," said Ronald R. Ross, chairman of Cameron Ashley.
Because of the company's broad product line, the new distributors could have an advantage in attracting new accounts. Cameron Ashley's customers include building developers, professional contractors, lumber yard proprietors and some home center chains.
Volume purchasing, firm pricing policies and tight cost controls have enabled the company to achieve operating profit margins of about 6 percent in an industry where the range is usually 3 to 4.9 percent, Mr. Ross said.
Analysts expect the company to earn about $1.30 a share in its fiscal year ended Oct. 31, compared with $1.13 the previous year. They expect $1.66 a share next year.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains Some Strength Against the Mark and Yen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar strengthened against most currencies yesterday, jumping to a 13-week high against the German mark.
Steady in London trading, the dollar climbed against the mark and yen, some currency dealers said, after the National Association of Purchasing Management said its index of manufacturing activity rose to 61.2 percent in November from 59.7 percent in October, the highest since 1984. 
 The manufacturing index is the latest in a series of reports indicating that the American economy is growing fast enough to prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to control inflation, dealers said. While rising rates have hurt the American bond market, dragging down the dollar for most of the year, higher rates, in theory, make dollar-deposits more attractive.
"People are much more optimistic about the dollar right now," said Tom Benfer, director of foreign exchange at the Bank of Montreal in New York. "Psychology is changing."
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.5768 marks, the highest level since Sept. 2, before settling at 1.5735 marks, up from 1.5710 marks on Wednesday. The dollar rose to a seven-week high of 99.48 yen, before settling at 99.35 yen, up from 98.97 yen on Wednesday.
Since Nov. 15, when the Fed raised short-term interest rates for the sixth time this year, positive economic reports have helped the dollar rather than hurt it, dealers and analysts said.
"People didn't expect the dollar to keep going up like this," said Joe Francomano, a trader at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank. "We'll probably see more fireworks tomorrow." The Labor Department is scheduled to release the November employment report today.
But signs that Germany's economy is accelerating kept the dollar from rising further against the mark yesterday, traders said. Industrial production in western Germany rose a bigger-than-expected 1.6 percent in October, prompting speculation that the Bundesbank will soon raise rates to control inflation.
Andrew Hodge, a vice president at Bank Brussels Lambert, said the Bundesbank was poised to raise rates. "That would be a negative for the dollar," he said. The German discount rate on direct loans to banks is 4.5 percent, compared with 4.75 percent in the United States.

HEADLINE: New Reports Show Strong Economy

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Incomes are growing so rapidly that free-spending Americans are not keeping up -- and therefore the savings rate is improving -- new figures showed today.
A flurry of reports pointed to a remarkably strong economy with "no dark clouds," said Eugene Sherman, an economist for M. A. Schapiro & Company, a Wall Street firm. 
 The fourth quarter got off to a quick start, according to data released today by the Commerce Department. On Wednesday, the Government reported that the economy expanded in the third quarter more rapidly than estimated earlier.
Income surged 1.4 percent in October, the biggest jump in eight months and the ninth straight gain, the department said. With millions more Americans employed and being paid more, analysts expect a strong Christmas shopping season.
Spurred by a big gain in average hourly earnings and bonus pay for auto workers, the income advance easily outpaced consumer spending -- which rose seven-tenths of a percent in October for its strongest showing since a rise of nine-tenths of a percent in August.
"These are very strong numbers," Mr. Sherman, the economist, said. "It's a very positive figure on the income side, so much so that people saved more money."
"Everything is doing remarkably well," he added. "There aren't any dark clouds."
These were among several reports showing a stronger economy:
*Construction spending rose nine-tenths of a percent in October, the second straight gain, although the advance was limited to nonresidential and government spending. The Commerce Department said residential construction spending, nearly half of construction outlays, fell.
*The Labor Department said the number of Americans filing the first time for state unemployment benefits dropped last week to the lowest level in two months.
*American manufacturing surged in November to its strongest level in 10 years; it was the 15th straight month of growth, according to a widely followed survey by the National Association of Purchasing Managers.
The Commerce Department said the income gain was the largest since it rose 1.7 percent in February.
Disposable income -- income after taxes -- also climbed 1.4 percent in October.
Americans' savings rate -- savings as a percentage of disposable income -- rose to 4.7 percent in October, from 4.1 percent in the previous month. The new rate is the highest since it reached 5 percent in April 1993.
Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the nation's gross domestic product, was up for the sixth straight month.
On Wednesday, the Government reported that the economy expanded at a 3.9 percent annual rate in the third quarter despite rising interest rates.
"The current quarter is off to a brisk start, and fourth-quarter consumer spending could rise at around a 3.5 percent rate," Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch & Company said. But, he added, "that pace is unsustainable."
Private wages and salaries, the most closely watched component of income, increased at an annual rate of $45.6 billion in October, more than double a rise of $18.5 billion in September.
The Commerce Department said incomes in October were also lifted by a big jump in subsidy payments to farm owners. But even excluding that factor and the bonus pay in the auto industry, personal income rose 1 percent.
The income and spending figures were not adjusted for inflation. When adjusted, disposable incomes rose 1.3 percent in October, while spending was up six-tenths of a percent.

HEADLINE: ON PRO BASKETBALL;
Knicks' Future Is Now, As in Now or Never

BYLINE: By Harvey Araton 

 BODY:
Pat Riley gets a front-row look tonight at the players who are bound to beat his brains in, should he stick around a few more years with his future Eastern Conference also-rans.
That's the Knicks, in Orlando tonight to continue what's looking more and more like a mighty struggle to keep their dubious future from spilling into their promising present, from giving Riley good reasons to wonder if signing a rich contract extension is such a smart idea. 
 The Magic was supposed to be another year away from intruding on the Knicks' Atlantic Division dominance, from being any kind of playoff threat, especially since they've never won a playoff game.
Tell that to their last eight opponents, all thoroughly whipped by the frightening Shaquille O'Neal and the emerging Penny Hardaway. Tell that to them.
"Our guys want the Knicks to know they've arrived," said Brad Ceisler, the Westchester-based Orlando scout who spent part of last summer devising ways to help O'Neal diversify his offensive game.
"What's happening now is that Penny is taking over games when he sees that Shaq isn't able to," Ceisler said. "The night we were in Boston last week, Shaq got hit in the throat. The next night, in Milwaukee, he can't really get into it. Penny was unbelievable, 35 points, triple-double. He just took over, and that's something he never did last year."
The Magic won 50 games last season, when O'Neal was more interested in bending rims than baby hooks, when Hardaway was chronologically a college junior, when Horace Grant was a rebounding Bull. Without a minute's contribution from the 3-point specialist Dennis Scott, Orlando has vaulted to the top of the Atlantic, and this is only the start.
It is the making of the dynasty at Disney World. The New Wilt. The Next Magic. Grant and Nick Anderson in their primes. Three future Golden State first-round draft picks Chris Webber won't be devaluing, now that he's come east to bang with Shaq.
Like Danny Manning in Phoenix, Brian Shaw took less money to play in Orlando because, inside the arena and out, the forecast is sunny. With the exception of league-leading scoring aspirants, who wouldn't want to play there?
Even the comparative economics are bleak for the Knicks, who will be stuck making huge payoffs to aging stars while Orlando becomes pro basketball's Magic Kingdom. Scott's $3.5 million dollar salary cap slot will open up next year. The Magic will target some classy small forward, maybe even Manning, to complete what will be a Boston/Los Angeles 1980's vintage starting five.
Forget, for the moment, Webber in Washington, Alonzo Mourning in Charlotte, Grant Hill in Detroit and the swarm of aggressive Pacers in Indiana. Riley and the Knicks have to know that soon, if not now, all Eastern roads to the finals will go through Orlando.
Maybe that's what Riley is thinking as negotiations to extend his contract beyond next season drag on. Maybe he senses the smart thing for him would be to see if the Knicks can complete his perfect painful progression, eke out that elusive Patrick Ewing-era title. Then Riley would be king of New York, in position to demand the skyline, live off his championship as the team retools.
If the Knicks don't win, maybe he decides he's done all he can here, and looks for something more compatible for the Winner Within.
"I haven't gotten anything like that in the many conversations I've had with him," said Dave Checketts, the new high chieftain of Madison Square Garden. "I don't sense he's delaying anything. I think it's been more a matter of timing than anything else."
Riley has tunnel vision, an obsessive nature once the games begin. Even he, though, must occasionally sneak a peek at the Knicks' big picture. Ewing shooting jump shots on achy knees and Charles Oakley grimmacing on misshapen feet may be temporary setbacks this season, but that's what's in store the next few years.
The Knicks have no young superstars, discounting infrequent ascensions to that level by John Starks. They haven't had an impact draft pick since Ewing in 1985. They have traded a batch of future first-rounders. No one knows if their new owners will throw money around the way the previous one did. And, of course, the N.B.A. has helped shroud their immediate future by turning thumbs down on their hands-on defense.
A few weeks ago, Riley said he couldn't fathom why people doubted his team had another good championship run left in it, or if it could even take another season of him.
"I agree that after seven or eight years, sometimes a team has had enough and it's time for a coach to move on," he said. "But not after three."
Unless, of course, it senses that opportunity has passed it by, that the new bully on the block is much too strong. Then it becomes easier to ask: What's the point?
The Knicks are thus advised to come to play tonight. This is much more than one game in December.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
Players' Union Is Discouraged After Meeting Adjourns

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 1

 BODY:
As the National Hockey League season slid one day closer to cancellation, league and union negotiators broke off talks early tonight after nearly eight hours of bargaining that offered no palpable hope for the future, except that the two sides would resume meeting Friday.
In fact, on Day 62 of the lockout, when the main action was expected to be the league listening to a counterproposal from the union on such issues as a rookie salary cap, arbitration and free agency, the N.H.L. came up with new wrinkles to its own plan that were not bound to please the players. 
 According to people familiar with the talks, union officials were discouraged when the talks broke up. The people said that the N.H.L. proposal today called for an entry-level salary structure for rookies that would pay a first-round draft choice no more than $700,000 a season, a second-rounder no more than $400,000 and a third-round draft choice no more than $250,000.
In addition, the league said it wanted to raise the age of free agency eligibility from 28 to 31. Part of new concept was supposed to have been unfettered free agency at 28.
"We exchanged proposals and we'll have working sessions tonight and there may be communication between both sides," said Bob Goodenow, the union's executive director.
"We met for eight hours, we're not going to characterize any progress," said Arthur J. Pincus, the N.H.L.'s director of public relations.
Both the league and the union are trying to salvage the remainder of the season, with a 50- or 60- game schedule before the playoffs.
The lockout has caused 20 layoffs in league offices in New York, Toronto and Montreal, which went into effect today, as did a 10 percent salary cut for all remaining employees, including Commissioner Gary Bettman.
For now, the league's proposal to create a "luxury tax," a penalty that would be levied on high team payrolls, is not on the table.
Players have called the tax a deal-breaker, and a salary cap in disguise.
One person familiar with the management position said the tax may be unnecessary if agreement on the other three issues produces the "drag," or slowing of salary inflation, so desired by owners, who claim that revenues are not keeping pace with soaring payrolls.

HEADLINE: Senators Cool to Pact With Koreans

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Democratic and Republican Senators alike gave a frosty reception today to the Administration's agreement with North Korea to halt its nuclear program, saying it had made too many concessions and might encourage other nations to engage in nuclear blackmail.
With some Republicans threatening to block the agreement, several members of the Senate Subcommittee on East Asia told the Administration's chief negotiator on the accord that it was unwise to promise North Korea $4 billion in new atomic reactors when North Korea would not permit inspections of some of its nuclear sites for five more years. 
 Frank H. Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who is in line to head the subcommittee next year, faulted the agreement because it does not require immediate inspections of all the sites where officials say there is evidence that North Korea has extracted plutonium to make nuclear weapons. This, he said, allowed the North to shirk its obligations under international treaties.
"Why didn't we insist that they come clean?" Mr. Murkowski asked. He and several other senators said this delay left the world vulnerable to the one or two nuclear weapons that some Administration officials say North Korea has developed.
Robert L. Gallucci, who worked out the accord in October, defended the agreement, saying it rightly focuses on denying North Korea the ability to make nuclear weapons in the future.
But Charles S. Robb, the Virginia Democrat who heads the subcommittee now, said "we will be well down the road of providing economic incentives" to the North "before we have the ability to confirm anything about North Korea's true nuclear weapons capability."
Mr. Robb called the hearing because the agreement was reached in late October, after Congress had recessed for the election campaign.
In return for North Korea's promise to freeze and eventually dismantle its nuclear weapons program, the United States has agreed to arrange for several nations, led by South Korea and Japan, to build two light-water reactors for the North. It is harder to extract weapons-grade plutonium from such reactors than from North Korea's current ones.
Senator Larry Pressler, a South Dakota Republican, said the agreement might encourage nations like Iran to copy North Korea and bar nuclear inspections unless the West agrees to furnish new power plants.
Mr. Gallucci said the accord calls for North Korea to do far more than it is obligated to under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. He said the North had promised to dismantle its reactors, to freeze construction of two large reactors, not to reprocess 8,000 spent fuel rods and not to refuel an existing reactor.
He said the freeze on its nuclear program would prevent it from building new reactors that could have produced enough plutonium to construct 30 bombs a year.
The International Atomic Energy Agency, he noted, has inspectors in North Korea who said this week that the North was complying.
Mr. Gallucci emphasized that to press North Korea to make good on its promises, it would not receive the nuclear components to start its light-water reactors until it allowed all the nuclear inspections sought by the Atomic Energy Agency.
"The agreement provides that before they get anything of significance, they have to come clean," he said. North Korea has refused to allow international inspectors to visit two waste sites that are believed to contain evidence that it has extracted weapons-grade plutonium.
Although Mr. Murkowski has threatened in the past to try to overturn the accord, he said today that he was not calling for canceling it. But Mr. Pressler said he was not convinced by Mr. Gallucci and that he would vote to overturn the agreement if given a chance.
Some Republican leaders have suggested that it would be politically dangerous to scuttle the agreement because that could revive tensions on the Korean Peninsula and the Republicans might be blamed for creating a new crisis.
Under the accord, the United States is to provide 50,000 tons of heavy oil to North Korea over the next three months as part of a long-term program to provide it with fuel until the new reactors are built. Mr. Gallucci said the Department of Defense would use $5.5 million in discretionary funds to buy this oil and would not need Congressional approval to do so.
But he acknowledged that the Department of Energy would probably have to go to Congress to reappropriate $5 million to $10 million to handle the North's spent fuel rods. That could become a vehicle for the Republicans to block the accord.

HEADLINE: Plan for Toxic Dump Off Coney Island Defies Common Sense

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re your Nov. 25 news article on the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's plan to dump toxic harbor dredgings in shallow ocean water only one-half mile off Coney Island beaches: The agency appears callous and unconcerned about the public's health and safety in defending its plan. An official says, "We must not allow a dispute over trace levels of contaminants to jeopardize a project of great significance to the Port of New York and New Jersey." 
 While harbors must be dredged to remove accumulated sediments in order for shipping and commerce to take place, disposal of dredgings contaminated with dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls should not create economic or environmental problems elsewhere.
The dioxins originated from past industrial discharges in Newark and Kingston, N.Y., and are continually being washed downriver into Newark Bay and into New York Harbor. The PCB's emanated from discharges in Schenectady.
Near-shore dumping of harbor dredgings over several decades six miles from beaches at Sandy Hook, N.J., induced the Federal Environmental Protection Agency to close that site to dredgings containing highly toxic substances because of significant ecological degradation. It defies logic and common sense now to consider dumping toxic dredgings even closer to public beaches where swimming and fishing would be more severely affected.
The Port Authority says that local residents will not be directly exposed to dioxins, considered the most toxic chemicals ever manufactured, because the dredgings will be capped with sand. However, dioxins and PCB's could escape the Coney Island dump site as they did from the Sandy Hook site, both during and after the dumping operations, before the cap could be deposited about four weeks later.
The presence of dioxins and PCB's in fish taken from the Sandy Hook area may be further explained by dissolved toxins migrating through the permeable sand cap at the present dump site, which could also occur at the Coney Island location.
Since extraction of toxins or land disposal of the contaminated dredgings is not feasible because of the large volumes involved (up to seven million tons annually), the most suitable alternative is offshore dumping into the Hudson Submarine Canyon, 150 miles from land, where the ocean is two miles deep. This enormous underwater gorge is larger than the Grand Canyon and extends from the edge of the Continental Shelf for almost 1,000 miles out into the three-mile-deep ocean abyss.
Toxic harbor dredgings dumped 150 miles out in 10,000-foot depths where wave action is in effect nonexistent would tend to migrate downslope and farther from land rather than upslope to the shelf, where most commercial fishing is done.

HEADLINE: Chemical Banking to Cut 3,700 Jobs

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
To cut costs, Chemical Banking Corporation said yesterday that it would eliminate 3,700 jobs, or 9 percent of its work force, underscoring the continuing profit pressures on big banks in New York and elsewhere in the country.
Chemical's action, one of the biggest single employment cutbacks in New York in recent years, highlights the large loss of jobs among money center banks, including Citicorp and Chase Manhattan. In metropolitan New York, fewer people now are employed by banks than on Wall Street. And further steady reductions in banking employment are still expected to come. 
 While most Wall Street analysts reacted favorably to Chemical's announcement, its stock fell 87.5 cents a share, to $40.75, in trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.
About 2,000 of the jobs to be lost are in New York City and its suburbs, with most of the layoffs likely to hit bankers dealing with corporations and people working in the bank's computer operations areas.
The bank also plans to sell its banking operations in New Jersey that are outside the New York metropolitan area.
Around the country, most banks are having trouble generating new sources of profits. But New York banks, in particular, are saddled by bad loans for real estate and to developing countries and cannot afford to move into other areas. Banks are turning more and more to cost cutting because investment banks, mutual funds and other new competitors are siphoning off an increasing share of the nation's savings and lending. And experts say there are still too many banks in this country.
Some fast-growing regional banks, such as Nationsbank of Charlotte, N.C., and the Norwest Corporation of Minneapolis, have been able to expand by ruthlessly eliminating duplicate costs in a buying spree of banks and nonbanking companies alike.
In 1992, Chemical merged with its Park Avenue neighbor, the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, eliminating 6,000 jobs and closing 130 branches.
But those cutbacks were not enough to keep costs from starting to rise again. Meanwhile, Chemical's revenues have fallen recently because of the slowdown in trading for bonds and currencies, resulting in a 9 percent drop this year in the value of the bank's stock.
"In 1994, the whole industry has had somewhat of a revenue challenge," said Walter Shipley, the bank's chairman, "which has been exacerbated by those of us who had large capital markets and trading activities."
Wall Street analysts said Chemical had little alternative to the drastic staff cuts.
"There is a lot of pain associated with this," said Thomas Hanley, a bank stock analyst with CS First Boston. "You've got to give them credit," he added. "They sat back, studied their problem and they bit the bullet."
In addition to the job cuts, Chemical plans to save money by negotiating lower prices with its suppliers and by selling some operations and bad real estate loans. The bank will take a charge against earnings of $260 million in the fourth quarter to cover the costs of severance pay and closing facilities.
In total, Chemical said its new plan would reduce its annual costs by $440 million in 1996. Given inflation and increased spending in some area, it expects its total expenses to remain constant at about $5.2 billion, while revenues are now expected to grow under its old target of 6 percent.
Chemical, which bought Horizon Bankcorp of East Brunswick, N.J., in 1989, making it the fifth largest in that state with 140 branches and $5 billion in assets, never acquired enough heft to compete effectively. With New Jersey banks drawing attractive offers, Chemical decided it would rather sell its operation in the southern part of the state than invest to expand there. Similarly, Chemical said it would try to sell its 40 percent state in the CIT Group, a commercial finance company. It sold a 60 percent stake in 1989 to Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Japan. And Chemical has designated $950 million in bad real estate loans to be sold quickly.
"This signals a new thinking that they are willing to dispose of businesses that don't meet strategic or financial return goals," said Ronald I. Mandle, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
The single largest source of savings will be $125 million, from negotiating better prices from everything the bank buys from computers to paper clips. The bank will also eliminate duplicate computer systems.
Despite the cutbacks, Chemical plans to increase spending by $180 million a year in certain areas, including credit cards, mortgage lending, private banking and the trading of securities and derivatives.
The 3,700 jobs will be eliminated over the next year, partly through attrition and partly through layoffs. In its branches, many of the layoffs will hit clerical workers. In corporate lending, by contrast, the bank will eliminate the jobs of many of its professional banking executives.
Another 10 to 15 branches will be closed next year as part of a program to cut 50 branches that was announced last spring.
Other banks are undergoing similar squeezes. Since 1990, Chase has reduced its employment to 34,000 from 42,000, but it will add another 4,200 jobs because of recent acquisitions. The bank just announced an early retirement program for which 2,600 people are eligible.
Citicorp has also cut jobs since 1990, reducing its staff in the United States to 39,000 from 52,000.
Elsewhere in the country, several regional banks have instituted even more drastic staff cutbacks. Fleet Financial Group in Rhode Island recently said it would eliminate 25 percent of its jobs. And First Interstate, in Los Angeles, said it would cut employment by 11 percent.
Chemical said it wanted to reduce its expenses to 57 percent of its revenues. This widely watched indicator in banking, known as the efficiency ratio, is currently about 61 percent at Chemical, compared to about 50 percent for the best managed banks.
To further increase the company's stock price, giving it leeway to expand into other operations, Chemical said it would buy back up to 6 million of its shares on top of a recent buyback of 10 million shares. Analysts said that if Chemical were able to sell CIT and the New Jersey operations, it would buy even more shares.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 3, 1994, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about plans by the Chemical Banking Corporation to eliminate 3,700 jobs misstated the company's stock price. The stock closed on Thursday at $36.625, up 25 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Finance Arm To Take Over Italy's Tessile

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, Dec. 1

 BODY:
The creditor banks that took control last year of one of Italy's largest, most innovative and most indebted textile groups, Gruppo Finanziario Tessile S.p.A., agreed today to make the company available to Gemina S.p.A., a finance and investment group.
The announcement by Gemina ends a drawn-out feud for control of the Turin-based textile company, which almost alone brought the Italian designer-fashion craze to the United States in the 1980's. For Italy's textile industry, shaken by recession and disclosures of financial misdealings, the transaction represented a successful effort to keep the Tessile group in Italian hands. 
 Gemina, whose holdings include the sportswear maker Fila, said it had reached an agreement to acquire a majority of Tessile's shares. Details of the agreement will be worked out with creditor institutions led by Mediobanca of Milan.
Bankers who confirmed some details said that Gemina, under a complex arrangement, would pay at least $103 million for a controlling stake in Tessile, depending on which of the creditors chose to remain as stockholders. They said that Gemina also agreed to purchase $37.5 million of fresh shares in Tessile, increasing its capital base. For their part, the banks were said to have agreed to restructure roughly $275 million of Tessile's short-term debt.
Led by the Rivetti family, the Tessile group saw its American sales balloon to $304 million in 1989 from $7 million in 1980, with licensed designer names like Armani and Valentino. But by 1993, the growth had stopped and the company was saddled with $250 million in debt. A consortium of banks took over, reducing the Rivetti family's role.
The decision to offer the Tessile group to Gemina, which is controlled by an Italian building contractor, Giampiero Pesenti, came as a surprise to some because it passed over an attractive counteroffer by CVC Capital Partners, a unit of Citibank. CVC had proposed to absorb most of the bank liabilities. But this proved to be a negative feature, given the desire of some credit institutions to retain links with the Tessile group.

HEADLINE: Luther Foster Jr., 81, Dies; Leader of Tuskegee Institute

BYLINE: By J. MICHAEL ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
Luther H. Foster Jr., who headed Tuskegee Institute for 28 years, died on Sunday at the South Fulton County Medical Center in East Point, Ga., while on his way home from vacation. He was 81 and lived in Alexandria, Va.
The cause was a heart attack, said his daughter, Adrienne Foster Williams of Iselin, N.J. 
 Dr. Foster was president of Tuskegee, a 113-year-old historically black college in Tuskegee, Ala., from 1953 to 1981, a tenure that included the civil rights and antiwar movements. Tuskegee's current president, Dr. Benjamin F. Payton, said his predecessor's "quiet but firm" hand had been a stabilizing influence on the campus during those tumultuous years. During that time, the institute grew to more than 3,500 students from about 2,000. In 1985, it was renamed Tuskegee University.
After retiring, Dr. Foster devoted his time to working with educational and other organizations. At the time of his death, he was chairman of the Academy for Educational Development, a Washington nonprofit organization that promotes educational programs in more than 80 American communities and 100 countries. He was a board member and former president of the United Negro College Fund and was a director of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies.
Dr. Foster was born on the campus of St. Paul's College in Lawrenceville, Va., where his father was an administrator. He earned undergraduate degrees from Virginia State College in 1932 and from what is now Hampton University in 1934. He received a master's degree in business administration from Harvard University in 1936 and a master's degree from the University of Chicago in 1941 and and a Ph.D. in 1951.
He joined Tuskegee as business manager in 1941, and in 1953 he became its fourth president.
In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife of 53 years, Vera Chandler Foster; his mother, Daisy P., of Petersburg, Va.; a son, L. Hilton, of Washington; two sisters, Virginia Hendrick of Petersburg and Mary Allen Burleigh of Clarksburg, W. Va., and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Now, for the Fruits of Freer Trade

 BODY:
The trade treaty's surprisingly easy approval in the Senate -- 76 to 24 -- is testimony to the good that Congress can do when its leaders stop squabbling and start legislating. Freer trade, by steering workers into high-paying exports jobs, could add as much as $1,700 to the typical family's income over the next decade. That gain was at risk until Senator Bob Dole, the next majority leader, took responsibility for bringing wavering Republicans in line behind President Clinton's legislation.
The House also approved the agreement by a large margin. Now that the political drama is over, Americans can look forward to reaping the benefits. They are not hard to locate. 
 Workers and exporters in the pharmaceutical, computer software, book and movie industries win big because the agreement will prevent trading partners from pirating intellectual property. Exports of agricultural products will rise as Western Europe and Japan lower quotas and tariffs. America will sell a lot more construction and medical equipment as its largest trading partners eliminate tariffs on these products. The jobs to be had in many of these export sectors are among the highest-paying in the economy.
U.S. consumers also win. The price of farm goods -- including sugar and dairy products -- will eventually tumble. So too will the price of children's clothes and consumer electronics. The important point here is that many of the goods that will enter the country at reduced or zero tariffs, like toys and furniture, account for a sizable part of the budgets of low-income families. The trade treaty will act like a tax cut stacked in favor of the poor.
Unfortunately, it will also cause disruptions -- though there will be surprisingly few because the U.S. made so few concessions. Textile and apparel workers in the South are most vulnerable to losing their jobs in the face of increased imports of sweaters and the like from parts of Asia and other developing countries.
Even here, though, the changes will be phased in slowly. If the Federal Reserve Board manages to keep the economy humming along near full employment, the prospect that job losers can find work at comparable pay will remain bright. Still, some will suffer; it is thus imperative that the Republican-led Congress not trim Mr. Clinton's proposals to upgrade retraining assistance to displaced workers.
Constructive bipartisan negotiation broke the trade logjam. It is to be hoped that the episode foreshadows fruitful compromise on other keys to robust growth -- health care, welfare reform, worker training and education.

HEADLINE: The G.O.P. Contract Is Too Timid

BYLINE: By Paul Craig Roberts; Paul Craig Roberts, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in 1981-82, is a fellow of the Cato Institute.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Liberals and conservatives alike regard the Republicans' "Contract With America" as a bold venture, though liberals complain it goes too far. In truth, it is a timid measure that even if carried out will leave the U.S. a handicapped player in the global capitalism of the 21st century.
Make no mistake: a capitalist revolution is sweeping the world. Communist central planning is no longer throttling the production and productivity of 1.2 billion Chinese people. Development planning is no longer stifling Latin America. 
 Latin America has a potential market twice the size of the U.S., and China four times as large. We know that these new players on the world scene are serious when the Chinese Communist Party uses its power to create stock markets and protect entrepreneurs, and when former socialist states like Chile and Argentina privatize social security and national health. In 25 years, according to World Bank projections, China will have the largest economy, with the U.S. a distant second.
In a global economy, capital will flow to areas where returns are highest and away from those where it is savaged by taxes, regulations and tort liabilities. So the U.S. has no choice but to stop building welfare and entitlement dependencies it can no longer afford, and to return to the small-government era that permitted wave after wave of penniless immigrants to be absorbed into the economic life of a thriving nation.
The Republican contract takes steps in the right direction, but they are a baby's faltering steps, not the strides of confident leaders. Even Republicans are too imbued with guilt over inequality to permit our country to really compete on the world stage.
If the U.S., a welfare state grown soft and fat, is to survive in a competitive post-socialist world, it must privatize Social Security and health care, abolish welfare and cease to tax human and physical capital. Above all, we must return to equality before the law and terminate the emerging legal system -- a throwback to feudal times -- in which people have differing rights based on their status, in this case race and sex.
Privatizing Social Security is an urgent matter of survival. The viability of a pay-as-you-go system that transfers money from one generation to another depends on a high ratio of workers to retirees. This is no longer the case in the U.S., and the system is already reneging on its promises by taxing Social Security benefits.
Privatization will be financially challenging. Large amounts of general revenue would have to be used to support those in retirement and near-retirement while younger workers are moved into I.R.A.'s and similar plans. These revenues can be made available only by curtailing functions of government that are inconsistent with a self-reliant people.
As Western Europe has discovered, a welfare-dependent population is a disadvantage in global competition. Only disciplined people with high saving rates to cushion themselves against uncertainties will successfully make the adjustment to the new world order. The economic cost of a government-supplied safety net is exorbitant, and its perverse incentives are socially debilitating. A new social safety net will have to be constructed, using a combination of lower taxes, expanded I.R.A.'s, medical savings accounts and charitable activities.
Nor can the U.S. afford the antipathy to meritocracy that suffuses its economic and social policies. Capitalism depends on the recognition and reward of merit, but American law now demands advancement by race and gender quota. A country bent on equality of result at all costs has no prospect of success in the emerging world capitalist order.
When multiculturalists demand the demolition of traditional academic standards even for the training of scientists, one must wonder whether the 21st century will find the U.S. engaged in the dismantling of modernity while our competitors become modern states. The cost of such a disastrous course cannot be offset by any economic policy.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Bond Swaps Ease Pain Of Big Declines in 1994

BYLINE: By Francis Flaherty 

 BODY:
SEASON'S greetings from the I. R. S.! That's what the tax break known as a bond swap amounts to -- a year-end gift of otherwise-Federal dollars. But if investors tie the ribbons on this nice present wrong, they may wind up saying "Uh oh" instead of "Ho ho."
 Bond owners can surely use a Santa this year. "There are plenty of losses out there -- many of 20 percent or more," said Jim Lebenthal, a New York bond trader. 
 But as bonds fall, bond swaps have more appeal. "I expect to do four, five times as many swaps this year as usual," said Peter Quick, president of Quick & Reilly Group.
 The boom arises because large bond losses mean large tax savings. In swaps, investors sell losing bonds or bond funds to offset capital gains or ordinary income, and then buy replacements with the proceeds.
 Imagine an investor who, last January, bought $25,000 of New York City general obligation bonds, yielding 5.625 percent and maturing in 2012. Today, those bonds would bring $20,000. At the 28 percent maximum Federal tax rate on long-term capital gains, that $5,000 loss means a tax savings of $1,400. And at 39.6 percent -- the top rate on ordinary income -- the savings are a jolly $1,980. Add state and local taxes and the gains are even more.
 Moreover, with Republicans ascendant, lower tax rates are in the air. That means tax savings could be smaller in future years. The $5,000 loss that saved $1,400 at a 28 percent tax rate is worth just $1,000 at 20 percent. Thus, some say, swap while the swapping is good.
 What is the price of these nice tax breaks? Befuddlement over complex rules, for one. An investor taxed at 39.6 percent on ordinary income would want to apply any losses to that income first; each $1 saved from taxes is 39.6 cents in the pocket. But while short-term capital losses -- on property held a year or less -- can be written off this way, long-term losses must first be applied to long-term gains. Even at the top rate of 28 percent on those gains, a tax break buys just 28 cents for each $1.
 Then comes the $3,000 rule. After applying capital losses to capital gains, taxpayers may use leftover losses to reduce ordinary income -- but only up to $3,000. The rest must be banked for the future.
 Still, tax breaks bring good tidings. By saving $1,400 in taxes, the New York bond investor shrank his 20 percent decline to 14.4 percent.
 What about the other half of the swap -- the replacement bond? In theory, the new bond should mimic the old one in maturity, coupon rate, credit rating and tax traits. "That way, you can create a loss and not alter your portfolio," said Thomas Ochsenschlager of Grant Thornton.
 But swapping like-for-like assumes a well-tended portfolio. Many portfolios are weedy, though, with too many high-yield bonds or low credit quality. For them, "use swaps to rebalance the portfolio and buy what makes sense now," said Lyle K. Benson, a Baltimore planner.
 James F. Lynch, who edits the Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory newsletter in New York, recommends that swappers lengthen maturities. "The yield on 15-year bonds is much greater than in January," he explained. Conversely, Mr. Benson said, "rising short rates may mean investors should put more in C.D.'s and T-bills."
 As for income, rising rates will help swappers maintain their yields. To replace the $25,000 of New York bonds sold for $20,000, Mr. Lebenthal suggested $20,000 of another New York City issue, yielding 7.52 percent and due in 2019. Despite the smaller face value, the new bonds yield $1,450 in tax-free income yearly, while the old ones paid $1,405.
 But swaps do have flaws. For one, they seal a loss. "If Grandpa holds those $25,000 in bonds until maturity, he'll get $5,000 more than if he sells now," Mr. Lebenthal said.
 And watch fees. Because bond fees are not flagged as stock commissions are, "many investors don't realize they pay fees on bond deals," Mr. Benson said. True, a 1 percent fee may be small if the swapped bond lost 20 percent. But if $25,000 in bonds lost 5 percent and the fee was 2 percent, at the 39.6 percent rate an investor would pay $475 to save $495 in taxes. Fund fees must also be factored into swaps.
 A final danger is the "wash sale" rule: If investors sell at a loss and buy substantially identical securities 30 days before or after the sale, the I.R.S. will disallow the tax gain.
 The rule -- which deters investors from selling securities they like just for tax losses -- is easily applied to stocks. Equities from the same company are substantially identical.
 But "wash sales are vague in bonds," Mr. Lebenthal said.
 The variety of practices prove it. "I've read that two elements must be different," Mr. Lebenthal said, like the maturity and the coupon rate. At Coopers & Lybrand, Vincent Vaccaro, a partner, said, "We say if it isn't exactly the same bond issue, the rule isn't violated." Other advisers have still other rules of thumb.
 But, in truth, the Government pays little attention. "I've never heard of the I.R.S. pursuing this," Mr. Benson said. Investors can also skirt the rule by sitting out 60 days, though at some market risk. Nor does the rule apply if, for portfolio reasons, they buy a different bond than they sold.

HEADLINE: THE 104th CONGRESS: NEW LEADERS;
Senate G.O.P. Elevates Dole But Ousts Ally From 2d Spot

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Senate Republicans re-elected Bob Dole as their leader today and then undercut him by dumping his assistant leader, Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming.
They replaced Mr. Simpson with the more confrontational Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, who had campaigned hard on his connections to Newt Gingrich, who will soon become Speaker of the House. 
 Mr. Lott was strongly supported by Senator Phil Gramm, the Texan who is expected to compete with Mr. Dole for the 1996 Presidential nomination. But he insisted today that Presidential politics had not played a part in the race, and said he would be Mr. Dole's completely loyal subordinate. Mr. Dole was elected without opposition.
While the Republicans were, like their voters across the nation, sounding a theme of change, the Democrats sent a less certain message.
They chose as their new minority leader Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, a cautious, low-key protege of the departing leader, Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine. But Mr. Daschle said today that he represented "real change."
Mr. Daschle, a die-hard battler for President Clinton's health care legislation this year, defeated Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, a late entrant whose backers argued that he was the combative sort the party needed to confront both the Republicans and, at times, the President.
Mr. Daschle insisted at a news conference that he planned to lead Senate Democrats down their own path. "To the extent that we can, we want very much to work with the White House," he said. "We will not be led by them; we will not view ourselves as an extension of them."
While Mr. Daschle was striving to portray himself as an independent agent, Mr. Lott was taking the opposite tack. "I'll be working with and for Bob Dole," even if Mr. Dole goes off to run for President, he said in reply to a question. "There won't be a new agenda," he continued. "There won't be a separate agenda. It will be our agenda, his agenda. He will be the leader."
Later he returned to the same point on his own initiative, protesting: "I'm going to ride shotgun for the leader. I want to help him. I want to protect him. I want to do his bidding on behalf of our conference. And sometimes, I'll take some slings and arrows and spears, if necessary, for the leader."
His victory was a surprise to Mr. Dole and Mr. Simpson, who had both told friends on Thursday they had firm commitments for Mr. Simpson from 30 Senators, when 27 were needed for victory. Mr. Simpson had held the position for a decade, working closely with Mr. Dole, who campaigned for his re-election.
But Mr. Lott, too, said he had more promises than the 27 votes he received in the secret balloting. He quoted Mr. Daschle, a former colleague in the House, as saying of any campaign for a Senate leadership post, "It's kind of like trying to put bullfrogs in a wheelbarrow."
Each contested race was decided by a single vote, and there were no major ideological differences in either contest, though in each contest the younger man won and had more open support from newer Senators. Mr. Lott, 53, and Mr. Simpson, 63, are both quite conservative, though Mr. Simpson favors abortion rights and Mr. Lott does not. Mr. Daschle, 46, and Mr. Dodd, 50, are both fairly liberal.
The results seemed to set the stage for a harder edge to party relations in the Senate than has existed between Mr. Dole and Mr. Mitchell for eight years, and to push Mr. Dole toward being more aggressive.
But even though he does not have the history of good relations with Mr. Daschle that he enjoyed with Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Dole visited the Democratic caucus to assure members that he planned to deal as fairly with them as Mr. Mitchell had with him.
Then Mr. Dole, who is 71, told the Democrats that he planned to keep the Senate in session in January, a month when it usually does not do anything after formally convening in the first week. Mr. Gingrich has already announced that the House will start legislating the day the new Congress convenes, on Jan. 4.
The Republican race ended with smiles, and two joint news conferences involving Mr. Simpson and Mr. Lott. Mr. Simpson came before the television cameras to say, "I'm going to break a little protocol to speak first." Referring to Mr. Lott,he said, "I pledged him my total support in whatever role he would ask me to do."
He said he personally would now concentrate on immigration legislation, which will come out of a Judiciary subcommittee that he will head, because "this is a huge bipartisan issue, and we either do it right, or else it will be tainted with racism and bigotry, and we can't allow that to happen."
The lanky Wyoming Senator said he had been reassured by the Mississippian that he, too, did not believe in "saliva tests" of Republican purity.
Mr. Lott, who had campaigned hard for the job and contended that he would bring a fresh energy to it, said he would be seeking Mr. Simpson's advice and was "honored by his support." And he added "There is no saliva test."
Asked why he thought he had won, he stressed his ties to the House, where he had risen to deputy minority leader before running for the Senate in 1988. He said, "I do have a personal friendship with them that I hope will be a constructive thing in making sure they understand we have a job to do over here, too."
The Senate Republicans' task would be harder, he said, because in the House the majority party controls the Rules Committee, and if "you control the rules, you control the world." But in the Senate, he said, "there's only one rule, unanimous consent, and maybe exhaustion."
The Democratic race appeared to end with less geniality. Mr. Dodd did not join in Mr. Daschle's news conference after the South Dakotan's 24-to-23 victory. Mr. Daschle said, "I'll be asking Senator Dodd for his counsel and help very often," and called him "my good and longtime friend." But it was clear the race had strained the friendship.
In the caucus, Mr. Daschle's backers urged his election because they said he stood for change. Mr. Dodd's supporters stressed both his experience and combativeness.
Mr. Daschle had campaigned to succeed Mr. Mitchell ever since the Maine Democrat decided in March not to run again. Before the Nov. 8 election, he was in a close contest with Senator Jim Sasser of Tennessee, whom Mr. Dodd was supporting. When Mr. Sasser was defeated for re-election, several of his supporters urged Mr. Dodd to step forward, and he did, but in the end Mr. Daschle's lead was too much to overcome, though votes were switching back and forth as late as Thursday.
The assistant Democratic leader will be Senator Wendell H. Ford of Kentucky, who was re-elected to the post without opposition.
Mr. Daschle promised that as Democratic leader he would try to work with Republicans to avoid gridlock. But he said, "We stand ready to offer vigorous opposition to extreme proposals that threaten economic security or our nation's economic future. We will fight against proposals that are mean-spirited." He said he hoped "our mutual goals are the prosperity and security of working people."
He cautioned, "This is not the time or the place to be talking specifically about our agenda." But he cited the same sorts of economic concerns that House Democrats have been concentrating on lately, saying "America's families need a thriving economy to produce the job security that is the heart of personal security."
Senator Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland was elected secretary of the caucus, the highest leadership position a Democratic woman has held.
Although Mr. Dodd was not there, Mr. Daschle surrounded himself with a leadership group that except for Mr. Ford, a Senator since 1974, included no one who had been in the Senate for more than 10 years.
Mr. Daschle, whom Mr. Mitchell put in charge of the Democratic Policy Committee, said that position would go to Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, one of his allies in this contest and another battle for health care legislation.
He appointed Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana to the position of chief deputy whip, a job Mr. Breaux had held in the outgoing Congress.
What had been the Democratic Steering Committee, a body whose main role has been to recommend senators for committee positions, was renamed as the Steering Coordination Committee, and Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts was named to head it.
Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, entering his third year in the Senate, was named assistant floor leader.
Mr. Daschle said he would ask the caucus to create a committee, on technology and communications, and said he would name Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia, a close friend and ally on health care, to head it.
But while the Senate Democrats were announcing new positions and committees, Senate Republicans announced a plan to eliminate entirely the 200-person Office of Technology Assessment, which helps members understand technical issues, and to cut the $450 million budget of the General Accounting Office, an investigative agency, by at least 25 percent.
They also announced a plan to reduce Senate committee staffs by 15 percent, to 815 members from 955. Almost all of those to go would be Democratic aides.

HEADLINE: JOBLESS RATE FELL AGAIN LAST MONTH TO A 4-YEAR LOW

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Surpassing nearly all expectations, the job market posted exceptionally strong gains in November as payrolls swelled by 350,000 and the unemployment rate fell to a four-year low of 5.6 percent, the Government reported today.
The improvement in the economy embraced broad sectors of business and nearly all population groups. Indeed, the growth last month was so vigorous in the face of persistent efforts by the Federal Reserve to slow the economy to a more sustainable pace that analysts now say another rise in short-term interest rates is all but certain. They predict that a rate increase could come possibly before the end of the month but is more likely at the end of January. 
 Several times earlier this year, evidence of a strong economy, like that in today's job report from the Labor Department, has spooked the inflation-sensitive bond market. Bond investors tend to fear that vigorous growth will lead to inflation, which would erode the value of their fixed-income investments.
But such fears were not in evidence today. Instead, long-term rates fell back below 8 percent, and the dollar rose in international currency markets to finish above 100 Japanese yen, apparently because investors now anticipate strong early action to resist inflation by a more vigilant Federal Reserve. The stock market also rallied, with the Dow Jones industrial average up 44.75 at 3,745.62. [Pages 39 and 40.]
The economy also looked remarkably well balanced. Relishing the latest of a string of strong recent reports, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said the economy was in a "Goldilocks expansion" -- not hot enough to ignite inflation, yet remarkably resistant to the Federal Reserve's attempt to cool it down.
"We have not witnessed in this country in a generation the same combination of low inflation and job creation," Mr. Reich said in a telephone interview.
For those fearing inflation, analysts said, one of the most reassuring elements of today's report was that average hourly earnings declined by 2 cents, after an October surge that was initially put at 8 cents and now revised to 7 cents. By far the biggest portion of business costs are accounted for by wages, and inflation is not likely to become worrisome unless wages rise significantly.
Despite the robust conditions reported today, there are some signs pointing to a slackening of economic growth next year. Interest-rate increases, six so far this year, may finally be starting to pinch. After the holidays, consumers may also pull back on the borrowing spree that has helped sustain the vigorous expansion.
Indeed, the Commerce Department reported today that its index of leading, or predictive, indicators edged down in October, the third essentially flat reading in the last four months.
The decline in the index, although a minimal one-tenth of 1 percent, was the first negative move since July 1993. September's reading, initially reported as unchanged, was revised to show a gain of one-tenth of a percent.
Still another report today found that orders to the nation's factories fell four-tenths of 1 percent in October, the first decline in three months.
But it was the buoyant job data for November, the first broad-gauged tabulation of economic performance for the month, that commanded most attention. Laurence H. Meyer, an economic consultant in St. Louis, said the unemployment report showed that economic activity had become so "steamy" that he decided to raise his forecast of fourth-quarter growth by about a percentage point, to an annual pace between 4 and 4.5 percent.
On Wednesday, the Government raised its estimate for the third-quarter growth rate to 3.9 percent from 3.4 percent, well above the roughly 2.5 percent increase many economists think is about the most that can be sustained without driving up inflation.
"Today's employment report," Mr. Meyer advised his clients in a report, "dramatically increases the probability that the Fed will move again to raise rates before the end of the year." He previously anticipated that the central bank would wait until its policy meeting at the end of January to make it more expensive for banks to borrow short-term funds.
The economy has defied expectations all through 1994, proving to be surprisingly strong. Analysts now attribute the vigorous performance this year, at least in part, to the delayed effects from the low interest rates of 1992 and 1993. Those rate declines were engineered by the Federal Reserve to kick-start the economy out of an extended period of so-called jobless recovery that followed the recession of the early 1990's.
Interest rates were so low in 1993 that homeowners went on a mortgage-refinancing binge, which added billions of dollars in spending power to American households. Federal Reserve officials and other analysts now express surprise that consumer spending has been so strong amid relatively stagnant growth in incomes.
Booming capital investment by business has been a second major source of economic strength. But the substitution of machines for labor did not prevent employers from adding 350,000 workers to their payrolls last month, about 100,000 more than most analysts had expected.
One of the biggest contributors to the increase was a jump of 71,000 in construction industry jobs, aided by mild weather in much of the country that extended the building season and by the return of some workers in the Southeast who had been idled during prolonged October rains.
There were 51,000 more factory jobs last month, on top of a gain of 42,000 in September. That powerful two-month surge lifted factory jobs to a level more than 250,000 above their September 1993 low.
Some analysts, including David B. Bostian Jr., a New York consultant, contended that the demise of the Clinton Administration's health care program was also a significant incentive to hiring. Many employers had feared that the program would raise their costs for workers' health care benefits. Once that concern was lifted, he said, "a lot of people started putting on workers they'd been thinking about hiring for a year or more."
The length of the average workweek in the private sector declined last month, the job report also showed, while the length of the factory week and hours of factory overtime were unchanged at recent very high levels.
The Labor Department's survey of households echoed the payroll numbers; 372,000 new jobs were created, and only 100,000 more people joined the work force, which cut the unemployment rate by two-tenths of a point. At 5.6 percent, the jobless rate has fallen half a point since August and is at its lowest level since August 1990.
The jobless rate for teen-agers dropped two points, to 15.3 percent, last month, while the rate for blacks and Hispanic workers each fell nearly a point to 10.5 percent and 8.6 percent, respectively.
Geographically, the biggest decline was in the Midwest, already enjoying the lowest jobless rate of any region. In that area, the November improvement was four-tenths of a point, to 4.6. The unemployment rate in the Northeast edged down to 6.1 from 6.2, while in the South it eased to 5.5 from 5.7. The West was unchanged at 6.7 percent.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Backed Candidate for Trade Post Is Trailing

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Dec. 2

 BODY:
One day after winning Congressional approval of a vast global trade accord, the Clinton Administration appears to be losing the first power struggle in the new world trade order.
At issue is who will head the soon-to-be-created World Trade Organization, the agency that is to handle trade disputes and replace the existing Geneva-based bureaucracy of GATT, or the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
 The United States has vigorously supported Carlos Salinas de Gotari, the Mexican President who left office on Thursday. Mr. Salinas is seen as a champion of free trade, having led Mexico into the North American Free Trade Agreement, and he is by far the most prestigious candidate for the job.
But he is running a distant second. The European Union, led by Germany and France, is backing an Italian diplomat and trade expert, Renato Ruggiero, who served as the Italian Minister of Foreign Trade from 1987 through 1991 and is well known in European trade circles.
A surprisingly strong third is Kim Chul Su, the South Korean Trade Minister, who has the support of Japan and most Asian countries.
The issue is important because many experts say the World Trade Organization will emerge over time as the most important international economic agency, eclipsing the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in importance, as it carries out the far-reaching changes in trade agreed to under GATT.
According to officials in the GATT building on the shores of Lake Geneva, Mr. Ruggiero has more than 50 percent of the votes of the 123 member nations. And pressure has built over the last week for the United States to persuade Mr. Salinas to withdraw in favor of Mr. Ruggiero.
"Fair is fair," said a European diplomat involved in the closed-door negotiations. "We have high esteem for Mr. Salinas and Mr. Kim, but Mr. Ruggiero has more than half the votes, and a consensus should form around him. It is only appropriate that Mr. Salinas and Mr. Kim withdraw."
In Washington, President Clinton today threw his weight behind Mr. Salinas, saying the former Mexican President would bring to the helm of World Trade Organization "a wealth of experience and important insights from the perspective of a developing country."
Administration officials said they recognized that Mr. Salinas faced an uphill fight. But they said Mr. Clinton had decided to issue the unusual endorsement because he believed that Mr. Salinas would bring with him the kind of political influence the new organization will need.
At minimum, the officials said, the endorsement would put Mr. Clinton in common cause with the Latin American leaders with whom he will meet next week in Miami at the Summit of the Americas.
Officials of GATT would like to resolve the dispute by Thursday, when the members meet to approve the startup of the World Trade Organization so that on Jan. 1 the agency will begin with a new director general, replacing Peter Sutherland, who was the managing director of GATT.
But so far, GATT diplomats say, none of the three sides is budging.
Many insiders say they cannot remember when the normally collegial body of bureaucrats has been as deeply divided, and they fear a long, messy internal debate.
What they hope at all costs to avoid is a potentially divisive public vote. GATT officials pride themselves on working by consensus.
For those who have criticized the World Trade Organization and its authority to rule unilaterally on trade disputes, the leadership struggle may confirm their worst fears.
Most of Mr. Ruggiero's votes come not from the major nations in Europe, but from the smaller African, Caribbean and Pacific countries that are either former European colonies or major trading partners with the European Union. Since each member has one vote, major powers like the United States and Japan have no more voting power than many tiny nations.
But the current debate is not really between large and small countries; it is predominantly between Europe and the United States, and underscores a growing economic rivalry. Europe has been slow to create new trade links outside its borders, as the United States has with Mexico. And many European governments were shaken last month by the prospect -- though admittedly distant -- that the United States would form a giant free trading bloc with the Pacific basin countries.
To be sure, both the Europeans and Americans have strong arguments for their candidates. Mr. Salinas's supporters say his presence would lift the stature of the agency and insure an audience with other world leaders at critical times.
But that is just what many in Geneva do not want. In addition to a fear that it would concentrate too much power in the hands of the Americans, anti-Salinas sentiment stems from a belief that a low-profile diplomat could accomplish more in the agency than one of Mr. Salinas's stature.
"Ambassadors fear Salinas would be forever going over their heads direct to the heads of states and not working through the existing process," a diplomat said. "This is a relatively informal agency. He wouldn't have the security, the entourage and the kind of office he is used to in the presidential palace in Mexico. What does Sutherland have, a couple of secretaries and an assistant or two? This is a very collegial body, not one of great show."
Since the organization is not about to bring the matter to a public vote, quiet canvassing is being done by Hungary's delegate, Andreas Szepesi, hoping that once one candidate builds a commanding lead, the two others will graciously withdraw.
Though Mr. Szepesi refuses to give interviews, he is making his findings known.
Despite the strong support for Mr. Ruggiero, who is 64, he lacks the backing of the United States, considered essential.
But Mr. Ruggiero is at the same time a friend of the United States, having pushed hard for European governments to support the Strategic Defense Initiative during the Reagan Administration. He has held senior diplomatic posts in Moscow and Washington.
"I think I am in the best position," Mr. Ruggiero said in a telephone interview. "But I need the U.S. support. Certainly without U.S. support, you cannot win."
But it is hard to see the United States so quickly abandoning the 46-year-old Mr. Salinas, who has many years ahead of him in international politics and not that many obvious places to serve.
"Salinas was the Aztec emperor for six years, and he is terribly afraid of suddenly becoming a nonentity and disappearing," said a Latin American official who supports him. "He's got to find some way to stay afloat."

The Economy
 
Job growth accelerated in November. The Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate fell to a four-year low of 5.6 percent. The report showed a well-balanced economy enjoying robust growth. [Page 1.] Job growth in the New York region, however, lagged behind the nation. [48.] 

Many agencies and municipalities that borrowed to participate in the loss-plagued investment fund in Orange County, Calif., may not be able to make withdrawals to pay off their notes without facing heavy losses or risking a run. Separately, S.& P. said it might lower the debt rating of Orange County. [39.]
 
Markets
 
Treasury bond prices surged as investors became convinced that that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates again sooner than expected. Short-term issues were weaker. [39.]
Stocks staged a surprisingly strong rally following the jobs report. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 4.38 points. [40.]
The dollar advanced against the yen and the mark, helped by a Japanese trade report and the United States jobs report. [49.]

HEADLINE: THE 104th CONGRESS: THE PRESIDENT;
Clinton Hints Of a Tax Cut As He Meets G.O.P. Chiefs

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
As he met for the first time with the new Republican Congressional leaders, President Clinton said today that he would not rule out working with them on a tax cut for the middle class, but he vowed to oppose any proposal that would "explode the deficit" or repeal a ban on assault weapons.
"I hope and believe we can cooperate with the new Congress," Mr. Clinton said, speaking via satellite to delegates at a National League of Cities meeting in Minneapolis. "But cooperation from me cannot mean abandoning principle, abandoning the hard work we have already accomplished together in our fight to restore the economy, our fight against crime, our fight to give this country back to the hard-working people who play by the rules." 
 The remarks about those who play by the rules precisely echoed Mr. Clinton's language in his 1992 Presidential campaign, when he promised a middle-class tax cut. After taking office, he dropped the idea in favor of reducing the deficit.
The President spoke just hours before meeting with Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, who will become the majority leader in January, and Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who will become Speaker of the House.
After an hourlong session in the Oval Office, both lawmakers emerged in late afternoon praising the meeting. Mr. Gingrich said he had expressed particular optimism to Mr. Clinton that they could work to pass a measure allowing the President to veto individual items in spending bills, make the laws that apply to private citizens and companies apply to Congress as well and pass a law barring the Federal Government from imposing programs on states and local governments without providing money to cover the costs.
Mr. Dole mentioned telecommunications regulation and the environmental legislation as other potential areas of cooperation. Both men said they did not discuss taxes, changes in welfare, health care, details of foreign policy or several other questions.
"We didn't cover everything," Mr. Dole said about tax issues. "We didn't get down to the t's." But, he added, "I think the President understands that we're going to hit the ground running."
Republicans have proposed a $500-a-child tax credit, cuts in capital gains taxes and other tax-relief ideas, but Mr. Clinton has made no mention of what specific ideas he might favor, all the while repeatedly mentioning a tax cut as something he would like to do.
Mr. Clinton's renewed claim to championing the interests of working Americans came a day after his proposal to increase military spending by $25 billion over the next six years. Both matters were part of his effort to stake out the possibilities -- and the limits -- of his cooperation with a Congress itching to challenge him, and to get out ahead of it on what he considers issues of bedrock political concern.
In his satellite talk to the city officials, Mr. Clinton told a Dallas Councilman who had expressed concern about the effect of tax cuts on Federal aid: "While I favor a middle-class tax cut, and I don't rule out working with the Republican Congress on some of their ideas, my standard will be, Will it help increase income for the middle class? Will it promote jobs and growth? And can we pay for it?"
At an economic briefing before Mr. Clinton spoke this morning, Robert E. Rubin, the President's senior economic policy adviser, was asked about prospects for specific cuts. Mr. Rubin drew laughter by saying, "Let me respond in large measure, perhaps, by not responding."
"We are absolutely going to be fiscally responsible," Mr. Rubin continued, "and the judgments that we have to make on the various questions that we need to deal with have not been made yet."
Mr. Clinton, who has struggled since his Presidential campaign to dispel an impression that he is sometimes too ready to compromise, also took pains today to point out the issues on which he would not bend.
"The assault weapons ban that you helped to win stands between the citizens you and I must protect and the gangs and thugs that would terrorize them," he told the city officials gathered in Minneapolis. "I will do all in my power to keep the next Congress from doing anything that will jeopardize the safety of our people. And I truly hope the new Congress understands how important these things are to the American people and to their elected representatives at the grass-roots level."
The President also met today with newly chosen Democratic leaders in both houses, including Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, who will be the Senate minority leader, and Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, who will be the House minority whip.
Afterward, reporters asked Mr. Daschle a variety of questions about his agenda with the White House, to which Mr. Daschle repeatedly replied that it was too early to say.
Mr. Bonior, on the other hand, lost no time in insisting that in contrast to the Republicans, the Democrats "will be taking care of working people" and supporting a tax cut to benefit "middle Americans."
Asked Mr. Clinton's reaction to that idea, Mr. Bonior said, "He was nodding his head in agreement."

HEADLINE: THE 104th CONGRESS: BALANCE SHEET;
Analysis Increases the Cost Of Clinton's Welfare Plan

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
The capital received another tutorial on the high cost of overhauling the welfare system today when the Congressional Budget Office announced that President Clinton's proposal would cost nearly $5 billion more during the next five years than he had allotted.
With the Clinton plan likely to be a dead letter in a Republican-led Congress, the Congressional Budget Office estimate was less important for what it said about the plan than for what it said about welfare overhaul in general: putting welfare recipients to work will cost money, probably more than the public realizes. 
 Like President Clinton, the Republican leaders want to put time limits on benefits and then enroll recipients in work programs. Although the public tends to think of mandatory work programs as money-saving measures, they are much more expensive, at least in the short run, than simply mailing welfare checks. That is because the Government must hire supervisors, subsidize wages and provide mothers with child care before the women can go to work.
The numbers buried in the estimate from the budget office drive home the point. The average mother with two children receives $4,440 a year in welfare benefits. But the budget office estimated that enrolling her in a work program would raise the figure to $11,440 a year, adding $4,000 for wage subsidies and supervisors' salaries, and $3,000 for child care.
Under Republican plans, those costs could go even higher. That is because the Republicans want to phase in their plans faster and require longer work hours, which would bring higher child-care costs. The Republican work plans have generally acknowledged the expenses involved but pledged to offset them with cuts of tens of billions of dollars in other anti-poverty programs.
Mr. Clinton's pledge to "end welfare as we know it" was among his most popular promises in the 1992 Presidential campaign. He said he would expand the training that welfare recipients received during their first two years, then enroll them in a work program if they remained unemployed.
But the President faced a series of embarrassments last spring as he tried to finance his plan. The Administration considered options that included taxing casinos and taxing food stamps. But news of the strategies leaked, and each met with a public outcry. Mr. Clinton ended up scaling back the plan, with less child care and a slower phase-in than some of his aides had wanted.
When Mr. Clinton presented his bill to Congress in June, he said that it would cost the Federal Government $9.3 billion over five years and that he had found an equal amount of cuts in the budget.
But the budget office, in reviewing the details, estimated that his plan would cost $11.8 billion and that the cuts would save only $6.9 billion. And while the Administration had said the plan would cost the states $1 billion, the budget office placed the figure at $2.6 billion.
The analysis by the budget office emphasized that estimating the costs of large-scale changes was an inexact science because no one knew how recipients would respond. Work programs might deter some women from seeking benefits; expanded training programs might attract others.
The difference in the spending estimates "should be considered small in view of the great uncertainty," the report said.
"You could end up with $7 billion or $14 billion, and both our estimates are in the middle," John Tapogna, an author of the report, said today in an interview.
A year of internal debate went into the drafting of the Clinton plan, but it has been overtaken by the Republican sweep of Congress. Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the presumptive Speaker, has pledged to send a bill to the House floor in his first 100 days.
His policy guidebook, the "Contract With America" endorsed by many Republican candidates, calls for enrolling 1.5 million recipients in a work program by 1999, almost four times as many as the Clinton plan. But Mr. Gingrich is also seeking cuts in social programs that could total more than $50 billion.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington advocacy group on issues that benefit the poor, has estimated that the Gingrich plan would remove from the rolls as many as five million of the nine million children now receiving benefits. Mr. Gingrich has proposed housing some of those children in orphanages.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rates Down Slightly In New York and New Jersey

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Unemployment in the New York region dropped only slightly in November, signaling that the recovery in the local area, already weaker than in most of the nation, may be losing steam.
"What is striking is the contrast between the brisk recovery nationally and what is going on in this region," said Samuel L. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "The labor market here has shifted into neutral." 
 The jobless rate in New York City fell to 7.5 percent last month from 8.2 percent in October, but the improvement was accompanied by a decline in the number of New Yorkers looking for work. That means the city's improved unemployment rate masked large numbers of people who, because they had stopped seeking jobs, were not counted.
The rates for New York State and New Jersey were virtually unchanged in November, leaving both states with levels of unemployment that are higher than any of the nation's largest industrial states other than California and Florida.
In New York State, the November rate was 6.3 percent, compared with 6.5 percent in October. In New Jersey, the November rate was 6.6 percent, compared with 6.7 percent in October.
The Federal data for November, reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, covered only the 11 largest industrial states. For that reason, Connecticut was not included.
The rates in New York and New Jersey compared with rates in Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio that were less than 5 percent, and with rates below 6 percent in Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Texas.
Only California, where the rate was 7.7 percent, and Florida, where it stood at 6.8 percent, had higher unemployment in November than New York and New Jersey.
In New York City, where unemployment has been far higher than the nation for more than four years, the 7.5 percent rate in November was a clear improvement from the first nine months of the year, when it ranged from 8.4 percent to 10.8 percent.
But Mr. Ehrenhalt said the number of people in New York City's civilian labor force -- those employed or looking for work -- dropped sharply in November. The labor force fell last month by 55,000 workers, to 3,236,000, from 3,291,000 in October.
Mr. Ehrenhalt said last month's steep decline suggests that the local economy is weakening.

HEADLINE: Bonds Rally Despite Employment Figures

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury bonds staged a powerful rally yesterday, despite a stronger-than-expected jobs report.
The Labor Department report showed continued robust growth in the economy, convincing investors that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates again sooner than expected. 
 Earlier this year, the prospects of Fed inaction had unnerved the bond market, but investors now see the Fed on the offensive over inflation. On Nov. 15, the Fed sharply raised the two interest rates it controls, the sixth rate increase this year, heartening the market. Another increase in the next month would be welcomed as a preemptive strike against an acceleration of inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income investments like bonds.
"The likelihood of further Fed tightening at its meeting on Dec. 20 has certainly increased," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Securities.
The price of the 30-year bond jumped 1 5/32 , to 95 11/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell below the psychologically important level of 8 percent, to 7.91 percent from 8.01 percent on Thursday. The latest yield was the lowest in more than a month.
Bond prices were also bolstered by a stronger dollar and the covering of short sales by investors who had bet that the market would head lower yesterday and instead were sent scurrying to buy securities to limit their losses. In a short sale, investors sell borrowed securities, hoping to buy them back later at lower prices, pocketing the difference. But when prices rise, these investors must buy back the securities to limit their losses.
The dollar surged yesterday against the Japanese yen and the German mark, settling above 100 yen for the first time since Oct. 11. A stronger dollar is likely to draw foreign investors back into the market.
James Hale, a fixed-income analyst with MMS International, said the prices of short-term maturities came under pressure because of investors' concerns stemming from the $1.5 billion loss reported by Orange County, Calif. The county said the loss was largely a result of purchases of the highly volatile investments known as derivatives. Investors' fears "are that the county isn't the only municipality that has had substantial losses tied to investments in derivatives," Mr. Hale said.
Mr. Fine of Chase Securities said the improvement in bonds yesterday was a result of a number of factors, including short-covering because many investors had positioned themselves for a strong jobs report. The various factors increased expectations that the Fed would raise rates at the Dec. 20 meeting of its policy-making committee. Mr. Fine said he expected the Fed would raise short-term rates by 50 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Other data released yesterday included October factory orders, which showed a decline of four-tenths of 1 percent, pretty much in line with expectations because of the decline in new orders for durable goods reported last week. The durable-goods component was revised to show a 1 percent drop from 1.5 percent, while nondurable orders rose two-tenths of a percent.

HEADLINE: Waking an Old East German Giant

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SCHKOPAU, Germany

 BODY:
Building after building sits vacant. The rust is everywhere -- on miles of piping that run overhead, on stanchions supporting huge water tanks and on smokestacks reminiscent of the last century.
This mournful site a few miles west of Leipzig is the Buna chemical complex, once the heart of the East German state chemical industry and, more recently, all but destined for the scrap heap. 
 But the European subsidiary of the Dow Chemical Company is betting on the revival of the 1,250-acre plant and its antiquated technology, as Dow makes its boldest move yet into Europe.
Dow Deutschland is expected to pay several hundred million dollars for a three-quarters stake in Buna and two other nearby plants, while the giant Russian natural gas company Gazprom buys the rest. The German Government will bear the brunt of the restoration at Buna with a $2 billion investment that nonetheless could save only 3,000 jobs at the plant, which once employed 18,000. It now has 4,600 workers.
"When we're done, Buna will be possibly the most modern chemical complex in Europe," said its managing director, Bernhard H. Brummer, "There were many in the West who simply wanted to shut us down so they wouldn't have any new competition. But that's not going to happen. Buna will live."
Dow Deutschland is already the dominant American chemical company in Europe, challenging European chemical giants like Bayer, BASF and Hoechst.
If Dow acquires majority ownership in Buna and the two other plants -- a steam cracker in Bohlen for beginning the chemical refining process and a polyolefin producer in Leuna -- it will become the fourth-largest chemical company in Germany.
"The East German operation is, more than anything, a beachhead for exports to Poland, the Czech Republic, the Ukraine and the Baltics," said Elmar J. Deutsch, head of Dow's German subsidiary, in a recent interview with the German business weekly Wirtschaftswoche. Mr. Deutsch declined to be interviewed for this article.
Buna embodies many symbols. For the German Government struggling to integrate east and west, it is by far the largest bailout of a failed East German industry, and, if successfully sold to Dow Chemical, it will be the largest privatization of the 13,000 former East German companies. And for eastern Germans, it represents an assurance that despite the failure of Communism, their chemical industry will not disappear; indeed, it will eventually be able to compete in the next century.
But the decision to invest a vast amount of capital to save a few jobs is also a politically delicate one. Buna will be left with only one-sixth of its former work force. Still, the project is an attempt to salvage at least some jobs in an area where unemployment is running 30 percent and idled workers have little chance of finding new jobs.
Dow has signed a letter of intent with Treuhand Anstalt, the Government agency handling all eastern German privatizations, to analyze the value of the operations at Buna, Bohlen and Leuna. Dow proposes to buy up to 76 percent of the operations and plans to sign a final deal as soon as the end of the year.
Walking through the deteriorating complex here leaves one wondering why Dow would want to get involved. For decades, Buna made its chemicals from coal, an expensive, polluting process that is no longer used. Buna makes fewer than half the 2,500 products that it made five years ago, and many of those products are from synthetic rubber, which Dow does not yet make.
But Mr. Brummer says the chemicals that Buna makes are a good fit for Dow. By 2000, Buna will give Dow a more prominent position in Germany, the largest chemical market in Europe, with close ties to East European governments.
"Many of the managers here were trained or educated in Russia," said Mr. Brummer, who is a former senior executive in Dow's German unit. "They speak Russian. They still have many ties with important people running government and industry in East Europe. More than anything, they know the Russian soul and have a deeper understanding of the Eastern mind."
Buna's move into free-market hands will begin a new era for this complex, which was built by the prewar chemical giant I. G. Farben.
During World War II, Buna made tires for the German war machine. Oddly, Buna was not bombed by the Allies at the end of the war, as were many German chemical plants. Some company officials contend that the Allies did not destroy the plant because they wanted to benefit from its substantial strides in the development of synthetic rubber.
Under Communist rule, Buna provided for the needs of the East German market because the country had little access to Western chemicals and technology. Thus, it developed the coal-chemical technology. Despite the severe pollution that resulted, the technology was studied by other chemical companies in the 1970's after the shocks of the November 1973 Arab oil embargo.
Mr. Brummer notes that coal-chemical technology becomes cost effective once oil prices rise to $80 a barrel -- a long way from less than $18 a barrel at present. "And we know we have much more coal on the planet than oil," he said.
Mr. Brummer, who keeps a color poster of the former East German strong man Erich Honecker as a reminder of the company's past, acknowledges that it is not easy for a Western manager to run Buna.
"There is real resentment here that Westerners have come in and exploited the East Germans," Mr. Brummer said. "East Germans want to run their own destiny now." The tension will worsen because one-third of the 4,600 current employees have yet to be laid off.
Astrid Molder, a public relations employee, acknowledged that she often yearned for the company's bygone days, pollution and all.
"At least we all had jobs," she said. "We were more united. We knew we were suffering from the pollution, but we could suffer together.
"Now with so few jobs, we are fighting each other. I don't know if my job will be eliminated. Now we resent it when we see someone else keeping a job."

HEADLINE: In From the Cold, Ex-Agent Warms to Capitalism

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Nikolai Nazarov has information to offer American businesses interested in investing in Russia. After all, he spent 20 years as a K.G.B. agent assigned to monitor the activities of foreign businessmen there.
"My job was just getting the information," he said in a recent interview. "That is the only thing I was trained to do, the only thing I can do, the only thing I like to do." 
 Making entrepreneurs out of ex-Soviet bureaucrats can be a complicated business, as the case of Mr. Nazarov illustrates.
He is one of 85 Russian business people who have spent a month as interns at small- and medium-sized businesses in 11 American cities. The interns came to America as part of "Business for Russia," a program financed by the United States Information Agency and planned with the help of the Russian Government, which has brought 350 interns to work in the United States since 1993. The cost of the program is about $6,500 an intern, and 1,000 more Russian business people are scheduled to arrive in 1995.
Joseph Duffy, director of the U.S.I.A., said that the program would "allow young Russian entrepreneurs to experience first-hand Western business practices and to see how decisions are made."
 Richard Schreck, the director of international programs at the University of Maryland, was in charge of placing Mr. Nazarov and nine other interns staying in the Washington area with business and home-stay hosts.
"Each of them is put into a business," he said, "either the same business that they're in, or one step upstream or downstream. The intent is that the Russians should learn how it works to run a business in a market economic situation."
Mr. Nazarov, 38, who has the discreet manner of a polished diplomat, spent his five weeks gleaning trade secrets from Prudential Associates Inc., a private investigation firm in Rockville, Md., that provides services mostly for corporate clients. Similarly, Mr. Nazarov's operation in St. Petersburg, Nazarov & Son, provides investigation and consulting services for businesses.
He is clearly pleased about his match, almost as impressed with them as they are with him. For the last five weeks, he has worked and lived with Robert Miller, president of Prudential. Like Mr. Nazarov, Mr. Miller has previous intelligence experience; he is a former intelligence officer for the United States Army.
"The thing I was most interested in was to know the American way of marketing, beginning with targeting the client base and saying 'Hello,' and 'Happy Christmas' and all that kind of stuff," Mr. Nazarov said.
Networking is another concept foreign to the Russians. Every Friday, the interns met at the University of Maryland's University College campus to regroup and attend classes reinforcing what they learned at the office.
"We had somebody come talk to them about networking, which is something else that they're not experienced at in Russia," Dr. Schreck said. "There's much less of a community of trust among business people than here. But they're quite keen to do it."
In addition to developing marketing skills, Mr. Nazarov used his internship to recruit potential clients and investors. While working at Prudential Associates, he pitched his services to venture capitalists, printed business cards, and even incorporated Nazarov & Son as a Maryland business.
"It's a pity," Mr. Nazarov said, "but the Russian market for my services is extremely narrow. So one of the purposes in my coming here is not only to learn the ways" of marketing, "but to examine the American market for my services.
"I consider the enormous, untouched American market to be my target market for investors, American investors, into the Russian economy."
It looks as if it could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship. "I realized what an asset he was, and we've been talking about an ongoing business," said Herb Quinde, director of operations at Prudential Associates. "We spent several hours with a venture capitalist who said he had never considered a business deal that took longer than five minutes to drive to from his office. By the end of the meeting, he was asking Nikolai to pitch him on ventures in Russia."
Mr. Nazarov says he joined the K.G.B. when he was 16, "for the romance, of course." After becoming a senior officer in the analytical department in St. Petersburg, Mr. Nazarov resigned in 1991 when the Communists fell from power. Seeing no other alternative, he plunged head first into capitalism, opening Nazarov & Son. His son, Sergei, is only 10 years old, but Mr. Nazarov says his dream is to have his son join him in the business one day.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Makes Strong Gains, Edging Above 100-Yen Level

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar surged against the Japanese yen yesterday, closing above 100 yen for the first time in seven weeks, in a rally that many analysts said signaled a long-awaited recovery.
The currency was bolstered yesterday by a Japanese trade report and the November employment data in the United States. The dollar also rose to a 13-week high against the German mark and was stronger against most other leading currencies. 
 "We're seeing a fundamental reappraisal of the dollar," said Robert Brusca, chief financial economist at the Nikko Securities Company International. "It's turned a pretty important corner."
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar rose to 100.61 yen, from 99.35 yen on Thursday; yesterday's was the first New York quote above 100 yen since Oct. 11. The dollar rose to 1.5798 marks, from 1.5768 marks on Thursday. But dealers said trading centered on the yen, which weakened broadly.
The dollar rose in Asian dealings after the Japanese Government reported that the country's trade surplus fell sharply in October, the third consecutive monthly decline, while the economy grew at a 3.7 percent annual rate in the third quarter.
Those numbers suggested a reduction of the huge stockpiles of dollars that Japan earns by exporting goods to the United States; constant selling of dollars for yen by Japanese companies had helped to push the dollar to record lows. In addition, a strong Japanese economy should absorb more imports, which must be paid for in foreign currencies.
The dollar was further bolstered in European and American trading by a stronger-than-expected report on United States employment in November. The Labor Department said the economy created 350,000 jobs last month, pushing the unemployment rate to a four-year low of 5.6 percent.
Receding inflation fears and the higher returns offered on shorter-term United States investments compared with those in Europe and Japan are providing a powerful draw, particularly at a time when Tokyo stock prices seem to have peaked.
"There is a realization in the foreign exchange market of a shifting out of yen-denominated assets and into dollar assets," said Bob Near, a vice president of the Bank of New York.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Price of Crude Oil Plunges; Heating Fuel Drops Sharply

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Crude oil futures plunged to a seven-week low yesterday after 28 Pennsylvania counties backed away from using a new gasoline aimed at reducing air pollution.
The prospect of reduced demand for the cleaner-burning fuel led to a 6.8 percent drop in gasoline futures and a sharp decline in heating oil, which already is burdened by rising stocks because of the unusually warm autumn weather. 
 "It's just a total panic," said John O'Connell, an analyst for Refco Inc., a futures brokerage firm.
The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities fell 1.94 points, to 227.71. Cotton futures extended Thursday's gains.
Light crude oil for January delivery plummeted 83 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange, to $16.99 a barrel, the lowest settlement for near-term deliveries since Oct. 14.
January wholesale unleaded gasoline tumbled 3.69 cents, to 50.61 cents a gallon; January wholesale home heating oil slumped 1.73 cents, to 47.02 cents a gallon, and January natural gas fell 1.8 cents, to $1.635 for 1,000 cubic feet.
On Thursday, Gov. Robert Casey of Pennsylvania signed legislation relieving 28 counties of their voluntary agreement to require reformulated gasoline beginning Jan. 1. The counties are not among the 9 metropolitan areas and 40 other communities required to offer the cleaner-burning fuel under Federal or state regulations.
"What this does is eliminate any lingering concern that there might have been for any tightness in reformulated gasoline supplies," said William O'Neill, senior futures strategist for Merrill Lynch.
He said traders were worried that the neighboring states of New Jersey and New York might also pull out of the program.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, silver futures dropped more than 4 percent to a 12-month low as rising interest rates fed fears of a stifling of the economy.
December silver fell 21.8 cents, to $4.689 an ounce, the lowest settlement for near-term deliveries since Dec. 2, 1993. December gold sank $3.10, to $375.50 an ounce.
Cotton futures rose sharply on the New York Cotton Exchange, the sixth consecutive day of gains driven by strong export demand. March deliveries rose 1.48 cents, to 82.84 cents a pound.

HEADLINE: Time Is Right for a Year-End Tax Review

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Antithetical though it may be to the holiday spirit, a bit of attention to taxes in the final weeks of the year can pay off handsomely. The savings reaped may even cover all those gifts to loved ones.
 Congress has done little to change the tax rules this year, no doubt lulling some people into complacency. Yet nearly everyone can still do something to minimize the bill that comes due in April. 
 One of the most basic moves is to avoid a penalty by making sure quarterly payments and withholding by your employer are sufficient. For most people, that means paying at least 90 percent of your tax liability this year, or an amount equal to last year's bill. If you earned more than $150,000 last year, you have to pay 110 percent of last year's amount to be safe. Another good idea is to pay close attention to the break points where extra income vaults you into a higher bracket, the highest being 39.6 percent.
 To be sure, some of the most rewarding tactics rest on shaky political assumptions, such as whether the new Republican Congress and the Clinton Administration will produce the middle-class tax cut that both sides have said they want. A way to bet on this is to defer income until next year and to accelerate deductions this year, for a lower 1994 tax bill. That can be done by postponing a bonus or making an extra mortgage payment -- only one is permitted a year -- for the additional deduction.
 Anticipating that the bite on capital gains will be eased, taxpayers may want to postpone selling assets at a profit until next year, and to make sure the investments are held long enough to qualify for long-term tax treatment, meaning at least a year and a day. Some market devices can be used to protect gains from evaporating in the meantime (see related article). Another possibility is to structure a profitable sale, of, say, real estate, in installments, with the bulk of the proceeds paid in future years. That way, the gains would be taxed at what is expected to become a lower rate than the rate on the date of sale.
 The Republicans propose to cut the maximum rate on capital gains in half, to 14 percent. (It is possible, though, that individuals who now pay income tax at the top rate of 39.6 percent might pay more than 14 percent on capital gains to make the measure politically palatable.) Whether any change would be retroactive to Jan. 1, 1995, is, of course, unknown.
 Even if you are skeptical about such changes, you may still want to shift income and deductions where possible to keep money in your pocket and out of the Government's for an additional year. The reward is more significant than last year because you can earn higher interest rates on your money.
 Specialists caution, however, that making an early mortgage or state income tax payment to increase deductions makes people more vulnerable to the alternative minimum tax. Those who push themselves into alternative minimum tax territory could "undo the benefits of shifting," said Rick Bobrow, national director of tax services at Ernst & Young, the accounting firm.
 Apart from income shifting, certain maneuvers may help taxpayers in specific situations. If you are selling your home -- and expect to realize a loss -- you may want to delay the closing until next year in case the Republicans push through their proposal to make this loss deductible.
 Another money-saving but decidedly unromantic tactic is for two high-income earners, who would pay higher taxes as a married couple than as singles, to put off their wedding until 1995. This would avoid at least one year of the marriage penalty, which the Republicans propose to relieve.
 Low-income people can also be hit by this penalty. Two people earning $11,000 each who marry would no longer qualify for the earned-income tax credit, perhaps costing them thousands of dollars.
An area where there are some complicated changes in both this year's and next year's law involves charitable contributions. As always, anyone who wants to make a gift to charity and lacks the money can put it on a credit card this month and get a full deduction even if the bill is paid next year.
 And as before, if you want to make a gift of appreciated securities, be sure to donate the stocks, bonds or mutual fund shares instead of selling them and giving the cash that remains after taxes. This has the double-barreled advantage of yielding the charity more, since it pays no taxes, and giving you a deduction for the securities' full market value.
 Time is running out, though, if the recipient is to be a private or family foundation. After Dec. 31, gifts of securities to such groups will be deductible based only on the donor's cost, not on the appreciated value.
 For any gift valued at more than $250, you need a charity's written statement to get a deduction. You also need a statement for all gifts exceeding $75 that came with some benefit, like college football tickets or a dinner, and the statement must itemize the donation and the value of the item given in return.
 Another way to reduce taxes when disposing of assets that have climbed in value is to give them to a child -- or perhaps to an elderly parent -- in a low tax bracket. This person, who must be at least 14 to escape the "kiddie tax," could then sell the asset and pay capital gains taxes at a lower rate than you would. Anyone can give $10,000 to a person a year without worrying about the gift tax. So rather than cashing in company stock to pay a child's college tuition next year, a couple might give the child up to $20,000 in stock.
 Making gifts of company stock is a particularly appealing idea, since it generates a deduction and many people have too much of their worth tied up in a single asset anyway.
 At a less exalted level, donating a hard-to-sell car and promptly deducting its book value may make more sense than spending the time and money to advertise and show the car to potential buyers. Many well-known charities, including the Salvation Army, have programs to handle car donations.

Bahrain Investment Group Acquires Prime Equipment

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
Investcorp, the Bahrain investment group that owns Saks Fifth Avenue and Gucci, said yesterday that it had bought the Prime Equipment Company, which rents construction equipment, for $300 million.
Prime, based in Houston, has 74 outlets that deal with contractors and refiners in 11 Sun Belt states. The company is the nation's second-largest equipment rental company behind Hertz and had rental revenue of $113 million in 1993, according to the Rental Equipment Register, a monthly trade publication. 
 Prime, which declined to disclose its sales, also generates some nonrental revenue from servicing leased or rented equipment.
Prime wants to expand in its current markets and add new products and services. Investcorp -- which acquired Prime from the United States arm of Artemis S.A., a French holding company -- said it would put up an unspecified amount of capital to accomplish this.
While best known for its acquisitions of Saks and Gucci, Investcorp, the New York holding company that consists primarily of Arab investors, has recently made more prosaic deals. In September, Investcorp bought a Boston supermarket chain, and in October 1993, it acquired a record retailer. Since its founding in 1982, Investcorp has made 52 investments with a value of $6.5 billion.
Robert V. Glaser, a member of Investcorp's management committee, said in a statement that his company was attracted to Prime because it held a strong position in a growth industry.
Thomas E. Bennett, Prime's president, will remain as chief executive and become a shareholder of Prime as a result of the deal. Mr. Bennett could not be reached for comment, and the size of his Prime holdings were not disclosed.
The equipment rental industry has undergone a resurgence as construction activity has bounced back from recession. Contractors rented less equipment when housing starts and other construction declined around the nation in the early 1990's. Prime saw its revenue drop 18 percent in 1991, to $200 million.
But now, suppliers of rental equipment and the rental outlets themselves "are having a hard time keeping up with demand," said Fred I. Anderson, a spokesman for the American Rental Association in Moline, Ill.
Contractors rely heavily on rental companies for specialized equipment or extra equipment for short periods. Prime's 30,000-piece fleet includes pumps, welders, air compressors and forklifts, but not heavy earth-moving equipment like bulldozers.
The revival in the rental equipment industry may be short-lived, however. New-home construction fell for the first time in four months in October as the housing industry began to suffer from rising interest rates.
Prime, founded in 1962, grew rapidly during the late 1980's through acquisitions of small, independent operators, Mr. Anderson said.
The industry is fragmented among 20,000 companies, only 6 of which generated more than $50 million in annual sales.

HEADLINE: GARDENING;
Taking a Sharper Look at Lawn Care

BYLINE: By JOAN LEE FAUST 

 BODY:
IF the lawn has not had its dose of fertilizer this fall, there is no time to waste. The task should be done promptly. Tradition has it that lawn fertilizer should be spread by the end of November. But the recent spate of mild weather has fooled many gardeners.
Lawn-keeping researchers believe that one late fall application is all that the lawn should need for an entire year. They say that this sort of application economy goes a long way toward lawn health -- but also keeps excess fertilizer out of the water system since less is lost to the environment through runoff. 
 Hopefully homeowners have purchased their lawn fertilizer to date and have just not gotten around to applying it. Otherwise bags of lawn fertilizer may be hard to come by since most of the garden centers have put away garden products to make space for their holiday displays. (Some merchants might be able to haul fertilizer bags out of their storage sheds if they still have some in stock.)
The reason for the late fall application of lawn nutrients is to make the spring greening of grass plants a bigger success and to nourish the grass root system in early spring.
The fertilizer will be absorbed well at this time of year, but because the soil will be cold the nutrients will not break down as quickly. They will remain in position to nourish the roots and grass blades in spring.
Lawn mowers may be cleaned and covered in the back of the garage or toolshed now. But in case not, there is one more task for the lawn: a final mowing. The grass should winter through at a short length. A mowing height of one and one-half inches is about right. This will put the grass in good shape for the winter and encourage a sturdy push of green growth in early spring. The young blades will not have to mush through all that extra growth left over from fall. Also, there is less chance of snow mold developing on a closely clipped lawn.
Of course, the lawn should go into winter free of leaves and other debris. A final raking and cleanup is very worthwhile. Leaves left on the lawn at this time have a tendency to mat, especially after cold weather chills them down. They would adhere to the grass blades and cause more problems in spring.
Next spring if any bare patches occur or there is need for reseeding, be on the lookout for grass seed with endophytes.
These organisms are a form of fungus that repel many of the grass-blade insects like billbugs and sod webworms. This type of grass seed is relatively new and will be found in only a few types on the market, particularly perennial rye grasses and fescues.
Although some of the research is ongoing on the effectiveness of this systemic fungi, this new development in grass culture may prove to be highly worthwhile.
Another facet of lawn care is the trend toward less lawn and more plant diversity, especially those that resemble meadows and contain the old-fashioned close-cropped lawns with English daisies and chamomile.
A rather remarkable book has made its appearance that makes a strong case for rethinking the traditional lawn. "Redesigning the American Lawn, a Search for Environmental Harmony" was published by the Yale University Press and represents a collaboration between the faculty and students of the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies and the School of Art and Architecture at Yale University. The authors were all graduate students at the university and proceeds from the sale of the book go toward fellowships for students in ecology and architecture at the university.
The students make a strong case for changing the traditional thinking about lawns and note that "The American lawn has a long and noble history, and it has won a firm place in our hearts, but there is a darker side to this grassy swath. In our efforts to make it greener, to make it all grass, to keep it closely mowed, and to make it a constant companion of suburban development, we are unnecessarily contributing to some of the most severe environmental problems facing the world today."
The book closes with a chapter on "A New American Lawn" in which several alternatives to the classic lawn are proposed. These alternatives cover a range of options from changing the traditional ways lawns are cared for to more drastic roles of replacing the lawn completely. Although the book presents many challenging viewpoints that might be debated, there is much to be heeded in what is being said.
And since this is such a fine time of year to do some serious lawn-keeping homework, there is yet another book also worth reading: "The Chemical-Free Lawn, The Newest Varieties and Techniques to Grow Lush, Hardy Grass" by Warren Schultz. This tome from Rodale Press advocates the organic point of view on lawn keeping without the use of pesticides, herbicides or chemical fertilizers.

HEADLINE: Black Architects Struggling for Equity

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
COLLEAGUES are few; exemplars and mentors fewer. Business contacts are made in social settings to which one is not always invited. Lacking experience in big projects, one is rarely entrusted with such jobs -- and therefore never gets the needed experience. All told, it is difficult to be a black architect, even in the best of times.
And these are not the best of times. 
 "Certainly, the atmosphere is less optimistic," said J. Max Bond Jr., a partner in Davis, Brody & Associates, whose career spans 35 years. "That seems to be one of the things that has changed -- the feeling in the community as a whole that there was going to be progress, that things were going to change."
Roberta Washington, who began her career in the 1970's, said the outlook may have been better 15 or 20 years ago, when black architects could go into business and get involved immediately with new construction, as opposed to renovation. Today, she said, "I don't see those same kinds of opportunities."
Before the recession, black firms faced white firms of comparable scale and experience when bidding for small jobs or public contracts, said William E. Davis Jr., president of the New York Coalition of Black Architects and a partner in Davis Samuels Architects.
Now, Mr. Davis said, because there is less work to go around generally, well-established offices are competing for smaller projects. "With those firms coming into the mid-size market and the government sector," he said, "it has really made it very difficult for African-American firms to compete."
Paradoxically, progress has been hampered in some cases by programs that set aside a percentage of government contracts for minority-owned companies. To qualify for projects, white-controlled firms will form joint ventures with smaller offices.
"Because of joint-venturing, the range of jobs that minority firms can get has diminished," Mr. Bond said. "Black firms, Latino firms, women's firms are often brought in to fulfill some quota and not because the majority firm thinks they provide value. They don't get a chance to manage a job."
And what about the prospects for individual black architects within larger firms? Ms. Washington worked for several New York offices before setting up her own practice, Roberta Washington Architects, in 1983. "At most firms, I was one of two black people and sometimes the only black person," she recalled.
"When I go to white firms today, I still don't see more than one or two black people," Ms. Washington said. "If it were just skill and something that was judged very objectively -- 'Can you do this?' -- I think there would definitely be more black partners and associates. But it's: 'Do you laugh at my jokes? Do you go to my club? Will we have something to talk about when we get together for the holidays?' If the answer to those questions is no, you never get to the other one."
Although 12.4 percent of Americans are black, only 1.1 percent of members in the American Institute of Architects are black, according to an article in last month's Architectural Record. That is more disproportionate than comparable figures for Hispanic, Asian-American or women architects.
Besides these discouraging statistics, this fall brought more bad news to the black architectural fraternity when Harry Simmons Jr., the founder of Simmons Architects in Brooklyn and a co-founder of the Coalition of Black Architects, was killed when a plane he was piloting crashed in Massachusetts.
Mr. Simmons specialized in housing and churches. His goal, he said, was "to overcome historical conditions by creating physical environments that are oases for dignified, safe, comfortable living." He described his philosophy in "African American Architects in Current Practice" (Princeton Architectural Press, 1991), which was edited by Jack Travis, who also founded JTA Jack Travis Architect.
Kandace Simmons, Mr. Simmons' daughter and the managing director of Simmons Architects, said the firm would remain in business under the architectural leadership of Robyn Fleming, who worked with Mr. Simmons for about nine years.
BUT it was clear from colleagues that Mr. Simmons would be difficult to replace. Mr. Travis described him as "bigger than life" and Mr. Bond said he was an "important symbol."
Mr. Simmons gave much thought to the qualities that distinguish housing for families, Mr. Travis said. One of his ideas was building residential units around courtyards and placing front doors on the yard -- not on the street -- so that front doors could be left open and everyone in the complex could keep an eye out on the children.
Mr. Travis recalled Mr. Simmons saying: "If you think about it, we're extended families. You don't have to go back to Africa to find that; just go back down South. We haven't lost that."
Another feature that Mr. Simmons believed was important in a housing complex was a space near the street for men to gather, particularly since large numbers of them were likely to be unemployed.
"It was a passion with him," Mr. Travis said. "He was really trying to push for these kinds of things to happen. He was, in my opinion, a visionary that way."
Mr. Simmons had another vision: architects should be financially successful. Mr. Travis said Mr. Simmons would make this point to students by finishing his lectures with a slide of his report card -- all A's -- and then slides of his Jaguar and airplane.
"He was fantastic businessman," Ms. Simmons said. "That's why he was able to stay in independent practice for 25 years. There are very few architects -- particularly black architects -- who can say that."
In 1969, the same year that Simmons Architects was founded, Mr. Bond and Donald P. Ryder formed the firm of Bond Ryder & Associates, which came to be one of the most successful and prominent minority architectural practices.
On Mr. Ryder's retirement in 1990, the firm merged with Davis, Brody. Mr. Bond is a partner in that office, with Lewis Davis and his son, Steven M. Davis.
Among Mr. Bond's projects are the new National University of Science and Technology in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, and the Center for Disease Prevention, on St. Nicholas Avenue, between 167th and 168th Streets, which is part of Columbia University's Audubon Biomedical Science and Technology Park.
Both at Bond Ryder and Davis, Brody, Mr. Bond has also been involved with designing a laboratory building on the site of the old Audubon Theater and Ballroom, on Broadway between 165th and 166th Streets, where Malcolm X was killed in 1965.
Preservation of the Audubon became one of the first major struggles over a site critical to African-American history. In March 1990, when its fate was still undecided, the Audubon was called "a landmark that is uniquely representative of the African-American experience of struggle" by Michael Henry Adams, a preservationist. "If this building is allowed to go down," he said, "it will be a tragedy."
After a tortuous evolution, the final plan for the new building, the Audubon Business and Technology Center, called for preserving some of the original structure, including parts of the exuberant terra-cotta facade. That plan was approved by the Board of Estimate at its final session in August 1990.
A year later, the 18th-century African Burial Ground was unearthed during excavations for a new Federal office building on a block bounded by Broadway and Elk, Duane and Reade Streets.
Another preservation battle erupted. Federal officials were criticized at first for excavating the site too hastily to permit sensitive archeological treatment of the hundreds of graves that were discovered. Then, the whole notion of disrupting the burial ground was called into question.
"This was a sacred place," William Davis said. "It shouldn't have been disturbed." Besides heading the black architects' coalition, Mr. Davis is a member of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, which designated the burial ground in 1993.
In the end, a corner of the development site at Duane and Elk Streets was set aside for a memorial. A design competition was held this year by the African Burial Ground Competition Coalition, headed by Mr. Davis, which includes the Municipal Art Society and Professional Archeologists of New York City. There were some 170 entries.
"Our next step is how we get the memorial realized," Mr. Davis said. The coalition has just published a richly illustrated 91-page book, "Reclaiming Our Past, Honoring Our Ancestors," chronicling the burial ground, its history and the competition.
The burial ground "raised my sense of connectedness to Africa," Mr. Davis said. "No one could ignore it anymore. The evidence was there that these people lived, worked, tilled the soil. There was a real community here. It's almost like they were speaking to us 200-plus years later."
Ms. Washington said the burial ground was "probably the biggest rallier of interest," but noted, as did others, a general increase in historical consciousness.
"There was a time when the black community wasn't concerned with preservation," she said. "They thought it was validating the fact that they only had second-hand things and also, they saw it as something that only people with time on their hands were interested in. But it's changed. In Harlem, there are discussions about getting additional buildings landmarked."
One of her projects is the restoration of the wooden porches in a group of landmark 19th-century houses known as Astor Row, 8 through 62 West 130th Street.
Exploration of cultural history does not stop on these shores.
"An African esthetic has not really come forward," Mr. Travis said. "Now, a handful of people are starting to take a look at the possibilities." He has conducted summer workshops for architectural students in the imagery of sub-Saharan Africa, examining the spaces found in tribal villages and homelands. "We try to take that imagery and forge new imagery," Mr. Travis said.
MARK A. WARREN, of Garrison McNeil & Associates, believes Afrocentric design is concerned with space more than ornamental "applique."
"For instance," he said, "in Japanese architecture they see space in flux and forever changing. Similarly, in African architecture, you would have aspects of inner and outer, meaning that the inside relates integrally with the outside."
While much of the discussion of Afrocentric architecture to date has been theoretical, Mr. Davis has begun exploring it in an actual project: a banquet hall and offices in Hempstead, L.I., for the Nassau-Suffolk chapter of 100 Black Men, a civic group.
"The exterior was your typical, Long Island, neo-Colonial brick face, with broken pediment," Mr. Davis said. "We said, 'That's not the appropriate image. Colonial times were not the best of times for black people. It would be important for you to say who you are from your building.' "
"We looked at their mission, their purpose," he said. "It talked about hard work, ingenuity, commitment. We looked at a series of West African symbols and used those symbols on the face of the building." The facade is still under construction but four pilasters are in place, as is the entablature on which the symbols will be placed.
"We need to look to other cultures and areas, as we have in music, dance, theater," Mr. Davis said. "There are many other areas where African sensibilities and ideas have answered questions that Europeans have been struggling with for years."
Ultimately, however, there may be practical brakes on the development of African forms in American architecture. "A majority of work still has to do with the public sector," Mr. Travis said, "and rules and regulations are going to hamper the energy needed for an Afrocentric esthetic."
The dependence of minority firms on government set-asides is viewed ambivalently. On one hand, the projects can yield needed revenue and invaluable experience.
But if the larger firm is uncooperative, architects in the smaller firm may be shut out of meaningful participation. Also, said Richard H. Franklin, assistant chief architect for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, "because you're tied to government work, it depends on changes and shifts in the political climate."
Ms. Washington's office is involved in several major projects as part of a joint venture, including the proposed 22-story Harlem International Trade Center on West 125th Street (in association with Mitchell/ Giurgola Architects and URS Consultants); the reconstruction of Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn (with Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum and Ellerbe Becket) and the master plan of Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn (with Polshek & Partners).
"I find generally that if architects in both firms really want it to work, they find a way," she said. "We keep trying because, in a lot of cases, it's the only way we can get to do a project that is a lot larger than any we've done before. We couldn't do the Trade Center ourselves. Even if we could, we'd have a hard time convincing the client."
Terrence O'Neal, who began practicing on his own last year after leaving Ms. Washington's office, said: "I am not concentrating on becoming a minority business enterprise and going for the sometimes huge amounts of money that are involved. From what I've seen, it's not even worth it to pursue that kind of work."
Mr. O'Neal's projects include the rehabilitation of two schools in Newark and the design of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Community Center at 34 West 134th Street.
Kevin F. Barnes, an architect and partner in the firm of BHA Consultants, said that in working for government agencies, "you get smaller contracts, you do the work over and over again until you please them and they won't pay you until you do."
"Quite frankly, I call it welfare architecture," Mr. Barnes said, "and it's nothing that I've ever found attractive." His recent projects include the renovation of 96,000 square feet of office space for Chancellor Capital Management, at 1166 Avenue of the Americas, between 45th and 46th Streets.
Mr. Bond suggested that the process might work better if the smaller firm were selected first and then chose the large office with which it would be associated, thereby gaining greater management experience.
The set-aside provisions tend to discourage the creation of integrated partnerships, Mr. Bond noted. For example, a firm owned equally by one black partner and two white partners would not qualify as a minority business enterprise.
BLACK firms on their own face daunting hurdles. Mr. McNeil's office has several big projects in Harlem, including a Pathmark supermarket on 125th Street, between Lexington and Third Avenues and the renovation of the Renaissance Ballroom, at 138th Street and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard.
Nonetheless, he said: "We don't get work below 96th Street or 110th Street. That's not bitter. That's a fact. One day, my 10-year-old daughter asked, 'Why don't you do buildings downtown?' I danced around the question. A day later, she said, 'You don't do work downtown because they won't give it to you, right?' I said, 'That's right.' "
"Race has an effect on the perception of black architects," Mr. Davis said. "That's really where the problem is. It's a subliminal thing that you're not quite qualified, even though all of us have gone to the same school, have the same degrees and the same licenses. We have to spend half the time proving that we're credible architects."
"People guard their culture very closely," Mr. O'Neal said. "A lot of what is considered architecturally good is often considered to be out of the reach of a nonwhite or a black architect."
What optimism there is rests mainly in the future. The year-old World Studio Foundation in Manhattan hopes to award $50,000 in scholarships next year, principally for minority students to study design.
"The key is academia and education if you want to change things," said Mr. Travis, who teaches at the Fashion Institute of Technology and the Parsons School of Design. He designed Spike Lee's house in Brooklyn and is working on four residences for Wesley Snipes, who played the architect Flipper Purify in Mr. Lee's 1991 movie, "Jungle Fever," on which Mr. Travis served as the consultant.
Minority firms are coming to benefit from their own networks. Mr. Warren and three others have formed the Atepa Community Development Association, whose name means "master builder" in Swahili. It includes engineers and lawyers. "We know the future is not just in knowing other architects," Mr. Warren said, "but in knowing your colleague in another profession who can help you get your project through."
Mr. Barnes noted that he and his partner, Gabriel Hernandez, were chosen to design a sanctuary for a Seventh-Day Adventist congregation at Weeks Avenue and 175th Street in the Bronx because "they wanted someone who was culturally related to them."
"I think minority architects will do better in the future because the client base will be expanding," Mr. Barnes said. "And I don't think most majority firms are willing to go into a lot of areas that I have.
"The difference that used to be restrictive," he said, "will be to our benefit."

In the Aftermath, a Builder Picks Up the Pieces

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
WHEN the building and buying boom of the 80's dissolved in bankruptcies and foreclosures, it was the developers who, deservedly or not, took the heat for overbuilding and overpricing.
In Stamford, which had been transformed from a dowdy industrial town into a modern city, the fall was especially hard. A parade of companies that had moved into new buildings suddenly moved out, headed for cheaper business and housing costs in the South and leaving developers with empty spaces and deep financial troubles. 
 Two of the best known real-estate names in the area, Arthur Collins Sr. and Robert Rich, were especially hard hit. Their companies live on, however, although in much-diminished and reorganized form and with control having gradually passed to younger generations in the families.
"Bob Rich," Mr. Collins said, "was hit worse than I was." Mr. Rich had been designated by Stamford's Urban Redevelopment Commission to level the downtown and then build most of its office towers.
"He concentrated totally on Stamford," Mr. Collins said, "I was in Princeton and Greenwich as well, where the markets were stronger. But I made the same mistake by concentrating too much in a limited area, and at all costs I would never sign notes personally again."
"It's easy," Mr. Rich said, "to second guess. We had other projects, too, in Boston and Florida. But we had a mission in Stamford -- a pact with the city signed in 1960 -- and we followed through. The tragedy was not that we kept building but, that the city allowed so much more building, including what Collins built on the waterfront."
Three of Mr. Collins's Stamford buildings were foreclosed: 1010 Washington Boulevard, 60 Long Ridge Road and Nine West Broad Street. Large tenant bankruptcies, including those of Savin, the copier company; and Vestron, a video company, left enormous vacancies. As other leases began rolling over at up to 40 percent less than their original rents, the value of the buildings dropped below the mortgages.
One Collins residential complex, called Harbor House, was also foreclosed, while Harbor Plaza, a 725,000-square-foot office complex and marina overlooking Stamford harbor, was not affected.
It took five years for the Collins Development Corporation to negotiate a financial agreement with lenders and pay off overwhelming legal bills. And, Mr. Collins said, "it was painful to let go people who had worked for the company for years."
The former Collins Development, once housed in 12,000 square feet of offices overlooking Stamford harbor, is now called Collins Enterprises, occupying a modest 3,500 square feet of an office building it owns at 53 Forest Avenue in Greenwich.
In October, Mr. Collins, 65, a Princeton-trained architect, ardent yachtsman and hockey player, moved up to chairmanship of the business that he started in Greenwich in 1971. His son Arthur Jr., 39, became president, overseeing development and construction, and his other son Dwight, 37, became vice president in charge of the portfolio of rental properties. Arthur Sr.'s wife, Joan, manages sales, and Charles Collins, a nephew, handles construction.
"AFTER the 80's, smaller is better," the senior Mr. Collins said. "We're sticking with rentals now -- the acquisition and management of rental properties, and the future development of waterfront projects in other states."
Last year Collins Enterprises bought Greenwich Close and Winthrop House in Greenwich -- apartment buildings with 130 and 52 units, respectively, for a total of $13.5 million. Vacancies are rare, and rents, which could rise next year following renovations, range from $1,080 for a one-bedroom apartment to $1,580 for three bedrooms at Greenwich Close, and about $50 more at Winthrop House.
"We are interested in the entire Northeast," Dwight Collins said, "and we are actively looking for rental apartment properties in Boston and Philadelphia."
Knoxville, Tenn., has hired the Collinses to construct a mile-long stretch of boardwalks, marinas, shops, restaurants and, eventually, 150 condominium and 100 rental units along the Tennessee River. Completion is expected in about five years.
"Condos are going to be a difficult sell unless the locations are special or they are bargains," predicted the elder Mr. Collins. "Waterfront sites are special."
Arthur Collins Jr. has been involved since 1987 in a similar waterfront complex in Stamford called the Strand, approved by the Stamford Planning Commission in 1990. Development has been stalled by the real estate recession.
"Our option to buy the land from Northeast Utilities was recently extended," he said, but Northeast has stipulated that the option cannot be exercised for four and a half years, at which time the utility expects the market to have improved sufficiently to sell. The 14-acre project designed by Do H. Chung & Partners, was to cost $90 million, and was expected to redeem Stamford's South End from its hodgepodge of decaying industrial buildings.
When Northeast Utilities was looking for a Strand developer, the Stamford Partnership, a business organization headed by David Anderson, recommended Mr. Collins, "because he has a particular niche in waterfront development, and he has an excellent reputation here, in Greenwich and Princeton," Mr. Anderson said.
From 1984 to 1987, Collins Development spent $2.5 million on engineering, architectural and legal fees, land options and environmental studies for the Strand. In addition, Arthur Collins Sr. agreed to donate an additional $2 million in cash or construction to low-cost housing in the South End.
"HE is like that," said James Sandy, the Greenwich town planner. "He would do everything a town wanted. We imposed a million dollars in offsite improvements on his Greenwich Gables condominium complex, and he did them."
Construction at the 167-unit Greenwich Gables complex lagged after a brisk start in 1990, when 2,317-square-foot units were selling for $575,000. "The last 23 units are being built now," said Arthur Collins Jr. One-bedroom apartments and three-bedroom town houses will cost from $390,000 to $600,000.
Lyon Farm, a residential development in Greenwich, "was typical of Arthur Collins Sr.'s unique approach to development in the 70's," Mr. Sandy said, "with major perquisites for the community. He even built a covered bridge over a stream."
Lyon Farm has small clusters of a total of 191 single-family units, separated by open spaces. Part of the land was donated for a town park and another part is open space in perpetuity. Prices have increased from an original $100,000 to as high as $900,000.
"The elder Collins was not unique in his difficulties," Mr. Anderson said, "and it can happen again -- where the real estate and banking industries and government regulatory agencies go wrong. Too much money, loose regulations, overbuilding, and the banks start foreclosing on so many loans that they go under -- back to the F.D.I.C., to you and me."

HEADLINE: The World;
Latin Leaders Speak Gringo

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO

 BODY:
IT'S being billed as a meeting of the hemispheres, but when President Clinton addresses Latin America's leaders this week in Miami, it will have more than a passing resemblance to an evening at the University Club. The Latin American leaders include alumni of Yale, Columbia and the University of Michigan. And they see the United States not so much as the overbearing behemoth of Latin lore, but as a place where they studied, whose language they share and whose values they are increasingly embracing.
 This does not mean that all of South America has gone yanqui; the new rapport with North America is growing, in large part, only among the elites. But that is still enough of change to make this first hemispheric summit meeting since 1967 unlike any other. 
 For a quarter-century of accelerating travel, study and work in North America seems to have shorn many of the continent's leaders of their suspicions about the Northern colossus.
 
A Common Language
 The two halves of the hemisphere now speak the same economic language -- that of free trade between free markets. And if they still have bargaining to do on how fast South America will be admitted to a hemisphere-wide free trade zone, at least they can do much of it in English.
 Until the mid-1980's, the Latin countries had a penchant for repressive dictatorships and economies run to benefit the cronies of the powerful. The United States, whose banks were pressing for repayment of billions of dollars in loans, was an all-purpose villain. Now, after Southeast Asia, Latin America is the world's fastest growing regional economy and the fastest growing market for United States exports. And civilian democracy is the general rule.
 "It's similar to all those exchange and scholarship programs that chipped away at the Iron Curtain; the Latin American students have learned different ways of running their economies and their politics," said William S. Reese, president of Partners of the Americas, a private Washington-based group that promotes educational exchanges between the Americas.
 So far, this transformation has been limited to the middle and upper classes. And because the region has the world's worst income distribution, one result may be to widen already yawning social, cultural and economic gaps. "It's all very nice that almost all the Cabinet has attended American universities," a minister in Ecuador said recently. "But lower down in the ministries, all the bureaucrats attended the National University. There they had Marxist professors who taught them to love state companies and to equate foreign investment with theft."
 But the middle-class embrace of the United States is clear in many places where France, Spain or Portugal used to be the preferred places to tour or study. Take Brazil. Over the last two decades, the number of Brazilians visiting the United States has increased 12-fold, to 700,000 this year. And since the early 1960's, the number of Brazilians studying at American colleges has increased tenfold, to almost 5,000.
 Overall, South America's share of United States tourist and business visas more than doubled in the five years that ended in 1993, when it reached 21 percent. The number of subscribers to CNN has tripled in three years to almost 2 million. Last year, when Magic Johnson retired from professional basketball, it was front-page news in soccer-crazy Brazil -- a tribute to the influence of satellite television.
 The United States business school degree is now the universally sought after ticket to success. "Applications from Latin Americans have been growing at the rate of 20 percent a year for the last five years," said Thomas P. Gerrity, president of the Wharton school of the University of Pennsylvania, which now has 1,020 Latin American alumni.
 Indeed, the ornate Spanish-style presidential palaces of Latin America are increasingly filled with leaders who mowed lawns during summer jobs in the United States. Cesar Gaviria Trujillo, the former Colombian President who became Secretary General of the Organization of American States in September, studied for a year at Roosevelt High School in Fresno, Calif. Ecuador's President, Sixto Duran Ballen, was born in Boston and graduated from Columbia University. President Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru studied mathematics at the University of Michigan.
 Bolivia's President, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, grew up in the United States and speaks Spanish with an American accent. Brazil's President-elect, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, has lectured at Stanford and Princeton. And Mexico's new President, Ernesto Zedillo, earned a doctorate in economics from Yale. "The best U.S. investment in Latin America was not the Alliance for Progress, but the Fulbright scholars program," said Augusto Alvarez Rodrich, director of Peru Economico, the nation's leading business magazine.
 Having developed a global perspective and an insider's understanding of competitive capitalism, such people tend to return dissatisfied with crony capitalism, a system pockmarked by monopolies, state subsidies and high tariff barriers. But to say Latin America's elite soaked up American economics is not to say that they absorbed its civics lessons.
 Last year, a group of wealthy Colombian parents at Bogota's American school, the Colegio Nuevo Granada, sought to bar the children of American oil workers from admission.

The Rage to Kill Those Who Kill

BYLINE: By TOM KUNTZ 

 BODY:
SENTIMENT in favor of capital punishment is sweeping the land. This week five executions are scheduled -- three in Texas, one in Missouri and one in Indiana -- meaning that if there are no last-minute stays (always a possibility) the nation will pass yet another milestone in the modern era of the death penalty. Since the Supreme Court allowed states to resume executions in 1976, in no calendar week have more than four executions taken place.
 With states like New York moving to bring back the death penalty and moves afoot to streamline the judicial process so the condemned can no longer drag out their appeals, it seems an appropriate time to ask, once again: Will all this killing do any good? Will it deter crime? Is it cost effective? Or are we simply talking about retribution here -- real Old Testament stuff? 
 The data presented on Page 3 are intended to provide some talking points for the debate.
 Comparing state homicide rates released by the F.B.I. this weekend with state-by-state death penalty numbers certainly doesn't prove the case for deterrence. In states with large numbers of executions, murder rates remain persistently high.
 Of course, the data don't necessarily disprove the case either, since a complex web of social, economic and demographic factors drive murder rates.
 The numbers also provide an intriguing hint that the resurgent faith in executions may be more ambiguous than it seems. In the 18 years since they resumed, 254 have been put to death -- a tiny fraction of those convicted of murder and less than a tenth of the 2,948 currently condemned to die. TOM KUNTZ

Colliding Missions -- A special report.;
U.S. and Bosnia: How a Policy Changed

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times; The following article is based on reporting by Michael R. Gordon, Douglas Jehl and Elaine Sciolino and was written by Mr. Gordon.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
It was the Sunday after Thanksgiving when Anthony Lake sat down in his Massachusetts farmhouse to work on a confidential memo to President Clinton, conceding reluctantly that American policy in Bosnia had run into a brick wall.
For months, Mr. Lake, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, had been talking about the need to combine the threat of force with the effort of diplomacy to protect towns designated by the United Nations as "safe areas" in Bosnia and quell the fighting. Now Bihac, a Muslim town in northwestern Bosnia that the United Nations had promised to protect, was on the verge of falling to the Serbs. 
 In his three-page note, drafted with the help of Alexander R. Vershbow, his top aide for European affairs, Mr. Lake said Washington had failed to persuade Britain and France to support NATO air strikes to try to save the town. Instead of pressing further for bombings, Mr. Lake recommended that the United States concentrate on trying to secure a cease-fire and on stepping up its diplomacy.
"Bihac's fall has exposed the inherent contradictions in trying to use NATO air power coercively against the Bosnian Serbs when our allies have troops on the ground attempting to maintain impartiality in performing a humanitarian mission," he wrote. "The stick of military pressure seems no longer viable."
From his house overlooking a pasture full of cattle, Mr. Lake faxed the memo to the White House, which in turn faxed it to Mr. Clinton, who approved it. Still smarting from his setback inmidterm elections, the President was at his Camp David retreat and had been involved only episodically in the Bosnian issue.
The next day Mr. Lake's conclusions were formally embraced at a meeting of the President's top advisers that neither Mr. Clinton nor Vice President Al Gore attended, and American policy on the 32-month-old war in Bosnia reached an important milestone.
The threat of bombing raids to pressure the Serbs to go along with a peace settlement would be put aside for now. Having failed to stop the assault on Bihac because it could not bend the wills of Britain and France, the United States concluded that it was more important to re-establish unity in NATO. But to do so, the leader of the alliance had to take a back seat to its junior partners, Britain and France.
The story of how and why the allies failed to act in Bihac, pieced together from interviews with American, British and French officials, goes well beyond the Balkans. It is a tale of the changing dynamics within the 45-year old NATO alliance, which is still searching for a role in a world with no clear adversary such as that embodied for decades by the Soviet Union.
With the common enemy gone, it has become increasingly hard for the United States, Britain and France to find the point where their national security interests converge. The United States, unwilling to send troops into Bosnia until the fighting stopped, was unable to impose its will on European allies that do have soldiers on the ground there. Washington managed to ease the worst NATO dispute since the 1956 Suez crisis not by leading the alliance to a consensus, but by acquiescing to the British and the French.
Last February, in response to a mortar attack that killed 68 people in a Sarajevo marketplace, President Clinton successfully pushed the alliance to create a weapons-free zone around the Bosnian capital. This time, Mr. Clinton contacted only President Francois Mitterrand of France. But the French, the architects last year of the "safe area" policy, were now siding with the British, who had been forced to go along with the threat of air strikes last February, and the Europeans prevailed.
NATO's unity was preserved. But a solution to the long war in Bosnia seemed more elusive than ever, and the United States is now looking for ways to keep the Serbs from feeling they have a completely free hand.
 
The Rift
Shift on Embargo Strains Allies
 The low point in the dispute between the United States and Western Europe over Bosnia came three weeks ago. Frustrated by the Bosnian Serbs' refusal to accept an international peace proposal, and by the Western Europeans' unwillingness to use military pressure, Congress ordered a significant change: as of mid-November, the United States would no longer enforce the arms embargo against the Bosnian Government.
Though the move had been telegraphed in the Congressional record since August, and its importance was more symbolic than substantive, it led to bitter recriminations within NATO. The leader of the alliance took the extraordinary step of saying it would no longer share intelligence with its closest allies or use its ships to monitor the weapons ban on the Bosnians.
As the Americans and Western Europeans were squabbling, the fighting in Bosnia was heating up.
Long frustrated over being cut off from food and relief supplies, the mainly Muslim Bosnian Government troops in Bihac opened an offensive in early November to push out of the enclave. The Clinton Administration refused to condemn the attacks, reasoning that the Muslims were victims in the war and were trying to reclaim their own territory. But Foreign Minister Alain Juppe of France and Foreign SecretaryDouglas Hurd of Britain complained that the Muslims were now acting as aggressors.
The United States and Western Europe might simply have agreed to disagree on the wisdom and morality of the offensive, had the Muslims prevailed for more than a few weeks. But the Muslim breakout from Bihac was risky -- so much so that Croatian military leaders warned the Bosnian Government against launching the attack.
Bihac was near Krajina, the Serb-controlled area of Croatia, and the Croatian Serbs soon joined in the fighting. According to an American official, 2,000 to 4,000 Croatian Serbs joined some 10,000 Bosnian Serbs in the fray, using supplies from Serbia, despite an agreement by Serbia's President, Slobodan Milosevic, to cut off all aid to the Bosnian Serb combatants.
"We saw no shortage of ammunition, no shortage of supplies on the part of the Bosnian Serbs as they conducted the Bihac counteroffensive," a senior Administration official said.
The Bosnian Government apparently had not calculated that the United States and its Western European allies would allow the Krajina Serbs to cross an international border in support of their Serbian brethren. The Serbs were also supported by Muslims loyal to a secessionist Muslim leader, Fikret Abdic.
The Croatian Serbs' intervention was decisive, and the Muslims were beaten back.
In a move that would set off alarm bells in Washington, the Croatian Defense Minister, Gojko Susak, signaled to Peter W. Galbraith, the American Ambassador to Croatia, that his Government planned to respond to the Serbian assault by entering the war. A cross-border triumph by the Croatian Serbs and Bosnian Serbs threatened the Croatian Government's ability to reclaim the third of its territory that fell to the Serbs in fighting there in 1991. Mr. Galbraith sent an urgent message to Washington on Nov. 11, passing on the Croatian warning.
The Clinton Administration feared that a Croatian Government offensive would lead to a wider war in the Balkans that could even prompt Serbia to join in.
 
The New Strategy
Making One More Exclusion Zone
 On Nov. 12, the day Washington stopped enforcing the arms embargo against the Bosnian Government, Defense Secretary William J. Perry and Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met in Mr. Perry's office at the Pentagon. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Mr. Lake, traveling with President Clinton in Asia, were represented by their senior aides.
Throughout the consultations on Bihac, Mr. Clinton was distracted by Asian economic issues, the push to win Congressional support for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and forging a relationship with Republicans in Congress.
The goal at the meeting in Mr. Perry's office was to draft a plan to keep the Serbs from taking Bihac and keep the Croats from joining the fight.
"Our No. 1 objective was to prevent the war from widening," said a senior Administration official who attended the meeting. "The only leverage we had was to apply an exclusion zone."
The plan seemed straightforward enough. Washington had won NATO approval for establishing zones free of heavy weapons around Sarajevo and Gorazde earlier this year. This would just be one more.
Tanks, artillery pieces and other heavy weapons would be forbidden within 12 miles of Bihac and would be subject to NATO air strikes if the Serbs violated the ban. Since the zone would include part of Croatia, new Security Council and NATO resolutions authorizing the move would be sought.
The next day, American ambassadors throughout Europe received an urgent message to begin emergency consultations with allies on the plan. Meanwhile, Washington sent a message to the President of Croatia, Franjo Tudjman, urging restraint.
But the plan proved to be a hard sell, and the Clinton Administration gradually shrunk the proposed exclusion area, trying to make it more acceptable to the allies.
Finally, it proposed a six-mile zone that would not include Croatian territory. That way, the Administration figured, the zone would not need a Security Council vote, with the risk of a veto by Russia, France or Britain.
But even the shrunken zone was too much for the Western Europeans to swallow.
For his part, Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose, the British commander of United Nations peacekeeping troops in Bosnia, refused to acknowledge that Croatian Serbs had joinedthe fighting, even though the United States shared intelligence with London and the United Nations indicating that they had done so.
Clinton Administration officials say they believe that General Rose and his French colleague, Lieut. Gen. Bertrand de Lapresle, commander of United Nations peacekeeping troops in all of the former Yugoslavia, have been taking their cues from their own Governments rather than from the United Nations, a charge the generals deny.
In their deliberations with the Americans, the British and French argued that the Serbs would content themselves with the retaking of lost territory around Bihac and would not threaten the civilians in the town. London and Paris were also concerned that the establishment of a new zone could prompt the Serbs to retaliate against their peacekeeping troops in Bosnia.
Some American officials argued that Britain and France wanted the Muslim army to suffer a resounding defeat at Bihac so that the Bosnian Government would give up its effort to reclaim land it has lost across Bosnia. Western European officials deny that that is their motivation, but suspicions of this sort contributed to a tone of sourness in the alliance touched off by the United States' decision not to enforce the arms embargo.
Indeed, tensions between the Western European allies and Washington became so high at one point that Mr. Juppe, the French Foreign Minister, suggested that the United States might be covertly supplying the Bosnian Government with arms in violation of the weapons embargo against Bosnian combatants. Peter Tarnoff, the Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs, flew to Paris and told Mr. Juppe that the charges were false.
The French Foreign Minister did not back down. "I take note of your position," he said coldly.
A senior Clinton Administration official observed: "This was a terrible time within the alliance to get a decision. It was directly tied to disenchantment within the alliance with the Americans. They saw us moving toward unilateral actions on the embargo. It greatly complicated our ability to get action."
With little support evident for the establishment of a weapons exclusion zone, the Administration prepared a fall-back plan. If the Western Europeans did not agree that the Serbs' advances to date warranted action, perhaps they could at least agree on what type of future Serbian attacks would justify NATO air strikes if the Serbs kept pressing toward Bihac.
Mr. Lake later outlined this plan in a classified memo to Mr. Clinton on Nov. 18.
The idea would be to get the Europeans to agree on measures that would be "triggered" if the Serbs moved beyond the reclamation of lost territory near Bihac, shelled Bihac with artillery or harmed United Nations peacekeepers, Mr. Lake wrote.
The possible response included the establishment of some sort of exclusion zone, air strikes on Serbian artillery positions in Croatia that were attacking Bihac, air attacks against Serbian surface-to-air radar missile systems in Croatia, hot pursuit of Serbian planes into Croatian air space and air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces attacking the town.
But this plan also had little appeal for the Western Europeans.
 
The Mixed Signals
As Allies Debate, Serbs Advance
 As Thanksgiving approached, the Muslim-controlled territory was dwindling by the day.
To stop Serbian bombing attacks, NATO launched a bombing raid on Nov. 21 against the Udbina airfield in Serb-held Croatia. But General Lapresle of the United Nations instructed NATO forces to avoid hitting approximately 15 Serb planes kept there so as not to unduly aggravate the Serbs.
Western European officials said that the strikes showed the alliance's resolve, but the Bosnian and Croatian Serbs appeared to have concluded that the West was afraid to take tough action and continued their assault.
In New York, Madeleine K. Albright, the chief American delegate to the United Nations, helped assemble a last ditch "stabilization plan."
The United Nations Secretariat had complained that the weapons exclusion zone would not work because the 1,200 poorly armed Bangladeshi peacekeepers in Bihac would not be able to monitor the area. So a tiny sliver of territory less than four miles across and six miles long would be declared an "enforced safe area."
Under that plan, all the Bosnian Government troops in the area would leave or be disarmed. Only 500 Muslim policemen would remain to keep order in the town of 70,000. Nationalist Serb attacks would be deterred with wide-ranging air strikes at ammunition dumps and supply bases throughout Bosnia, not just the weapons directly threatening Bihac.
For two weeks, the Western Europeans argued that the Serbs would stop short of Bihac, but the Serbs were now on the town's doorstep. Pinprick air strikes, the Americans feared, would no longer keep them from overrunning the town.
Still, the Europeans made it clear they did not like the idea of wide-ranging air strikes. Soon after Ms. Albright outlined the plan in New York, Robert E. Hunter, the American Ambassador to NATO, presented it in Brussels, making it clear that the United States would not insist on the "strategic strikes."
On the day before Thanksgiving, to back up his ambassadors, President Clinton called Mr. Mitterrand, who the Americans calculated could play a pivotal role in persuading other Western European nations to go along with the plan. He asked for French support, telling Mr. Mitterrand that Bihac could fall in two days and that a Serbian takeover might prompt the Croats to enter the war. There could be thousands more refugees, more killing and an escalation of the war, he said.
President Mitterrand said he thought Bihac might not even last that long and that he needed to consult with his Foreign Minister and Prime Minister, who were traveling abroad.
On Thanksgiving Day, President Mitterand called back to offer only qualified support.
The French President said that Serbian artillery and troops were near Bihac and that they were not afraid of NATO planes. Mr. Mitterrand said that he was skeptical about the idea of some sort of exclusion zone but believed that some "limited measures" were needed, according to American officials.
"I appreciate that," officials quote Mr. Clinton as saying. He added that it was important to persuade Britain and other members of the alliance to go along.
Mr. Mitterrand reportedly said: "We must do what we can without waiting. Do you want a NATO decision?"
Mr. Clinton replied that it was important to move as quickly as possible, American officials said.
The stage for a NATO decision was finally set, but the alliance did not act.
In fact, although Mr. Mitterrand had voiced support for limited measures in the conversation with Mr. Clinton, the French Ambassador at NATO, Jacques Blot, argued that the new American plan would require more peacekeeping troops and hinted that Washington should supply them.
The Americans were angry that the French had not followed through, and French officials at NATO continued to complain that the Americans were demanding action but reluctant to expose their troops to the risk of Serb retaliation.
 
The Second Thoughts
Alienating Allies With No Gains

On the day after Thanksgiving, Mr. Perry and Mr. Christopher reviewed the maneuvering at a one-on-one lunch and concluded that the American demand for action was hurting the NATO alliance without tangible gains.
Mr. Christopher was scheduled to go to Brussels the following week to outline American thinking on how to expand the NATO alliance, and State Department officials did not want the trip to be overshadowed by reports of infighting over Bosnia.
Mr. Lake reached a similar conclusion. Two days later, Mr. Lake and Mr. Vershbow, his aide, drafted their memo for Mr. Clinton, noting that the American effort "to use NATO air strikes to prevent the fall of Bihac has only intensified trans-Atlantic frictions."
Mr. Lake recommended that the Administration put aside for now its push to win support for NATO air strikes to protect Bihac and focus instead on trying to arrange a cease-fire in Bihac and on diplomacy.
Mr. Perry was the first to articulate the new policy, appearing on the NBC News program "Meet the Press" two days later and proclaiming the Serbs' gains to be irreversible. Now that the Administration had given up on persuading the allies to use air strikes to save Bihac, Mr. Perry sought to justify the change in policy by arguing that air strikes were not that useful anyway.
The next day, a "principals meeting" of Cabinet-level officials was held. By and large, the officials accepted the conclusions in Mr. Lake's memo. But Ms. Albright, who took part in the meeting from New York via video monitor, was troubled. If the allies signaled that there would be no air strikes, would they not forfeit whatever leverage they had over the Serbs, she asked?
Mr. Lake said NATO warplanes would still be available for close air support, meaning they could protect United Nations peacekeeping troops and Sarajevo and Gorazde if the United Nations asked for such action.
Mr. Christopher said it was not realistic to assume that "strategic" air strikes were possible, meaning wide-ranging strikes through Bosnia. While such attacks should not be ruled out, he said, emphasizing that possibility would raise false expectations.
 
The New Policy
Going Back To the Future

Mr. Perry's disclosure of the new Administration approach came before the White House had time to devise a plan to pitch the new policy publicly. Critics said the United States was merely inviting further attacks by the Serbs and had abandoned its leadership role in the Western alliance.
Even some Administration officials wondered if Washington might have prevailed if it had made it clear earlier this year that its support for international peace efforts depended on the allies' support for air strikes to punish the Serbs if they spurned an accord.
Stung by the criticism, the White House insisted that Washington was simply beating a tactical retreat in the face of Western European objections. Mr. Perry, officials said, would explore the idea of establishing new weapons exclusion zones around other Muslim safe areas to deter Serb attacks when he met with Western defense ministers later this month.
But the larger issue was how the West would gain leverage over the Serbs without a credible threat of force.
Even advocates of the policy shift seem daunted by the task ahead. "The road will be very difficult," Mr. Christopher acknowledged on Friday.

HEADLINE: 'Nothing to Build On': Haiti Starting at Zero

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Dec. 2

 BODY:
The ambulance for the only public maternity hospital in this capital city of 2 million people sits rusting on cinder blocks in the parking lot, its tires long gone. Fetid sewage water surrounds the hospital, clumps of garbage bobbing through the thick green algae. The hospital grounds are littered with broken and abandoned equipment: a battered sterilizing drum, a pile of old tires, a gurney with two wheels, a rusty boiler.
Inside the hospital, just one example of the overwhelming problems facing President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's new Government despite initial signs of hope, it does not get better. A half-dozen women, groaning and crying as they begin to go into labor, lie on a hallway floor because the beds are filled. 
 The birthing room has no equipment other than a half-dozen tables. The sterilizer has broken down again. There is no medication of any kind. There are not even swabs to take a culture. In the shabby room that serves as a laboratory, the refrigerator is not working, a microscope is broken and so is the X-ray machine.
The maternity hospital has no running water.
"Sometimes we have enough money for a water truck; otherwise we just walk around the neighborhood to a water source," said the lab attendant, gesturing futilely at the taped-up faucet in the sink and then miming carrying a heavy bucket of water. Even water is often a private, rather than a public resource in Haiti -- 39 percent of the population has no access to safe water -- and this is the way much of it gets delivered, even to hospitals.
"There is nothing to build on here," said Col. Lionel M. Nelson, an American Army doctor detailed to advise the Ministry of Health, as he shook his head in amazement and distress. "There is simply no infrastructure. This is a country starting at zero with three strikes against it. I don't see how they can make it."
It has been six weeks since President Aristide was delivered back to office in an American Army helicopter and three weeks since he assembled a Government. Thus far, he has won praise from American and foreign officials for his policy of reconciliation, a wary silence from the tiny, immensely wealthy, light-skinned elite who feared a revolution and -- at least for now -- a hopeful patience in the slums and shantytowns where people who must bathe in sewage hope to see their lives bettered.
"Aristide is back, and the sky has not fallen as many feared it would," said William L. Swing, the United States Ambassador, who has been intensely involved in the transition. "Overall the spirit is pretty good."
The Ambassador continued: "The President has made a lot of wise decisions. He's appointed a broad-based Cabinet. He's been an advocate of reconciliation in a country that probably rivals South Africa as a place of historical divisions. I think he's probably come back with a greater appreciation that he is now the President of the entire country and must reach out to them all."
In the hotels now, men with suits and briefcases come and go, speaking of guaranteed loan plans, replacing the hordes of sweating, blue-jeaned journalists covering the showdown with the old military Government. Bankers, foreign aid bureaucrats, businessmen and investors are ready, American officials estimate, to pump a half-billion dollars into this beleaguered country during the next year, although it is expected to take months before real effects are felt.
The American Airline flights from New York and Miami are filled with returning Haitians checking so much luggage it is a wonder the planes can take off. Their hand baggage is shrink-wrapped in heavy plastic so they cannot stuff in more on the way to the gate.
The army, the police and their thuggish plainclothes extensions -- Fraph, attaches, Tontons Macoute -- are no longer terrorizing the population, killing, beating, raping and stealing. That alone is a difference of night and day.
"People can sleep," said Colin Granderson, executive director of the United Nations Civilian Mission here, summing up simply what is an astonishing change.
"The situation has improved tremendously, no doubt about it," Mr. Granderson said. "The factional violence many people expected has not occurred, and much of the credit for that has to go to the President himself. Reconciliation is not just a hollow word."
President Aristide, still in a security cocoon, has become more visible in recent days, journeying to Jacmel to survey the damage of Hurricane Gordon, which sent mudslides across houses, villages and roads, killing about 800 people and demonstrating once again the lack of Government services. He delighted a crowd by saying the storm should be renamed "Attache."
He played host at the national palace -- the "house of the people," he calls it -- the other day for a group of some 500 labor union officials, many of them near tears as he hugged and greeted them. But they also clamored with requests and grievances. The President sternly lectured: "Discipline. Order. We must have democracy. But we can't have democracy without order and discipline."
But Haiti is a land like no other.
Born of a slave revolt, its 190 years of existence have been marked by what Alex Dupuy, a Haitian scholar at Wesleyan University, described as "a predatory state that preys on the population at large." There has never really been an ideal of a civil polity. Even the holiday celebrating Haiti's first ruler, Jean Jacques Dessalines, a black field slave turned rebel general, marks not his birth, but his assassination by mulatto rivals in 1806, two years after independence, beginning the important color line here.
Successive governments have taxed, stolen and extorted, but provided little in the way of basic services like roads, schools or even water. A symbol of the last Government is the road leading to the house of the former police chief, Lieut. Col. Michel Francois. Even the streets in the center of town here have crater-size holes, and the roads turn to dirt and mud -- the rich simply buy Range Rovers -- but virtually the only smoothly paved road in the country stretches for more than a mile directly to the chief's former house, the macadam abruptly stopping at the end of the property line.
Startling statistics abound. There have been 21 Constitutions and 41 heads of state, 9 declaring themselves leader for life and, with some overlap, 29 either overthrown or assassinated in office. Even before the coup, it was the poorest country in the hemisphere, with a per capita income of $370 a year; it is even worse now.
Two-thirds of the population is illiterate. Only 5 percent of eligible young people are in Government high schools. There are only six doctors per 200,000 people, but many of these connive to get assigned to hospital payrolls in the capital, doing little work because there is no equipment or medicine. Some 15 percent of the children die by the age of 5. Half the population is malnourished. Curable diseases like malaria and tuberculosis flourish.
"This place does not lend itself to a quick fix," said Colonel Nelson, the American Army doctor, part of a team of reserve officers attached to the 358th Civil Affairs Brigade. With civilian occupations like forestry, Federal emergency management, law, banking and even a Philadelphia deputy mayor for transportation, they have been mobilized to advise the new ministries. It is proving a daunting task.
"You see bed after bed of people dying who don't have to -- it just breaks your heart," Colonel Nelson said. "Eighty percent of the equipment in public hospitals is not working. No water for a maternity hospital? That's typical of every hospital I've seen."
Indeed, an early study by the Army War College warned of the difficulties of reconstruction, saying bluntly, "There is almost nothing to build on." Haiti, the study went on to say, has been "so degraded by poverty, illiteracy, malnutrition, disease, violence, corruption, overpopulation, rapid urbanization, deforestation and soil erosion as to raise serious questions about its continued survival as a society and as an independent nation-state."
In addition to the vast difficulties of turning the Government functional -- further hampered because office equipment, supplies and files were made off with in a final act of what an American official described as "rapine and pillage" -- there is an underlying fear of what will happen when the American troops, already moving out their equipment and about 200 soldiers a day, finally leave.
"There has not been enough disarmament, of the attaches and Fraph in particular," warned Mr. Granderson, the United Nations official. "There are smoldering fears that after the U.S. troops leave, these people will come out of their bolt-holes.
"Many Haitians are not convinced," he continued. "They have lived through periods of stability which didn't last before. There is a deeply ingrained streak of pessimism. There is an amount of confidence invested in the U.S. forces which, unfortunately, has not rubbed off on the U.N. peacekeepers who will replace them."
The guns, Prime Minister Smarck Michel said, are "a serious problem," adding, "The amount of automatic weapons we have seen in the streets the past three years does not conform to the number of weapons that have been gathered."
But of more immediate moment, the Prime Minister said in an interview in his office in an ornate Italianate mansion built in the 1950's by a police chief whose official salary was $200 a month, was that "everything has to be done, whether it's cleaning up the streets or putting toilets in the schools."
"Going from a predator to a servant doesn't conform to tradition," he said. "This is a world of misery, a world of hunger, of children not going to school, of bad roads. But with the time it takes to go through proper channels, the conditions of disbursement -- we may see nothing in help until April or May."
The old Government had left nothing in the offices but truckloads of garbage that had to be carted away, and when he took over, the Prime Minister said, "there were no vehicles, no typewriters, no computers and almost no pencils."

HEADLINE: TRADE AGREEMENT ENDS LONG DEBATE, BUT NOT CONFLICTS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
The enormous global trade agreement approved by Congress this week does not mean an end to trade conflicts, economists and Administration officials say, much as arms control does not mean an end to strife. If anything, the biggest trade accord in two generations will clear the way for new struggles over a different breed of trade barriers, which may prove more daunting than those it resolved.
The 22,000-page General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, known as GATT, dealt with many of the enormously sensitive political issues facing the international trading system, including the gradual reduction of tariffs on agricultural products and the protection of intellectual property rights, like copyrights and patents. 
 But the conflicts the Clinton Administration and others see ahead will involve a whole new generation of issues that mirror many foreign policy problems facing the United States today: questions of how countries act within their borders -- like labor conditions, environmental standards and human rights -- rather than simply how they interact with other states.
These were some of the most emotional matters brought up by GATT opponents in the debate that preceded Thursday's Senate vote. But many targets of these complaints, like China and Indonesia, have already told Washington that they consider these questions to be none of its business.
All of those issues are outside of GATT and many believe they should stay that way.
Talks have already begun, however, on another set of thorny issues that were left over when the GATT negotiations ended, including the movement of "cultural" products, like movies, across national borders and the opening of markets to foreign insurance companies, securities firms and banks. Those are also the subject of a number of bilateral negotiations, particularly between the United States and Japan.
These new issues are likely to be played out in new forums. For many reasons, this GATT, in fact, may prove to be the last sweeping global agreement of its kind. No one is eager to slog through another 12 years of talks with such a huge array of players, each with radically different interests.
And during the recent debate, members of Congress repeatedly expressed frustration that the expansion of the GATT was so vast, and its effects so unpredictable, that none of the experts and lobbyists who descended on Capitol Hill could come up with trustworthy estimates of how much the American economy would benefit, or how many American workers would lose their jobs because of increased foreign imports.
"In the end most everyone voted on an emotion about freer trade," one senior Clinton Administration official said on Friday. "No one wanted to look like an economic Neanderthal."
To make the next set of agreements easier to negotiate and more understandable, many believe the drive to liberalize commerce will continue largely on a regional basis, through accords in Asia, the Americas and Europe.
President Clinton has already begun down that road, pressing Asian leaders at a summit meeting last month in Indonesia to create a regional free trade area that will go beyond the minimum rules set out in the GATT accord. He will do it again starting on Friday in Miami, when he gathers the first summit meeting of leaders from Central and South America since 1967.
"It is difficult to negotiate with over 100 countries on things so politically sensitive" as labor rights or the environment, the United States Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor, said today. "Regionally, you have a lot more leverage."
But the Administration argues that without rules set by GATT, it would not have the political backing to pursue a broader free trade agenda around the world. "To grow trade, we are going to have to create more and more credibility for trade," Mr. Kantor said. "If the rules are not fair, the playing field not level, we will not have the credibility among the American public that free trade is to our benefit."
The global trade pact Congress approved established the precedent that the common barriers to trade that countries have used for decades at their borders -- tariffs on imports, quotas on the amount of rice or the number of cars or VCR's that can enter a country, regulations that domestically made products need a certain percentage of "local content" -- must be gradually eliminated. Of course, even when the new agreement is fully enforced more than a decade from now, many such barriers will remain. Future arguments, however, will not be over whether they should fall, but how fast.
But opponents of the GATT agreement have complained, for example, that it would not allow the United States to stop the import of products made by child labor, by companies that pollute the environment, or that force companies to keep wages artificially low.
Few countries, however, are prepared to allow international trade inspectors to come into their factories and press questions like this: "Excuse me, how old is that little girl who is gluing the leather soles of those shoes?" or "Could you show us how you treat the chemicals coming out of this factory before you dump them in the river?" Or even: "Why do you imprison workers who demand to make more than 50 cents an hour?"
The chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, Laura Tyson, said after the GATT victory: "Are these really international trade issues at all? Ralph Nader is willing to have the United States pay a higher price for goods because we eliminate imports from countries that don't adhere to environmental standards we consider to be acceptable. But he doesn't tell us the pricetag that consumers should be willing to pay."
If anything, the Clinton Administration has backed away from linking such domestic political issues to trade. The underlying message of its decision earlier this year to remove China's human rights record from the question of whether to renew its preferential trade status is that commerce is commerce, and connecting it to politics is just an invitation for America's competitors -- Japan, the European Union -- to move into markets while the United States stands on principle.
Moreover, getting 124 countries as varied as Malaysia and Sweden to agree on common labor or environmental standards would be next to impossible. President Suharto of Indonesia made it clear to President Clinton last month that he was not interested in talking about why his country throws labor leaders in jail. Singapore's founder, Lee Kuan Yew, has forcefully argued against Western interference in "Asian values," including a national right to economic development that supercedes most individual rights.
The result of such divisions is that the world's trading partners may determine that rather than trying to hit another global home run, they should try something a bit less ambitious.
C. Fred Bergsten, the president of the Institute for International Economics and a key participant in the past two Asian economic summits, contends that regional agreements, as long as they do not create warring trading blocs, can speed overall change. If Europe sees the Asians and the United States sign a regional economic agreement, "it is likely to want to match or better the terms." Fear of a closer alliance between the United States and the Pacific nations, he contends, was a major factor in persuading European countries to finish long-stalled negotiations on GATT last year.
But the doom of global trade agreements has been predicted before, and those predictions have proven wrong. "I thought they were over for good in the early 1980's," said John H. Jackson, a professor of law at the University of Michigan and one of the leading authorities on the workings of the GATT. "They seemed to be a mess, out of control. But there is something systemic that happens when you get so many countries together, and the issues rise to the top political level. I wouldn't be surprised if, after a number of years of stepping back, everyone decides they need to do this again."

HEADLINE: Patrols and a New Law Are Combating Airport Hustlers

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
Sabrina Hacker had heard all about the con artists, robbers and other criminals that make New York unwelcoming for tourists like herself. But she wrote the whole thing off as sheer hysteria and hype.
That was until she and a travel companion caught a taxi from Kennedy International Airport to their Manhattan hotel during a visit last year. The trip cost her $ 400: $200 cash and $200 in travelers' checks. 
 "When he told me the price, I asked him if he was joking," Ms. Hacker, a 22-year-old banker, said last week during a telephone interview from her home in Thomaseerg, Germany, which is 10 miles south of Bonn. The driver held them captive, she said, driving around midtown for 15 minutes until she paid up.
"Everybody on the plane told me to take only yellow cabs," Ms. Hacker said. "But the man who approached me outside the baggage claim area told me yellow cabs only go to Brooklyn and Harlem. And I fell for it. He seemed honest."
Ms. Hacker's experience illustrates just how vulnerable tourists are to scams that many New Yorkers are already on to. Many of the crimes go unreported, but Port Authority Police issue several thousand summonses each year at La Guardia, Kennedy and Newark International airports, officials said.
The situation has become so alarming that airlines have begun showing videos aboard international flights bound for New York, warning passengers of potential hustlers. Warning posters have been tacked up in bathrooms and along other walls throughout the airports.
And officials, worrying about loss of the money tourists bring to the local economy, have stepped up patrols at the airports and toughened laws against airport hustlers. Under a new state law that took effect on Nov. 1, ground-transportation hustlers face up to $1,500 in fines and 45 days in jail. Seventy-five illegal drivers have been arrested since the law was enacted, said Sgt. Carl Harrison of the Port Authority Police. In the past, hustlers faced only $50 fines.
Last year, Port Authority Police issued summonses charging nearly 2,000 people with being limousine and baggage hustlers, said Tom Middlemiss, an authority spokesman. The Port Authority, which operates the three airports, has teamed up with the Queens District Attorney's Office to enforce the law.
Hustling charges include people who pretend to help with luggage and then either charge the tourist dearly or steal the bags; limousine driver who solicit riders without previous arrangements, and cab drivers who overcharge.
"Illegal ground transportation hustling has long been a problem at our airports," said the Queens District Attorney, Richard A. Brown. "Passengers are often greeted by aggressive hustlers who block their way, grab their luggage or forcefully encourage them into their cars. Then these unscrupulous hustlers charge exorbitant fares and at times even detain passengers physically or by holding their luggage as ransom until such fares are paid. We will not tolerate the hustlers."
As part of the campaign, begun last month for the winter travel season, a team of undercover officers dressed as tourists strolled through the international arrivals building at Kennedy Airport on Friday, looking for drivers making illegal solicitations, but few were working this day.
Officer Gerald Silva, 27, from the Bronx, was dressed in black jeans, sunglasses and a tan thigh-length coat. At times, he pushed a baggage cart. His partner, Officer Michael Guarnier, 32, a Brooklyn native, wore jeans and a black leather jacket. Some days they carry airline tickets and baggage to pull off the act.
They passed through throngs of tourists and legitimate drivers who held placards bearing the names of passengers; sometimes criminals go so far as to hold up name cards.
Officer Guarnier said the hustlers catch people off guard because many are distressed after hours and sometimes days of traveling. The hustlers prey on foreigners, the police said, because of the language barrier.
In Ms. Hacker's case, which happened in July 1993, she filed charges and the driver, Doron Guez, was charged three months ago with theft, said Michael Aloise, an assistant district attorney in Queens. He paid restitution and was fined $1,000, Mr. Aloise said.

HEADLINE: Peace Moves In the Mideast Cheer Turkey

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Turkey

 BODY:
As they survey the stirrings of peace in the Middle East, Turkish diplomats are pondering whether their own country might not be poised to revive some of its former glory as a regional power.
Yet when Prime Minister Tansu Ciller voyaged through the region in November, she quickly discovered the kind of powder keg that could confront Turkey. An impromptu visit to Libya inspired Western worries that she was legitimizing Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi; in Palestinian-run Gaza she raised eyebrows and ire by speaking of Israel as the "promised land" of the Jews, and she provoked a furor on the Israeli right by calling on Palestinian leaders in East Jerusalem because the visit was viewed as symbolic recognition of a would-be Palestinian state. 
 While her journey puzzled commentators back home, it underlined what might be a crossroads for a land of 60 million with an imperial past that feels it deserves more attention but is constrained by that same history from projecting itself too forcefully.
Turkey, for example, is crucial to the United States effort to maintain the embargo on neighboring Iraq. And its geography provides one vast land bridge between the Balkans, Central Asia and the Middle East.
Yet Turkey has been striving to find a new international role since the cold war ended and stripped away its defining task as NATO's easternmost bulwark against the Soviet Union.
"Two years ago, Turkey looked toward the Turkic states of Central Asia" to spread its influence, said a Western diplomat in Ankara, "but enthusiasm has waned."
The overtures produced suspicions in Russia and Iran that the modern Turks were dusting off the imperial dreams of the Ottoman sultans. But President Suleyman Demirel has denied this.
"We, as the Turkish Republic, do not regard the geographical region that is created by our countries as a future area of influence or a region of competition," President Demirel told a meeting of Central Asian Turkic states in Istanbul in October.
While Turkish diplomats weigh a possible role in the region, reconciliation among its Arab neighbors holds out many dividends for Turkey in at least two areas.
First, if Iraq's recognition of Kuwait leads to the lifting of the United Nations embargo, one of Turkey's gateways to the Persian Gulf will reopen, oil will resume flowing through Iraq's pipelines across Turkey and trade will revive.
"This is of vital importance to Turkey," said Ozdem Sanberk, the Foreign Ministry's ranking diplomat in Ankara.
Second, if Syria joins the Middle East peace effort, Turkey hopes that this will give Turkish traders access to a rich new market from Israel to Saudi Arabia. The Turkish Government is also hoping that a peace-minded President Hafez el-Assad of Syria will draw his support from the Kurdish separatists who have been waging war in southeastern Turkey for a decade.
So when Mrs. Ciller went to the Middle East, Mr. Sanberk said, she was showing that "whether she said this or that, the main interest of Turkey is to be present there as a peaceful power."
Could that be construed as a revival of Ottoman ambitions translated into economic dreams?
"The burden of the past exists everywhere in the Middle East," Mr. Sanberk said, "but it is up to us to overcome it."

HEADLINE: In Their Backyard;
Homeless Shelter for Men in Rural Area Provokes Outrage

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHESTER, N.Y., Nov. 28

 BODY:
For roughly a decade Thomas Wall did not worry about living down a country road from a barracks-style shelter crowded with hundreds of homeless men from New York City. He has even donated old clothes and empty refundable bottles to the shelter residents.
But a few years ago things began to change around this town of 9,100. Mr. Wall started finding syringes on his lawn. One day police officers appeared at his door and asked permission to search his fields; a homeless man had assaulted a shelter guard and fled. Recently, Mr. Wall discarded two large trash barrels full of empty liquor bottles that had littered his property. 
 He has installed a burglar alarm in his house and won't let his young daughters, ages 6 and 11, play alone in the yard anymore. "I'm very concerned about the shelter," said Mr. Wall, who lives on Old Oxford Road about a quarter mile from the camp. "I've had to change the way I live just to be sure that my family is safe."
Mr. Wall's experience illustrates how dramatically this section of Orange County has turned against Camp La Guardia, an old-fashioned homeless shelter that was started by New York City during the Depression, when leaders believed the poor and troubled were better off living a country life, away from city slums. Over the last 60 years, the city managed to operate the 365-acre shelter quietly, without running into the kind of not-in-my-backyard furor that homeless shelters have often provoked elsewhere.
But local outrage at the shelter has mounted in the three years since the city, under pressure from advocates for the homeless, reversed its longstanding policy of keeping the men largely confined to the grounds of Camp La Guardia almost like prisoners. There are about 700 men living in the shelter, and they are free to come and go.
The tensions reached a new level last week when Orange County officials sued New York City over the shelter, claiming that it had become a dumping ground for criminals and the mentally ill. Officials here demanded in the suit that the city conduct extensive background checks on the criminal and psychological history of residents before sending them to the shelter.
Residents of this semirural conservative community about 55 miles northwest of Manhattan have many of the same complaints as the New York City residents who live near large armory shelters in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx.
Police cars here slow to a crawl when they pass groups of homeless men huddled on street corners. And in this tense atmosphere, the homeless men themselves say they have modified their behavior to deflect any suspicion.
"I never walk in a crowd around here," said William Houston, a 36-year-old shelter resident, as he walked several miles back to Camp La Guardia the other day with a bag of groceries from the village of Chester, where most of the stores, bars and restaurants are. "You can never tell what the guy next to you is going to do in a crowd. So, you're better off on your own."
County officials say a number of shelter residents have been arrested for burglary, and drunkenness and urinating in public and other crimes that have heightened fear in the area and placed a strain on local services. The officials noted that between 1992 and July of this year, shelter residents served 4,564 days in the Orange County Correctional Facility in Goshen, at a total cost of $402,581.
"We're not going to let this ruin our community," said Roy G. Weyant, a member of the Orange County Legislature who represents the district that includes Camp La Guardia, which straddles the border between Chester and the town of Blooming Grove. "There are people who have put their house up for sale but can't sell them."
Mr. Weyant added, "If the city doesn't straighten this out sooner or later, we're going to tell them that we want them out of here."
Joseph G. Rampe, the Orange County Executive, said the decision to file the suit was made after attempts to negotiate with the city failed.
Muzzy Rosenblatt, a spokesman for the city's Department of Homeless Services, said he could not comment on the suit because officials have not had time to review it.
However, Mr. Rosenblatt said the city has for three years maintained an informal agreement with local officials that among other things establishes stricter eligibility requirements for shelter residents here than in New York City. To qualify for Camp La Guardia men must be at least 32 years old. City officials say they also try to weed out those who have been at the camp and had complaints raised about them by local law-enforcement authorities.
Camp La Guardia residents face immediate transfer to other city-run shelters if the law-enforcement authorities simply accuse them of committing crimes like drinking in public, even if charges are not filed.
So far, 700 Camp La Guardia residents have been sent back to shelters in the city since 1991. But advocates for the homeless, including officials from the Coalition for the Homeless in Manhattan, criticize the practice, saying that it denies the men due process and encourages local law-enforcement officials to harass them.
Camp La Guardia dates to 1935, when it was opened by the administration of Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia at the former site of a women's prison. It originally served older men who in many cases were alcoholics. To this day many of the homeless men say they come here because it's easier to find work as day laborers, cutting grass, raking leaves and washing dishes at the Catskills hotels that are within commuting distance.
But in recent years, younger men with problems like drug addiction have moved into the shelter as New York City's homeless population expanded -- something that many, including shelter residents, feel has made Camp La Guardia a growing nuisance.
David Casado first came to live in the shelter in 1986, and he says he is astonished at the way its population has swelled with drug-addicted and mentally ill men. To him, it is no wonder that local people express outrage at the way the men come and go freely.
"I don't think anyone understood what would happen when they opened up those gates," said Mr. Casado, a 42-year-old unemployed cook. "In a sense, that's why I can understand why the community is acting up."
Many of the men are black and feel that they are being singled out unfairly in this primarily white community. Outside a supermarket in the Chester Mall, the village's main shopping center, a slim man who identified himself only as Ronald recalled suffering open discrimination regularly.
"We're not treated the same way the local residents are," he said with a grimace. "People are always suspicious of us. They watch us when we walk around stores. They stare at us when we're on the streets. We're not treated with any dignity. We're treated like the plague."
There is a history of other sorts of exclusion against these men in Orange County.
In 1992, a New York State Supreme Court judge granted a group of 270 Camp La Guardia residents the right to vote in the county after the local Board of Elections tried to stop them on the grounds that they were transients who officially resided in New York City.
And a former Camp La Guardia resident is suing the village and town of Chester in Federal court, claiming that he was falsely arrested in November 1992 for drinking alcohol in public.
The man, Lester Pucket, also alleges in the suit that of the 15 people arrested between January 1991 and October 1994 for violating the village's open-container ordinance, 14 were shelter residents.
"Clearly, the village is singling out residents of the camp, many of whom are black and easy to identify," said Steven R. Schindler, the lawyer representing Mr. Pucket. "These men are being arrested for violating a village ordinance that otherwise isn't being enforced."
Few things here better illustrate the rift between the homeless men and local people than a crude wooden bus shelter tucked away near the Chester Mall. It is there that the homeless men have to wait for the shelter-run buses that shuttle them the four miles to and from Camp La Guardia.
Barry Adelman, the president of the Chester Mall Merchants Association, recalled that the bus shelter was built two years ago after some local merchants began worrying that the men would frighten off customers as they waited for the bus in the heart of the shopping center.
But Mr. Adelman said the fears are unwarranted. "We probably have more trouble with teen-agers coming in here to shoplift," said Mr. Adelman, who owns a clothing store called Warehouse. "I think the fear that people have of homeless people doesn't reflect the reality. The reality is that we've never had many problems with them."

Expert Advice: Mr. Cheap On the Prowl

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

 BODY:
WE caught up with Mr. Cheap in Washington, where he's cataloguing what's cheap there besides talk. Bargain guidance was urgently needed for holiday shopping. Mr. Cheap, whose previous books include "Mr. Cheap's New York," at first started raving about some "gorgeous buys" in five-year-old hotel suite furniture he unexpectedly found being auctioned by the Ritz-Carlton at a Beltway warehouse: "You should see the four-poster beds!"
Hold on, Mr. Cheap, we're not talking tax-and-spenders-slept-here sort of bargains. We're talking strictly New York, stocking stuffer, memorable but CHEAP. 
 It turns out that the "seemingly harmless hand mirror that emits a piercing scream" when you look at your reflection will do at $12 from Dapy's gift shop on West Broadway. Mr. Cheap never lets us down, even if he's gone megalopolis lately, a hungry actor suddenly become best-seller writer who has a research assistant now in his ever-widening bargain hunts.
HE locks into a city for six weeks of research. Everything from new appliances to used clothing, free movies to cheap poetry cafes, low-priced pets to second-hand pianos. He talks of "a certain predatory thrill" in bargain hunting, and 100,000 shoppers agree, having bought Mr. Cheap books on five cities.
In New York, he knows that the Frick collection "rivals the Met at half the price," and a great cheap lunch is a loaf of bread from Zito's on Bleecker Street with cheese next door from Murray's. His book cherishes neighborhoods: eat Greek in Astoria at Uncle George's; buy tonight's steak wholesale at Basior-Schwartz in the West Village meat district; sample one of the city's oldest bargains, the almost-free speeches at Cooper Union.
"There's no other way to do this but pounding the pavement," says Mr. Cheap, who in his heart of hearts is the 33-year-old professional actor known as Mark Waldstein from Verona, N.J. He traffics well enough in cheap candor to admit to occasional ennui if not outright heartburn at such self-imposed limits as hunting down restaurant meals for under $10.
"It does reach a point where you walk into your 500th falafel joint and what more is there really to say?" he asked in Washington. He quickly recovered from such gratuitous plaintiveness, however, and cited "a great Vietnam soup house, Pho 75 in Arlington, 15 delicious varieties of stew, $4.95 for a big bowl you can't finish." Or the Federal cafeterias, most impressively the Library of Congress's Montpelier Room: $8.50 for a buffet with linen tablecloths and a view of the Capitol, the nation's Pols "R" Us megastore, where nostalgia items like trickle-down economics are endlessly hawked.
MR. CHEAP hasn't been spoiled by success; he stays at the Quality Inn Iwo Jima. This is economically well west of ritzier Washington precincts where the art of tax write-offs for business visits like Mr. Cheap's was invented, never mind endlessly indulged in one of the all-time, all-American business bargains.
But Mr. Cheap's authenticity is his fortune. "I'm not comfortable with $100 dinners," he said, implicitly dismissing much of the work ethic of "The McLaughlin Group." "I've always had to get by in dives and greasy spoons, which is why I'm well suited to be Mr. Cheap."
He began in Boston having to eat, rent and generally survive at as close to wholesale as he could get between stage roles and occasional writing jobs for radio and community newspapers. He finally wrote a book about his favorite cheap discoveries, and now his publisher, Bob Adams, has him turning them out like cheap bodice-rippers. There has been Mr. Cheap's Boston, Chicago, Atlanta, San Francisco and New York, at 350 pages per of waxing cheap. Washington, then Seattle are next, with Dallas and Minneapolis-St. Paul on the horizon, fast as Mr. Cheap can clear head, gazetteer and gullet.
"Washington is among the more expensive cities," he said. "New York has both extremes. They'll gladly take your money there, of course, but there are great prices to be found in really interesting neighborhoods."
In general, Mr. Cheap loves cities. The only thing that interests him about suburbs are failed shopping malls that he watches for signs of metamorphosis into bargain outlets.
"The stores are getting crazy here," Mr. Cheap said of his Washington researches. "Too crowded. Special Christmas sales," he complained of seasonal prices that skew his year-round data. "I'll have to go home for a couple of weeks," he said, wishing one and all a happy and cheap holiday.

HEADLINE: Salvadorans See Future Imperiled by U.S. Immigration Move

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SANTA TERESA, El Salvador, Dec. 3

 BODY:
People in villages like this one say they survive because of the money they receive from relatives working in the United States.
The hundreds of monthly stipends and the savings brought with villagers who return to live here have an impact on every small farm and tiny business. So everybody sees their future dependent on a decision announced Friday in Washington that the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service will not renew a program that allowed tens of thousands of Salvadorans to live in the United States legally. 
 "Without the money from the North we will dry up, " said Aristides Gonzalez, who used the income he earned in the United States to start a small snack bar and grocery store here. Still, exactly what the decision will mean for them is not clear.
The intent of the American program was to give temporary refuge to Salvadorans because the civil war made this country dangerous. But the war ended two years ago, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service determined that the political and human rights situation in El Salvador has improved significantly.
The program expires at the end of the year. The Immigration Service said those covered by it have nine months to apply for political asylum under another program.
An estimated one million Salvadorans live in the United States, about half of them with full legal status. Of the rest, according to American officials, nearly 200,000 orginally joined the temporary program that is now being abolished. Immigration officials say only 85,000 remain in the program, although other officials say the number is probably much higher.
El Salvador's Central Bank estimates the Salvadorans covered by the program will send their families $302 million this year, more than the value of the country's main export, coffee. The total amount of remittances from all Salvadorans living abroad is expected to reach $1 billion this year.
While waiting for hearings on their claims for asylum Salvadorans will be able to live and work in the United States legally. But it is not known how long it will take to hold the asylum hearings, let alone how many Salvadorans will be granted asylum.
On their way to jobs or farm chores here in Santa Teresa, in central El Salvador, six men gathered around a table under the wobbly awning at Mr. Gonzalez's snack bar and talked about what Salvadorans in the United States mean to this village.
Leonel Rivas pointed out that in contrast to the areas of El Salvador where people do not have many relatives in the United States, this village and those nearby have progressed remarkably. There is now a bridge over the ravine that once isolated several communities. Electricity has been extended to other villages, and dirt roads once barely passable have been paved.
"It's only recently that people had a way to get to jobs in Zacatecoluca," Mr. Rivas said, referring to the closest city. "Now farmers can get their crop to the market."
Local officials said the improvements were due in large part to taxes paid by the small businesses started and now sustained by the money earned in the United States.
American officials in El Salvador warned the State Department that a sudden drop in remittances from Salvadorans could be disastrous for the poorest regions of the country. The officials said if the Salvadoran economy could not provide jobs, then more Salvadorans would probably go to the United States illegally to find work.

HEADLINE: Stadium Plans: Ruthian Touch And No Dome

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
New York City's plans to improve Yankee Stadium may crystallize as early as this week with the expected release of a design for the ballpark, which is to incorporate old-fashioned touches reminiscent of the original stadium, officials say.
Last week, Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, a Kansas City, Mo., design firm, gave the city its report, which examined increasing luxury suites, club seating and parking, and retail opportunities around the stadium. 
 John S. Dyson, the city's Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development, said the design includes many old-fashioned elements, and does not call for topping the 71-year-old stadium with a dome.
"We'll present it to the Mayor and the Governor-elect first, and then the Yankees," he said. "We have to present it fairly soon. We promised to show it to George Steinbrenner after the World Series. They're anxious there."
The Kansas City firm was awarded a $630,000 contract this summer from the city's Economic Development Corporation to study the renovation.
Mr. Dyson was not specific about the firm's design, but he said it was more detailed than designs prepared last year by the Parks Department, which proposed a broad renovation to make the stadium closely resemble its 1923 look.
Estimates for the renovation of Yankee Stadium have started at $250 million. Although the Yankees asked the city several months ago to look at sites for a new stadium, the Hellmuth, Obata report did not address any other sites.
Mr. Dyson said he had received no indications that Governor-elect George E. Pataki had planned to reduce the state's commitment to helping pay for a renovation. The subject was not an issue in his victorious campaign against Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who has been a strong advocate of keeping the Yankees in the Bronx, or at least in New York City. Governor Cuomo last year suggested a $500 million waterfront ballpark on the West Side of Manhattan.
"I don't see any difference with Pataki," Mr. Dyson said. "Yankee Stadium is an institution beyond any parochial city concern. For all we know, he's a Yankee fan."

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases;
Lean Times for Catholic Charities

 BODY:
After a sharp drop in private donations this year, Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York is conducting a mail campaign for the first time in its history. Msgr. James Murray, executive director, said the agency is $250,000 short of its budget, mostly because individual contributions have fallen off.
Catholic Charities, which has provided social services for the poor through a network of agencies since 1917, is one of seven charities supported by the annual appeal of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The New York Times Company Foundation pays all the costs of running the appeal, so all contributions go directly to the charities. 
 Besides its own programs, Catholic Charities supports a network of hospitals, nursing homes, child care agencies and community centers in the New York region. Services range from prenatal care for indigent mothers to day care for the elderly. In New York City, eight family service centers provide emergency housing or food, legal advice and psychiatric care.
Monsignor Murray said the aftereffects of a long recession still weighed heavily on poor New Yorkers, many of whom depend on Catholic Charities for services. "All the layoffs and early retirements caused by the recession are making life difficult for hundreds of people," he said.
Like other charity officials, Monsignor Murray said he didn't know how city budget cuts would affect his agency. But he is especially concerned about programs supported by the Human Resources Administration, the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation Services and the Department of Youth Services.

HEADLINE: BACKTALK;
With Hockey in Limbo, Lindros Goes Back to College

BYLINE: By MICHAEL GRANGE; Michael Grange is a graduate journalism student at Western Ontario University.

 BODY:
If he weren't so big, he could be any other student at the Spoke, the University of Western Ontario's cavernous campus pub. Blue jeans, bulky sweater, hiking boot/sneakers, a cap tugged low over wavy brown hair, a day-old beard.
But Eric Lindros, the Philadelphia Flyers' 21-year-old man-child, is big. He is 6 feet 5 inches, 240 pounds, broad-jawed, thick-necked. 
 But rather than stand out in a crowd, especially at The Spoke in London, Ontario, he prefers eating his lunch at a quieter spot by a dormant air hockey table.
The labor strife that threatens the National Hockey League season has scattered the union brethren. Mark Messier is going with Wayne Gretzky's all-star team on a barnstorming tour of Europe. The Toronto Maple Leafs' Doug Gilmour is playing first division hockey in Switzerland. Russians are in Russia, Finns are in Finland. Some younger professionals have gone back to junior hockey. Others play pick-up games on rented ice, waiting to go back to work. Lindros is going back to school.
"Look at what we're doing right now," he said. "We're sitting here at lunch. It is 11:40 A.M. People are in here studying, listening to tunes, playing video games, just hanging out. This is part of school, and I wanted to see it."
For most students, college this time of year can be gloom (midterm marks have arrived) and doom (the finals are coming). Dishes sit in the sink, long-distance bills are a battlefield, and ketchup is added to macaroni and cheese to make it taste different. Yet Lindros, the millionaire, the man expected to be the defining hockey player of his generation, wants to be right there in the thick of it.
It is not surprising that Lindros is taking a course in introductory economics. While in junior hockey and while he sat out a season demanding that the Quebec Nordiques trade his rights, Lindros took a few other credit courses at York University in Toronto. What is different now is Lindros has moved to London, Ontario, a tree-lined college town. He is crashing on the floor of a house he shares with eight other male students.
This professional athlete, who has a contract worth $3.5 million a year, is catching up on the five weeks of class he missed during training camp. But he isn't just filling time. He is taking in a bit of university life, tasting it, chewing it. Learning what's been missing from his diet.
"I went out yesterday and bought one of those little Instamatic cameras -- the next cheapest to those disposable ones," he said, "and we just went crazy taking pictures all day, trying to remember all this."
 
Before the N.H.L., There's High School
 Learning has always been important to Lindros. When he was 16 and selected first by Sault Ste. Marie in the 1989 Ontario Hockey League draft, he refused to report. The "Soo" was 10 hours away from his home in Toronto, and endless bus trips would make it impossible for him to finish high school before entering the N.H.L. at 18.
"I had nothing against the Soo. I just didn't want to be in the N.H.L. without high school," he said. "If I got hurt and didn't make it, or if there was a lockout or something, I wanted to have a foot in the door for the university."
His decision not to report to Sault Ste. Marie became the first Lindros controversy. It raised the hackles of a conservative hockey establishment and most of Sault Ste. Marie. He moved in with a family in Farmington, Mich. He used an accelerated program to finish his last two years of high school in six months, giving him the option of playing college hockey.
The junior hockey rules were changed to allow Sault Ste. Marie to trade him for cash and players, and he was sent to Oshawa, only 45 minutes from Toronto.
"Sports is a business, it's cutthroat," he said. "I've been going through that since I was 16, the whole Sault Ste. Marie thing, being sold to Oshawa, being traded and bought to go to Philly -- you're property. You're a piece of land that, to be basic about it, people want to put condominiums on.
"That's sport, there's a lot of pressure. I'm not saying I don't like the pressure, I would like to say I thrive on pressure, but that's the way I've grown up."
Two years later, in a controversy of continental proportions, Lindros refused to sign a long-term contract with the Nordiques, which took him first over all in the 1991 N.H.L. draft. Then 18, he received death threats and his family was vilified by the Quebec news media.
It was another lesson learned.
"You care about people's perceptions, but if you're happy with what you're doing, it doesn't matter," he said. "I mean what is media? What is print media? It's one person's perception of a situation. And let's face it, everyone talks to each other in the World of the Pen, as I call it. Just because one person has a bad perception of you, they might not have even talked to you, they talk and people get these bad feelings and it comes out in articles. It's a joke, but that's the way it works.
"I'm not saying everybody has it out for me, but I can count on my fingers and toes how many interviews I've done that I could sit down and talk to somebody and go through it all."
 
Living in a House With Nine Guys
 Marc Montemurro, one of Lindros's roommates, sits in a messy room in the cramped house.
"At first it might seem strange, why he's living in a house with nine guys, sharing a room and everything. But then you realize what he's been through -- everyone knowing who he was, watching all the time, and it's not so strange. He's only a year older than me, and if I was in his shoes, I'd want to experience this, too."
While driving home after visiting friends for homecoming weekend in early October, Lindros decided to enroll at Western Ontario. By Wednesday he was in school, sharing a room with hometown friends in a house with cracked plaster walls, decorated with beer posters and high school hockey shirts.
"I went to a Halloween party at this frat," Lindros said. "I've never been to a party like that, I've never seen how these things work. You can have team parties, and they're fun, but this is all new to me, absolutely different. We went as mechanics. Three of us, coveralls, greased-up face, work boots, name tags. We were ready to go. The most comfortable costumes in the place."
London is a homecoming of sorts for Lindros. It was where he lived before becoming Canada's fastest-rising hockey star. His father played football at Western and began his accounting career here. His mother was a nurse in the emergency room at a local hospital. Lindros's new digs are just up the street from the outdoor rink where his dad used to take him skating before work, down the road from the park where he used to go tobogganing.
"I was amazed and pleased when I found out about Eric's decision," said his father, Carl Lindros. "As a parent, the thing that impressed me most was the commitment he made to his studies. I think it's been eye-opening for him."
As Lindros said: "There's more to life than hockey. I've been out of school for three years. It's a weird adjustment. You're on the road and the only thing you ever read, unless you get into a novel or something, is the USA Today or The Hockey News. Your vocabulary starts to go. The first week I was here the writing -- if you haven't done it for a while the words don't come very easily. You pick it up in a couple of days.
"But unless you keep your mind occupied, it doesn't work the way it used to, or the way it can. It's just great to learn something that previously you might never had a chance to learn, that may never have crossed your mind."
 
When a Celebrity Shows Up at Practice
 The Western hockey coach, Barry Martinelli, blows the whistle. A forward line gathers speed at center ice and attacks two defensemen. Lindros is filling in at defense. The left winger bears down with the puck, and Lindros, skating backward, gives him the wide side, lots of it. The winger bites and heads for the generous space between the mountain and the glass. A mistake. With quickness astonishing for his size, Lindros closes the gap. In an N.H.L. game, the winger would be board advertising.
But this is a college hockey practice, and Lindros is a visitor. The rush simply ends, and Lindros skates over, takes a place in line and glances at the track team, practicing on a rubber oval surrounding the rink.
"I think he's enjoyed stepping out of the limelight a bit, and just being a regular person," said Martinelli, who has enjoyed having an N.H.L. player practice with his squad.
"When he first started working out with us it was chaos," he said. "I was getting 40 calls a day and there must have been 500 or 600 people at practice. The guys were really nervous, passes were flying all over the place, but he just said things would die down after awhile and they have.
"He's never asked for any special treatment since he got here. We don't have a stall for him. He gets dressed in the middle of the floor."
Sort of the way he sleeps on the floor at the house.
"I'm going all out here; 'I've eaten more Kraft dinners than anybody here," Lindros said, laughing. "I'll miss this, but I'll always remember it."

HEADLINE: Reassuring an Insecure Europe

 BODY:
After the disarray over Bosnia, the national security crowd in Washington seems to be seized with the question of how to save NATO. They should instead be asking how to ease the insecurity in Eastern Europe and Russia.
To do so, they need to be clear about the wellsprings of that insecurity. The newly freed nations need political and economic reassurance, not military alliance, and a helping hand to bring them into the community of democratic nations. 
 The worry is that America is not up to the job, especially now that the Republicans have taken control of Congress. Some in the G.O.P., like Senator Jesse Helms, seem to regard any help to transform Eastern Europe and Russia as a waste of time and money. The hope is that leaders of broader vision like Senators Robert Dole and Richard Lugar will sense the opportunity and sustain the effort.
Offering NATO membership and security guarantees to Poles, Czechs and Hungarians is tangential to meeting their felt needs. It is also sure to alienate those who are excluded, especially Russia, where a nationalist reaction could topple Boris Yeltsin and the reformers, thereby increasing Eastern Europe's insecurity. Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev underscored that point last Thursday by holding up the start of his country's cooperation under NATO's Partnership for Peace.
Left intact, NATO can provide military insurance in case things go wrong in Russia. It can also help promote change by reaching out to ex-Warsaw Pact armies, including Russia's, promoting democratic control of the military and facilitating military conversion to peaceful pursuits. Yet NATO alone cannot meet Eastern Europe's needs. Other institutions can -- if they are strengthened.
Universities, foundations and other non-governmental organizations need to sustain support for democracy and the free institutions that nurture it. Private-public partnerships can encourage everything from stocking libraries and housing military retirees to funding scientific research by former bomb-builders.
The European Union has yet to lay out a strategy for bringing the East into a European-wide market. It can move a lot more quickly than it has to lower agricultural and other trade barriers. It also can construct road and rail corridors to link the East and West and invest in projects to reverse environmental degradation. Washington also needs to be involved.
The Helsinki accords give the 53-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe a leading role in preventing ethnic conflict and protecting human rights. The C.S.C.E. can also provide political legitimacy and oversight for peacekeeping in the region. Yet Washington has looked upon the C.S.C.E. as a rival to NATO and tried to constrain it.
The thickening web of ties to the West can help reassure anxious Eastern Europeans, including Russia, that they will not be left out if they want in. At the same time, the West would be right to insist that the political and economic standards it sets for cooperation are met by countries seeking assistance and closer ties.
The new Republican majority has a chance to help transform the East. But it will not succeed if it focuses on expanding NATO and does not try to meet the East's political and economic needs -- and ease its ethnic frictions.

Panic on Broadway

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
When "Angels in America" closes at today's matinee, it will be the most resounding final curtain in the history of the Broadway theater. In its wake, not a single new American drama will be running on Broadway.
Yet this tragedy may soon give way to a new, white-knuckle melodrama gathering steam in the wings. Much has happened, much of it behind the scenes, in the six weeks since Neil Simon made his epochal decision to take his next play Off Broadway rather than risk Broadway's punitive economics. Panicked investors have fled some of the season's few remaining productions; the once-monolithic Broadway Establishment is cracking. As power shifts, so does the likelihood of a gory management-labor showdown that could finally start Broadway's revival -- or plunge Times Square into darkness by next year's tourist season -- or both. 
 Some of the apres-Simon fallout is visible. The Tony administrators, belatedly embarrassed that the theater's biggest names are excluded from their Broadway-only awards, suddenly talked of creating a special Off Broadway Tony. At "Les Miserables" and "Miss Saigon," the producer Cameron Mackintosh conducted an unprecedented "winter sale," selling the best $65 seats for slow performances in January and February for $30 and driving other musicals to follow suit.
Not all these developments are earth-shaking. A single Off Broadway Tony is appropriately derided by Peter Stone, the Dramatists Guild president, as "a second-class award" and "a slur," since Off Broadway artists could still not compete equally with their Broadway peers in the regular categories; in an informal Guild discussion on Thursday, playwrights from Edward Albee to Donald Margulies unanimously dismissed the idea.
By contrast, the Mackintosh winter sale was a revelation. The tickets sold quickly, reaffirming the public's resistance to regular Broadway prices. More intriguing, credit-card receipts showed an unexpectedly high number of sales to suburban New Yorkers -- the group that has most conspicuously abandoned Broadway in recent years. Why? Perhaps because this is the first Broadway discounting scheme that required neither an inconvenient coupon nor a wait at the half-price booth -- and that included the best seats. The unanswered question: Might the same audience return to Broadway for plays as well as musicals?
No one will know until prices come down for keeps, but they can't come down unless the price of producing Broadway shows falls first. It's this vicious cycle -- astronomical production expenses and the costly tickets needed to pay for them -- that has both killed the Broadway play and driven away its audience.
Though star salaries and advertising rates are part of those expenses, the single heftiest factor is contracts that require producers to employ a number of backstage workers who do little work and musicians who do none. Why have producers repeatedly capitulated to such contracts? Largely because they've been held hostage. For decades, Broadway theater owners, who remain in place as producers come and go, have dominated the negotiations with the unions -- and given away the store. They'd rather surrender to union demands than take a strike and lose their guaranteed rental income. Producers and theatergoers, meanwhile, have been stuck with the bill.
But faced with Broadway's collapse, the street's most powerful producers, who collectively represent most of its remaining musical hits, have at last pooled their clout and staged an insurrection. After a series of meetings, Michael David (co-producer of "Guys and Dolls" and "Tommy"), Alan Wasser (of Cameron Mackintosh Inc.), Edgar Dobie (of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Company) and Emanuel Azenberg (Neil Simon's producer) went to the theater owners and, in a bloodless coup, won their acquiescence to a new strategy for the next cycle of union negotiations, starting with the stagehands next spring. That strategy includes a willingness to take a strike if that's the only hope for Broadway's survival.
Success is hardly guaranteed and will at best come incrementally. But for the first time in decades, Broadway seems poised to throw away the script that has brought it to the edge of doom.

Children's Aid Society: A Social Services Pathfinder

 BODY:
Child care for working mothers and free school lunches are expected services in the 1990's. But the Children's Aid Society was already running such programs in the 1800's, paving the way for the many other agencies nationwide that now offer them.
Founded in 1853 to care for New York's orphans, the society now helps more than 100,000 children a year. As the society increases spending to expand preventive services, private donations are not keeping pace, said Philip Coltoff, the executive director. The society has dipped into its unrestricted reserves for $5 million this year to meet a budget of $24.5 million, expanding foster care and health care services and after-school programs. 
 "Children have been affected greatly by the recession, so our budget is going up 10 to 12 percent a year," Mr. Coltoff said. "Our income is increasing, but not at the same rate as our spending."
The society emphasizes preventive health care, serving thousands of children at clinics in Washington Heights, Harlem and Manhattan. It also finances foster-care and adoption services, with placement programs, medical services and counseling.
Other programs include summer camps, pregnancy prevention for teen-agers and Head Start classes for toddlers. A literacy program matches seventh and eighth graders with tutors. The society runs two community schools in Washington Heights, where social workers and teachers interact to improve children's academic performance and mental health.
Mr. Coltoff said that looming state and city budget cuts threaten all the society's programs. And a decrease in state Medicaid revenues means the society's clinics will have to depend more on private donations.
"We've already lost more than $1 million in public funds, which we will desperately try to make up through private sources," Mr. Coltoff said. "If food pantries are closed, health care programs reduced and substance abuse programs eliminated, a lot more New Yorkers will be depending on us for the most basic services."

LOST PURITAN: A Life of Robert Lowell, by Paul Mariani. (Norton, $27.50.) This approach to the "real" character of a protean confessional poet uses letters and diaries to reveal a writer whose fascination with preachers, statesmen and generals hints at restlessness with his own art.

HEADLINE: CHRISTMAS BOOKS '94;
Photography

BYLINE: By Andy Grundberg; Andy Grundberg is the director of the Friends of Photography in San Francisco and the author of "Crisis of the Real," a collection of criticism.

 BODY:
IF photography as we have long known it is about to be replaced by a limp electronic gerund, "imaging," why do publishers continue to satisfy our cravings for pictures with a multitude of finely printed volumes ranging from delicate to disturbing? This season's harvest suggests not only that the recession in photography book publishing is over, but also that the ballyhooed electronic revolution remains a gleam in the distance. The most promoted electronic title having to do with photography, a CD-ROM planned to accompany the book "Passage to Vietnam" (Against All Odds Productions/Melcher Media/Publishers Group West), is now optimistically promised for February, four months after the book's publication date. Museums may be busy digitizing their collections of photographs, but few of these electronic archives have the makings of a best seller.
The books that fit on traditional holiday coffee tables are sufficient consolation for anyone searching for new ways to look at photographs, however. Major collections of the lifetime work of Robert Frank and Andre Kertesz are complemented by visual anthologies of the human figure, self-portraiture and the dead and deformed ("The Body," "The Camera I" and "Harms Way"). Fashion takes an impressive turn on the runway with "Toni Frissell: Photographs 1933-1967" (Doubleday), "William Klein: In and Out of Fashion" (Random House) and Albert Watson's "Cyclops" (Bulfinch/ Little, Brown). And edging in the direction of multimedia is "Talking Pictures" (Chronicle), a Chaucerian diversion in which 70 people, from Joan Rivers to Mister Rogers, elaborate on the image that has meant the most to them. Unfortunately, one has to go to the touring exhibition of the same title to hear the actual sound of their voices. 
 What's missing here besides CD-ROM's? There is nothing in the way of a newly discovered talent (although Nick Waplington, a new talent earlier in the 1990's, is back with a second book, from Aperture). And, except for the catalogue to the Metropolitan Museum's sterling show of Edouard Baldus's 19th-century views, there is remarkably little that could be called valuable new scholarship. Despite a growing interest in revising the canon of photography as it was constituted more than 50 years ago, publishers, editors and museum curators still find it hard to resist following in photography's equivalent of Good King Wenceslas's footsteps.
ROBERT FRANK: Moving Out. By Sarah Green ough and Philip Brookman, with essays by W. S. Di Piero, Martin Gasser and John Hanhardt. (National Gallery/Scalo/Distributed Art Publishers, $60.) Robert Frank's peculiar charms as a photographer of intense nihilism and purposefully casual technique are captured with remarkable success by this survey of his career, which accompanies an exhibition that will tour other cities after it leaves the National Gallery of Art in Washington at the end of the year. While the pictures in Mr. Frank's widely influential book "The Americans" (1959) justly constitute the core of his achievement, there are scores of other images, taken before and after his trip across the United States in the mid-1950's, that either have become classics or deserve to be. Most of all, "Robert Frank: Moving Out" convinces us that "The Americans" was not a fluke. Like Willie Mays, whose golden moment came with his World Series catch, Mr. Frank honed his skills for years beforehand and stayed in the major leagues long afterward.
Still, the book makes clear that the photographer's work has gradually, inexorably darkened from its relatively sunny beginnings in his native Switzerland. The lyric charm of a sequence of images of folding chairs in Paris, taken in 1949 and 1950, puts one in mind of Henri Cartier-Bresson and Robert Doisneau. By the time Mr. Frank photographed in London in 1952 and 1953, however, the skies had literally filled with clouds. After making the somber photographs in "The Americans," Mr. Frank switched his focus to films, returning to still photography only in the early 70's. Sarah Greenough, the curator of photography at the National Gallery, writes that "little in Frank's earlier still photographs prepares us for the raw and unrefined nature of 'Mabou,' " one of the first of these more recent, typically collaged images. But by the time we get to a dispirited 1985 assemblage called "Home Improvements," little in the way of surprise remains.
While curators and guest essayists detail the substance of the photographer's career, they play second fiddle to Mr. Frank's own commentary, which is interspersed among the excellent reproductions. He is not his own best critic (one section begins, "Whenever I look at these pictures I think that I ought to be able to say something about the way I felt when I took them"), but his creative spontaneity and his despair about his inability to communicate his feelings fully come across in visceral fashion. An artist who fundamentally redirected the course of photography at mid-century, Mr. Frank wears his hair shirt with surprising grace and few pretensions.
ANDRE KERTESZ: His Life and Work. By Pierre Borhan, with essays by Pierre Borhan, Laszlo Beke, Dominique Baque and Jane Livingston. (Bulfinch/Little, Brown, $65.) Almost a decade has passed since the last in-depth look at Andre Kertesz's career, an American-organized exhibition and book called "Andre Kertesz of Paris and New York" that appeared in 1985, the year of Kertesz's death. Besides having the benefit of time, "Andre Kertesz: His Life and Work," a new retrospective volume, has the distinction of being a French production based on the collection of Kertesz's photographic negatives and correspondence deposited with the Mission du Patrimoine Photographique (stiffly translated in the book as the Association for the Diffusion of the Photographic Patrimony) in Paris.
Both Paris and New York claim Kertesz as their own, even though he was born and raised in Hungary and began photographing there. Some of his most memorable pictures date from the late teens and early 20's, depicting the everyday life of the Hungarian countryside and his hometown of Esztergom. Still, the pictures he took during his years in Paris, from 1925 to 1936, are generally considered the foundation of his rank as one of the major figures of photography in this century. After 1936 he lived and photographed in New York until his death -- mostly unhappily, Mr. Borhan, the head of the Kertesz archive, points out more than once in his text. Unfortunately, Mr. Borhan's main thesis -- that Kertesz therefore really belongs to France -- is neither germane to art history nor especially eloquent in this uncredited English translation. What is one to think of a historian capable of a sentence like this: "The Hungarians going into exile were so numerous that Admiral Miklos Horthy, an anti-Semite, inaugurated a dictatorship"?
What redeems "Andre Kertesz: His Life and Work" is the many pictures that have seldom or never been reproduced. Some of them help put together the many pieces of the photographer's career, like a bird's-eye winter view of a Paris garden, taken in 1929, that resembles his pictures of Washington Square Park taken some 30 years later. Others are just simply wonderful pictures. Hungarian, French, American -- Kertesz was above all a consistently fine photographer.
THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF EDOUARD BALDUS. By Malcolm Daniel, with an essay by Barry Bergdoll. (Metropolitan Museum of Art/Canadian Center for Architecture/Abrams, $65.) Given the scholarly attention photography has
received in recent years, it is rare to find a photographer of genius whose work has never received the attention it deserves. Edouard Baldus (1813-89) is the real thing, a mediocre painter of the 1840's who in the 1850's made some of the most impressive, seemingly modern photographs of the 19th century. Baldus, a Prussian emigre who in his mid-20's settled permanently in Paris, adopted the "English" paper-negative process invented by William Henry Fox Talbot and parlayed his technical and visual prowess into a career as a recorder of France's churches, monuments, cities, railroads and official buildings during the reign of Napoleon III.
Baldus may have thought of himself as an artist working with a camera, but his primary patron, the French Government, often used him as a photojournalist. He was there to document the route of Queen Victoria's 1855 journey to Paris by train, the construction of the "New Louvre," the aftermath of the flooding of the Rhone in Lyons and Avignon in 1856. And while his initial fame rested on large-scale pictures of Roman-era ruins and medieval cathedrals, the pictures he took along the routes of France's newly built rail lines show him to have had a knack for capturing the dawn of an industrial, urban age. "The Photographs of Edouard Baldus" accompanies an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Dec. 31) and contains 86 fine reproductions, a comprehensive account of Baldus's career written by Malcolm Daniel, an assistant curator of photography at the museum, and an essay on the architectural ambitions of the Second Empire by the art historian Barry Bergdoll.
WILLIAM GARNETT: Aerial Photographs. Introduction by Martha A. Sandweiss. (University of California, $45.) For more than 40 years William Garnett has been taking aerial photographs of California and the American West, reducing land forms to patterns and moving conventional scenic photography into territory at once abstract and beautiful. This elegantly designed and produced tribute to his career, printed in Spain, contains 73 examples of his work and reveals why he has been considered an important exponent, along with Aaron Siskind, of the relevance of abstraction to modern photography.
A typical Garnett photograph uses light to redefine the shape, line and texture of the land and, in several cases, the sea. Shadows become the armatures on which his pictures hang, the marks of plows, rivers and eroded hills conspiring to create a kind of gestural drawing familiar to those acquainted with postwar art. One of the limitations of this genre, to which Mr. Garnett has been devoted, is that it too much resembles the products of paintbrush and pen, and as a result strikes a minor key. But there is no doubting the artist's integrity of eye and intent, or his ability to make us rephrase our stock replies to the question of what photography is supposed to tell us about the world.
THE BODY: Photographs of the Human Form. By William A. Ewing. (Chronicle, $29.95.) Diminutive in page size but large in intention, "The Body" navigates the shoals and rapids of an esthetically and politically loaded topic, and manages not only to survive the journey but also to shed substantial light on how photographers have used the human figure for a variety of pictorial purposes through more than 150 years. Some of these purposes have been prurient and oppressive, as in a German photograph from 1900 of a naked Tunisian woman kneeling on a plank with her hands and legs bound with rope, and some have been at least primarily artistic, like the elegant modernist nudes of Imogen Cunningham, Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Weston.
"The Body" approaches its subject across a spectrum of such intentions and purposes, dividing itself into chapters called "Fragments," "Figures," "Probes," "Flesh," "Prowess," "Eros" and the like. The "Probes" chapter is the most fascinating, focusing on medical and scientific images of the body, from photomicrographs of bone tissue to Harold Edgerton's stuttering stop-motion depiction of a golf swing. William A. Ewing does a creditable job of balancing art-historical information with references to present-day debates about pornography and about the control of the representation of one's own body. Robert Mapplethorpe, Chuck Close, Lucas Samaras and Lorna Simpson are among the many men and women artists who make this subway-sized Baedeker entertaining and educational.
THE CAMERA I: Photographic Self-Portraits from the Audrey and Sydney Irmas Collection. By Robert A. Sobieszek and Deborah Irmas. (Los Angeles County Museum of Art/Abrams, $49.50.) Accompanying an exhibition of photographs from a Los Angeles collection, "The Camera I" reveals the faces of 135 photographers who turned the lens back on themselves. It also suggests a great deal about the artistic self-image of photographers since the middle of the last century. Encountered early on are Roger Fenton and Francis Frith, two of Britain's great 19th-century photographers, both dressed as exotic Zouaves. At the turn of the century one finds Edward Steichen holding a painter's brush and palette and Edward Sheriff Curtis, the photographer of Indians, looking like a buffalo soldier. Closer to the present are Diane Arbus, reflected in a mirror and wearing only underpants, and Andy Warhol, bow-tied, seen in a strip of photo-machine prints. What makes this book so fascinating, however, is not its celebrity factor; these self-portraits register the ambitions of their time, whether the soft-focus estheticism of the pictorialist period, the radical angles and extreme close-ups of European modernism, or the shifting, dress-up disguises that distinguish post modernism. Photographers, we are led to believe, not only adopt styles, they become them.
HARMS WAY: Lust & Madness, Murder & Mayhem. By Joel-Peter Witkin. (Twin Palms/Ingram, $60.) The camera's obsession with death, sex and pathology is recorded here through a sly and creepy collection of images that are as far removed from the realm of everyday museum photography as this book is from everyday publishing. "Harms Way," originally reviewed in these pages on Sept. 11 of this year, is really an archive of four disturbing collections: police photographs of murder victims, medical photographs of deformities and ugly growths, pictures from the Kinsey Institute dealing with unconventional expressions of sexuality, and images of mental patients taken by Dr. Hugh W. Diamond in the 1850's. As interesting and stomach-turning as some of the photographs are, the essays by Eugenia Parry Janis, Stanley B. Burns and James Crump give the project intellectual weight, collectively noting that photography was enlisted in each case to provide a means to categorize, comprehend and ultimately control human behavior. As is usual with this publisher, the reproductions are rendered with cae and the design and production quality are peerless.
THOMAS STRUTH: Strangers and Friends, Photographs 1986-1992. Essay by Richard Sennett. (MIT, $39.95.) Thomas Struth is one of the most promising of a young generation of German photographer-artists influenced by Hilla and Bernd Becher, whose putatively objective approach to putatively mundane subject matter elicits surprisingly emotional results. Mr. Struth has absorbed the complex lessons of the Bechers and applied them to a variety of subjects; while he is best known for his clotted views of overbuilt city spaces and for museum interiors in which visitors stare intently at masterpieces, he also has essayed portraits of individuals and family groups and images of single buildings. In this volume, which mixes these subjects together seemingly arbitrarily, his diverse attentions do not clearly add up, but the absolute sureness of his eye is unmistakable. Mr. Struth deserves all the attention he has been getting.
FAREWELL TO BOSNIA. By Gilles Peress. (Scalo/Distributed Art Publishers, $60.) In reaction to the oversimplifying tendencies of much magazine and newspaper photojournalism, Gilles Peress has set himself the task of explicitly rendering exactly how confusing and disorienting it is to be in the midst of a far-off, fast-breaking and inevitably dangerous news story. He also means to show us, as he did in a previous volume, "Telex Iran" (1984), that the events occasioning the news are more of a riddle than we would assume. In "Farewell to Bosnia," an unrelenting book of edge-to-edge pictures taken between March and September of last year, the messages of "Telex Iran" are repeated in more graphic fashion. Mr. Peress visits hospitals that care for the victims of shelling attacks, as well as the barricades where sniper fire leaves bodies and trails of blood. He also focuses on families surviving hardships and the loss of their own. But in the end something seems missing; perhaps it is the customary assurance that even in the face of overwhelming despair, photographs offer the consolation of their own provisional meanings.
LISTENING TO THE RIVER: Seasons in the American West. By Robert Adams. Poems by William Stafford. (Aperture, $45.) "Listening to the River" is one of two books published this year by Robert Adams, who is perhaps America's most thoughtful and eloquent living photographer-writer. (The other is a book of essays, "Why People Photograph," also published by Aperture.) It contains Adams's recent black-and-white photographs of fields and farms and the sides of roads, pictures that seem utterly unprepossessing at first glance but that, like the previously published poems by William Stafford accompanying them, reward close attention. In some pictures, streaks of light in the sky invade the land below the horizon, suggesting a moment of revelation; elsewhere, clouds seem to hover like silent observers. Laid out two and three to a page, the images form small sequences that chart the passage of time as crops grow and are harvested, and as trees flower, mature and wither. The meditative quality that marks Mr. Adams's best work is very much in evidence here, and while the reproductions do little to make any of the images stand out individually, they do permit the sum to exceed its parts.

HEADLINE: Who Will Help the Black Man?

BYLINE: By Bob Herbert 

 BODY:
TWO HARLEM HOSPITAL doctors have calculated that the life expectancy of black men in central Harlem is shorter than that of men in Bangladesh. In America, the leading cause of death among black males between the ages of 15 and 24 is homicide. The unemployment rate in America for black males is more than twice that of white males. Even black men with jobs and higher education do not, for the most part, receive the same pay as white men or black women. Among recent college graduates with one to five years on the job, white men earned an average of $12.85 an hour in 1991, black women earned $11.41, white women earned $11.38 and black men $11.26.
The plight of black men in the nation's inner cities has been widely reported. Their experience, however, does not represent that of all black men. But the condition of the black male underclass remains the consuming preoccupation of many Americans, none more so than successful black men in America. The Times Magazine convened six of them, from a variety of fields, at a symposium moderated by Bob Herbert, an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times, to talk about it. 
 Even most middle-class blacks are no more than a generation or two removed from poverty; it's probably impossible to be a successful black man and not see your inner-city counterpart reflected daily in the eyes of others and perhaps in your own bathroom mirror. As John Singleton observed in the round table excerpted here: "I don't differentiate between myself and my cousin who just got out of jail." A black man need only try to hail a cab in New York City to be reminded that no amount of wealth, education or achievement can erase his blackness or maleness or sense of threat.
This breakdown of the inner-city black community and the marginalization of black men has accelerated in the last 25 years. One obvious explanation lies in drugs, especially crack. Another explanation, not so obvious, is the decline in manufacturing jobs with the shift to high technology. According to another participant in the symposium, William Julius Wilson, a professor of sociology and public policy at the University of Chicago, 48 percent of all employed black males, ages 20 to 24, were in well-paid, blue-collar, semiskilled crafts positions in 1974. By 1986, that figure had declined to 25 percent.
Joblessness has a direct effect on violent behavior. According to an ongoing research project led by Delbert Elliott of the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence at the University of Colorado, during adolescence the rates of violence for black and white young men are virtually the same. However as the study tracks the same group as they mature, the statistics show that black men between 25 and 30 years old are four times as likely to be involved in violent crimes as white men the same age. The difference is employment, Elliott says. "If you get a job, you quit your violence. If you don't get a job, you continue your violence." Employed black males and employed white males, have almost the same level of violent behavior.
The obstacles faced by black men are made even clearer by the extent to which black women have been able to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the civil rights movement. Black women have higher rates of completion at colleges and graduate schools. Their income is higher. On the average, black women who are college graduates have achieved income parity with their white counterparts. Black women remain afflicted by high rates of teen-age pregnancy, AIDS and drug addiction. But, on the whole, they have made real strides and, according to Dr. Alvin Poussaint of Harvard, "There's a high level of anger among black men, be they low-income or professional, that black women . . . are given preference over them."
The symposium participants are:
Patrick Day is the coordinator of the Multicultural Services Center at Texas Tech University in Lubbock. He is a graduate of Northwestern where, as a student, he was the assistant director of the university's cultural diversity project. He's currently developing a national association for African-Americans in higher education.
Ken Hamblin is a nationally syndicated radio talk show host and columnist, based in Denver. He owns two upscale sandwich shops in Colorado. He is also a pilot, photographer and fly fisherman. Hamblin grew up on welfare in a tenement apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.
Joseph Marshall is a former teacher who watched with frustration as smart, lively students fell prey to the lure of street life. In 1987, he founded (with Jack Jacqua) the Omega Boys Club in San Francisco, which has so far taken 500 youths off the street and sent 108 to college. He is also co-host of "Street Soldiers," a call-in radio program that is broadcast weekly in San Francisco and biweekly in Los Angeles with an audience now approaching 200,000. His callers ask tough questions about gangs, drugs and the pressure of being a teen-ager in the ghetto.
Hugh Price this summer became president of the National Urban League, which is trying to revitalize inner-city neighborhoods and raise the quality of life for their residents. He was previously vice president for equal opportunity and school reform at the Rockefeller Foundation.
John Singleton is the writer and director of "Boyz N the Hood," "Poetic Justice" and "Higher Learning," to be released early next year. In 1992, he was the first African-American nominated for an Oscar for best director, and at age 23, was the youngest ever nominated in the category, for "Boyz N the Hood"; Orson Welles had held that honor since 1941 when he was nominated for "Citizen Kane" at age 25.
William Julius Wilson is director of the Center for the Study of Urban Inequality at the University of Chicago. He is the author of several landmark books on race and class including "The Declining Significance of Race" and "The Truly Disadvantaged."
Bob Herbert, the moderator, joined The New York Times as an Op-Ed Page columnist in 1993. He has also been a reporter and columnist for The Daily News as well as a network television correspondent for NBC News.
BOB HERBERT:The question is, who is responsible for the terrible situation that so many African-American men and boys are in? And who specifically must begin to turn that around, and how?
HUGH PRICE: I'll offer one anecdote. A friend of mine, who is the president of the Cleveland Foundation, is part of a group of African-American men who are working with young males from tough neighborhoods. In one of the sessions, the kids said, "If you're going to be helpful to us, you've got to tell us what your income is." And it took a while for the professionals to decide that they would reveal this information -- not just to the kids, but to one another. Several meetings later, they went around the table. One fellow said, "I make $175,000." Another said, "I make $150,000." A third said, "I make $125,000." Do you know what the reaction of the young people was? "How do you get over on $175,000 a year?" Now where did they get that? They got that from a perception of one reality as a welfare and drug culture reality and the other reality as Shaquille O'Neal's salary. For all too many kids, there is no zone in between that makes any sense, that they're familiar with.
JOSEPH MARSHALL: Let me just talk about what's changed since I was a kid in South Central, all right? The first thing that is important is that I had a steady job. I had a job, 11 years old, working in a corner store, making 85 cents an hour. No big deal, right? But you know what I believed very early? I believed people could make money legally! [Laughter]
It doesn't sound like a big thing, but that's a big thing. I believed early that you could make money legally. I got a stake in what you call the American work ethic. I always had a job, little bitty jobs, you know, all the way through high school, all the way through college. But it locked it in my head, you can do it this way! Brothers can't find no work today! You cannot find the jobs I had, when you started to believe that you can make it doing right. But right outside the door [today], there's plenty of ways to make that dollar illegally. It's right there at your doorstep. You go outside, there it is. Here's the money!
PATRICK DAY: A lot more people are going home after college and can't find jobs. We are talking about people coming out, with degrees. From my experience, people are very frustrated.
JOHN SINGLETON: Well as far as I'm concerned, we were never meant to survive here in the first place. Everything that's happened in this country since we have set foot here has been geared toward our destruction. And it is by sheer miracle that we as a people have been able to survive. I mean you can go into a classroom of black boys and say: "This one is not going to survive. This one is going to go to jail. This one is going to kill. This one is going to rob a bank." You can do that with any city, country, rural area in these United States.
HERBERT: If we take your example of being able to go into a classroom of young boys and there would be X number who would just not make it, would not even survive, given the conditions as you describe them now, whose responsibility is it to turn that situation around?
SINGLETON: Black people. It's not up to white people. I think that it should all be within the black community. We need to act the way other successful groups in this country have acted for centuries. Meaning this is our family, stay out of our business, let us take care of our business. And we will either live or die by that. Either we live by it and survive or we continue to have this industry of destruction going on. It's a virtual holocaust going on out there now. No one admits it, but that's the deal, you know?
KEN HAMBLIN: If, as is true, from cradle to grave, light-skinned black people, dark-skinned black people, black people with straight and nappy hair, we've been told that racism abounds, white folks ain't going to give you a chance, there's no benefit in going to school, then we have been forewarned. It's like being prepared to walk through a door with three men, and getting a tip, "The guy in the middle is the one that's going to shoot you." Damn it, you can't stand there and take a bullet between the eyes. You've been forewarned.
SINGLETON: So what exactly are we talking about?
HAMBLIN: If we are warned from cradle to grave that racism abounds in this country, then because we know as black people we are not going to get a fair deal, we should be the best educated. Because whitey ain't going to give us a break. We should be the most law-abiding because the justice system is racist and bigoted. But that requires hard work, midnight oil. Doing the right thing, staying the course. It's not a philosophy that is likely to gain me a lot of friends. Because it's the least romantic of all the paths.
MARSHALL: I need to be on the street, working with the homies. I barely saw a .38 when I was a kid. Even in L.A., right? These brothers got weapons, they've got 9 millimeters, AK's, Uzis, Glocks, weapons of war on the streets, right in their hands. That's a huge difference between now and 25 years ago! These neighborhoods are like Beirut. And I'll tell you, crack -- ain't never been an agent like crack in our community. Crack is the only thing, chemical or otherwise, that has stopped African-American women from mothering their children. And I see it! Slavery didn't do that! You could separate a family in slavery and some other woman would take care of the child. You got something in our community now that stops the fundamental raising of the children.
HAMBLIN: Crack and AIDS is not the most critical assault. We've been under that assault before. I can't think of the author's name, it's been racking my brain. It's in the book "The Promised Land" [by Nicholas Lemann]. It talked about Clarksdale, Miss. Talked about syphilis, talked about bathtub gin. And what he was writing about was black trash. Black trash. And in this room, we are debating the merits of including the values of black trash in the mainstream of the black effort. Now I know that's a hard pill to swallow because----.
SINGLETON: Black trash?
MARSHALL: What is black trash?
HAMBLIN: Black trash. We all get access to a dictionary. If there's white trash, there's black trash. If there's a hot day, there's a cool day. I'm not here to ask for anyone's agreement.
It's my opinion. We are talking about a collectivism. Black people have failed because of the socialist collectivism.
HERBERT: Ken, so we're clear, I think we need to get your definition of black trash.
HAMBLIN: Black trash are the people who prey on us and then turn around and encourage us to sit here as intellectual wizards, film makers, columnists, talk show hosts, members of black organizations and talk about what whitey did to us. Now we talk about black people not getting a shot. I don't care what you say about white people; education is still free. And I was part of a generation that said we were going to take the schools from whitey because they couldn't teach us. Well, look at our schools today! Look at the S.A.T. scores. Look at the attitude: "Yo baby, you trying to be white! How come you don't talk right?" All of those things exclude you from the marketplace.
MARSHALL: All I'm saying is somebody taught you. A lot of these guys, ain't nobody teaching them.
HAMBLIN: Then they lose!
MARSHALL: Agreed. We ain't disagreeing!
DAY: We have not prepared black men to work and be employable in the 21st century.
HAMBLIN: Then they lose! But you can't sit here and deny all of the effort and progress that people have been making!
MARSHALL: Who has denied anything? Nobody is denying that.
HAMBLIN: I've got ears. I'm sitting here and I'm listening. I'm squirming in the chair. And if we don't know why there are no jobs in Harlem, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, in northwest Denver, in South Central, in East St. Louis, then we are kidding ourselves.
 
JIM CROW COLLAPSED. SO DID BLUE-COLLAR JOBS.
HERBERT: Hugh, you would say that there are other reasons why there are not jobs.
PRICE: Let me just say a couple of things. When the Brown decision [The 1954 Supreme Court school desegregation decision] was handed down, the big assumption was that there was a pretty robust economy. There was a white-collar economy and a blue-collar economy. The assumption that the blue-collar economy, that was robust coming out of World War II, would be there and that blacks would get to play [their role] once the Jim Crow laws collapsed. That assumption has not held true.
WILLIAM JULIUS WILSON: If you talk with employers today, they will tell you that they prefer to hire women, white women, black women, immigrants, ahead of black males.
Jobs now call for more contact with the public. In previous years, black males would work in a factory or shop doing heavy lifting and labor. They didn't have to come into contact with the public. There is a perception that they don't relate to the public or the public doesn't relate to the black males. That the consumers would rather not have to deal with the black males.
HERBERT: What are the reasons given for this?
WILSON: There is an image that black men are threatening, that they're dangerous and that people would rather not come into contact with them. This image has increased in recent years and it carries over to the employment place.
PRICE: The one intervention -- that we won't see but that I think would make a huge difference -- is factories moving back into the inner city offering today's equivalent of 1954 wages. But we are not going to see that, and we must all improvise with this new reality and try to figure out how to navigate it. School systems have not made that adjustment. And they especially haven't made that adjustment for us.
HAMBLIN: We run the schools in our community.
PRICE: Doesn't matter. We use testing and gatekeeping mechanisms.
HAMBLIN: A white kid sitting in a middle-class, or low-income or black trash community is not stupid. And when he watches a black or Hispanic kid come through and run accusations of racism and thereby be excused from doing the homework or the quality of work necessary to keep up, that white kid plays out the same game. I believe that when whatever comes out of the ghetto, the underclass black or brown trash element of that ghetto----.
SINGLETON: Please, you know----.
HAMBLIN: I was on the street before you were born. Back off.
HERBERT: John, your comments.
SINGLETON: I'm sure that every week, you take out the trash. And you take out your trash, all right, unless you eat out all the time, O.K.? What do you do? You got eggs, you break the eggs, you put the shells in the trash can. You have a milk carton, you drink it, throw it in the trash can, right? That's called usage. O.K.? What you term as black trash, I call my brothers and sisters. They are going through the same kind of process as when you eat something and throw it out. That's usage.
HAMBLIN: We're not talking about milk cartons. I'm talking about people that crank down the window and send young black boys, that you are lamenting about, home in body bags. We're not talking about eggshells.
SINGLETON: I can shout louder than you.
HAMBLIN: Go right ahead.
SINGLETON: I'm younger than you.
HAMBLIN: Go right ahead.
SINGLETON: You are allowed to have your own opinion. But you say that you don't care. The brothers on the street don't care either. They would come in here and maul everybody in this room down. You part of the family, you know? You see my point? You don't care. They don't care.
WILSON: In responding to Ken's comments, which I find somewhat bizarre because it seems to me that you have reached the conclusion that [these people] are trash and developed that way because of some individual shortcomings.
HAMBLIN: Yup.
WILSON: I would say that they developed that way because of lack of opportunity.
HAMBLIN: I mean the young boy who develops that way soon learns by the kind of rhetoric that is fed in from both white and black concerned citizens who hold them to no standard. They are not stupid. By virtue of the fact that they are on the street today, they are the end of evolution, the most cunning creature in the jungle. They may not be called to Cape Canaveral to launch rockets, but they have every bit of human cunning. They adapt and metamorphose to the environment, and they prey on us while we sit here playing out this game.
WILSON: What is so interesting is to talk to the young people who have some reason to feel hopeful, who think that they have a future out there ahead of them. Their behavior is entirely different from those who don't have that. What I'm saying is that a lot of behavior that you are talking about is a direct response of people not having a future, or feeling that they don't have a future, feeling that there is little ahead for them to look forward to.
MARSHALL: Let me just say this, they're not told [what their prospects for the future could be]. This is what they're told: "Yo! You got to do what you got to do. Got to handle your business. You gotta get your own. Ain't nobody doin' nothing for you." And without that information, they adopt to this other set of information.
WILSON: Can you imagine what would happen if we had no unemployment rates, tight labor markets for a long period of time, what effect that would have on a lot of these youngsters in the inner city? Because right now, these youngsters, particularly those in high school, don't see the relationship between school and post-school employment. So it's hard to get them to study. Some of the obstacles they have to overcome, such as lack of information, is overwhelming.
MARSHALL: Wait a minute, let me make my point. Because they're getting information, they're getting the wrong information. They're not getting the right information, they're getting the wrong information. You're not around to tell them the right information and the schools ain't around to tell them the right information.
HAMBLIN: What happens when they look outside the neighborhood?
MARSHALL: They don't look outside the neighborhood.
DAY: I work on a college campus and I think a very serious point is that responsibility lies within our educational institutions. Black men have learned absolutely nothing about their history, or American history, if you will, as it relates to them.
HERBERT: Given some of the problems that we have been discussing, what are some of the steps that people need to take to turn things around?
MARSHALL: The first step and most important is, do you want to do it? Is it important to you to do something about it? Are the kids worth it? Because most people don't think these guys, or this issue, is worth it. I was in Israel when Arafat came to the West Bank. I'm seeing lifelong enemies, centuries-old enemies come together because they feel that it's necessary. They're coming together but not only that. This peace is being aided by the world. We are going to dump $100 million into Palestine because we know that if Arafat can't take care of his people, you can't have peace. What the world is saying is that that's important. I got war in the neighborhoods. I got brothers been banging [fighting in gangs] for 25 years. Ain't nobody helping them. They don't have any envoys, no negotiators; there is no peace accord being signed in Washington or Compton.
DAY: What has to happen is that every black person has to make a commitment to doing something about the plight of their people, all right? At the core, it has to be black people. [If we look to anyone else], we are absolutely fooling ourselves.
MARSHALL: The first thing you got to say is that it's worth it. Now a lot of individuals are doing that and the individual can get results. I got plenty of results. I got plenty of homies never looking back. Bring them in here and you would swear they never shot people or sold dope. But what was important was that somebody said it was important for them to change.
DAY: Every black person has got to be able to answer the question "What are you doing?" Until everybody can say that I have my hands on a young black person and doing X, Y or Z, we will never get there. You can't do that sitting around and talking. It's a matter of putting your hands on somebody and saying, "Here is what you need to do to function in a modern world, a technological society." But it's got to be a hands-on thing. It's got to be hands-on.
MARSHALL: That ain't stupid. See, kids ain't stupid.
IT'S NOT JUST
BLACK MEN THAT
ARE SUFFERING
MARSHALL: That's like people following Harriet [Tubman] out of slavery; a lot of them want to get out. They just don't know how to do it. I'm not saying all of them are going to come out. Some of them got so much scar tissue on them, there is so much anger, fear and pain in a lot of these brothers that you know there is just too much there for some of them. But a lot of them will follow you and if you take the time, you can get some of those with a lot of garbage in them, because I've seen that happen, too.
HAMBLIN: I worked hard to come across that bridge from Brooklyn. I worked hard to move away from Fulton Street and Nostrand Avenue, where the dope dealers and hookers and prostitutes were. I'm not going to give up my right of access to the system, by being forced to select and live with people I don't want to live with.
MARSHALL: It's really no different than physical slavery. Harriet went into the plantation and she said, "I can take you to the North." That's how most black people got free, all right? She led them out. They followed the North Star and she went back by herself, no posse and there were black people then, that didn't want to leave physical slavery! She said: "I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back."
SINGLETON: And the next time they'll be ready.
MARSHALL: I have seen results. I can give you plenty of them. But the main issue is the effort.
WILSON: I have to disagree. I don't disagree entirely but I want to make this point. I think its important to get black people involved in helping black men, disadvantaged black men, recover. No question about that. But it can't be black people alone.
MARSHALL: And! Don't say but. Say and!
WILSON: O.K. And----.
MARSHALL: There you go, say and. You're right!
WILSON: I think it can't be an effort that's directed solely at black males. It has to be a comprehensive program that involves different segments of society and not just blacks. I'm talking about programs that involve the interaction of the private sector and the government sector, people at the community level and people representing various institutions designed to improve the chances in life of various Americans. The question is whether or not it's possible in this day and age.
SINGLETON: Nobody is going out of their way to push black people forward. It's not up to white people or anyone else to do that. It's up to black people to do that in the long run.
WILSON: I think that somehow we've got to change the rhetoric that we use to talk about these issues. The rhetoric has to emphasize things that people have in common. It's not just black men that are suffering a great deal. It's also the case that a lot of people are experiencing economic marginality. Not only the so-called underclass, but also the working poor, white and black and even middle-class people.
SINGLETON: The white trash too, Ken.
WILSON: Even middle-class people are experiencing a decline in their real income. So what I'm saying is that if this thing is going to be turned around, the nation is going to have to take a different approach toward these kinds of problems. In order to generate the kind of support that you need, you have to discuss problems in a way that resonates with different segments of the population.
DAY: Let me jump in. At some level, I agree with you. But I think that a trap we run into sometimes is thinking that our problems have to be solved in the context of other people. I think at some point we've got to come home, sit down and talk about how to clean up the house. Then I think we can introduce a broader program. But that initial step has to be at home and it has to be with us.
PRICE: As we think about the problem, I think we've got to distinguish between those things which we have to work on as individuals and as members of the community. I think we've got to make an unequivocal commitment to develop our children for the 21st century. We've got to know what that entails and we have just got to go for it. And most parents, including most middle- and upper-income parents don't even understand that. . . .
DAY: Yes, sir. They're not prepared for that.
PRICE: In addition to the parents, we need to put caring adults in the lives of kids. I love mentors, but mentors aren't good enough. We in the Urban League have talked about the idea of youth development funds. We would go into the African-American middle class, and by that I don't mean status, I mean the ability to give. We are going to go into our community and say, "Everybody, you got to put up $500 or $1,000 per year on the table to pay the salaries of the youth workers who are going to be there in the lives of kids every day."
[At the Rockefeller Foundation] I worked with the National Guard on something called the National Guard Youth Challenge Corps, which has taken dropouts off the streets and put them through a six-month residential program. This program is on military bases. Over 70 percent of those who enter the program complete it. And of those who complete it, over 70 percent are coming out with their high-school equivalency degrees. And over 80 percent of those who get G.E.D.'s, in the early run of the demonstration, are either in two- or four-year colleges or in job training. What the military has and has always had that we don't use on the domestic side of the equation is fast track, no-nonsense skill training. Deep understanding of human development and motivation. Very interesting, finely grained incentive systems. So that they say to a young person, "If you can't see way over the horizon, come on a journey with us and we are going to take it step by step."
HAMBLIN: The bottom line is that we can sit here on the 10th floor of The New York Times building. We can sit on campus in Texas, or Chicago, wherever we want. Until we break down that wall to let a black girl know in Oakland that it's O.K. to pursue an opportunity that will take her away from Oakland and not be called a race traitor or sell out or whatever, then we are spinning our wheels.
PRICE: Well, those things are happening. Girls are looking outside, boys are looking outside. By the millions. And others aren't.
MARSHALL: And they can handle "sellout" and "punk" and all that stuff. They learn how to handle it.
'MOST BROTHERS
GOT US ALL SCARED'
HERBERT: What are the prevailing images of black men in America?
SINGLETON: Wait, wait. Just stop before you even start. We know the images of black men in America. What we need to concentrate on is----.
HERBERT: You are a very significant person to talk about this because you deal in images.
SINGLETON: I don't want to sit here and tell you all the images of the dangerous black man in America because I don't want that to be written. I make a living making pictures. I try to have a strong black man in every picture that is responsible for other black men. Younger, older, whatever. I've made three films now, one comes out early next year ["Higher Learning"]. I had a black father in my first film, "Boyz N the Hood," who tried to make sure that despite all the adversities outside of the home, he would be there for his son and teach him what he needed to know to become a man. And that at a certain point the son had to make his own decision of what type of man he's going to be. In my second picture, I had a young black father who took his daughter away from the mother who was messed up on drugs. And in this new picture I have a young man in a university who comes up against a conservative kind of brother and in the end learns that they have a bond.
PRICE:What we have said in the Urban League is that these black folks who have moved out of the village have got to keep paying taxes. Basically we've got to help people connect the dots between the fact that if we don't make the investments in rerouting young male and young kids growing up in poverty from the lives that they're headed to, all of us are going to sit around and moan about the quality of life and the fact that crime is going into the suburbs.
SINGLETON: Our children need assets like technology that will lead us into the next century. And they need to learn that it's cool to learn this technology. That it's cool to learn how to use a computer. Enough of basketball. It's about learning how to use this stuff.
WILSON: If the young people know how to use it and become more hopeful about their future, you'll see an entirely different response in the classroom. And an entirely different response in the neighborhood. Kids who believe they have a future behave differently from kids who don't think they have a future.
MARSHALL: You're saying that kids need to believe there is a future. Hey, you just want to live. I mean brothers tell me all the time: "Damn! I made it to 21." So you know life, liberty and peace is what I call it. I don't even use the pursuit of happiness. I just use peace. To me that's the first question: Is it worth it to make the effort?
HERBERT: You have kids packing guns----.
MARSHALL: Yeah.
HERBERT: Who are willing to shoot other kids.
MARSHALL: Yeah.
HERBERT: What are you going to do to stop that?
MARSHALL: I can talk them out of it. I have talked them out of it.
SINGLETON: It's a mental state.
MARSHALL: I have talked brothers out of packing guns because somebody told them that's what they should do. Nobody has challenged them enough to show that, number one, what they're doing isn't going to work and that there are other alternatives. Mostly it's just a matter of being there to say something to them in the first place. Most brothers got us all scared.
SINGLETON: Right.
MARSHALL: I mean they do! We're afraid of them. We are afraid to engage them, just the process of engaging them. . . . You know what I think the Uncle Tom stuff comes from? That means you don't want to deal with me.
SINGLETON (Looking toward Hamblin): You don't care!MARSHALL: You don't give a damn about me! So if you don't give a damn about me, I'm going to call you Uncle Tom. What they're really saying is that nobody is willing to engage me, O.K.? So the process of engaging them, getting involved in their lives, saying "I'm not afraid of you" is a powerful thing. It's a powerful thing to say to a child that's not biologically yours----.
SINGLETON: I agree.
MARSHALL: To say that I will be [between] 1 to 100 percent parent to you. Or 1 to 100 percent friend to you. The biggest challenge I had when I started working with kids outside of teaching was that I didn't have an angle. They don't live around genuine people. They live in a predator's world. They've been prey since they were little. I mean kids go out into the street and become prey and they turn into predators.
HAMBLIN: Simple. Wonderful method and policy of collectivist thinking. Hope is limited. Kids packing guns, out-of-wedlock births. John started to come around to it. I'm still stuck there. What do we do?
HERBERT: We need you to tell us what to do.
HAMBLIN: What do we do to help get black boys and girls, young men and women, out of failing ghetto communities so that they can look beyond those boundaries and find hope?
HERBERT: Answer your question.
SINGLETON: What do you do to keep the ghetto community from being a ghetto community?
HAMBLIN: Bring hope back in.
MARSHALL: I ask them: "What do you want? What would you like to have? What do you want to be?" Oh, O.K. Let's see how we can get there. It could be a job, it could be a college education. It could be a pair of shoes. Now I'm going to tell you what happens along the way. They become realistic. They become realistic in their expectations.
They say, "I need money."
Well, how much do you need?
"I don't know, I just need money. I feel like I have nothing if I ain't got no money."
HAMBLIN: Why? Why?
MARSHALL: I help them say: "Oh, I need $50 a week. I need $20 a week. I need $100 a week." Well, maybe money is not really that important. They begin to change.
HERBERT: You are engaging them. Who else needs to do it?
MARSHALL: Anybody who wants to. You can do it one on one. I have a radio show, "Street Soldiers," in two cities that reaches 200,000 kids. This is specifically using media to combat violence rather than how it often contributes to violence. In this room, like I'm talking to you, they listen to me. It's amazing that they will actually call in and say, "Look, I want out. How do I get out?"
 
'GET THEM OUT OF THERE!'
HAMBLIN: I am telling you that meaner than any Simon Legree, any slave master, there is a grip, an iron wall, around ghetto communities. South Central, Watts, East St. Louis. And I'm saying the first step to saving those black kids is to say to them: "There is a shot. You can be the next John Singleton. You can, in fact, be the next director of the Urban League." But you've got to take them away, you've got to bust up that black reservation. Whenever I talk about that, I get the names, the Uncle Toms.
MARSHALL: Yeah, but could you explain what you mean by "bust up the reservation," bust up the ghetto? I got to understand what you mean by bust up----.
HAMBLIN: I'm telling you that when you find kinds coming from a certain environment, whether they're getting pregnant with their third child or whether or not they're young boys such as portrayed in John's "Boyz N the Hood"----.
MARSHALL: What do you mean by "bust up"?
HAMBLIN: Break it down. Tell them that they can go away to college.
MARSHALL: Oh, O.K. That's no problem.
HAMBLIN: Get them out of there!
DAY: First of all, when we talk about busting up the black community----.
HAMBLIN: Ghetto! The black community is not the ghetto.
SINGLETON: When we talk about the family, we are talking about the nature of relationships between black men and black women. From age 1, black women are taught that black men are nothing. Black men are taught to take their frustrations out on black women. Black men and black women and black people are at war with everything around them.
MARSHALL: To me, [the solution] is real easy. Be a family member.
HERBERT: But it's easier said than done, isn't it?
MARSHALL: No, it isn't! I'm putting 108 kids through school myself. Me. None of them are biologically related to me. I'm not saying everybody has to put [kids] through college. What I did make was a commitment to be a family member. What that means is if I see a kid on the street doing something wrong, I'm going to tell him he's wrong. That's family. That's what I would expect somebody to do for my kids. I'm going to do that for everybody else's kids. This whole notion of expanded family, that it takes a whole village to raise one child, has always worked. I go back to Harriet Tubman. That was one individual. We honor this woman. We honor Malcolm. We honor Martin. Those were individual efforts so I'm not looking for any grandiose plan.
 
SAVING ONE MEANS SAVING FOUR
MARSHALL: I got this thing about family. When I save one, I save four. That's the way I figure it out. The brother. The brother, or brothers he was going to shoot. The girl he was going to impregnate. And the baby he was going to bring into the world. So I never say one, I say four. So the grandiose plan is very simple, but not easy. See that's the point for me. My thing is, "Are you willing to do it?"
WILSON: Take a white or black middle-class family and strip them of all their resources to make them comparable to an inner-city family. Put them in one of those dangerous neighborhoods where the parents have to worry every day about what's going to happen to their children. Where they have to deal with the crime, the drugs and isolation. Where they can't depend on other families in the neighborhood because they're also isolated. You put any family in that neighborhood, stick them there, let them be trapped and see how successful they'll be over the long run in raising their children.
PRICE: It's easy to proclaim that "they" ought to be responsible. It's easy to proclaim that folks ought to care for their kids; that we ought not to have out-of-wedlock births and so on. The question is whether you've got the support structures, the development structures there to help people navigate and make those calculations on a day- to-day basis. So that there isn't just a proclamation from the pulpit or the press.
MARSHALL: In many ways, I appreciate this gathering. I gotta say that. Because this ain't the N.B.A. championships. [Laughter] It isn't the Super Bowl or the latest concert. Just the fact that we are here says that this is important enough to talk about.
SINGLETON: I don't differentiate between myself and my cousin who just got out of jail or such-and-such over there who is dealing crack or this person that's working at McDonald's. I'm a black man living in America, right? And when I get up and I look in the mirror, despite whatever position I have and despite whatever job I have, I know that I go through the same thing that every other black man experiences. WILSON: You look at some of the youngsters in the inner city entering the first grade. Oh boy, they can hardly wait to go to the first grade. They're very enthusiastic about learning. They're very, very excited. By the fourth grade, they are totally turned off. What happens?

Pick a Mandate

BYLINE: By Max Frankel 

 BODY:
Most Octobers in America are fun because neither pundits nor politicians know what the voters will do on Election Day. Post-election Novembers and Decembers are even more exciting because the same pundits and politicians suddenly know exactly why the voters did it. They look in the mirror and there discover the electorate's innermost thoughts and feelings.
Thus we get a media clash of mandates, a contest more instructive and certainly cheaper than the battle of poisonous paid commercials that preceded the voting. The experts who spent October deploring the absence of any meaningful discussion of issues invariably find by mid-November that the voters sent messages bursting with meaning after all, messages that just happen to be congenial to the views of the discovering pundit or politician. 
 The gentle former Republican Senator from Tennessee, Howard Baker, for example, observed on the morning after that "the country is in gentle rebellion" -- dangerous only because the voters themselves "don't know where they are going." The determined Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, on the other hand, found the same electorate talking his language, hellbent to get where he's going: "They're saying, 'Shut down the Clinton agenda; make Government smaller; we want our money back.' "
Projecting the self onto a continental quilt of election returns is a bit like discerning new mythological figures in a starlit sky; it takes the keenest vision and a vivid imagination. A candidate's blurry October promise to hold down taxes can be transformed in November into a stellar mandate to cut mainly the taxes on capital gains -- by precisely 50 percent. (Speaker-to-be Newt Gingrich avers that this is not a benefit to the rich because they "already have capital"; it's a "benefit to the poor," who will acquire capital from jobs created by the savings of the rich.) What before the election was a nebulous devotion to family values can turn out afterward to be a dazzling new idea for getting teen-age mothers off welfare -- ship their kids to orphanages. Gingrich has not yet disclosed who would pay for the orphanages.
In the post-election campaigns, winners like Gingrich speak with greater certitude than losers. This year's biggest loser, President Clinton, was surely the muddiest analyst. He said he thought the voters "were saying two things to me, or maybe three . . . maybe 300." He took these three, or 300, messages to be a desire for change, for smaller and cheaper government, and he argued that the Democrats suffered a historic beating primarily because they were producing these changes too slowly.
There exists no comprehensive guide to all these morning-after exhalations. But the main themes were easy to find in just a few evenings with C-Span, national news magazines, newspapers and columnists.
Almost all the commentators agreed that after 1992's "Year of the Woman," 1994 could well be recorded as the "Year of the Man." To produce the first Republican House in 40 years, men voted Republican by 54 percent to 46, whereas women, especially unmarried women, favored Democrats. White men voted 62 percent for Republicans, and by about 70 percent in the once-Democratic South. Few pundits were brave enough to explain the sexual divide, but those most pleased by the result were quick to adopt a macho manner.
The Wall Street Journal, for instance, cheered the "historic repudiation of modern liberalism" and completion of the Reagan Revolution, mincing no words about the wimps who'd interrupted it: "The electorate has found that 'kinder and gentler' Republicans don't work and that there are not yet any 'new Democrats.' " The New York Post, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Thomas Sowell and William Kristol echoed that theme. George F. Will, as usual, offered it most pungently: "With breezy frankness, voters have said approximately this: Something is amiss when a government that does not adequately deliver the mail delivers condoms to children."
More solemn end-of-an-era essays were offered by Al From (notable because he invented, and persuaded Bill Clinton to head, the Democratic Leadership Council) and the historian Michael R. Beschloss, who found a historic breach in the "high sea wall" that Congressional Democrats had long maintained against the conservative tides.
The middle-ground media, by comparison, were mealy-mouthed. The Daily News in New York found the result only "partly coherent" and thought the Republicans would fail because they lack the guts to cut farm subsidies and vacation-home mortgages. The New York Times suggested hesitantly that there was "something about Mr. Clinton" that "nettled" the voters. The Washington Post conceded that the vote was against liberalism but doubted that spending could soon be cut enough to lower taxes -- a doubt shared by The Los Angeles Times, The Economist, USA Today and Time, which saw the Republicans burdened by their own costly special interests, like agriculture, oil, guns and the Christian Right.
Most columnists found their own constellations in the sky. Mark Shields led the few who "unmistakably" saw a referendum on Bill Clinton. William Raspberry caught a whiff of racism in "the revenge of the white guy," a phenomenon that John Leo ascribed instead to anti-white-guy "multi-culturalism." Joe Klein also blamed indulgence of "protected" ethnic groups -- and public-employee unions. E. J. Dionne Jr. stressed the Democrats' failure to deliver promised health, welfare and political reforms. Bill Safire and David S. Broder led those who thought the public wanted to punish a government (or Congress) grown too large while producing too few results.
The villain was economics -- namely, the middle-class's still-shrinking take-home pay -- said Anthony Lewis and Richard Cohen. "It's not the economy, stupid" but "values" under many labels like crime, welfare, race, family, quotas, said Ben Wattenberg. In the judgment of Susan Estrich: "Hate works. Fear Sells." No, wrote Pete Hamill, "The most powerful force in American politics is not anger, it's nostalgia."
William F. Buckley Jr. wondered admirably how "a mere 2 percent" shift to Republican House candidates since 1992 could cause "all this commotion." But for parochial reasons, I responded best to the judgment of Jim Sleeper that the liberalism of "most New York Times writers" is "as much to blame" as the right wing for "the G.O.P. Neanderthals, know-nothings and nincompoops who've swept Congress." Just think, that means in Tennessee alone, the daily sale of only 1,740 copies of The Times caused the Democrats to lose the governorship, two Senate seats and two more seats in the House. Improbable? Well, O.K., 4,400 on Sundays.

HEADLINE: Saw the Show? Buy the Trinket

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS 

 BODY:
IT WAS A TYPICAL EVENING AT THE Palace Theater on Broadway, where another performance of "Beauty and the Beast" was about to begin. At curbside, taxis pulled up with late arrivals. At the box office, breathless theatergoers checked their tickets. And in the crowded lobby, by the long glass counter where a staff of six peddled "Beauty and the Beast" compact disks, silk ties and sweatshirts, the air crackled with the conversation of the contemporary theater:
"How much is the T-shirt?" 
 "Do you want to go to 'Adult Large'?"
"How small do they run?"
"That comes in black and white."
Once, a big Broadway show was simply an eye-filling diversion, an event to be savored and later recalled by playing a cast album or thumbing through a playbill. But now, as producers become increasingly sophisticated about selling their shows, embracing merchandising techniques long employed by sports teams, rock stars and movie studios, the Broadway show has also become a collectible: its logo can be stamped on everything from coffee mugs to lapel pins, from $2 postcards to $170 directors' jackets. Selling theatrical keepsakes has evolved into a multimillion-dollar business, with some shows, like the rock musical "Tommy," earning more than $1 million a year on merchandising.
From one end of Broadway to the other, new shows -- usually musicals these days -- sweep into town with large casts, larger budgets, sumptuous sets and their own product lines. At the Gershwin Theater, for instance, you can browse through kiosks filled with "Show Boat" spoons, playing cards and pewter key chains. At the Minskoff, "Sunset Boulevard" mugs made of porcelain are sold in the musical's own boutique. Less than a block away, at "Damn Yankees" in the Marquis, the producers are selling sets of baseball cards depicting actors in the show. "Tommy" marketed a pinball
 
machine to video arcades, a promotion that even at $4,500 per machine completely sold out.
Dickens, the Rockettes, Tony Kushner -- anything on a large New York stage, it seems, is fair game for the tchotchke industry. "A Christmas Carol," the new musical at the Paramount in Madison Square Garden, is selling an array of Victorian-inspired knickknacks, like Christmas ornaments and cloisonne pins, at a shop in the theater, as well as at a booth at F. A. O. Schwarz. Radio City Music Hall has just opened a freestanding shop, the Radio City Avenue Store, that markets everything from Radio City T-shirts to coffee cups adorned with the likenesses of the theater's renowned kick line.
Even "Angels in America," Mr. Kushner's Pulitzer Prize winning drama about AIDS (which closes on Broadway today), offers key chains, baseball caps, sweatshirts and T-shirts. The national road tour will increase sales.
While no industrywide figures are available for this extremely lucrative side business, sales-related profits for some musicals have been extraordinary. In the year and a half since its Broadway opening, "Tommy" has grossed $3 million from merchandise sold at a small booth in the St. James Theater and during the national tour, said Scott Zeiger, president of the Pace Theatrical Group, a co-producer. Some merchandisers say that the opportunity to shop at intermission can add as much as $10 per theatergoer to a show's take.
"It's an inherent part now of every major musical production," said Garth Drabinsky, the producer of "Show Boat," the lavish Harold Prince revival of the Jerome Kern-Oscar Hammerstein classic. The musical originated in Toronto and boasts the highest ticket price on Broadway: $75. Mr. Drabinsky, a former movie producer and exhibitor, and his staff are marketing a product line that capitalizes on the story's setting in the Old South. The effort was so successful in Toronto -- where sales of programs, recordings and souvenirs like collectors' spoons earned an estimated $5 a ticket holder -- that Mr. Drabinsky has brought the merchandise to New York.
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO INCLUDE THE "Show Boat" assortment of "epic quality food snacks," candies manufactured for the musical that were given names like "Can't Help Lovin' Those Gummies" and "Parthy's Potato-Coated Peanuts." The trouble was, the Nederlander Organization, which owns the Minskoff, could help lovin' those gummies: the theater sells its own candy -- and, according to the show's press agent, Mary Bryant, forbade Mr. Drabinsky from peddling his. The Nederlander Organization did not respond to numerous requests for comment.
For a long time, Broadway remained aloof from the American craze for buying customized memorabilia, regarding such aggressive merchandising as the purview of cruder venues, like ball parks and boardwalk concession stands. The theater was not supposed to be about the bottom line.
But with the advent of the mega-musical, international hits like "Cats" and "Les Miserables" became industries unto themselves. Broadway producers soon learned that they could hedge their bets through the sales of autographed posters, beach towels and refrigerator magnets. The tremendous popularity and vast reach of those productions led producers to reconsider the Broadway audience as a pool of souvenir-conscious consumers extending across the country and even around the world.
The growth of merchandising is also a byproduct of the changing economics of Broadway: as ticket prices rise, the Broadway theater habit has become, for many people, a once- or twice-a-year luxury, a special occasion, much like a trip to the circus or a world's fair. And what is more basic to the experience of attending a spectacle than taking home a souvenir?
Still, some theater producers are leery of making too much of merchandising successes, lest they be accused of putting commerce before art. In fact, some shows take great pains to avoid looking like hucksters. At "Beauty and the Beast," for instance, the Walt Disney Company, the show's producer and merchandiser, has tailored its style of selling to the more sedate sensibilities of the theater. Expert at marketing spinoff products from movies, it steers clear of shouted come-ons in the theater: at lobby counters salespeople simply hold their wares aloft, mutely, as ticketholders file by.
At the same time, because most shows are produced by privately held companies, souvenir sales figures are closely guarded secrets. Seth Felson, president of Loring & Matthews, a Miami firm that has overseen the merchandising of 46 shows in the United States, would, like many in the business, speak only in generalities. Sales of items for "The Phantom of the Opera," he said, have been in the "double double digits of millions" of dollars. He would not elaborate.
"We don't create the logo for the merchandise; we create the logo for the show," said Antony Pye Jeary, managing director of Dewynters, the London advertising agency that oversees the worldwide marketing and merchandising of the musicals of Andrew Lloyd Webber, the composer, as well as those of Cameron Mackintosh, the producer, who have been involved separately and together with many of the most successful musicals of the last decade, including "Cats," "Les Miserables" and "The Phantom of the Opera."
MR. LLOYD WEBBER'S newest production, "Sunset Boulevard," opened last month in New York offering an array of items that reflect the show's Old Hollywood style. No cheap crockery coffee mug for "Sunset"; what was called for was a more elegant piece. Thus the decision to go porcelain. "It's an adult product, as opposed to a family product," Mr. Pye Jeary said.
Mr. Pye Jeary was there at what some consider to be the birth of modern theatrical merchandising: a London office in Piccadilly, where the creative team for "Cats," including Mr. Lloyd Webber and Trevor Nunn, the director, gathered, shortly before the musical opened in London in 1981, to look over the designs for a poster that would promote the show.
"We must have produced 50 posters," Mr. Pye Jeary recalled. "And some had real cats, some had illustrations." One image captivated everyone: a pair of cat's eyes, with a dancer reflected in them. "There was this 20 seconds of silence," he said. "It was one of those classic situations where nobody knew what they wanted until they saw it." It was, in a sense, the ur-Cat.
The selling of "Cats" and "Cats"-related products was revolutionary at the time. While T-shirts, programs and cast albums had been sold by many shows on Broadway before, "Cats" brought a new sophistication to the mass marketing and advertising of a Broadway show, through the merchandise sales in the theater and aggressive marketing of the "Cats" logo.
Today, it is commonplace for producers to come to Broadway with the ubiquitous T-shirts and anywhere from 5 to 20 other items. The sale of the merchandise, which also includes the traditional souvenir programs and cast recordings, accounts for a relatively small portion of a show's income -- producers and merchandisers say the goods typically represent 3 to 6 percent of revenues -- but that can still be a considerable sum by Broadway standards.
"Merchandising is key to any live entertainment business, whether you're in contemporary music, Broadway, the circus or ice shows," said Mr. Zeiger, whose company co-produced "Tommy," a musical whose roots in rock have helped to drive sales. Rock concerts -- where profits from T-shirts and memorabilia can amount to as much as 50 percent of gross ticket sales -- historically have been more aggressive at selling merchandise. So the producers of "Tommy" picked Winterlands, an organization that had vast experience in the rock business, to oversee their merchandising.
"A large part of our audience is expecting to go home with a T-shirt and a baseball cap," Mr. Zeiger said. "The traditional theatergoer, the 53-year-old woman from Long Island, is not the demographic that wears T-shirts. But our 40-year-old stockbrokers from Wall Street who loosen their ties to come see 'Tommy,' they probably wear T-shirts when they exercise on weekends."
The value of those T-shirts cannot simply be measured in financial terms. The logo on a shirt often becomes, like a corporate trademark, a show's public face. The abstracted helicopter of "Miss Saigon," the haunting white mask of "Phantom," the sad-eyed waif of "Les Miserables" are deemed classics of their kind, powerful images that help sell merchandise and tickets.
To understand how little producers and theater owners thought about the merchandising of their shows, one has only to look at the theaters themselves. A major problem for those who market souvenirs is that many Broadway theaters do not have the space to sell them.
"Crazy for You," Mr. Felson said, about the musical at the Shubert Theater, "is not one of the higher-grossing shows for merchandise. But it's not because of the show. It's because of the theater. The Shubert has no lobby space; I'm stuck into the corner. But the worst theater we've ever gone into is the Broadhurst," where "Kiss of the Spider Woman" is now playing. "No space. I set up in front of the box office. We have to hide it during the walk-in and shlep it into place during the intermission."
Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization, owners of the Shubert and 15 other Broadway theaters, said the chief architectural concern when many of the older theaters were built was finding places for people to sit, not to buy. "Consequently, you do not have very elaborate lobby spaces, especially in dramatic houses. And even in musical houses the lobby space is on the small side," he said.
Top-selling merchandise though is no guarantee that a show will make a profit. It has been estimated, for example, that "Show Boat," which cost more than $10 million to produce, will have to run for almost two years at near capacity to break even.
BEYOND THE LOGISTICAL problems, some promoters of Broadway are convinced that merchandising is a key to the theater's very survival, that marginal shows have a leg up, thanks to the sale of tapes, posters and lapel pins. "I think it's even more valuable in Broadway's attempts to save itself than to sell itself," said Nancy Coyne, chief executive of Serino Coyne, the Manhattan theatrical advertising agency. "It is a source of income to producers who desperately need the money."
Merchandising is also becoming an important tool as producers seek new ways of bringing out-of-towners and tourists to Broadway. Mr. Felson, who began his merchandising career on Broadway with "Les Miserables," says that typically the heavy purchasing starts only when a show begins attracting the out-of-town crowd.
The Walt Disney Company learned an important lesson about the differences between merchandising a musical and a movie when it tried out its stage version of "Beauty and the Beast" in Houston. Initially, said Melissa Greenberg, marketing manager for Disney's licensing division, she and her colleagues tried to sell toys in the theater that originally were sold in stores as tie-ins to the hugely popular movie that inspired the musical. They discovered, however, that theatergoers had not come to a live show to be reminded of a movie.
"We learned that what people wanted was something true to the Broadway show," Ms. Greenberg said. "They wanted something that said, 'I was there.' "
What sold was the clothing and memorabilia designed especially for the stage show, an assortment of products that could be described as anti-Disney in appearance: stark black-and-white T-shirts with simple lettering, a design that reflected the tastes of the theater district rather than Fantasyland.
While Ms. Greenberg declined to reveal how much merchandise Disney has sold in New York, salespeople at the Palace say business has been brisk. At the lobby display cases it is normally elbow-room only for merchandise-minded ticketholders eager to pick up a bauble or two.
"I had to have some souvenirs," Elyze Held said as she waited for her receipt at the counter, minutes before the evening's performance of "Beauty" was to begin.
 It had taken Ms. Held, who had flown in to see the show from Key Biscayne, Fla., only moments to drop $60 for a pair of posters and a compact disk recording of the musical, gifts for relatives back home.
"I haven't even been to Bergdorf's yet," Ms. Held said with a laugh as she gave the display cases a final once-over. "But I love to stand here and shop."

HEADLINE: ART VIEW;
And She Also Knew How To Paint

BYLINE: By Vicki Goldberg 

 BODY:
BEING A LADY MAY HAVE gone out of style with white gloves and virginity, but once there was an art to it, and Art was then a ladylike accomplishment. As early as the 16th century, Baldassare Castiglione's "Courtier" recommended that women learn to draw and paint. High-born ladies, even royal ones, did.
Such notables as the Queen of Bohemia in the 17th century and Mme. de Pompadour in the 18th displayed their accomplishments in this line, and a good drawing style became a virtue on the order of a talent for embroidery or music. By the 19th century, when drawing had become such an accepted part of a gentlewoman's education that instruction could be obtained from a drawing manual, George Eliot thought feminine piano playing and painting were just too, too ladylike; she referred to them in "Middlemarch" as "small tinkling and smearing." 
 Royalty never went professional, but other women did. A tidy little show called "Ladies of the Brush," which includes some 40 Victorian paintings and sketches from the Forbes Magazine Collection and the National Museum of Women in the Arts, showcases a number of professional painters alongside the Royal Family. Victoria and her daughters were fairly accomplished but luckily did not have to earn their living with a brush; besides, they would have thought it dreadfully infra dig to do so. Other women with more talent and less wealth dared the general opprobrium attached to women earning money with their art and made a name for themselves, if only temporarily.
At this exhibition (at the Forbes Magazine Galleries on lower Fifth Avenue, through April 29), there are no real inspirations, no undiscovered geniuses demurely hiding behind English hedgerows, but a few pleasant enough works of art, a heap of history and, for a change, some sweet and not very titillating news about British royalty. Queen Victoria had some talent, though fortunately for England she was better equipped to rule. She had been brought up on language and voice and art lessons and when young often sketched people from memory.
She remained an eager artist when Queen and Empress, and the Prince Consort was not to be left behind. Both took drawing lessons from the eminent British painter Sir Edwin Landseer, and this show has the royal couple's joint copy of a sentimental religious painting. Their four daughters dutifully learned art, too, and the Princess Royal had a knack for it; her small study of "An Eastern Lady" is nicely done. Americans saw some of her work at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893.
THE QUEEN'S BIGGEST contribution to art was not her drawing but her patronage, and though she was not for women's rights and was adamantly opposed to medical training for women -- all those unmentionable sights -- she commissioned and bought art from women and appointed one her official printer and publisher.
Less high-born women strove mightily to be professional artists. For hundreds of years they had had almost no opportunity, but a few cracks opened in the establishment in the 19th century, and women streamed through. According to Naomi Rosenblum's new book, "A History of Women Photographers," the number of women who considered themselves artists increased fourfold between 1840 and 1870, and from 1870 to 1900 the number of female artists and art teachers in the United States alone rose from 418 to 11,031.
The ladies on view at the Forbes Magazine Galleries presented a pretty, agreeably domestic facade in their paintings. Jessica Hayllar's "Coming Event," about an impending wedding, presents a rich still life of wedding dress, shoes and paraphernalia right up front in the spectator's space, removes the bride-to-be to a far doorway, nearly obscures her fiance, and dimly reveals another figure way down the hall. The rich, formal trappings of the wedding quite outshine and overcome the mere participants.
Emma Sandys and Henrietta Rae produced creditable, if not riveting, Pre-Raphaelite portraits of women with luxurious hair or heads surrounded by vines that make literally creepy halos. Lilly Martin Spencer, an American, dashed off a charming still life of ripe watermelon and assorted fruit. Sometimes literature was the spur: Elizabeth Adela Armstrong Stanhope Forbes, a Canadian who must have been excessively fond of names, painted a triptypch of a woman in white by a woodland stream and added a carved arts-and-crafts frame inscribed with a poem about fairy folk. Julia Margaret Cameron, not a painter but a photographer, dressed her models as Lancelot and Guinevere to illustrate Tennyson's "Idylls of the King."
(Victoria, incidentally, was a great devotee of photography and both commissioned and purchased a good deal of it. Rosenblum points out that late in the century, when photography grew simpler, royal women in several countries took up cameras themselves. Before that time, developing had been awfully messy. Cameron confessed she'd stained a lot of table linens with silver nitrate.)
The ladies were not above Victorian sentimentality of the sort that has achieved immortality on greeting cards. Sophie Gengembre Anderson's "It's My Turn to Play Mother" shows a pettish child understandably tired of playing housemaid while her sister lolls on the sofa with a doll, a teacup, and a bell to call the servants. Rebecca Solomon's "Fashionable Couple" archly depicts a man and woman entranced by an album of other fashionable couples. In the company of so many household effects, literary conceits and all-too-adorable genre scenes, Lady Butler's "On the Morning of Waterloo," a large, imposing picture on a military subject, is a surprising departure.
These painters may not have been geniuses (a word that was reserved for men) but the mere fact that they pushed their talent ahead in the economic arena is quite an accomplishment, considering how hard society -- mostly male society -- tried to stop them. Most of them were the daughters or wives of painters who gave them instruction and support. (In 1971, the art historian Linda Nochlin, in an article called "Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?," pointed out that until modern times all women artists were the daughters of painters and taught by them, for girls could not leave home at an early age to apprentice with important male painters, nor were they allowed full access to the academies.)
An 1844 domestic guide for women, widely read in England and America, declared painting, and especially drawing, a valuable skill because it is so quiet it never disturbs anyone and, since it keeps the mind from brooding, also helps a woman "maintain that general cheerfulness which is a part of social and domestic duty." (Just in case you wondered why Gauguin and van Gogh in particular had no female counterparts.)
The lady writer of the guide admonished women against doing anything too well: "To be able to do a great many things tolerably well is of infinitely more value to a woman than to be able to excel at any one." A Frenchman in 1860 specifically advised against ambitious painting: "Let men busy themselves with all that has to do with great art. Let women occupy themselves with those types of art they have always preferred, such as pastels, portraits and miniatures. Or the painting of flowers."
And still they painted, and some achieved success. If the ladies of the brush were not great painters -- and they were not -- yet they were full of vim and courage in the face of obstacles. Great ladies, then. The weaker sex may be the braver after all.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Planning for A Winter Break

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
DID travelers from the Northeast learn to plan ahead after last winter's 17 snowstorms? One big company selling Caribbean tours believes so, saying that Northeasterners now suffer from "snowblower syndrome": They stare uneasily at televison commercials for shovels, then rush to order tickets to the Caribbean for January and February. Callers are saying that the Farmer's Almanac is forecasting a worse winter this year, travel agents report. American, Carnival, Continental, Delta and USAir may be reading from the same book: They are adding seats to the Caribbean.
So it seems likely that except for Presidents' Week, Feb. 19 to 25, a tough ticket already, travelers who start now will be able to find January and February flights to the Caribbean, and hotels to go with them, frequently in the form of packages. The prices are higher than in October, but not through the roof yet. 
 American, which has the most service into the Caribbean, has created a number of new flights. Dennis LeBright, the line's director of international operations, said that by Dec. 15 American will have 12 daily flights to San Juan from Miami, 10 from Kennedy and 35 from other mainland airports. There are 61 flights to other places in the Caribbean from San Juan and the mainland, he said. Jamaica has the biggest schedule ever, he said, and St. Martin is also increased.
Mr. LeBright said that as of Nov. 17, through new flights and larger planes, American had increased its capacity to the Caribbean 5 percent over last year, and that bookings were up 7.2 to 7.5 percent, depending on destination. Caribbean bookings made before Oct. 31, when sale prices expired, were up 30 percent, he said.
 
Rising Demand
 Richard A. Ellis, senior vice president of marketing for Gogo Tours in Ramsey, N.J., diagnostician of the snowblower syndrome, said that his company's Caribbean sales for January and February were up 30 to 40 percent over that period in 1993. He said that much of the rise was an unexpected demand for Puerto Rico, created not by mainlander Puerto Ricans going home for the holidays, but by tourists buying packages for resorts like El Conquistador or the Hyatts.
Mr. Ellis cited some specifics for what he said were proving the three most popular packages: As of Nov. 16, sales of San Juan trips for January were up 93 percent over January 1993, for February, 108 percent, and for March, 133 percent. For trips to Aruba in those three months, sales were up 40 percent, 34 percent and 27 percent, he said, and for Jamaica, the rises were 65, 61 and 81 percent.
USAir, which starts serving Montego Bay, Jamaica, from Baltimore-Washington International Airport and Charlotte, N.C., on Dec. 15, and which already serves San Juan, St. Martin and St. Thomas from Baltimore, said on Nov. 17 that the Caribbean was selling more heavily than last year for the corresponding months. Andrea Butler, a spokeswoman, said that for January, capacity was up 28 percent over last year and bookings were up 46 percent; for February, the figures are 36 percent and 56 percent.
Jane Weiller, president of Hartsdale Travel in Hartsdale, N.Y., who sells a lot of Caribbean travel, saw the same pattern, saying her clients were planning a couple of months ahead this year, to avoid the "desperation" of last time. Ms. Weiller saw a frugal pattern, too, saying many clients were using frequent-flier coupons and buying somewhat more expensive land arrangements. Overall, packages are somewhat more expensive, she said. Last winter, she was glad to offer air-land packages at a total of $700 to $800 a week. Now, she said, they run $1,100 or $1,200. But it is a mixed picture, she said, because clients are now familiar with airlines' yield management methods, and sometimes hold off in hopes of a lower price. But she said the Thanksgiving pattern belied that possibility. A one-way American Airlines ticket to Florida that was $198 at one point went to $516 the following week, she said.
 
Post-Blizzard Blues
 But Linda Schuller, president of Travel in Style in Livingston, N.J., said her clients were barely waking up to Christmas and New Year's, and had not contemplated the snows of future years. "The election worries them, and they don't know where taxes are going to go," she said. "When the first two blizzards hit them, they'll call and say 'Get me out of here.' But not now."
At the top of the price list for new services is a Concorde flight to Barbados, to be offered weekly from Dec. 26 to March 4. The scheduled charter flights leave Kennedy International Airport at 11 A.M.; the flight is just under two hours. Except for Monday, Dec. 26, and Sunday, Jan. 1, the trips out and back are on Saturdays. The last return flight, on March 11, will be on a subsonic plane. The Concorde round trip alone costs $1,950. As a basis for comparison, just before Thanksgiving, American Airlines quoted a first-class New York-to-Barbados fare for January at $1,190 and economy class at $459 for a January weekday, $503 for Friday to Sunday in January. E.T.M. Travel Group in Westport, Conn., (800) 992-7700 or (203) 454-0090, is selling the Concorde tickets as well as land-air packages.
On Nov. 1, Delta added two daily flights between Kennedy and St. Thomas-St. Croix. In January, this will drop back to one a day, leaving at 9:30 A.M. and arriving in St. Thomas at 2:15 Atlantic time. Alison Clements, a spokeswoman, said research showed New York travelers wanted the Virgin Islands rather than Puerto Rico -- which the line serves from Orlando and Atlanta. She said that sales on the new service were higher at Christmas than expected, but that January and February were merely meeting expectations, that the line detected no strong reaction to last winter's weather.
 
Additional Flights
 Continental is adding three daily nonstop flights between San Juan, P.R., and Newark, starting Dec. 15. These leave Newark at 8:35 A.M., 10:40 A.M. and 8:10 P.M., and they are sold out for the Christmas period, a Continental reservation agent said on Nov. 17. A promotional price for January, requiring ticketing in 24 hours, applies to the 8:35 A.M. flight for Monday to Thursday, effective until March 31. It is $99 one way; the return flight with the same price leaves San Juan at 4:10 P.M. On weekends, these flights cost $129 each way.
When these tickets sell out, prices to San Juan will be $363 round trip Monday to Thursday; $403 weekends, with a three-day minimum stay. There are also nonrestricted tickets at $199 each way.
Carnival Airlines, with two flights to Puerto Rico from Newark -- one to San Juan and one to Ponce -- and one to Ponce from Kennedy, added one to San Juan from Kennedy. The San Juan tickets cost $109 to $199 each way, depending on how early they are bought.
In an apparent contradiction, Kiwi will discontinue flights from Newark to San Juan on Jan. 9 because business is not good enough after Christmas. It will resume at Easter, a spokesman said.

HEADLINE: Seeing China Under Your Own Steam

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, former head of the Beijing bureau of The Times, is the author of the recently published "China Wakes: The Struggle for the Soul of a Rising Power" (Times Books).

 BODY:
MOUNT TAI is a sacred site in Asia, soaring into the clouds and teeming with Chinese pilgrims and sinewy peasant entrepreneurs straining and sweating as they haul ice cream up the 6,000 stone steps -- for sale at prices that climb as steadily and as steeply as the hillside. Yet while Chinese regard Mount Tai as one of the most famous places in their land, redolent with a history that goes back to visits by Confucius 2,500 years ago, it rarely appears on tourist itineraries.
It has been about 15 years since China opened up its doors to Western tourists, yet foreigners still crowd into just a few big cities, seeing standard sights, without ever meeting a peasant, even though three-quarters of the nation's 1.2 billion people live in the countryside. The tourism industry, in other words, has fostered a cocoon that allows Westerners to pass through China without ever quite stepping into it. Since returning to the United States after five years in Beijing, I have found that the most common query I get is not about Deng Xiaoping's health but rather about how to escape this cocoon.
What I tell people, to start with, is that it has never been easier to visit the "real China" beyond the tourist circuit. Independent travel can be frustrating, but with many hotels offering airport pickup and concierges arranging train and air tickets, few foreigners get irretrievably lost. Certainly it is hard to imagine a safer part of the world in which to roam about. While it is possible to take a regular tour of the main cities in China and then tack on a week of individual travel at the end, my recommendation is to go without a tour group if you are comfortable doing so.
The place to begin a self-guided two-week tour is in a Chinese-style courtyard hotel like the Lu Song Yuan or the Hao Yuan, in Beijing. Both hotels are built in the traditional courtyards that were once home to the aristocracy, and the 17-room Hao Yuan was the residence of the former Chairman, Hua Guofeng, until he was ousted by Mr. Deng at the end of the 1970's. Neither is convenient by Western standards -- the staff usually does not speak English and a request for a bucket of ice may take an hour to convey before it is understood and ignored. But the rooms are comfortable and the courtyards are full of the charms of China. On the other hand, if you place a premium on comfort and convenience, stay at the totally modern Palace Hotel, with its pair of gold Rolls-Royces to ferry you around the city. An alternative, also in the center of Beijing, surrounded by little shops and narrow alleys, is the Sara Hotel.
Any guidebook will tell you what to see in Beijing; my favorites are the Forbidden City, the Tibetan-style Yong He Gong temple and Tiananmen Square (including the Mao Zedong mausoleum; despite the rumors about wax, it really is Mao's corpse on display). You might also notice the high red walls of Zhongnanhai, an old imperial compound on the Avenue of Eternal Peace less than a mile west of Tiananmen. It is the new Forbidden City, the workplace and playground for today's Communist leaders. Visitors are not allowed beyond the soldiers at the gate.
Several Beijing hotels and shops rent bicycles for a dollar or so a day; they are one-speed contraptions but are usually functional, and in any case it is far safer to bike in Beijing than it would be in Western cities. Instead of sticking to the main streets, meander through the hutong, or back alleys, where residents live in one-story housing and share toilets with their neighbors. Rooms are so cramped that people often sit in their doorways, munching on watermelon or chatting with neighbors.
Almost everybody makes a side trip from Beijing to the Great Wall, but instead of going by bus, take a taxi and an interpreter. Your hotel can arrange an interpreter for $2.50 an hour or so, or you may simply run across an English-language student who is willing to accompany you for the day and interpret free of charge.
On the way back from the Great Wall, have the taxi driver take a dirt road randomly off the main route until you find yourself in the middle of a little village. You will find the peasants happy to talk to you, through the interpreter, and they'll be thrilled if you have brought a Polaroid camera and can take their photos.
AFTER a few days in Beijing, take the night sleeper train seven hours west to the much-overlooked city of Datong in Shanxi Province. Fifteen hundred years ago, Datong was the capital of the Northern Wei Dynasty, whose legacy is a spectacular cliff of carved Buddhas 10 miles outside the city. The Yungang Grottoes include 53 caves decorated with 51,000 statues and carved reliefs, yet what is most awe-inspiring is the scale of the sculpture: stone Buddhas that soar up to 55 feet high. To me these huge, serene statues in the middle of nowhere are as exhilarating as Europe's Gothic cathedrals, for the offer a similar mix of artistry and spirituality.
While modern Datong itself is a rather grim coal-mining metropolis -- offering a much more realistic slice of urban Chinese life than either Beijing or Shanghai -- it is also less than an hour's drive from the Great Wall. Unlike the reconstructed parts of the wall near Beijing, the wall near Datong is the original -- a crumbling, worn mound of rocks overgrown with shrubbery 2that extends endlessly toward the horizon.
After five or six days in Beijing and Datong, head south to Taian in Shandong Province -- again by train, the means of locomotion for most Chinese traveling between cities. One of your short rail journeys in China should be by hard seat, the cheapest class, which is how ordinary Chinese travel, but the nine-hour journey from Beijing to Taian is not the one to spend jammed in an uncomfortable railroad car as people spit on the floor and converse raucously about the large size of foreigners' noses.
Taian is the town at the base of Mount Tai, or Taishan as the holy mountain is called in Chinese. It is possible to check your luggage by the train station and take a small bag or backpack for the overnight trip up the mountain. Stone steps have been carved up the hillside, so it is not so much mountain climbing as stair climbing. Most people can manage the trek up, with plenty of time for breaks and photographs, in five or six hours. A hotel on the summit, Shenqi Guest House, has private rooms with bath and a decent restaurant; it also offers sleeping bags and rents jackets against the chill. An alarm wakes guests at dawn to see the sun rise and proclaim, as Mao Zedong did, that "The east is red."
Confucius climbed Mount Tai and came from a nearby town, Qufu, that is still dominated by the Kong family (Confucius is a European rendering; Confucius himself went by the name of Kong). Qufu is a typical country town, sleepy and gritty, yet it is chock full of temples and historic sites such as the family cemetery of 78 generations of Confucius's descendants. The town is an easy side trip from Mount Tai, or you can get back on the train for the daylong journey to Shanghai.
After several days of roughing it, you may enjoy the plush luxury of a place like the Garden Hotel, in the old French Concession of Shanghai. For the adventurous, the Chinese-run Red Flag Guest House, which used to accommodate only top party officials, now opens its bungalows to capitalists. A charming location and a sense of history and place are the rewards, but don't expect a concierge to arrange tickets or a maid to put mints on your pillow. Shanghai has some wonderful little privately owned restaurants and astonishing discos replete with Madonna-look-alikes, strobe lights and prostitutes who conduct their business with the help of cellular telephones.
The city also abounds with English speakers eager to ply their skills, and one or more of them will probably strike up conversations when you walk along the Bund, the historic riverfront district. Some are aiming to change money or act as paid tour guides, but others simply want to chat in English, and you may be able to find a terrific unofficial tour guide in this way. There are also con men on the waterfront, however: I once saw a pickpocket run down the Bund, chased by his victim and several onlookers; when a bus stopped on the main avenue, people inside jumped out to join the chase as well. The pickpocket was tackled, beaten up and then handed over to a policeman before the bus resumed its way.
After a couple of days in Shanghai take the two-hour, 20-minute flight to Guilin, a southern city in Guangxi Province that is the jumping-off point for daylong boat trips on the beautiful Li River. Three-day and four-day cruises on the Yangtze River in central China have become popular among foreigners as well, but the Li River is more scenic and eats up much less of a two-week vacation.
The Li River courses through spectacular rocky crags that are the inspiration for much of traditional Chinese watercolor landscapes. Children swim naked in the river as the boats pass, and peasants till the soil with water buffalo. The countryside is enchanting, so hire a taxi driver and an English interpreter for a half-day excursion to a nearby village, where you are likely to find mud-brick homes, a small elementary school with ramshackle desks, tiny backyard plots with pigs and chickens and flocks of little children who will make you feel like the pied piper. If you bring a few trinkets, someone may well invite you to a dinner of stir-fried vegetables and tofu with rice.
From Guilin, take a 60-minute flight to Guangzhou, the bustling southern metropolis also known as Canton. Ever since the Portuguese arrived in the 16th century, Guangzhou has been at the front line of interaction between China and the West, and it was partly because of intrigues among Western traders here that the Opium War broke out and Hong Kong was ceded to Britain. The free markets of Guangzhou are among the most vibrant in the nation, and the Cantonese have a national reputation as sophisticates and gourmets. Yet while the Cantonese make great food, they don't know where to draw the line with ingredients.
One interesting but depressing sight is the Qingping Market, where turtles, salamanders, snakes, dogs and just about everything else are sold to be eaten. Afterward, intrepid tourists may wish to go to a snake restaurant or rat restaurant in Guangzhou. Snakes, in particular, are regarded as a virtual health food, a Chinese equivalent of alfalfa sprouts.
For those on a two-week itinerary, it is time to move on toward Hong Kong for the flight back. If you do not have too much luggage, take a bus or taxi for a few hours to Shenzhen, the boom town next to Hong Kong. Fifteen years ago Shenzhen was just a sleepy farming town; now it is a dynamic industrial city with a stock exchange, glass-and-steel skyscrapers, pin-striped lawyers and hundreds of factories churning out televisions, shoes and toys for consumers around the world.
From Shenzhen it is easy to walk across the border into Hong Kong, with only brief formalities with Chinese and Hong Kong immigration officials. On the Hong Kong side, trains take everyone to the urban areas. Alternatively, express trains run direct from Guangzhou to Hong Kong and minimize problems for those burdened by lots of luggage. The overland route is worthwhile simply because it conveys the feel of an endless construction zone; Guangdong Province has the fastest-growing economy in the world, and everywhere you look buildings are going up. Westerners joke that the official local bird is the crane.
For those with an extra week, Tibet makes a delightful side trip from Beijing. But be sure to get out of Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, and visit smaller towns such as Shigatse, site of a beautiful monastery and the traditional headquarters of the Panchen Lama, second only to the Dalai Lama in the Tibetan hierarchy. As everywhere in China, it is fascinating to visit the nomads and peasants who make up the bulk of Tibetans. Rural Tibet is still one of the most remote places in the world. I once met a Tibetan woman who was puzzled when I asked her whether her village had electricity. It turned out that she had never heard of electricity.
Most flights to Lhasa stop over in Chengdu, in Sichuan Province, the potbelly of China, and Chengdu makes a terrific break for a day or two. It is a somewhat grimy, very typical Chinese city of narrow lanes, tiny family-managed restaurants and, in the outskirts, peasants toiling over doll-sized plots of land. Moreover, Chengdu has, for my taste buds, the best food in China. I once took two Americans to dinner at a hole-in-the-wall restaurant near the Jinjiang Hotel, and our table was soon laden with delicious spicydishes; there was more than the three of us could eat, yet the bill -- including beer -- was less than $5.
IN any case, wherever one goes in China, perhaps the most important thing is to spend time with the people.
In many cities, so-called English corners are set up one or more nights a week for local people to get together and practice English. Americans are hugely welcomed. Similarly, university campuses are a good place to meet English-speaking Chinese, and even on the streets you may meet someone who will invite you into a home for dinner.
In particular, spend at least a day in the countryside. My most interesting moments in China were spent in the villages, and the fascination was often mutual. On my first trip to China, in 1983, I was waiting for a train at a station in a rural part of Shandong Province, and so I sat down and began reading my guidebook. A few peasants gathered in front of me, watching me for entertainment, as if I were a movie. Then others approached, and soon dozens of them were sitting in a semi-circle around me, pointing and staring.
Soon nearly 100 peasants were sitting on the ground in front of me, the adventurous ones crawling in front of me to look at the cover of the book I was reading, and the episode ended only when the alarmed authorities led me to a small room and barred the audience from following. It was an encounter between two worlds, and I found it just as extraordinary as they did.

 In Beijing, an interpreter, official or unofficial, can negotiate to rent a regular taxi for the day for about $80 or a minivan (which are not allowed to pick up foreigners up at hotels) for $40. In other cities taxis should be a bit cheaper. Train travel is not expensive: a first-class train ticket from Shanghai to Guangzhou costs about $30.
Hotel prices are for a double room, calculated at the rate of 8.5 Chinese yuan (renminbi) to the dollar. The country code for China is 86.

HEADLINE: And Still the Stonington Fleet Will Fish

BYLINE: By CAROLYN BATTISTA 

 BODY:
AT 9 A.M. on a cold fall day, the rain had stopped but wind still whipped the Stonington Town Dock. "Boy, it was pouring," said Arthur Medeiros, who'd been there four hours earlier when his 55-foot fishing boat, the Seafarer, went out for the day. Now he talked with others on the dock, including two men mending a giant net and Fred Calabretta of Mystic Seaport.
"How's the fishing, Arthur?" asked Mr. Calabretta. 
 "It's been good," said Mr. Medeiros, noting great improvement over last winter. "We've been worried about the regulations; we still are, but we've gotten into other specices, like squid. Everybody's giving it a good shot. They're not going to roll over and die."
Mr. Calabretta often stops by the dock to talk with local fishermen about everything from the weather to even more formidable forces the men face -- declining stocks of fish like flounder and increasing regulation. As director of the Mystic Seaport Stonington Fishing Oral History Project, he and an associate, Glenn Gordinier, have taped some 30 interviews with the men, their families and others involved with Stonington fishing, including a local clergyman. A Seaport photographer, Mary Ann Stets, has taken hundreds of photographs to accompany the project.
Fishing in Stonington "is a significant maritime activity in our own backyard. We're trying to get a record," Mr. Calabretta said. "And there's a certain urgency. Fishing here -- and throughout the world -- is in real trouble." He added, "People are the focus of this project, not gear. These are good, hardworking people. They're all after the same limited fish stocks, but they stick by each other."
Stonington has been a center of fishing since Colonial times. Today it has Connecticut's only sizeable commercial fishing fleet -- 18 draggers and 12 lobster boats. The local fishermen's association is headed by Mr. Medeiros, who after fishing for 46 years now has someone else run the Seafarer and considers himself semi-retired. Still, he comes to the dock every day, to check on things and help out. He's pleased that the Oral History Project is recording a way of life beset by changes and challenges. "It's very good for generations to come to know firsthand from fishermen and their families what it was like," he said.
Project interviews, taped mainly in people's homes, are being transcribed; they fill more than 500 pages so far. In them, the fishermen tell how much they love their hard, dangerous work; how they learned it (mostly from their fathers and uncles, who learned it from theirs), and how they remember the men who died doing it.
What they like about fishing, most of the men said, is that it lets them be independent -- and out on the water.Mr. Medeiros, in his interview, said, "It's a good feeling, doing what you like, being out in the fresh air. There's no timeclock or people standing over you." Another interviewee, John Rita, said, "I guess you could call it being free, just being your own person."
Many have fished since childhood. Mr. Rita, who is 44, said he loved to go fishing with his father during school vacations. "I'd hear him get up. He'd say, 'You want to go?' I couldn't wait. I used to run right downstairs," said Mr. Rita.
Mr. Medeiros said that growing up in fishing is the way to learn to do it. "This isn't a business that you advertise in the newspaper and get a man to come off the street. It takes years and years of experience," he said.
Many fishermen grew up in Stonington, now a gentrified place with expensive homes and upscale shops. But Mr. Rita noted that when he was young, "It was a small-knit community, where most were fishing people," and just about everybody walked to the grocery store, the barbershop and the dock. After school, Mr. Rita and his friends headed to the dock to meet returning boats -- and get paid ("$5, which was a lot") for doing chores like washing down engines.
Some Stonington boats go out for several days at a time; others make day trips. The latter "is more of a family-type life. I think it's a lot better," said Mr. Rita. He and his wife, Ann, who was also interviewed for the project, have three children.
Family concerns run through the interviews. Mrs. Rita -- daughter and sister-in-law of fishermen as well as the wife of one -- is a bookkeeper at the town dock. Budgeting is a constant concern. "If you're prepared, you can manage," she said, but "you can't collect welfare and you can't collect unemployment."
Another interviewee, Robert Berg, added that "to survive now, a guy's wife has to have a job where she gets Blue Cross." And Mr. Rita said, "You've got to provide your own retirement. Nobody's going to give you one." Many interviews cite those who've left fishing to get jobs with benefits.
The fishermen noted that even when they're not on the water, they're on the job -- checking their boats, fixing nets, doing all kinds of maintenance. "Christmas morning, after the kids open their gifts, we run down for a couple of hours and check everything," Mr. Rita said.
They know long hours and terrible weather. They know the risks, but don't dwell on them. They know loss. On the dock stands a granite memorial to fishermen lost at sea; it has 34 names now. Every summer the fishermen's association sponsors the Blessing of the Fleet, which is partly festive, with food and music, but also has solemn ceremonies, like the dropping into the sea of a broken anchor of flowers, to honor fishermen who have died. "My heart and soul go with that," said Mr. Medeiros, who knew almost all those whose names are on the memorial.
It is at the 1995 Blessing of the Fleet that Mr. Calabretta hopes to show the oral history for the first time. Tapes, transcriptions and photos will be kept at Mystic Seaport; about 40 photographs, with text from the interviews, will become a traveling exhibition.
The men and their families are clearly worried about the future. So are government agencies, which have imposed limits on catches of scarce species, like flounder, and have proposed such steps as a buy-back of fishing boats, to reduce the number working the waters. The agencies have also been requiring additional safety features on fishing vessels (which Mr. Rita called "more safety things we've got to keep buying"). Many fishermen said that it's increasingly difficult for them to earn a living -- and keep up with the paperwork.
Some have given up. John DeBragga, working on the net at the dock, no longer fishes. In his interview he said that regulations and paperwork drove him to take a job at the casino in Ledyard. "That was sad to hear," said Mr. Calabretta.
Most though are still trying. Mr. Rita, in his interview, spoke of the proposed government buy-back of fishing boats. "For somebody that wants to fish, that isn't what you want. You don't want to sell your boat. You want, somehow, for them to let you make a living, continue what you're doing. I don't want somebody to mail me the check. I want to get up in the morning and go fishing," he said.
Asked what he would tell young men considering going into fishing, Mr. Rita said, "The way things are right now, I would say it's a good period to hold, see what's going to happen."
Mr. Medeiros's son graduated from college and now works with computers. "He liked fishing, but fishing is questionable for the future," said Mr. Medeiros.
Mr. Calabretta noted that the fishermen are very supportive as their children seek other opportunities, but they're also a little disappointed. "They're proud of what they do," he said, and proud of following a long tradition. Now, "there's an impending break in this tradition."

HEADLINE: Tanks Take On New Role as Artificial Reefs to Attract Fish

BYLINE: By JENNIFER WEITZMAN 

DATELINE: MANASQUAN

 BODY:
NEW JERSEY is participating in a nationwide cooperative program between the Department of Defense, the National Guard and Federal and state environmental groups by taking outdated Army tanks and dumping them into coastal waters to form artificial reefs to create habitats for fish.
The program of using old war materiel is called Reef-Ex (for Reef Exercise), and officials say it will improve and extend the life of artificial reefs and rebuild the environment and economy of coastal states. 
 New Jersey's recreational fishing industry, with 125 miles of coast, is second only to that of Florida, with 1,100 miles of coast.
On a recent morning, four miles off Manasquan Inlet, a group of Army officials and environmentalists watched in awe from a charter boat as six M-60 main battle tanks, which saw extensive service in Vietnam, were pushed one by one by a bulldozer off a barge. They plunged with a huge splash into the water and sank 65 feet, coming to rest on the Axel Carlson and Sea Girt reef sites. They were the first of about 100 tanks destined for New Jersey.
Officials said that by the next day, small marine organisms like mussels and barnacles would find the tanks to be a good place to hide and would attach themselves to the steel plates inside and outside the open vehicles. These creatures will become food for the dozen species of fish the program hopes to attract, including sea bass, blackfish and lobsters.
The tanks are also expected to provide a safe breeding ground for juvenile fish to grow and survive, which in turn would attract more sports fisherman and divers to the area. Officials said they hoped that by this time next year, fishing boats would find the waters rich with fish.
The 40-ton tanks are certified to be environmentally safe by the Army Corps of Engineers and Federal and state environmental agencies. Army and Navy reservists, performing their two weeks of annual active-duty training, prepared the tanks by draining all fluids, removing transmissions, engines and hydraulic systems and steam-cleaning the tanks.
"We are pretty hopeful these will be good reefs for divers and will provide better access for people fishing," said Bruce Halgren, maritime fishery administrator of the New Jersey Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife. Mr. Halgren said that because the hulls of the tanks were so thick, about 12 inches of steel, they would last 50 to 100 years as reefs before dissolving in the salt water.
That compares with the 5-to-10-year life span of thinner items like old cars and ships used before.
Capt. William Higgins of the Defense Logistics Agency Headquarters Reserve Unit in Washington said he came up with the idea of creating artificial reefs from the excess tanks. The Department of Defense was faced with the task of getting rid of 3,500 tanks from its Anniston, Ala., Storage Depot. Rather than cut the tanks up for scrap and remove their firing power, which was initially estimated to cost $10,000 each, Captain Higgins decided it would be cost effective to have the tanks removed intact and dropped into the ocean.
With the advice of the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Marine Fisheries Service, Captain Higgins said, the best solution, both environmentally and economically, was to use the tanks as artificial reefs to stimulate fish growth.
"By taking obsolete but environmentally safe tanks, we can recycle them and improve our existing artificial reefs," said Maj. Gen. Paul J. Glazar, the Adjutant General for New Jersey. For each tank sunk, he said, New Jersey will generate tens of thousands of dollars during the life span of the tanks from increased fishing and diving.
New Jersey is expecting about 100 tanks to be distributed along the coast by next year. It is estimated that the entire program will generate $7 million in economic activity for New Jersey over the next half-century.
"We need to maximize the reefs because the fish need to be protected," General Glazar said. "We don't have the coral reefs other states and islands have, so we have been creating artificial reefs using chained tires filled with concrete, automobiles and excess rubble along the coast of New Jersey for several years."
"Also, the openings throughout the tanks will provide the fish with more places to hide and give scuba divers more interesting places to visit," General Glazar added.
Captain Higgins said the program would be run at minimal cost to New Jersey, as it is one of the nation's testing states. The Army, the Navy and the Coast Guard will use funds for training reserves to pick up the tab for moving the tanks, and the program will seek donations from local businesses and grants and funds from the Federal Government and the states involved to cover the cost of the barge.
William Figley, reef coordinator for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, said that fishing is a multimillion-dollar industry for the state and that its resources "can be there forever if we take care of it."
The fish population over the last few years has dwindled 30 to 50 percent throughout the North Atlantic, as determined by the National Marine Fisheries Service. There are more fishermen using better technology, resulting in an excessive amount of adult fish being caught. Housing developments in wetland areas and the pollution of rivers add to the depletion of the fish population.
Now the trend is to rebuild marine life by regulating how many fish can be caught and by developing new reef habitats. "The goal of the Reef-Ex program is to create enough habitats for the 12 species known in New Jersey," Mr. Figley said.
He added that the tanks were a small portion of the artificial reef project and that the project would take several years before a significant change could be detected.
The deliberate creation of artificial reefs in New Jersey first started in 1935 through the efforts of party boat and charter boat volunteers. Artificial reefs have historically developed along the Eastern Seaboard from natural disasters and shipwrecks.
The Reef-Ex program was instituted in Alabama this year when 100 tanks were dropped throughout the summer to create two major artificial reefs. Steve Heath, marine biologist with the Marine Resources Division of the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, reported in The Mobile Register that a "tremendous number of fish" were seen around the first six tanks dropped in June.
He said, "The program has lived up to all our expectations, and we expect it to get better as the food web grows."

Washington-to-London Concorde Flights End

BYLINE: By IRVIN MOLOTSKY 

 BODY:
After 18 years, British Airways has discontinued service on the supersonic Concorde between Washington and London, and it will use the newly available airplane to increase its Concorde charter service from Kennedy International Airport in New York. The twice-daily Concorde service between New York and London is unaffected.
The thrice-weekly Washington service whisked travelers who paid $7,800 for a round trip between Dulles International and Heathrow Airports, traveling at up to 1,350 miles an hour so smoothly that they didn't spill their caviar and Champagne during the four-hour trip, but it fell victim to the economy, according to Margaret Vodopia, spokeswoman for British Airways. 
 Although the recession has ended, government agencies, diplomatic missions and international institutions like the World Bank that had cut costs during hard times decided to continue holding costs down, Ms. Vodopia said.
USAir will provide connecting service between National Airport in Washington and Kennedy Airport in New York for Washington-area passengers flying the Concorde between New York and London. There are two Concorde round trips a day between Kennedy and Heathrow at a round trip fare of $8,756. IRVIN MOLOTSKY

HEADLINE: For Arbitragers, the Game Is Afoot Once Again . . . but Rewards May Not Be as Sweet as in the 80's

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
LAST month's collapse of Conseco Inc.'s bid to acquire Kemper Corporation is the kind of event that professional speculators in takeover stocks dread. Many of these high-stakes investors, known in the business as risk arbitragers, bought Kemper stock at prices as high as $60 a share, hoping to make a killing by the time the deal closed at Conseco's offering price of $67.
But when Conseco withdrew its offer on November 21 because it couldn't muster the financing, Kemper's stock plunged, closing Friday at $40.25 a share. 
 To the "arbs," the Kemper blowup was just the latest in a series of mishaps that have unexpectedly roiled their complex calculations this year. But few are complaining. On the contrary, most are more upbeat than they've been since the fat years of the 1980's. "It's a very exciting time to be in the business," said Richard Nye, managing partner of Baker Nye and a 28-year risk arbitrage veteran.
Why so happy? After being tarred by the excesses of Ivan Boesky, the highflying arb who pleaded guilty to insider trading in 1986, and seeing their business dry up in 1990, many arbs now see things going their way.
The Republican victory in last month's elections saw the demise, or muzzling, of several powerful Democrats who were notorious among takeover investors for obstructing deals. Opportunities overseas are expanding as countries in Europe and elsewhere adopt more open takeover rules.
And domestically, the volume of takeover deals has approached record levels in the past two years and doesn't seem to be ebbing. Through November, $150.4 billion worth of deals were announced, involving 1,298 publicly-traded United States companies -- more than in any prior year, though the 1994 dollar volume may fall short of the $178.4 billion achieved in 1988.
"I feel comfortable that we are in pretty good shape for the next 12 to 24 months," said George Kellner, managing partner of Kellner, DiLeo & Company, a longtime investor in takeover stocks.
At a time when investors are uncertain about the direction of both the bond and stock markets, risk arbitrage has strong appeal. Because arbs focus only on the outcome of specific deals, their returns, in theory, are divorced from the vagaries of the overall market. Instead, arbs traditionally rank their performance against the money market, promising to deliver between two and three times the level of short-term interest rates.
A small and inbred club, arbs practice the select art of buying up the stocks of targeted companies after a takeover has been announced but while there is still some doubt about whether the deal will be completed. Their buying power offers less patient investors a way to get some cash out up front, while the arbs aim to make their profit when the deal is eventually consummated.
Notoriously secretive lest others follow their lead, arbs work either for Wall Street investment banks, risking the firms' capital, or for private investment funds with capital provided by institutions or wealthy individuals. Most rarely allow themselves to be quoted in the press.
It is virtually impossible to determine how much arb money is in the market at any one time because different players are moving in and out of deals on a daily basis. During the height of the 1980's takeover boom, estimates of total arb capital ranged from $10 billion to $20 billion. Today, arbs estimate the total to be a fraction, perhaps $4 billion.
Mr. Kellner, like most of his competitors, was reluctant to divulge how much money his firm manages, saying only that it is "well in excess of $100 million." But in a recent interview he added that he would like to raise about $100 million more.
Other arbs, too, said they were seeking more investment capital, while several who claimed they were not actively raising money coyly admitted that they wouldn't mind having more to play around with in the coming months.
"This year, risk arbitrage will continue to be one of the dominant styles that we believe will make money going forward," said E. Lee Hennessee, director of a group at Republic New York Securities that advises clients about investment partnerships known as hedge funds.
A major reason is the large number of takeovers being launched by corporations. Consolidations in industries such as defense, pharmaceuticals, financial services, entertainment, health care and computer software have resulted in a spate of deals, providing a wealth of opportunities for arbitragers.
THE 20-person arb desk at Bear, Stearns & Company is currently tracking 170 deals, twice as many as two years ago and even more than it followed during the 1980's, according to senior managing director Barry Cohen.
But while high deal volume broadens opportunities, it does not necessarily guarantee high profits. Risk arbitrage may reduce an investor's exposure to a downturn in the performance of the overall market, but it replaces market risk with the risks of specific deals.
Nevertheless, several arbs claim mouth-watering returns. Guy Wyser-Pratte, president of Wyser-Pratte & Company and a veteran arb who was brought into the family business started by his father in Paris in 1929, said his firm has registered an average annual pretax return on assets of 30 percent since July 1967. (Counting management fees, the actual pretax return to investors is closer to 25 percent.)
Such calculations smooth over the high year-to-year volatility of the past decade and minimize the impact of having to pay capital gains tax on all those short-term profits. Still, their record is respectable. The aggregate performance of the risk arbs tracked by Ms. Hennessee of Republic New York Securities vary from a 47 percent return in 1988 to 1.2 percent in 1990 to nearly 20 percent in 1991.
One of the reasons that the 1980's was a golden era for risk arbitrage is because most of the deals not only were completed but were bid up by successive suitors after a target company had been "put in play." Arbs could simply buy the targeted company's shares after the first bid was announced and ride the stock until the top bidder prevailed.
Before the 1980's, risk arbitrage was largely the preserve of investment banks like Goldman, Sachs & Company and Bear, Stearns. But the celebrated success and conspicuous wealth of Ivan Boesky spawned imitators and made arbitrage one of the emblems of the go-go 80's.
The party began to draw to a close after Mr. Boesky and several other prominent arbs, including Robert A. Freeman of Goldman, Sachs, pleaded guilty to insider trading. It ended in 1990, when deal financing dried up and new takeovers rapidly declined.
MANY arbs got clobbered when the stock market crashed in 1987, and after two separate bids for UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, collapsed in 1989 and 1990. Reeling from the losses, PaineWebber and the Blackstone Group shut down their risk arb departments. Smith Barney had trouble making up its mind, getting in and out of the business several times.
During the lean years of the early 1990's, the practice of risk arbitrage was difficult. Many arbs recast themselves, using their skills at assessing deals to buy the bonds of bankrupt or nearly bankrupt companies to reap profits from the reorganization.
Now such so-called vulture opportunities are drying up and investors are moving back into arbitrage.
But given the record number of deals this year, the risk arb business has not been as sweet as in years past. Many of the deals involve complex industries, such as telecommunications, health care and computers that are not easy to analyze. Unlike the 1980's, when cash was king, many acquirers have used their own stock to fund deals. That makes it harder for arbs to calculate what their returns will be.
For example, earlier this year, arbs playing the Viacom-Paramount takeover took hits when rising interest rates forced some private partnerships to unload their stock in order to cover their losses in the bond market. Because Viacom was using its stock to buy Paramount, the resulting fall in Viacom's share price cut into the profits of arbs waiting for the deal to close.
Rising interest rates also raised the cost of financing the arbs' stock holdings and shrunk profit margins after they had committed to deals.
In addition to blow-ups like the Kemper takeover, many deals have been delayed awaiting approvals from federal regulators on antitrust grounds -- an issue that never posed much of a problem during the Reagan and Bush Administrations.
TO arbs, time is money. A deal that closes in a month with a 10 percent gain represents an annualized return of 120 percent. But if the deal stretches out over six months, the effective annual return is only 20 percent.
Consequently, most arbs are fairly strong advocates of the free market. Mr. Wyser-Pratte railed against "the almost hysterical zeal of the Federal Trade Commission by what I would call the friends of Hillary gang." He blamed the commission for holding up pharmaceutical maker Eli Lilly's acquisition of distributor McKesson Corporation earlier this year.
But while antitrust worries have frustrated the arbs, they have also created opportunities. Software giant Microsoft Corporation is offering 1.336 of its shares for Intuit Inc., the maker of the Quicken personal finance program. That equals about $83 at Microsoft's current price. Yet, Intuit is only trading at $67.25 a share.
"This is a deal that the market thinks has a very serious antitrust problem," said one arb who requested anonymity. "If you have confidence that the deal is going to close, you are going to make more than $15 a share."
What can provide that kind of confidence is research and experience. Many of the successful arbs maintain a core of analysts who crunch numbers and assess the likelihood of deals reaching fruition. They also employ lawyers and consultants to brief them on the regulatory and legal angles of the deal.
"In a sense you are putting together the same kind of team that the corporations in the deals have done for themselves," said Peter M. Schoenfeld, vice chairman of Wertheim Schroder & Co., an international investment bank that trades for its own account as well as for outside investors.
The arbs see things getting easier in the months ahead. Deal volume will continue to be strong, they believe, as pending legislation affecting financial services, health care, entertainment and other industries encourages continued consolidation. Flush with cash and eager to earn fat fees, the commercial banks are increasingly willing to get back into the business of financing takeovers. In addition, falling stock prices will make potential targets more attractive while the low value of the dollar will continue to make American companies attractive to foreign buyers, who tend to pay cash.
The arbs also expect the new Republican majorities in both houses of Congress to ease antitrust fears. Senator Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio, a well-known gadfly who attacked many corporate takeovers, did not seek re-election and Representative John D. Dingell, who used his position as chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee to challenge some deals, will be handing the committee reins to a Republican.
"There is no doubt in my mind that these folks are going to be behaving a whole lot differently," Mr. Wyser-Pratte said of the Clinton Administration.
Mr. Wyser-Pratte and others are also expecting an expansion in European deal activity as the continent emerges from recession. New rules adopted by the European Union strengthening shareholder rights have also made playing the risk arbitrage game more attractive.
"It's becoming more of a global market," said Mr. Schoenfeld, who maintains arb staffs in both New York and London.
But some of the veterans make it clear that they don't want things to get too good, either. If that happens, too much money might be drawn into the business, narrowing the spreads in the best deals and increasing volatility in others.
"We're not seeing the hot-money crowd, and that's good," Mr. Wyser-Pratte. "All that does is destabilize the sector."

HEADLINE: At Work;
Linking Gay Rights and Unionism

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble 

 BODY:
A CONFERENCE of gay trade unionists was just one of hundreds of events last June organized to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall rebellion, the 1969 clash between the New York City Police and the patrons of a Greenwich Village gay bar that is generally regarded as the birth of the modern gay rights movement. But out of the Pride at Work conference, as it was called, a national organization has emerged. A leadership group of labor activists gathered in New York again late last month to formally ordain the National Gay/Lesbian/Bi/Transgender Labor Organization, the group's politically inclusive full title. Alas, no acronym dare speak its name, and so the group will be known as Pride at Work. It has a national mailing list of about 600 names.
It may not seem like the most propitious moment for an alliance between the two groups most likely to be marginalized by those who must now be obeyed in Washington. The Democratic debacle is attributed in part to Bill Clinton's support for gay rights and his attempt to change the military's discriminatory sexual orientation policies early in his term. There are undoubtedly those in the union movement, with strong ties to the Democratic Party, who would regard gay rights as a lavender albatross. Supporting those issues, the argument would go, is to risk further alienating the gay-shy electorate. 
 But as Pride at Work's organizers point out, they are not asking unions to do the right thing. Instead, they are trying to establish a power base that cannot be ignored, either in the political arena or when union locals are called on to support their gay and lesbian rank-and-file members who are being harassed at work. "We want to be recognized as part of the labor movement," said Flo Stern, a spokeswoman for the group. "We have to be visible wherever we are."
If the rank and file of the gay and labor movements would seem to have little in common other than an activist impulse, consider that neither group reflects its stereotype very faithfully. The liveliest segment of the labor movement is not in blue-collar industries dominated by workers who -- according to stereotype -- might be inclined to be hostile to homosexuality. The fastest-growing unions are those organizing white-collar and service industry workers. Some of those unions, especially the ones based in big cities, have a significant gay presence.
On the other hand, new research indicates that gay men and lesbians aren't all "guppies" and "dinks," which is to say, gay urban professionals and "double income, no kids" upwardly mobile couples without significant family financial responsibilities. A survey by a University of Maryland economist, Lee Badgett, revealed that both gay men and lesbians earn less on average than similarly qualified heterosexual men and women.
Pride at Work envisions itself as a kind of mediator between gay and labor concerns, promoting civil rights within the unions and the labor perspective within the gay community.
Part of the mission is to raise the consciousness of blue-collar workers who do fall into the stereotypical category, as well as to provide support for gay unionists in parts of the country where it is virtually impossible to be out of the closet.
The group can build on the history of informal gay activism within the union movement, and gay caucuses of varying degrees of formality exist at several unions. Pride at Work is doing within the labor movement what many gay people in general are doing these days: Coming out after a long period of cogitation in which they were open in every way except putting a name to it.
 
Labor Notes
 * In the week before Thanksgiving, the Association of Professional Flight Attendants observed the first anniversary of its strike against American Airlines, which, to the surprise of most observers, nearly shut the carrier down. The parties have been in arbitration since Oct. 17 and expect to be there until at least February. Reports of the airline's improved financial condition may give the union leverage to fight off concessions.
* Traffic accidents are the leading cause of occupational injuries. The Monthly Labor Review reports in its October issue that highway-related fatalities accounted for 20 percent of 6,271 fatal workplace injuries, based on statistics from the Labor Department's 1993 Census of Fatal Injuries. Homicide ranks second, at 17 percent of total job-related deaths. About half were of retail workers in grocery stores or restaurants who were killed during robberies or in the commission of some other crime. Roughly one victim in seven was done in by a "co-worker or personal associate."

HEADLINE: Yes, Even Now, There Are Pro-Clinton C.E.O.'s

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
IT is almost an oxymoron to combine the words "Democrat" and "chief executive officer." Yet there is a small, but hardy, band of Democratic business executives. And, despite the recent Republican sweep of Congress, they are standing by their man, President Clinton, though with some reservations and concerns.
More than any other Democratic Presidential candidate in recent times, Bill Clinton in 1992 reached out to business and business responded. From bankers on Wall Street to entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, the Clinton-Gore campaign courted executives with the message that business had nothing to fear from a Democratic Administration. This effort had many goals: To lend credibility to the Clinton campaign, to tap into the deep pockets of business and to gain votes that had traditionally gone to Republicans. 
 And this effort paid off. More than 400 business leaders, nearly a third of whom were Republicans who had voted for President Bush, publicly endorsed Mr. Clinton. Now, two years and a bruising partisan setback later, feelings are softer. Many of these leaders say President Clinton has done a poor job of articulating what they claim are his many successful pro-business accomplishments -- and that the President should get that message out in a hurry.
The Clinton Administration is given high marks for a budget bill that began to rein in the deficit, for keeping interest rates low and the economy strong, for reducing unemployment and creating jobs, for Commerce Department trade missions that have been effective in promoting the sale of American goods overseas, for backing the North American Free Trade Agreement and GATT, for reducing taxes on small business and for supporting a whole array of regulatory initiatives that have cut red tape and spurred business development.
But, these business leaders say, these accomplishments have gotten little attention. "This Administration has a level of sophistication about business and many accomplishments," said Steven J. Green, chief executive of the Astrum International Corporation, which owns Samsonite luggage and Culligan water systems. "But it does a poor job of communicating what it has done well and an excellent job of communicating what it has not done well."
Some in the Administration say the midterm Democratic defeat should help business -- forcing President Clinton to focus more on centrist business issues of the type typically favored by executives and by the Republican majority in Congress.
"This is an opportunity for the President," said Kenneth D. Brody, a former Goldman Sachs partner and president of the Export-Import Bank. "There's an intersection with what the Republicans want and what the President wants. A lot of good things will get done. Beatings like this will have the President and his advisers focused on what the American people really want."
Just last week, Felix Rohatyn, the investment banker, appeared before the National Press Club in Washington to appeal for bipartisanship and for support for Mr. Clinton from the business community. "At this time," he said, "the Clinton Administration must regain the confidence it had originally gained from the business community, and which it subsequently lost. Whatever its shortcoming, I believe that the Administration is entitled to such support as a result of its economic policies."
If Democrats sniff opportunity in defeat, so do Republicans. Barbara Hackman Franklin, a former Commerce Secretary and a Republican fundraiser, said: "I'd like to see the G.O.P. capitalize on this victory and explain why business people are better off with us." As for fundraising for the Republican Party, Ms. Franklin added, "it's going to be a lot easier."
What follows is a midterm assessment by several prominent executives who voted for President Clinton.
 
Bernard L. Schwartz
Chief executive of the Loral Corporation, a New York-based military electronics manufacturer.
"I'm frustrated, but not disillusioned and I've not lost heart. The President is smart enough to read the election returns. He's delivered quite a lot. But the common perception is that government doesn't work. So he's got to skinny down his agenda and focus. He's also got to get people who are a little more seasoned and a little less idealistic on his team. I'd like to see a little more gray hair at the White House.
"This Administration has done a yeoman's job in helping the industrial base in a nonpartisan way. He's made good friends in the defense and aerospace industries. My advice is to stay the course -- we're only in the third or fourth inning, not the ninth. 1996? You tell me what the level of the stock market is in 1996 and the inflation rate and I'll tell you who will win."
 
Paul A. Allaire
 President of the Xerox Corporation, based in Stamford, Conn.
"There are a number of things Clinton has done that are positive for business. Clearly his approach to free trade is something we can feel very good about. The budget package helped produce a growing economy and created new jobs. And raising competitiveness to the forefront and acting to assure that our nation is more competitive is positive, too.
"Business would like to see the President and Congress working together so we don't get gridlock. We've had business, labor and government working together well. I don't think business leaders were very strong Clinton supporters in the beginning. Even though he's done a lot of things that business would say is good, business feels negative about other things -- like health care -- and that's colored their view."
 
Paul Montrone
Chief executive of Fisher Scientific International, a Hampton, N.H., scientific instrument supplier.
"Bill Clinton has been consistently supportive of the business community. But that's not kept a lot of business people from falling by the wayside in their support of him. Why? The answer is a combination of form and the people he has surrounded himself with that deal with the business community. [Commerce Secretary] Ron Brown has been a great business ambassador. But at the White House there are not a lot of players who understand how to deal with the business community and how to build alliances. They don't know what buttons to push and a lot of business people think he is too liberal.
"Bill Clinton's own thinking is pro-business. He needs to have some real solid business people close to him and follow their advice and lead. If that happens, it could possibly help in a major way. I'm hopeful."
 
Sanford R. Robertson
Chairman, Robertson, Stephens & Company, a San Francisco investment bank.
"I do a lot of business in Silicon Valley and he's been very good for us. He's lowered trade barriers to high-tech companies and cut red tape. Ron Brown has been terrific. The President has done a lot of things he hasn't gotten credit for.
"Business, however, was scared by health care. They saw the costs, and they didn't like the way it was handled. They saw the symbolism of big government. His support seemed to be O.K. until health care. Then it fell away fast.
"He can recover. But he's got to take the middle again and he's got to get to the middle fast. Maybe he can hop on the Dole capital gains tax cut proposal. He's on the right side in opposing the proposals on the new accounting treatment for corporate stock options. But Senator Phil Gramm has picked up the flag on that. If the President succeeds, there's a chance the Republicans will get all the credit."
 
Neil Bluhm
President of the JMB Realty Corporation, a Chicago-based real estate company.
"I was a supporter and still am. From a business perspective, he's done a good job. Frankly, I was surprised at the midterm elections. They can't be based on the economy because interest rates are way down and the President and his advisers were instrumental in getting that done.
"I'm in real estate and it's certainly a lot better environment. When Clinton came into office, everyone felt the U.S. was a second-rate power to Japan and Europe. People don't feel that way now.
"It must be that the public is fed up with big government and there are elements of the Democratic Party which are not responsive to that mood. Corporate America has downsized. It's gotten lean and mean. Now government has got to do the same and the liberal wing of the Democratic Party has got to understand that."
 
Steven J. Green
Chief executive of the Astrum International Corporation, a holding company based in Miami.
"This Administration truly understands the global changes in the economy and has been better at promoting business abroad than any other Administration I've seen. When people voted in Bill Clinton, they said that the system didn't work and they wanted change. But Clinton hasn't given them the perception that that's happening.
"The Republicans will probably get some benefit for supporting a capital gains tax cut. Every businessman earning over $200,000 a year wants it and will become a Republican supporter for it. If so, it will be difficult for the President to gain the momentum in the business community that he deserves -- especially if you look at what he's done for business.
"But the President has two years. In politics, that's a long time. Clinton is the master of escape. He's capable of pulling out of a tailspin. He's wounded and knocked down. But the referee hasn't counted to 10 yet. So I wouldn't give up."
 
Alan Patricof
Chairman of Alan Patricof & Company, a New York venture capital company.
"I'm an active supporter of Bill Clinton. And, from the standpoint of small business, a lot of good things have been happening. The No. 1 thing for small business is capital, and the regulators have made it easier for banks to lend and have cut paperwork. The Small Business Administration has been rejuvenated and has a new attitude -- they talk about small businesses as 'customers.' Small entrepreneurial business is now represented at cabinet meetings.
"A lot has been happening that's positive. But it seems like the P.R. isn't getting out for the good stuff. That's disappointing. I'm not jumping ship. The President has the right instincts and, if he acted on them, we could have an interesting Presidency. Maybe we will begin to see government work better. That was the clear message of the midterm elections. Congress had better start working better regardless of who is in the White House."

HEADLINE: World Markets;
The Newest Hot Spot? The Middle East

BYLINE: By Paul Lewis 

 BODY:
AMERICANS finally have a chance to bet on the emerging and burgeoning stock markets of the Middle East, thanks to Foreign and Colonial. In October, the London-based fund management group created the first investment fund registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and devoted to this neglected area of the world, with assistance from Nomura Securities International, Paine Webber and JW Securities.
The Foreign and Colonial Emerging Middle East Fund Inc., as it is called, is a peanut-sized closed-end fund with a total initial capitalization of just $42 million, only 22 percent of which is currently invested. It finished the week trading in New York at $14.125, slightly down from its initial offering price of $15 a share. 
 A handful of British-run Middle East investment funds are already traded in London, with more reportedly on the way. But this is the first time Americans have seen such a beast. Foreign and Colonial won't keep its exclusivity long, however. Merrill Lynch will soon launch a second S.E.C.-registered fund aiming at Middle Eastern and African emerging markets. And Alliance Capital, another New York money management firm, plans an off-shore Middle East fund not open to American investors.
The Middle East, a region encompassing 19 countries with 319 million people, has gone relatively unnoticed by the fund managers swarming over the world's other emerging markets.
But now the Middle East offers greater political stability, new privatization programs, accelerating economic growth and, of course, Yasir Arafat's wobbly peace deal with Israel.
"Frankly, I expect the peace process to be a bumpy ride," said Omar Masri, the Lebanese-born investment manager of Foreign and Colonial. "What is impressive is the economic progress these countries are making and the performance of their stock markets. Most Middle East countries aren't affected by what happens in Israel."
So far this year, the Egyptian stock market is up 150 percent and Mr. Masri reckons the party is far from over when an estimated $25 billion worth of privatizations are expected in Egypt in the next few years. And wealthy Egyptians hold some $120 billion abroad. "Supply and demand are both there," he notes.
Tunisia's market has risen 45 percent so far this year. Markets are up 35 percent in Morocco, up 26 percent in Oman, and up 5 percent in Jordan. The region's market losers are Turkey, which has fallen 45 percent so far, and Israel, which is down 35 percent.
Other money managers and investment advisors in New York are also warming to the Middle East's markets. Kathy Lynn O'Donnell, executive vice president of Chase Global Markets, is enthusiastic about Morocco, where her firm actively deals in commercial bank debt. "It's a very attractive market," she says.
Douglas Dooley of J.P. Morgan likes a Moroccan brewery called Brasseries du Maroc and Cimenterie d'Agadir, a cement producer. He also points out that the Middle East's financial scene will become even livelier next year when war-torn Lebanon reopens its stock market. "There is still strong human capital there and a lot of offshore wealth," he said.
A major difficulty with investing in the Middle East is that while 13 countries currently have stock markets, only six -- Egypt, Jordan, Israel, Turkey, Morocco and Tunisia -- are fully open to foreigners. Oman is partly open, with foreigners allowed to deal in six of its 90-odd quoted companies, although this is expected to increase soon.
But Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are firmly closed to noncitizens, while only foreign residents may trade on the Kuwait market. Bahrain limits foreigners to four stocks, all of them banks.
Mr. Masri has divided the open markets into two groups. He plans to invest 65 percent of his Foreign and Colonial fund in what he calls the core markets of Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan and Oman, reserving the remainder for Turkey and Israel, since American investors already have access to country funds specializing in these two markets.
Among the stocks he likes on Casablanca's Marche de la Criee, as the Moroccan stock market is called, is S.N.I., a recently privatized financial conglomerate. In Egypt, he would choose the Suez Cement Company, which accounts for a quarter of market capitalization, as well as the Misr hotel group, which has properties on the Red Sea, safely out of range of fundamentalist terrorists. In Oman, he is looking at a power plant and a flour mill.
Some day, of course, one conspicuously missing stock exchange will open up to foreigners. Three times a week, Iraqis gather in a Baghdad bank to trade shares in Iraq's private industries and banks. But until the Security Council lifts sanctions, a Keep Out sign hangs for the rest of the world's investors on the door of the Baghdad stock exchange.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Wild Gambling And Deception Bring Big Losses

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
GAMBLING, gambling.
We used to think that it was the stock market where the big betting went on. But if this year has proven anything, it is that the really big swingers were playing the interest rate game. 
 Add Orange County, Calif., to the list of big losers. It has lost $1.4 billion in its investment fund, or about 18 percent of the money invested with it. It did this by borrowing like crazy -- roughly $2 for every dollar invested in it -- and using both derivatives and ordinary securities to bet on falling interest rates. By ignoring the fact capital was vanishing, the fund was able to pay yields of more than 7 percent a year.
It is true that Orange County used, and abused derivatives -- most of them issued by Government agencies like Fannie Mae. But other ways to gamble were also used. The county fund borrowed money at floating interest rates and used the money to buy five-year Treasuries. This is known as "playing the spread," and works as long as short-term interest rates remain lower than the coupon on the bonds. Now, however, some of those trades are losing money every day, but the county won't close them out for fear of having to recognize the losses.
The county says all of the securities will eventually be worth par value. True enough, but if interest rates keep rising it is possible that billions of dollars worth of them will pay zero interest for years before they mature. The county is still betting big on falling interest rates and could lose billions more.
The simple fact is that the Orange Country treasurer was gambling with the public's money. He bragged about yield and treated market value as irrelevant. What is needed is not Government regulation of derivatives but a law requiring public agencies to tell the truth by reporting the market value of their portfolios and calculating total returns.
Orange County joins a long list of others whose gambling was uncovered only after it failed, ranging from Gibson Greeting Cards to Mellon Bank. Many of them held on for the first year of the bond bear market, denying the reality and hoping it would turn around. An important question for the bond market now is how many more gamblers still are sitting on their portfolios, hoping to be bailed out before the truth emerges.
Stock market investors may be tempted to regard all this with a certain smugness. After all, stock prices have generally held up while bond prices have tumbled. But it is worth asking if there are other surprises awaiting.
"I didn't read any of that until the bond market melted down," observes Chuck Clough, the chief equity strategist at Merrill Lynch, speaking of the reports of derivatives abuse by fixed-income investors. He wonders if "the same may be true of leverage in the stock market."
It is clear that derivatives have made it a lot easier to gamble in stocks with little money down and have made it possible to shift risks around in a seemingly endless chain. Just where the risks have ended up, and whether those risk-takers could stand a bear market, is not knowable now.
In the bond market, even those who saw the dangers, and largely avoided them, have been stunned by the carnage. "We thought the market would turn slowly," said Jim Midanek, a portfolio manager with Solon Asset Management. "But markets don't turn slowly. They turn viciously."

As the Rules Change in Mexico, He's a Quick Study

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MONTERREY, Mexico

 BODY:
HE had just pulled off the deal of the year, swiping a sweet $1 billion joint venture with AT&T out from under his competitors' noses -- and in the process reshaping the future of telecommunications in Mexico. So how did Dionisio Garza Medina, the 40-year-old chairman of the Alfa group and scion of one of Mexico's most prestigious business dynasties, celebrate his coup?
He wolfed down a turkey sandwich and a Diet Coke at the AT&T offices in Mexico City, where the announcement was made, before he boarded a private jet to Alfa's headquarters in Monterrey to get back to work. 
 Mr. Garza may come from an old-line industrial family, but he represents a new kind of Mexican executive. Though he is steeped in tradition and belongs to a family so powerful it has been called the Rockefellers of Mexico, he has no time for the three-hour lunches that characterized the Mexican business style for so long -- and in some circles, still do.
Since becoming Alfa's chairman and chief executive in April, he has quickly recognized that global competition and open borders have changed the rules of Mexican business. In his first few months in charge of the diverse conglomerate, he has cut corporate costs by 40 percent, taken two of the four divisions public -- and, most notably, signed the deal with AT&T on Nov. 9 to form a joint venture that is sure to get a big piece of Mexico's long-distance business in just over two years.
Considering the vast potential for growth here, that could be a big prize indeed. For each 100 people, there are just 8 phone lines (compared with, say, 55 in the United States and 16 in Argentina), making Mexico one of the world's most desirable telecommunications markets.
The right to provide long-distance service now belongs exclusively to Telefonos de Mexico, or Telmex, but its Government-protected monopoly lasts only until 1997. Then the Government will spread the business around, and Alfa and AT&T are certain to get a big chunk of it.
It may seem odd that AT&T would choose a company like Alfa, with no experience in telecommunications, but what it clearly wanted was a partner that knows Mexico well, that knows the regulatory ins and outs. And Mr. Garza convinced AT&T that Alfa could offer exactly that.
"I think he is going to turn out to be one of Mexico's great entrepreneurs," said Timothy George, a friend of Mr. Garza's who is an investment banker at Morgan Stanley and who made the initial contacts between Alfa and AT&T.
Tall and lanky, given to white shirts and red ties that set off his pale skin and owlish glasses, Mr. Garza seems an unlikely magnate. But as a seasoned hunter, he knows the value of camouflage, of being able to overtake his prey -- whether quail or competitor -- by surprise. And for him, the hunt is not just a sport.
"I don't hunt for killing," he said. He keeps no prize bucks or trophies on his office walls. "Everything I hunt," he said, "I eat."
THIS hunter has been busy at Alfa. His rapid-fire moves have shaken up a company so battered by a brutal economic restructuring and family hardships -- including a 1973 kidnapping that ended in the murder of a Garza patriarch -- that it was in danger of losing its place as a force in the Mexican economy.
"When I took over, there was a feeling that Alfa had to do something," Mr. Garza said in an interview at Alfa's plush headquarters in Garza Garcia, a suburb of the northern industrial city of Monterrey. (Though the "Garza" in the town's name has no connection to the family, the Garza influence can be seen in the 13,000 jobs Alfa's companies provide in Monterrey.)
Mr. Garza Medina is reluctant to give details of his personal life because of his fears about kidnapping, but he did speak freely about the conglomerate where he has worked since graduating from Stanford University in 1975 with a master's in industrial engineering.
In many ways, Alfa's history over the last 20 years is a concise version of the broader Mexican story. In 1973, with a leftist president in office and political tensions mounting, Alfa was part of the increasingly unpopular northern conservative establishment. That year, leftist guerrillas kidnapped and murdered the head of the family, his great-uncle Eugenio Garza Sada.
The murder shocked the business community, and chaos seemed imminent. When President Luis Echeverria visited Monterrey after the killing, the family took out newspaper ads blaming him for encouraging the crime with anticapitalist rhetoric.
The family soon broke up its holding company, the Monterrey Group, into four businesses that could be managed -- and protected -- more easily. Alfa, one of the four, grew so fast in the mid- to late-70's that it soon became Latin America's largest privately owned company, with $2.49 billion in sales last year. (Three of its divisions are steel, petrochemicals and prepared foods; the fourth includes new businesses that Alfa is nurturing.)
Success came back to haunt Alfa, though. The company, which had borrowed heavily, was hit hard in Mexico's 1982 debt crisis. With a debt surpassing $6 billion at one point, Alfa could not make its payments and had to go for a loan to the Government it had castigated a decade earlier. Even so, it ended up signing over 45 percent of its stock to foreign bank creditors.
The past 10 years have been spent rebuilding -- restructuring the debt and investing billions in plants and equipment. The chairman at the time, Bernardo Garza Sada, was Mr. Garza Medina's uncle.
When Mr. Garza Medina took over, directors asked, " 'Where are we going to go from now?' " he said. "But nobody had it clear what alternative we should pursue."
When the Government privatized Telmex in 1990, the board considered bidding for it. But recalling the disastrous growth of the 70's, the members decided it would be wiser to complete the restructuring and invest any available cash in the core companies.
But now it's branching out, and with the Mexican Government still deciding the terms of the long-distance concessions, several companies have already formed teams to go after them: MCI with Banamex, Mexico's largest bank, and Sprint with Iusacell.
UNTIL the very morning of the Alfa-AT&T announcement, most analysts expected AT&T to pick Telmex. But Victor A. Pelson, an AT&T executive vice president, said company lawyers were concerned because Southwestern Bell owns 10 percent of Telmex; that could cause problems with United States regulators because regional phone companies are barred from long distance.
In addition, at a Mexico City news conference after the announcement, Mr. Pelson said an important consideration was "the management styles, the chemistry among managers, the things that make a real partnership work." And he said he had found that with Alfa.
"Management styles" can be taken as code words for cultural differences involving everything from decision-making to lunch -- issues that have derailed other ventures. One spectacular example was this year's breakup of Vitro, a Monterrey glass conglomerate (also headed by a member of the Garza family), and Corning.
Mr. Garza said he tried from the beginning to avoid cultural clashes. Alfa already has 15 international partners, perhaps more than any other Mexican company, and has learned a lot from them.
When he began negotiations with AT&T in June, Mr. Garza said, he made several points clear. "First of all, I didn't want a divorce," he said. "We were flexible, of course, but there were certain guiding principles. One was very, very important: We want to be an active partner in the management of the company."
Considering that he was negotiating with one of the world's most technologically advanced telecommunications companies, and that he himself has no experience in the field (he doesn't even use a personal computer), that was a tough stand to take.
The venture they worked out will be 51 percent owned by Alfa (in accordance with a Mexican law that prohibits foreign companies from owning the majority of a telecommunications company), but the partners have equal say in everything.
The deal "was one of the smartest hits of the year by any Mexican company," said Gabriel Szekely, a consultant in Mexico City. "They have forced a number of medium-sized companies, like Banamex-MCI, to reconsider whether they can be effective competitors." Telmex itself has been hurt; its stock dropped more than 10 percent after the AT&T-Alfa deal, but has since rebounded slightly.
FOR Alfa, the venture represents a jumping-off point. If it is a success, Mr. Garza said, "we'll be able to double the size of the company in the next several years." He has tried to focus investments on a few businesses with great potential.
"Already, our portfolio is very complex," he said. "Adding this $100 million company here and another $200 million company there would just add to the complexity, and I don't think that's good."
Maria de los Angeles Pozas, a researcher at the Colegio de la Frontera, who has written a book about the Monterrey business community that focuses on the Garzas, said the ascension of Mr. Garza Medina to both top posts represents the full return of the family to the Alfa helm. Because of the debt crisis, she said, Alfa had to go outside for a while for professional managers. But now, she said, "the company is back in the hands of the family."
That family realizes more than ever the importance of performance over paternity. Besides his Stanford degree, Mr. Garza also holds an M.B.A. from Harvard. He worked his way up the ladder at Alfa, although not from the bottom rung, starting as an executive in training in 1975. His last stop before the top: president of Sigma, the food division, and overall vice chairman.
And now that he and his wife, Balbina, have three sons, he keeps that in mind when planning the future. "The first priority I have in my life outside of here is my family," he said. "At times my boys ask me: 'What am I going to do?' I say whatever you want, but if they want to do it here or in any other company, I don't know what their position is going to be in 20 years."
Taking Alfa's companies public has brought $250 million in fresh capital, but it also brings closer the day when the family loses control. "It's not that I won a beauty contest and was put here," he said. "It's not that the family can do this or that. We have to be careful, if we want to have investors in the company, to run it as professionally as possible."
But the Mexican traditions that have played so big a role in the family's growth are not about to disappear in Mexico's newly open economy.
"I always tell members of the board I have a brother who is a priest and he needs the company to be profitable so we can donate the money he needs to run his parish," Mr. Garza said. "Then I tell them, 'If I don't do well, my brother is going to fire me before you do.' "

Angelo Trippiedi is a muffler man. Always has been. Fifty years ago, he was working on cars in about the same spot he works now on Cropsey Avenue, only now he has his own place.
Back then, he was a minority among the lumberyards that lined the avenue between Neptune Avenue and the Belt Parkway. Now he owns one of the oldest of dozens of repair shops that are crammed into six blocks in the area, making it the veritable auto repair capital of Brooklyn. 
 "I'm the Godfather," said Mr. Trippiedi modestly, standing behind the counter in Buy-Rite Muffler at 3123 Cropsey. "Everyone started to see me do business years ago and this corner caught on. In the 1960's, they really started coming in, but the height is now. This is it."
In the four-block stretch along Neptune Avenue between 19th Street and Stillwell Avenue, and on the block of Cropsey between Neptune and Hart Place, there are 34 places in which to fill up, get a muffler, check your transmission with a guy named Sal, examine vinyl tops and sun roofs, investigate new ideas in upholstery and repair your fender.
A majority of the stores are owned by Russians, who have picked up where the Italian and Jewish immigrants left off a few decades ago. Like much of Coney Island, the auto strip appears to be a place that time forgot, with its almost campy pastel signs that advertise the services offered, and velvet chairs and couches, circa 1956, that sit in the waiting rooms of some of the shops.
Mike Schmidt bought Ocean Collision two years ago from an Italian-American who had run the shop for 40 years. "How did I choose?" he pondered as he stood outside his shop, the sun reflecting off his aviator sunglasses. "It's a busy commercial strip area, and I knew the neighborhood." Inside, his mechanics drilled and pounded over salsa music.
Coney Island, once the center of working-class New York, has taken an economic and social beating in the last few years. It seems that in the middle of the century, when most of the famed amusement park burned to the ground, much of the lore and magic of the neighborhood went with it.
Since the 1970's, business closures and the ills that fester in public housing projects have furthered the decline. Though local business leaders insist that the neighborhood will see an economic rebirth, the auto shops seem to be the only consistently thriving businesses.
The shop owners say there is enough business for everyone because the strip draws customers from Bensonhurst, Mill Basin and Dyker Heights, and that they often trade customers. Indeed, on a recent afternoon, each shop appeared busy.
Still, the shops offer few employment opportunities for the neighborhood's young people who need jobs. "There is someone walking in every day looking for a job," Mr. Trippiedi said. "But I keep a steady crew of four guys. Once they come to me, they don't go out," he added. "They find a home." J.S.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: CO-OP CITY/PELHAM BAY;
New Kmart Worries Some In Co-op City

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
Two weeks ago a giant Kmart opened in Bay Plaza, a retail and office mall just south of Co-op City. It brought 450 jobs, inexpensive goods for local shoppers and the usual dividends of a retailing behemoth's arrival.
But Kmart's opening, as well as plans for further expansion in Bay Plaza, has stirred mixed feelings among Co-op City residents. Although they acknowledge the store's benefits to many local people, they worry that the development is hurting the neighborhood's quality of life. 
 Vocal residents, especially those who retreated to Co-op City's suburban-like culture in the early 1970's from the South Bronx, complain that the growth is drawing thousands of outsiders. Co-op City is a self-sustaining community of 55,000 residents, with its own shopping strips, schools and security force. What was once a five-minute drive from their garages to the highway, they say, now takes 20 minutes on weekends.
"It used to be quiet; we used to enjoy it more here," said Iris Baez, president of the residents' board of directors of the Riverbay Corporation, the cooperative that owns Co-op City. Ms. Baez, who has lived here since 1973, added, "We used to look out and see only darkness. It was a little bit of the country, but now it's like living on Central Avenue."
With the Kmart now open, development is to start on 11 acres just east of the store, said Ellen C. Weiman, a spokeswoman for the city's Economic Development Corporation. The department will lease the city-owned land to Prestige Properties, a Manhattan developer. It has built much of the retail and office space in Bay Plaza, whose 70 acres are bordered by Bartow Avenue, the Hutchinson River Parkway and the New England Thruway.
Within the next three years, the developer will start constructing 110,000 square feet of retail space and 60,000 square feet of office space, Ms. Weiman said. A second phase may follow. Calls to Prestige Properties last week were not returned.
"The additional retail site here is another example of the city's efforts to provide diversified and ample retail opportunities, so New York City residents can shop for the goods they need within the five boroughs," said Clay B. Lifflander, the Economic Development Corporation's president.
Sections of Bay Plaza first opened in 1989, in an area where the city believed shoppers were underserved and where companies otherwise headed for Westchester or Connecticut might settle. Besides Kmart, the largest retailers at the site are a Pathmark, a Rickel home-supply store and a 13-screen movie theater.
Expansion plans are expected to address what many Co-op City residents consider the most irksome side effect of growth: increased traffic. Particularly now, during the holidays and on weekends, residents say cars are snarled between Bay Plaza's entrances and highway exits. Already, Kmart is taking steps to reduce the traffic problems, said Myles Johns, the store's general manager. He said he would work with the local community board to lobby for more bus stops, so that shoppers need not drive.
Amid all this, at least one another developer is eyeing city-owned land north of Co-op City's residential buildings, in a natural area called Givans Creek Woods, said Jimmy Vacca, district manager of Community Board 10. "You must have a balance," Mr. Vacca said, "between creating jobs and encouraging business and disrupting people's way of life."
But last week, in Bartow Mall's plaza, where longtime residents gather, Samuel Cotler, 80, was unsentimental. Opponents, he said, were attached to a Co-op City that no longer exists.
"I do agree it brings in more cars," he said. "But you've got to have competition. If you have only one store, you'll get robbed." NORIMITSU ONISHI

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
How This Ship Came In

BYLINE: By ANDREA KANNAPELL 

 BODY:
AT 10 minutes before 7 last Sunday night, a driving rainstorm moved across New Jersey, throwing out 35 mile-an-hour winds and pushing slowly east. At the same time, an incongruous figure in pink shirt, paisley tie, wool coat and leather-bottomed shoes leaped from the pitching deck of a small launch in the Atlantic and attached himself to a rope ladder.
The ladder was hanging from the side of the Pol Baltic, a Greek-flag container ship out of Baltimore, and Capt. James R. Canvin, harbor pilot, was going to work. 
 His work is guiding foreign-flag vessels -- oil tankers, container ships, car carriers -- in and out of New York Harbor, at all hours, in all weather. These mega-ton ships can spend weeks crossing the open ocean. But it is at the end, as the vessels slide, huge and brakeless, into shipping lanes and narrow docks, that the most delicate navigation takes place. This is the domain of harbor pilots and docking pilots, with their detailed knowledge of the local aqueous geography and of a peculiar, intuitive physics. And this is the story of how they brought one ship in.

18:51 Captain Canvin heaves himself up the Jacob's ladder and steps up five flights to the bridge, lighted dimly by reflections from the moonlit waves now a hundred feet below. The ship is aiming for Port Elizabeth,21.5 miles and 15 or 20 approaching vessels away. He shakes hands with the ship's master, Adonios Pulimenos. "What's your deep draft, Captain?" he asks, meaning the depth of the keel under a full load. "Thirty feet?"
"No, is less," the graying, hospitable Greek responds.
The ship can take a half-mile to slow down, a mile to come to a halt; any boat that even might cross her path is a danger. It is work that Captain Canvin describes as "hours of boredom followed by moments of sheer terror," and he is watching gauges and thinking in trajectories with the canniness of a pool shark.
 
19:01 Captain Canvin, knowing a storm is coming, though not when or how harsh it will be, issues his first command: "Three one five." The quartermaster repeats the command and alters heading to 315 degrees, 45 degrees west of true north.
The quartermaster is Filipino. There was a time when a Greek-flag ship would be owned by Greeks and have an all-Greek crew, but technology and political economies have created a new bottom line. Ships are often registered under "flags of convenience," offered by countries that want their piece of the maritime pie. Deckhands are refugees from third-world poverty. Modern ships carry the cargo of 10 of the older variety; the harbor is far quieter than in its glory days. With fewer runs and fewer jobs,relations between the various piloting groups have become strained.
Forty-nine years old, Captain Canvin may be the last in a maritime line. His great-grandfather died at work, washed overboard back in the days when pilots had to row out to meet the ships. "They were another breed," he says. His grandfather and father were also pilots. It is unlikely, he says, that his sons will be.
 
19:05 The Pol Baltic, doing 16 knots, moves past the first two buoys of Ambrose Channel and into the Coast Guard's Vessel Traffic System. Captain Canvin picks up the radio: "The Pol Baltic to New York Traffic."
"New York Traffic, go ahead, over."
"This is the Pol Baltic. We are inbound at the Ambrose one and two. We are 595 feet in length, 29 feet in draft. We will be inbound for the Con Hook range and the Kills going to Berth 62."
"Pol Baltic, New York Traffic. Roger."
The call will be repeated as the Pol Baltic moves toward Constable Hook and Bayonne, and the Coast Guard will relay warnings. The radio crackles: an Israeli container ship off Bay Ridge is beginning to stir.
The sea is a crushed-velvet sheen that spreads and darkens till it meets the clusters of lights that mark Sandy Hook to the west, the Rockaways to the east, and the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to the north, where the Israeli ship looms. Captain Canvin zips between the radar screen and his binoculars until it softly passes by.
Captain Pulimenos paces calmly, more bored than nervous. "Part of the job is making the captain feel secure," Captain Canvin often says. "They don't know what I know, and you don't tell them."
 
20:05 The Pol Baltic has slowed to a crawl north of the Verrazano. Capt. Douglas J. Brown, the docking pilot, climbs aboard.
Captain Canvin's organization, the Sandy Hook Pilots of New York and New Jersey, essentially holds a state-licensed monopoly on guiding vessels involved in international commerce into New York Harbor. But they share local navigation with the docking pilots, who as Coast Guard-licensed tug masters orchestrate the inside moves that nudge the ships in and out of dock. There is more grunt work on tugs, and less family heritage: Captain Brown, 43, is the son of a salesman, and went to the SUNY Maritime College because he just "liked fooling around with boats."
Relations between Sandy Hook and docking pilots have been tense since the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska prompted a Federal push to unify the two systems. Proposals for the 100 or so Sandy Hook pilots effectively to absorb the fewer that 30 docking pilots were met with fear and anger. Since then, though, legislative moves to alter the system have dragged, and the pilots seem to be seeking common ground.
When Captain Brown appears, the atmosphere turns deliberately cordial. He is briefed: several hundred feet ahead, a barge is cutting across the Pol Baltic's path. Repeated calls have raised no response. Captain Brown takes the binoculars. "O.K., I'm comfortable," he says, in the ritual of change of command. "Captain, I have it."
He finally raises the barge, which turns aside, then, commanding two tugs, begins the long process of nudging the ship through the tight turns of the Kill van Kull.
 
20:54 The Pol Baltic lines up with the Port Elizabeth Channel, a long rectangle of water lined with the spindly steel skeletons of container cranes, street lights glimmering at their ankles amid irregular mountains of containers waiting for loading. The berth is perhaps a half-mile away.
The action moves outside, where a cold rain is splattering. Captain Brown bellows to order the ship's speed reduced: "Half a head!"
"Hyoff a hyedd," Captain Pulimenos dutifully relays to the quartermaster. After a 12-second pause, the engine rumble softens.
The ship's engines are barely moving; with his radio, Captain Brown is maneuvering the tugs in tiny increments. One wrong move, and the ship could crush the dock and the crane. Forty feet to go. Thirty. Twenty.
21:30 The heaving lines are thrown. "All stop, Brian, all finished," Captain Brown tells the Margaret. "All stop, Vinnie, all finished," he tells the Kerry.
"Thank you, Mr. Pilot," Captain Pulimenos says, and strides toward the bridge.

THE ECONOMY
 
For Better or Worse, a New Era in World Trade
The world was watching last week as American politicians did their odd little rain dances on that endlessly discussed world trade pact. President Clinton called the old, humbled Congress back for a bittersweet farewell to deal with the issue, and after he pacified Bob Dole with some last-minute tinkering, the House and then the Senate gave their overwhelming blessings. Now this nation's main trading partners, like Japan and Europe, can act, too -- they were waiting for Washington. Then what? Will the pact, as Mr. Clinton said, keep America "moving forward" to "create more high-wage jobs"? Or will it, as some critics contend, allow a global group to undercut American laws if they are seen as harmful to trade? The pact isn't perfect, said George Mitchell in his farewell. But "these are the only trade partners we have. We don't trade with Mars." 

What Jobs, Exactly?
Jobs, the numbers say, are abundant. November's unemployment rate came in at 5.6 percent, a four-year low, as payrolls surged by 350,000. But what jobs? Amid talk that this strength might spur a further rate cut by the Fed, possibly by Christmas, a gloomier statistic poked through: average hourly earnings fell 2 cents. So that job bounty, one suspects, is mainly concentrated in dehumanizing, minimum-wage dead ends, tucked far from the gaze of chin-stroking economists. This is strength?
 
California Dreamin'
You won't catch Orange County doing anything halfway. Not a place with both Disneyland and a John Wayne Airport. The county is fabled as one of the nation's richest -- but it just got poorer. While some municipalities, and companies, settle for investment losses in the mere hundreds of millions on high-risk derivatives, Orange County's treasurer confessed last week that its loss was $1.5 billion and counting (in real taxpayer dollars). The loss reached that staggering level because $12 billion was borrowed to add leverage in a quest for outsized returns -- compounding the risk. The treasurer is "confident that we can deal with this," but if he had magic up his sleeve, he didn't disclose it.
 
Consumers Are Happy, Alas
Watch out: people are feeling good about the economy. So good, in fact, that the present looks far better than the future. Figures out last week showed that consumer confidence soared in November to its highest level in more than four years. And there the danger lies, for history alerts us that such optimism marks the late stages of recovery; in other words, if you're smiling now, recession may lurk. And when expectations are well below current confidence (as they are now), it follows that investors, an eye to the future, will sell stocks, sending the markets down.
 
And the Battle Puffs On
Like a gritty slog through the trenches, the Great Smoking War is evolving into a battle of inches. Restaurants and tobacco lobbyists turned their big guns on a proposed New York antismoking bill: from full-page ads to Philip Morris's threats to leave the city. When the dust settled last week, the City Council gave some ground -- exempting restaurants that seat up to 35 and workplaces with up to three consenting smokers -- but basically stuck with a tough law. The Tobacco Institute called the bill still "severely restrictive," while a champion of the smoke-free objected, "The smaller the restaurant, the more toxic the second-hand smoke." . . . On another battlefront, antismoking groups vowed to go the F.D.A. to bar the marketing of the industry's latest idea, a low-smoke cigarette, calling it nothing but a drug-delivery device. The industry, in response, saw Prohibition reincarnate.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Norway Goes It Alone
Suppose you live in a nice house, have a good income, and then some unruly neighbors invite you to move in with them. Easy to resist, right? That seemed to be Norway's reasoning last week when it said "No thanks" to the European Union. Norwegians wavered a bit when Sweden and Finland hopped on the bandwagon, but in the end figured they're doing just fine being single -- they've got oil, fish and a solid economy. Who needs Europe? Those who backed membership worried about the oil running out, about a 25 percent tax on fish sold, say, to Sweden. This time, though, a fierce independent streak won the day; it remains to be seen whether it gets lonely later.
 
Steady as Mexico Goes
Mexico got a new President last week, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, and even before he took office, his commitment to a continuing focus on a free-market economy was clear when he named some holdovers from the previous Administration to top Cabinet posts. Among other things, Mr. Zedillo's Government will oversee the end of Telefonos de Mexico's long-distance monopoly and the entry of competitors like AT&T. [Page 8.] Mr. Zedillo, a Yale-educated economist who served as a budget official in the last Administration, also pledged a new fight against poverty.
 
Drink Up, Brazil
Apparently Americans are about as cola-saturated as they'll ever be, because the soft-drink biggies are increasingly scouring the globe for thirsty gullets. A prime target: developing countries with populations weighted toward the young. Pepsi, even with $3 billion in yearly revenue overseas, is still outsold abroad by Coke, nearly 3 to 1. Pepsi wants more. Last week it said it would spend $400 million through June to try to triple its share of Brazil's drinkers, a market it expects to become the world's second largest (you know who's first). Not that Coke is sitting by: it's an official sponsor of Brazil's soccer team, and is already spending $500 million in Brazil this year and next.
 
COMPANIES
 
Cream of Tomato It Ain't
Salsa didn't need Nafta; it started engulfing this nation's chips long before the trade walls fell. Since 1988, sales have grown 13 percent a year, making it nearly a billion-dollar craze -- and making American food companies realize that bland is no longer quite as beautiful. In fact, 10 of the 15 food giants reportedly wanted to buy Pace Foods of San Antonio, the giant of salsa. And last week the prize went to that ultimate mom-and-apple-pie company, Campbell Soup. The price: a very spicy $1.1 billion. Doubters said that was awfully rich, but then again, Campbell's already got some tomatoes, peppers and onions to throw into the mix.
 
Three's Company, Four Isn't
The three networks aren't . . . No, you can't say "the three networks" any more -- not with what Fox has done lately. Make that: The three old networks aren't going to take it. Between cable and that Fox upstart, they're getting battered. So last week NBC tried a desperate measure: it filed a petition with the F.C.C. asserting that the main Fox stations are illegally foreign-owned (by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, based in Australia). If Fox can do it, NBC said, other networks should be able to seek unlimited foreign investment. With G.E.'s deep pockets behind it, NBC could stir up trouble, but no one expects more than a rearrangement of Fox's finances. Fox called it a "blatant attempt" to thwart competition.
 
'No'? That's Not an Answer
Say this for Paul Kazarian: he doesn't give up. For months he pounded on Borden's door, while Kohlberg, Kravis was already in the parlor, flowers in hand. And last week -- after Borden accepted, and the S.E.C. blessed, a K.K.R. bid -- Mr. Kazarian came up with a new idea. It isn't a buyout offer, he said, but "a recovery proposal": a complex deal involving a $430 million investment by Japonica, Mr. Kazarian's firm, and splitting Borden into three pieces -- "unleashing the value," he said. The combined shares, he insisted, would trade for at least $17 (vs. $14.25 from K.K.R.) and hit $22 to $25 in a year -- though he didn't spell out how he'd perform such a feat. If Borden shuns him again? "We would have to consider our options," he said -- teeth, presumably, gritted.
 
Those Vanishing Bank Jobs
New York banks have staged a mighty comeback since hitting bottom four years ago, but the price has been high: jobs have disappeared so fast that local banks now employ fewer people than Wall Street does. Last week saw one of the hardest blows, as Chemical said it would cut 3,700 jobs -- on top of the 6,000 jobs that vanished when it merged with Manufacturers Hanover in 1992. But if Chemical hoped to get in the market's good graces, it hasn't yet. Its stock fell 87.5 cents the day of the announcement.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 11, 1994, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Business Diary column last Sunday about job cutbacks at the Chemical Banking Corporation misstated the movement of the company's stock on Dec. 1, the day of the announcement. It rose 25 cents, to $36.625; it did not fall 87.5 cents.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: 9 of 48 Cove Club Apartments Sell;
Developer Targets Hong Kong Buyers

 BODY:
When the developer of the Cove Club at Battery Park City decided recently that the time was ripe to sell the building's remaining 48 apartments, he returned to Hong Kong, where, three years ago, he had sold half of the building's 163 units to investors within a month. Before last weekend's two-day sale, Andrew Goodstein was quoted in The Hong Kong Standard predicting he would sell all 48 apartments, which had been kept by him and his partners and rented out since the building was completed in 1991. He sold nine. Eight one-bedroom apartments brought prices ranging from $169,000 to $206,000, Mr. Goodstein said, and a two-bedroom penthouse was sold for $410,000.
 Mr. Goodstein, the president of Goodstein Properties of Manhattan, attributed the smaller-than-expected number of sales to the competition in Hong Kong: There were 31 other dealers offering properties, mostly in London, Australia and Canada, on the same weekend. He also blamed the recent interest-rate rise and declines in the stock market. 
While saying he was "thrilled" by the results of the sale, he added: "I never thought the results would be so mixed. Going over, we expected an immediate blowout."
 Mr. Goodstein has sold in Hong Kong before. In May, 1991, he sold 35 percent of the building's units the first day, and another 15 percent in the next month. "When the sales dried up -- when we'd hit anybody and everybody -- we came back to New York and sold another 20 percent," he said.
 Last weekend's investors were an interesting group, he said, from the wealthy woman with a Chanel bag to the older gentleman with the torn bluejeans -- who was the quickest to write a check.

HEADLINE: Merchants Hope and Shoppers Wait and See

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
DESPITE all the fanfare late last month in stores around the county marking the official start of another holiday buying season, Sandra Parada and other shoppers like her paid little heed.
"I'm biding my time," said Mrs. Parada, who was unmoved by the Christmas music and sales promotions in stores along Central Avenue, where she was shopping with her children, Dariush, 5, and Nicole, 7. 
 "We are here to look, not to buy," Mrs. Parada said, leaving Bradlees department store in Yonkers with only a small bundle under her arm. "You could say I'm just comparison shopping at this point."
Mrs. Parada and others shopping just after Thanksgiving said that extended hours and early-bird specials notwithstanding, they would hold out for what they hoped would be even better discounts on merchandise as the Christmas shopping season progressed.
Meanwhile, merchandisers optimistically forged ahead, saying that even though many consumers appeared to be taking a wait-and-see approach, the stores were expecting a robust holiday season.
"Customers are doing what we expect them to do," said Coleman Nee, a spokesman for Bradlees, a discount chain based in Braintree, Mass. "They are looking for the best bargains."
From Bradlees, which caters to low- and middle-income shoppers, to the upscale Neiman Marcus in White Plains, retailers reported that traffic in their stores was up. That, they said, was the greatest indicator of sales to come.
Even in downtown White Plains, where many shopkeepers have been struggling to compete with malls and some have closed shop in recent years, merchandisers said they were hopeful that this year things would be better.
Edward Kahn, the owner of Lords Decorators and president of the White Plains Downtown Merchants' Association, reported that business had recently shown signs of a pickup. "Nothing dramatic," he said, "but there seems to be signs of life." He said his customers were expressing renewed interest in redecorating their homes and that gift items in the store were also selling well.
Indeed, both nationally and in local shopping areas, retailers were betting this year on reports that indicated confidence was running high among shoppers. According to a survey released on Nov. 18 by Arthur Andersen, a Detroit-based consulting firm, roughly three of four Americans said they planned to spend at least as much this holiday season as they did the year before, reflecting income gains during the year and other favorable economic trends.
"We have seen job growth, low inflation and rising disposable incomes in 1994," said Jay Scansaroli, managing partner for Arthur Andersen.
The survey also said that the growth in consumer debt during the year may lead to more cash spending during the holiday season -- a prediction that was borne out locally.
"It's cash only for me this year," said Janerous Heyward, who was also shopping at Bradlees last weekend. "Credit catches up with you in the end."
Another shopper, Michael Jones, said, "I'll spend what I have, but I won't go into debt for it."
Only 22 percent of shoppers -- specifically, wealthy consumers -- said they would use credit for their purchases, the survey said.
The news was especially good for shopping in the Northeast, which was one of two regions (the other is South Central) to rate above the national average in both shopping budget and consumer optimism. Northeast shoppers, the survey said, had an average shopping budget of $690, and nearly 21 percent planned to spend more than last year.
Mr. Jones's experience reflected that trend. "I'll be buying for my wife, my daughter, my mother, my brother, my nephew," he said, reviewing his shopping list. "I guess I'll have to spend more this year, because there are more people than I had counted on."
Frank M. Surdey, an economist with the State Department of Labor, said that merchandisers in Westchester -- in response to renewed optimism this year -- began hiring for the holiday shopping rush earlier than usual. In general, he said, "the Westchester labor market has taken a turn for the better this year."
The county's retailing sector added 900 jobs between September and October compared with a 300-job gain last year and a loss of 200 jobs for the same period in 1990, Mr. Surdey said. Overall, the county had 374,900 jobs in October, 1,200 more than it did 12 months ago.
Likewise, jobless figures were down in October to 4.5 percent, from 4.9 percent in September, making that the lowest unemployment in October since 1990.
For the most part, the county has lagged behind the rest of the country in rebounding from the recession, mainly because of corporate downsizing, Mr. Surdey explained. The area traditionally has depended heavily on big-business hiring and was hard hit when many Fortune 500 companies like International Business Machines laid off large numbers of workers.
"Slowly, though, we are seeing ripples of recovery in Westchester," he said, adding that the county's high corporate vacancy rate has also led to good deals for new companies seeking to relocate here.
"Not only is there high-tech space available but there is a high-tech work force ready and willing to go to work," Mr. Surdey said. "For companies looking to relocate here, Westchester has become a prime candidate."
The modest rebound has led to a buying public that is more optimistic but still looking for "the best bang for its buck," Mr. Surdey said.
At Bradlees, the best buy is often the sales promotion of the week, Mr. Nee said. In the toy department, that could be Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, which are action figures, or even Barbie dolls, which continue to sell well. In the electronics section, CD players are the hot item this year.
By contrast, at Neiman Marcus one of the featured items in the national chain's 1994 Christmas catalogue is a jeweled teddy bear -- for sale at $200,000.
Also cashmeres -- sweaters, scarves, gloves -- were selling well at Neiman Marcus along with leather goods of all kinds, reported Dru Pyne, a company spokeswoman in White Plains, where the store is undergoing a multimillion dollar renovation. She also said that leather cellular phone holders and backpacks costing up to $1,500 were popular items.
While Ms. Pyne refused to describe the typical customer frequenting the department store, she did say, "The recession was never felt at Neiman Marcus."
Bradlees customers were more likely to have suffered from the recession, and Mr. Nee described the typical customer there as cost conscious and careful -- often a "middle- or lower-income woman shopping for her family," he said.
"But we cater to a broad range of customers," he added, explaining that the store's line of children's clothing appealed to all income levels.
In downtown Yonkers, in the Getty Square area, shopkeepers had also targeted a niche in the consumer market -- and were thriving as a result, said Joseph V. Apicella, the Yonkers downtown manager.
The typical customer there this Christmas season is the lower-income earner with a yearly income of $15,000 to $20,000.
"The key for us is to go after the neighborhood customer, not to compete with the malls," Mr. Apicella said. "We are appealing to basics."
In White Plains, Mr. Kahn said that although the stores were struggling to hold their own against their nearby competition, "no store was really doing well."
In addition to the downtown's struggle against competition from larger merchandisers, the office vacancy rate of 32 percent in the surrounding business district has meant fewer potential customers in neighborhood shops.
But Donna Chambers, owner of That Old Black Magic, a book and gift store on Mamaroneck Avenue that caters to black customers, said she was hoping to beat the odds in White Plains' struggling downtown this Christmas.
Ms. Chambers designed her holiday windows with black Santa Clauses, black angels and five-foot-high tin soldiers displaying brown faces and dark curly hair. For fabric, she used traditional African kente cloth.
But Ms. Chambers, who is also a jewelry designer, expressed concern that despite her effort to appeal to blacks, the store might not generate sufficient sales. She relies also on sales from a pushcart she rents at the Galleria mall.
As Mr. Kahn said: "All of us just keep plowing ahead the best we can. Perhaps this Christmas will be better here, too, like it is in other parts of the county."

HEADLINE: Now Act to Ban the Products of Child Labor

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As author of the child labor deterrence bill, which would prohibit the importation of products made by abusive child labor in manufacturing and mining, I take strong exception to "The Poor Need Child Labor" by Kaushik Basu (Op-Ed, Nov. 29). 
 Mr. Basu is right in calling child labor a "tragic phenomenon," but he is dead wrong in contending that the condition should not be banned because the impoverished people of the third world need it.
The notion that the poor need their children to work is scandalous. Do the poor need their children, some as young as 7 years old, working as prostitutes? Who wants to expose their children to dangerous chemicals in the workplace? Who wants to see a child forever deformed from excessively heavy work?
Child labor both causes and perpetuates poverty. The clearest indication of the fallacy in Mr. Basu's argument is seen in the fact that the worst instances of child labor are found where adult unemployment rates are high.
Developing countries do not have to wait until poverty is eradicated before eliminating the economic exploitation of children. Some countries in Asia -- South Korea, Sri Lanka and some parts of India -- have successfully concentrated on sending children to school rather than factories. These countries recognize that in the medium and long term, their economies will be competitive only with an educated, skilled and productive work force.
The dangers facing child workers are varied. Carpet weavers toil under conditions that ruin their eyesight and lead to deformed back and limbs. Those in brickwork carry heavy loads that injure and deform. Children working in mines, glass factories and match factories face multiple hazards. Children toiling in the fields can be maimed, killed and exposed to toxic pesticides.
It is also important to distinguish child work from child labor, something that Mr. Basu fails to do. My bill will not prohibit casual child work, like running errands or helping parents in small ways in mom-and-pop operations.
It will, however, prohibit child labor, which by definition is the exploitation and abuse of children in the work world. For this reason my bill prohibits the importation of products made with child labor in manufacturing and mining, where some of the most abusive cases exist.
Despite the fact that nearly all countries have adopted legislation banning the exploitation of children and have ratified international conventions dealing with children, the International Labor Organization estimates there are as many as 200 million child laborers worldwide.
Because child labor is such a complex problem and is ingrained in many societies, my legislation takes both a multilateral and bilateral approach. The bill also urges the President to seek an agreement with governments that trade with the United States to secure an international ban on trade in the products of child labor.

HEADLINE: Fed Rate Rises Take Longer To Have Effect on Economy

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
As the United States economy's growth continues unabated 10 months after the Federal Reserve began trying to slow it, more and more economists are concluding that the central bank's all-purpose tool, raising or lowering interest rates, is not as effective as it used to be.
To these economists and to a number of former Fed officials, figures like those in the Labor Department's report Friday showing a sharp drop in unemployment last month signal a quiet erosion of the Fed's influence. 
 No one questions the tremendous power the Fed can wield if it raises interest rates sharply or keeps them high for a long time. But changes in the country's financial system, notably the declining role of banks as providers of money for companies and consumers, may make it necessary for the Fed to make bigger increases or to wait longer to get the same effect, they say.
Last month, for instance, the Fed abandoned the pattern of quarter-point or half-point increases it had followed since February, instead pushing up the rates that banks pay for short-term borrowing by three-quarters of a percentage point, its biggest increase in 13 years.
The danger, debated among current and former Fed officials, is that in switching to a heavier hammer, it becomes easier to bend the nail, or mar the results.
Preston Martin, who was vice chairman of the central bank from 1982 to 1986, said that "the Fed just doesn't have the leverage that it had when I was on the board." He sees a serious risk of a recession in 1996 from the bigger increases, which he thinks may have been prompted by growing impatience for results.
Andrew F. Brimmer, a former Federal Reserve governor, said that the six rounds of interest rate increases this year are "having some effects, but they're more modest and it's taking longer."
Current officials of the central bank dispute this, arguing that the rate increases made in the spring are beginning to bite and that they are succeeding in their goal of forestalling inflation by slowing the economy now.
Alan S. Blinder, the Fed's vice chairman, said in an interview Friday that he saw no persuasive evidence of change in the economy's overall responsiveness to interest rate moves. While some effects of monetary policy may be less powerful, others have become more so and the balance has shifted little, if at all, he said.
"There isn't any doubt that at the level of detail, monetary policy works differently than the way it did 20 years ago," he said. But he added, "I'm not persuaded that at a fundamental level it's weaker."
Lawrence B. Lindsey, a current Fed governor, took a middle position, saying "the jury is still out" on whether the delays in monetary policy's effects on the economy are lengthening.
To be sure, monetary policy has never been a precise tool, always subject to long and variable lags between action and effect. Corporate decisions -- for instance, whether to build a factory or to stock more goods for sale -- are based on current interest rate costs, but take a year or more to affect the economy. So last year's low rates may still be driving growth, Mr. Blinder said.
The Fed's position is like that of a supertanker captain steering down a narrow channel. Quick changes of course are not possible, and trying too hard to avoid one set of problems only makes other problems worse. If interest rate changes take longer to have their effect, then the Fed has an even looser rudder as it guides the economy.
Many Congressional Democrats and others who have opposed the Fed's rate increases would, of course, welcome any weakening of its influence.
And even some Fed supporters see benefits along with potential dangers. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said he thought that the Fed's moves seemed to have a slower effect than usual on the economy this year because of the rise in initially cheaper adjustable-rate mortgages. Home buyers "are not feeling the pain to the degree they normally would," he said.
"It may actually make it a smoother influence on the economy," Mr. Bentsen added.
But a slower impact by the Fed also holds risks, he said. "The problem now is judging how much and when the impact will hit with things already in the pipeline."
Some Administration officials have begun to worry that the Federal Reserve's rate increases might catch up with the economy late this winter, as Christmas credit-card bills and home-equity loan charges are piling up and mortgage payments move steadily higher.
Economists who think the Fed now takes longer to affect the economy note that the central bank most directly controls the Federal funds rate, the overnight interest rate at which banks borrow money from each other. But banks are playing a dwindling role in financing the nation's growth and are becoming less dependent on overnight borrowing. More corporations are borrowing money by selling notes and bonds while more consumers are turning to mortgage brokers and car makers for loans to buy houses and vehicles.
The Detroit auto makers are still doing quite well, in part because interest rates on car loans have not risen all that much this year and cars are increasingly being leased rather than sold.
The average interest rate on a new-car loan from a bank has risen only 1.37 percentage points this year while the Federal funds rate has climbed nearly twice as much. Car makers and finance companies, which raise money by selling bonds, are providing more competition for the banks and holding down costs for consumers, Mr. Lindsey said.
Interest rates controlled by the Fed only indirectly influence the rates that the auto makers and finance companies pay on the bonds they issue. These bond rates have typically not gone up as much as the overnight rate the Fed directly controls.
Home building is another industry that has traditionally suffered when the Fed raised rates. Yet the sharp increase in the use of adjustable-rate mortgages this year, with first-year rates of 6.5 percent still available in some places, has allowed Americans to go on buying new houses even though some no longer qualify for fixed-rate mortgages at 9.25 percent.
But while adjustable-rate mortgages may have helped some people buy homes, rate increases to existing holders of such mortgages have reduced the ability of many households to spend money.
"Once you're hooked, you're more subject to interest rates," Mr. Lindsey said.
Americans have also insulated themselves from the effects of Fed rate increases by borrowing money on credit cards or against the value of their homes, using home-equity loans. A steady rise in consumer debt has made it easier to continue spending, at least for a while, even as rising mortgage payments begin to drain people's wallets.
Combined with the elimination a decade ago of regulations that used to limit the interest rates that banks could pay to attract deposits, the changes in housing finance have weakened the Fed, said Martin Mayer, an analyst at the Brookings Institution.
"Whereas Bill Martin could put the foot lightly on the brake and everything shuddered, now you have to put the foot all the way down," said Mr. Mayer, referring to William McChesney Martin, the chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1951 to 1970.
Most complicated of all, and also important for the Fed, is the tendency by banks to rely less on the overnight borrowing the Fed controls. When banks have needed this year to raise money for customers seeking loans, they have relied to a considerable extent on selling other assets. Many banks have sold part of their huge inventories of Treasury bonds accumulated in the last several years. Many have also bundled together existing loans and resold them to investors.
A dwindling breed of economists who focus on the nation's money supply argue that the Fed's power is undiluted because the central bank can still raise or lower the quantity of money in circulation in the economy as it sets interest rates.
Drawing analogies to other rate increases of recent times is difficult because the circumstances have been different. During the two most recent periods of increases, for instance, from 1978 to 1981 and from 1987 to 1989, the Fed delayed taking action until the economy was already overheated and inflation was rising.
Budget policy was also more stimulative to the economy during the periods of those increases than is current budget policy -- although some now at the Fed worry that the Republicans who control Congress may again widen the budget deficit by voting for tax cuts without providing matching spending cuts.
Excluding such differences, the braking effect of interest rate increases is weaker now than it used to be, said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Brothers.

PRIVATE HANDS TAKE OVER CITY WORK
In his effort to shrink municipal government and cut spending while still maintaining core services, the Giuliani administration has, without fanfare, begun turning over to private companies an array of services in New York City now handled by municipal employees -- from replacing traffic signs to stuffing tax bills into envelopes to keeping city buildings clean. In all, the Mayor's office has awarded contracts, sought bids or drafted plans for hiring private companies to undertake two dozen separate services. A1. 

NEW YORK CITY
 
DISSONANT PORTRAIT OF ROBBERY SUSPECT
Until Friday, his family and friends said, 30-year-old Richard Larrier had never been in any kind of trouble. But on Friday night, he apparently led two nephews and a friend of theirs in an armed robbery at a bicycle store in Brooklyn that left Mr. Larrier and a police officer dead and the three youths in jail, charged with murder. Only one piece of the Ricky Larrier that people in his neighborhood described seemed as if it might have come from the same man who the police say organized the robbery. "He liked to ride bikes," said Lamont Pickney, a friend of Mr. Larrier's. "He really liked bikes." B3.
 
13-YEAR-OLD CHARGED IN A FATAL STABBING
A 12-year-old boy was fatally stabbed in the chest after reportedly taunting a 13-year-old in the playground of a Bronx housing project, the police said. The older youth was charged with murder. The suspect had been a subject of teasing in his neighborhood because he was an ungainly 6 feet tall and weighed over 200 pounds, neighbors said. B3.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
In Orange County, Strategies Sour

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The treasurer of Orange County, Calif., investing $8 billion of money from the county and local government agencies, did not buy any securities that have defaulted. Nor are any of them likely to do so. Virtually every security he bought will be worth, at maturity, about what he paid.
So how did the treasurer, Robert L. Citron, manage to lose $1.5 billion of that money, as the county acknowledged last week? 
 The answers lie in the strategies he used in managing the county's investment fund. To put more money to work, the fund borrowed about $2 for every dollar that had been entrusted to it to manage. The fund must pay interest on those borrowings, and that interest bill has risen rapidly this year.
That part of the loss has nothing to do with derivatives -- securities whose performance are based on the action of simpler underlying securities -- and everything to do with the risk of taking on debt to make investments.
In the meantime, the interest the fund earns has stayed the same on many of its investments and declined rapidly on others, including some of the more exotic securities that can be classified as derivatives. While those securities will presumably return to face value in a few years, they may not produce enough interest to support the loans Mr. Citron took out to buy them.
Some of the securities conceivably could go for years without paying any interest. The $1.5 billion of losses refers not to the cash that has flowed out of the fund, but to the current market value of the securities the fund owns.
The fund cannot now afford to let its customers withdraw money, because its securities are not now worth at market value what it paid, and it would take losses if it sold them. So last week it notified the customers that any withdrawals would carry a 20 percent penalty. Had it not done so, the first customers out would have received their money while later ones took even larger losses.
What follows is a look at some of the securities Mr. Citron bought and the financing strategies he followed:
LEND LONG, BORROW SHORT Orange County bought large quantities of Treasury and Government agency securities, mostly with maturities of 5 years or less, with some running to 10 years. It generally financed those purchases through what are called reverse repurchase agreements, or reverse repos, in which the securities, either those that are being bought or others, are pledged to secure loans. Those loans were generally rolled over every three or six months and became more expensive as market interest rates rose.
For example, in October the fund bought $124.8 million face value of Treasury notes, which paid 4.75 percent interest and matured in September 1998. It paid an average price of slightly more than par value, so it got an effective yield of 4.61 percent. Most of the money it spent on the bonds came from borrowing through six-month reverse repos.
At the time, the going rate on such six-month loans was 3.31 percent. So at the start, it could finance the entire transaction and get a profit of 1.3 percent -- or $1.6 million -- a year. That money was added to the profits of the fund and helped it to pay above-market yields on the money invested with it.
Unfortunately, as short-term interest rates rose, the profit vanished. Now the rate on such loans is about 6.75 percent. At that rate, the investment loses about 2.1 percent -- or $2.6 million -- a year. And those losses will continue if short-term rates do not fall. The fund could sell the Treasury notes and close out the position, but if it did it would get just $112.8 million at current prices, suffering a capital loss of $12 million.

STRUCTURED NOTES One of Wall Street's most versatile recent inventions is the structured note, in which the issuer -- usually a Government-related agency like the Federal Home Loan Banks or the Federal National Mortgage Association -- pays interest rates that vary and are based on formulas that can be quite complex. The notes, a form of derivatives, are often tailored to meet the needs of a buyer like the Orange County fund, and are devised by investment banks like Merrill Lynch or Paine Webber.
Normally, the agency would immediately engage in an interest-rate swap with the investment bank, so that it would pay a floating rate about one-fifth of a percentage point less than a short-term market rate, the three-month London interbank offered rate, known as Libor. That left the investment bank with exposure to the opposite risk being assumed by Orange County, a risk it presumably hedged by using other derivative securities.
The terms of the structured notes varied widely. In some cases, the county got a promise of rising interest rates for three years, followed by rates at a formula that could cause rates to decline, perhaps to zero, if market interest rates rose. In that case, the fund was effectively betting that short-term rates would not rise. In other structures, it agreed to be paid a rate based on the difference between short-term and long-term rates. In that case, it was betting that long rates would remain much higher than short rates. And in at least one case, the formula was tied to German interest rates and was a bet that those rates would fall. This year, all those bets have been losers.
Consider two examples of the structured notes the fund owns:
In one case, Orange County bought $100 million of Federal National Mortgage Association stepped inverse bonds in February, just after the Federal Reserve tightened credit for the first time this year. The bonds promised to pay 7 percent interest until May and then to pay a rate of 10 percent minus the three-month Libor rate. The rate the bond paid fell to 5.1 percent in May, to 4.9 percent in August and to 3.9 percent last month. Beginning in 1996, the rate will rise to 11.25 percent, minus Libor. The notes mature in 1999, when Orange County will get its $100 million back.
The notes do not trade, because Orange County owns the entire issue. But if they were sold, they would now trade at a substantial discount to the face value. They were a bet on falling interest rates, and that bet has so far not worked out.
In another example of a structured-note deal, Orange County in July 1993 bought $100 million in dual indexed bonds, whose interest rate will fluctuate on the difference between the rate on 10-year Treasury bonds and the six-month Libor. The bonds, issued by the Federal Home Loan Banks, mature in July 1998. They promised 6 percent interest the first year, with the rate then reset every six months. The formula is the rate on 10-year Treasury notes minus the six-month Libor rate, plus 3.1 percentage points.
Last July, the rate was reset at 5.065 percent. If current market interest rates remain unchanged until the rate is reset again in January, the new rate would be 4.2 percent, well below the rate the fund is paying to borrow money.
In buying these notes, Orange County bet that the spread between short-term rates and long-term rates would stay the same or get larger. Instead, it has shrunk. Were short-term rates to become higher than long-term ones, the rate Orange County gets could fall to zero.
On the other hand, these bonds can be bought back by the Federal Home Loan Banks any time the rate is reset. So if the banks find that they are paying a rate they deem too high, they can simply buy back the bonds at par.
This issue also does not trade, because no one except Orange County owns it. But with the spread between the short and long rates having been cut in half since issuance, it would also trade at a discount if Orange County decided to sell.

HEADLINE: Workers Said to Concede Managers' Power

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Although millions of American workers want much more of a say in the decisions that govern their working lives, they now believe that management has become so powerful that workers will not get that say -- even in union shops -- unless management gives its consent voluntarily, a new study finds. The findings are already influencing the Clinton Administration's labor policies.
The study, to be made public today in Washington, finds that workers would ideally prefer to organize into independent groups that are not necessarily unions. Delegates from those groups would sit with managers on joint committees running work places. 
 But in real life, most workers said, such committees are effective only if managers cooperate. To secure that cooperation, a majority in the study said, they would consent to be represented by groups that are powerless.
"Workers want power and they know management cooperation is the key to having that power, but they don't know how to compel management to give that cooperation," said Joel Rogers, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Wisconsin and a co-director of the study.
What makes the study, which was carried out mainly for a Presidential labor commission, so authoritative is the reception that it is receiving. The A.F.L.-C.I.O., as well as management groups, had advisory roles in it. Spokesmen for those groups said over the weekend that they considered the findings accurate.
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich agreed. He said the findings were a "window into what workers really believe" and would figure prominently in discussions on labor policy. "The survey," Mr. Reich said, "reveals that at least in employees' minds current management practices are an obstacle to productivity gains. This is a direct invitation to management to wake up."
A commission appointed by President Clinton to recommend changes in labor laws considers the study essential to its deliberations. A member of the panel, a labor economist from Harvard, Richard Freeman, helped raise nearly $200,000 from foundations to conduct the study, of which he was co-director. The commission was concerned that of the 400 people who testified before it, not one was an individual worker.
"We have heard a great deal of testimony from union officials about what they think their members think and from management about what they think their workers think," said John T. Dunlop, chairman of the panel and Labor Secretary in the Ford Administration. "But this is the first statistically valid sample of what workers themselves think on a range of issues of particular interest to the commission."
No labor issue is more central today than labor-management cooperation. Each side favors a greater role for workers in decision making. The big question has been how much independence and power workers should have in decision making, so that they can speak out without fear of consequences like losing their jobs.
The Dunlop panel will factor the study into recommendations that it will make this month. The commission is considering whether to recommend altering a ban in labor law against company-controlled unions. The provision has effectively blocked the use of labor-management committees at some companies on the ground that managers would too heavily influence them.
The study suggests that workers, in their desire to obtain management cooperation, might acquiesce to committees that give managers the final say.
A majority of the workers surveyed would prefer to let outside arbitrators settle disputes, and thus have the final say. "But it is not an aggressive demand," Mr. Freeman said.
The findings also shed light on a second issue before the Dunlop panel. In a preliminary report in the spring the commission said that the American work place could not become truly efficient and competitive until the hostility between labor and management was reduced. The chief source of the hostility, the commission added, has been management's aggressive campaigns against union organizing.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. wants the commission to recommend changing laws to make organizing easier. The study suggests that workers themselves -- quite apart from organized labor -- favor easier union organizing. A third of the nonunion workers surveyed said they would vote for unions to represent them, though some said they would not do so in the face of management opposition. Ninety percent of the union members in the study said they wanted to keep their unions.
The most startling finding in the six-month study, which first involved focus groups and then detailed telephone interviews with 2,400 workers, occurred when the workers were asked to choose between two types of organizations to represent them. One would have no power, but would have management's cooperation. The other would have power but would be opposed by management. By a 3-to-1 margin the workers chose the weaker organization.
The 2,400 workers -- representing 56 million people in companies with at least 25 employees -- explained their answer in response to another question. Seventy-three percent said they believed that management was so powerful that any employee organization formed to have a say on issues like wages, benefits, working conditions, technology and production goals could "only be effective with management cooperation."
In the interviewing, by Princeton Survey Research Associates, 63 percent also said they would like to participate in decision making much more than their companies allow them to do. Thirty-eight percent said they were confident that their companies kept promises to employees, and 76 percent said their companies would be more competitive if "more decisions about production and operations were made by employees instead of managers."

HEADLINE: Miami Prepares to Embrace the Summit of the Americas

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Dec. 4

 BODY:
On the streets, they are resurfacing and planting palm trees. In the neighborhoods, they are putting the finishing touches on protests and demonstrations, including one that is expected to draw more than 100,000 people to the Orange Bowl.
In city offices, about 800 workers have been briefed about being good hosts. And for three days, seven photographers at the Dade County morgue will take pictures of world leaders instead of bullet wounds. 
 But when President Clinton and 33 Latin American heads of state gather here starting Friday for the first Western Hemisphere summit conference in nearly 30 years, Miami will have more at stake than being a good host.
In a city better known for hurricanes, Cuban refugees and "Miami Vice"-like urban violence, officials say the Summit of the Americas provides a chance to spotlight Miami as a growing center of international commerce.
Experts on Latin American affairs say the conference, which will deal mainly with the economic integration of the Americas, is crucial to a city heavily dependent on trade. Closer to many Latin American and Caribbean capitals than to Washington, Dade County, Miami's metropolitan area, handles about a quarter of the annual $80 billion in United States exports to Latin America.
"It's not just a nice place to have a party," Ambler H. Moss, director of the University of Miami's North-South Center and a former United States Ambassador to Panama, said of Miami. "It's a place whose future depends on the success of the party."
The summit conference is welcome here as the official sign that the city has arrived. In announcing why Miami was picked as the site of the meeting, the President praised its efforts "to build a genuine multicultural, multiracial society that would be at the crossroads of the Americas and, therefore, at the forefront of the future."
It is also a city, Mr. Clinton said, whose economy is already integrated with that of most of Latin America. International businesses like shipping, banking and travel employ about 40 percent of Dade County's work force, officials here say.
The city itself is increasingly Latin American, serving as both refuge and playground for its hemispheric neighbors -- in good times they come to shop and buy condominiums; in bad times they move in. Hispanic residents make up about half of Dade County's population of two million; more than half a million of them are of Cuban descent, but many now are from Venezuela, Peru or Colombia.
The conference is by far the biggest event ever held in the Miami area, bigger than any of six Super Bowls or visits by Pope John Paul II in 1987 and Queen Elizabeth II of Britain in 1991. Preparations are now in full throttle both to work with trading partners and to show off.
There are plans for pre-summit business conferences and the deployment of 2,000 volunteers at information booths. Beautification projects have been under way for months, including about $15 million in landscaping and road improvements.
"We want Miami to look like the Garden of Eden before the apple," said Arthur E. Teele Jr., chairman of the Dade County Commission.
The conference is also one of the largest field operations for the Secret Service, "perhaps only rivaled by the 45th anniversary of the United Nations in New York," said Jack Kippenberger, the special agent in charge of Miami.
Half of the nation's 2,000 Secret Service agents are expected here for the conference, including technicians and counter-sniper specialists. They will be complemented by 5,000 local and state law-enforcement officers, host committee officials said.
Aside from security, the biggest headache will be transporting 34 leaders and their entourages, national delegations ranging from 70 to 200 people and a contingent of more than 5,000 reporters, photographers and television technicians, local officials said. The agenda calls for trips by air, land and water in Miami, Miami Beach and Coral Gables.
As the leaders come and go, many Dade County residents are likely to be caught in unexpected traffic jams. For security reasons, they are not being told the precise time of arrivals, departures or motorcades, and what specific areas to avoid.
But many are already caught up in the spirit of the gathering, with a number of Hispanic communities planning dinners and other celebrations in honor of their countrymen. Others will try to draw attention to a cause or a grievance.
There are demonstrations planned by Haitians upset about the accumulation of trash in their neighborhoods, and by advocates for the homeless angry about what they say is the neglect of the estimated 8,000 homeless people in Dade County. The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit to prevent police sweeps of the homeless before and during the conference.
Cuban exiles expect to meet with some of the visiting leaders, and plan to march on Saturday through the Little Havana district to the Orange Bowl to press their anti-Castro message. Cuba was the only Latin American country excluded from the conference.
Organizers of the Cuban march, who expect about 100,000 people to participate, have promised local officials a calm gathering, with no angry signs or strident speeches that could embarrass the President.
A source of contention between Cuban-Americans and the Federal Government is the more than 20,000 Cuban refugees still being held in American detention camps in Panama and the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
"We know the summit is important for the United States and Florida," said Juan Gonzalez, one of the organizers. "We won't do anything against the summit."
How important the conference turns out to be for the economic development of Florida and Miami remains to be seen. State and local officials say trade with Latin America is already a growth market, but any free-trade accords after the conference could markedly accelerate that growth and expand Florida's role in hemispheric trade the way the North American Free Trade Agreement is doing for Texas.
"Because of decisions that are being made in the private sector, within 10 years we're going to have a hemispheric common market," said Lieut. Gov. Kenneth H. (Buddy) MacKay of Florida. "The summit is adding impetus to that."
But a more immediate expected benefit is a change in image. Tourism in Florida saw a downturn this year, attributed largely to several highly publicized killings of tourists. But Miami officials hope to steer attention to the city's more positive features with events like a huge beach party in Miami Beach on Thursday for the visiting journalists.
"Very few communities ever have an opportunity to redefine their image," Commissioner Teele said. "For too long, the negative connotation of 'Miami Vice' has plagued our city."

HEADLINE: Prospects for U.S.-Cuba Thaw Now Are Fading

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 4

 BODY:
Three months after an agreement between the United States and Cuba to stop a flood of refugees raised expectations of a thaw in the countries' relationship, the prospects for quick, significant change are fading.
Cuba's hopes for a weakening of political support for Washington's tough economic sanctions against the island were shattered by the sweeping Republican victories in the Congressional elections. 
 The hopes of American officials that new free markets for farm products and other items in Cuba might portend broader changes by President Fidel Castro are starting to dissolve in the absence of steps toward political reform.
The dialogue between Havana and Washington, having turned almost cordial after their migration agreement on Sept. 9, is growing harsher in tone, and and American officials say they expect tensions to increase.
"Things probably will get nastier before they get better," one Clinton Administration official said. "You cannot say what would have happened if the Republicans hadn't won so big, but there's no question that the picture has changed."
In a move that Cuban officials have warned could jeopardize the migration accord, the Clinton Administration confirmed on Friday that it would drop its policy of denying direct entry into the United States to the nearly 32,000 refugees detained at the American military bases in Panama and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
As many as 8,000 children and parents who had formerly been required to return to Havana to apply to emigrate will now be considered for asylum on what Washington says are humanitarian grounds.
American officials, who reversed themselves after Cuban-American groups threatened embarrassing protests during the hemispheric summit meeting that begins in Miami on Dec. 9, say they are confident that Cuba will not retaliate by unleashing a new flood of refugees. Casting the parole of families as an exception, they say they will begin to build more permanent housing for refugees at Guantanamo Bay.
But Cuban officials appear to be reading the shift as a sign that the political distance established between the Democratic Administration and conservative Cuban-Americans by the migration pact is narrowing once again.
Under the immigration deal, Cuba agreed to stop the exodus of refugees in return for a promise of at least 20,000 visas each year for Cubans wanting to emigrate to the United States.
The agreement was widely seen as favoring the Clinton Administration, which resolved its immigration problem while refusing even to discuss lifting the United States economic embargo against Cuba, which Cuba's Government blames for the exodus.
Senior Cuban officials acknowledged that the pact would satisfy only a fraction of the people who might wish to leave. They said they accepted it in the hope that by ending the three-decade American policy of automatically admitting Cuban refugees, it would discourage those tempted to flee on highjacked boats or homemade rafts.
By normalizing one aspect of their relationship with the United States, the officials added, a precedent might be set for improvement in other areas.
The strategy was a return to the kind of incremental approach that Cuba took years earlier in trying to end American pressure directed at policies ranging from Cuba's ties to the Soviet Union to its support for Latin American guerrillas.
It also seemed to jibe with the policy articulated by the Clinton Administration at the height of the refugee crisis. If Mr. Castro moved to open up the island's politics and economy, officials said, the United States would respond with "carefully calibrated" steps.
But before, during and since the talks, Cuban leaders have insisted that they will never change their political system to meet conditions that the United States chooses not to set on its relationships with Communist countries like China and Vietnam. To many analysts of United States-Cuba relations, that made it even more likely that improvement would depend on small steps, not big ones.
A first such step came when Cuba dropped its longstanding insistence on a high surcharge for collect telephone calls and the Federal Communications Commission authorized American companies last month to begin direct-dial telephone service to the island.
In another move to increase the flow of information, Clinton Administration officials said they might soon authorize American news organizations to set up bureaus in Cuba and allow Cuban reporters to work in the United States.
Cuban officials have not said whether they would welcome American reporters. But they have long said such access would depend on the reciprocal treatment of Cuban journalists.
Despite having tightened restrictions on Cuban-Americans wishing to travel or send money to relatives in Cuba, Clinton Administration officials say they are considering moves to ease travel to the island by American students and academics, and to improve mail service between the countries. Officials say there is some support in the Administration for talks with Cuba on issues like cooperation against drug trafficking and the renewal of a treaty on hijackings.
But the same officials say such measures may now depend even more now on the political climates of Washington and Florida.
Until last month, a small but growing number in Congress from both parties were calling for a reconsideration of American policy. Now, the louder voice and closer scrutiny are likely to come from conservatives like Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who is expected to take over as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee next month.
Similarly, as Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida grappled over the summer with the exodus of refugees, he weighed the political power of the state's Cuban-Americans against a new and potentially stronger constituency: voters opposed to rising immigration. But while Mr. Chiles won re-election with little Cuban-American help, the Democrats' hold on the state is precarious enough to give pause.
"There is only one Democratic governor in the eight largest states in the country, and that's in Florida, so I don't think Clinton is going to do anything about Cuba that could get him on the wrong side of the Florida Democratic Party," said Peter Hakim, the president of Inter-American Dialogue, a policy research organization in Washington. "He may have to worry about getting the nomination now."
Some American officials say there is still a chance that the Administration might respond to economic changes in Cuba, depending on how far they go. They speculate about a possible backlash against Cuban-American groups, which have remained bitterly critical of Administration policy despite winning a series of concessions. Other officials say any real shift in policy hinges on political moves that Cuban officials have shown no readiness to make.
"The missing piece there is any kind of movement forward in terms of democracy and human rights," one State Department official said. "Our position is that Fidel has to take the first step now."
Cuban officials say they remain confident that pressure for change in American policy will build in the longer term.
They note that only Israel stood with the United States in October as more than 100 countries voted in the United Nations to condemn the American embargo. They have also begun to more aggressively court American business executives as a political counterweight to Cuban-Americans, telling them that the embargo is allowing Canadian, Mexican and European businesses to snap up the best investments in Cuba.
But at the same time they seem to have put aside the optimism with which they announced the migration accord in September.
"Those agreements are not enough for us to begin talking about a solution to the problems in the relationship of the United States with Cuba," the vice president of Cuba's Council of Ministers, Carlos Lage, said recently. Referring to the embargo, he added, "They are not even enough to conclude that this is the beginning of the end."

HEADLINE: Bond Rally May Be Act of Faith

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The performance of the bond market last week rattled conventional wisdom and led a number of credit market analysts to suggest cautiously that the 14-month rise in long-term interest rates may be about over.
"I think we are close to a peak in long-term rates," David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International, said. "I wouldn't want to argue with the idea that we are going back above 8 percent or, perhaps, as high as 8.25 percent. But unless something unforeseen happens on the inflation front I don't think we are going much higher than that." 
 Since the October 1993 trough around 5.75 percent, bond yields have marched steadily higher, and they moved above 8 percent this fall. On Friday, the yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond closed at 7.91 percent, its lowest level in more than a month.
Analysts pointed to a number of technical reasons to explain the rise in bond prices last week. Banks have been liquidating positions in short- to intermediate-term securities, causing those yields to rise relative to bonds. At the same time, some portfolio managers have been moving money out of the stock market and into bonds yielding close to 8 percent. Analysts said at least some of that money was arriving from overseas and was a big reason that the dollar spurted in value.
But if one of the oldest articles of faith in the bond market still applies -- that good news on the economy is bad news for interest rates -- then those short-term positive factors should have been buried under the avalanche of positive reports that emerged over the course of the last five business days.
From the upward revision in third-quarter growth figures to the latest assessment of consumer confidence from the Conference Board to the November employment report from the Labor Department the message was pretty much the same. Despite efforts by the Federal Reserve Board to slow it down, the economy continues to expand at a rate usually associated with rising inflation.
"Everything that has caused the bond market to sell off in the past year was revisited in the last week," the chief economist at C. J. Lawrence, Edward Yardeni, said. "All of those strong numbers should have sent bond yields back to their highs."
Seeking to explain the market movement, Mr. Yardeni and others said the rally in the face of strong economic news reflected a vote of confidence that the Federal Reserve would respond to the latest statistics by ratcheting short-term rates even higher.
The Fed could decide to do just that as early as Dec. 20, the analysts said, when its policy-making Open Market Committee has scheduled its next session.
"If this rally continues, the market is saying they expect the Fed to be successful and to stave off a rise in inflation," said Joseph Liro, chief economist at S. G. Warburg & Company.
The director of financial markets research at BA Securities Inc. in San Francisco, Steven A. Wood, said, "The Fed's credibility with the market is very high right now."
Some analysts said that after watching the economy expand at a clip that at other times had generated higher rates of inflation, market participants were possibly becoming more comfortable with the notion that the equation has changed.
"It could well be the market will need to see more than just rapid growth to deteriorate," Paul G. Mastroddi, a managing director at J. P. Morgan & Company, said. "It might need to see more inflation."
The chief global economist at Lehman Brothers, Alan Sinai, said the bond market might be adjusting to a "new paradigm," one of "strong growth and low inflation."
In support of that model, Mr. Sinai noted that despite the big increase in employment reported for November -- a gain that pushed the unemployment rate even further below the 6 percent level, which is usually seen as a sign of tight labor markets -- hourly wages declined.
"I believe this cycle will be different," Mr. Sinai said. "Structural changes in the economy have been immense, and Fed policy since February is unlike anything attempted by any other central bank. No other central bank would have nearly doubled the overnight rates without a sign of rising inflation."
Not surprisingly, not all economists accept that hypothesis. Even though long rates may be close to their peaks, those analysts said the Fed would need to push up short-term rates further, because the economy will remain strong and inflation will finally begin to move higher next year. With unemployment as low as it is and factories operating at what seems to be full capacity, there is little reason to expect anything else, the analysts said.
"We have seen some remarkably benign inflation numbers," Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities Inc., said. "But it is unreasonable to think they will continue. Inflation is likely to be a little bit higher next year, which is what you might expect with the economy doing as well as it is."

HEADLINE: State's Quality of Life Has Dropped Sharply in Last 10 Years, a Study Finds

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Dec. 4

 BODY:
The social well-being of Connecticut declined sharply during the state's economic recession, erasing a substantial advantage Connecticut held over the rest of the nation in the 1980's, according to a report by a Fordham University research group.
The report, "The Social State of Connecticut," is the first study of a state by the Institute for Innovation in Social Policy at Fordham, which produces an annual assessment of the nation's social well-being known as the Index of Social Health. 
 In the Connecticut study, as in its national index, the institute used Census material and other data on factors including infant mortality, child abuse, health costs, crime and income disparities to reduce social health to a single figure ranging from 0 to 100, called the social-health index.
In 1984, Connecticut's index was 61.8, nearly 20 points higher than the national index, the institute reported. But it began declining the next year and by 1992, the last year for which data were available, it stood at 40.9, barely higher than the national index.
"Connecticut did better for a longer period of time," said the institute's director, Marc L. Miringoff. "The major decline for the country began in the late 70's and bottomed out in the early 80's.
"Obviously, the economy and its deterioration, particularly in manufacturing jobs, has been a major cause."
The Connecticut report was commissioned by the Legislature and a foundation, the Graustein Memorial Fund, to provide an up-to-date picture of the state's social health, comparable with the economic data readily available.
Policy makers, Mr. Miringoff said, need an overview of several factors so they can direct the state's resources where they can have the greatest impact, and his goal is to produce annual indexes that will enable officials to measure their progress.
Future reports on Connecticut, however, will depend on whether the Legislature and the foundation continue their support.
Looking back to 1970, the institute found that Connecticut has made progress in some areas. The state's infant mortality rate has decreased, though it remains high in poor cities, and the birth rate among teen-agers was lower in 1992 than in 1970.
The suicide rate among young people had worsened only slightly and had declined in the last two years for which data were available. And while housing remained expensive, the report found, the cost of single-family houses compared with personal income was no higher in 1992 than in 1970.
Health-care costs, however, had nearly doubled since 1980, and most important, from 1988 on, not only were more people in Connecticut unemployed, but more were out of work for longer periods.
The strains on family income during that time were accompanied by a sharp increase in reports of child abuse and of crime, Mr. Miringoff said, mirroring similar increases across the country.
The report also noted a small decline in the state's high-school graduation rate over the entire period, at a time when a growing proportion of jobs require higher education, and a widening of the gap in income between the state's wealthiest communities and its poorest.
Mr. Miringoff said the report's data allow policy makers to see what factors tend to rise or fall with each other over time as they make spending decisions. "A well-targeted dollar could touch two or three problems," he said.
Noting the effects of the recession and a shift in the work force from high-paying factory jobs to lower-paying service jobs, he continued, "It's easier to get at some of these problems through jobs rather than counseling children, for example.
"I would see the creation of stable, real jobs to be the most important single thing that we can do."

HEADLINE: U.S. Senators Step to Plate

 BODY:
Fearing a devastating blow to Florida's economy with the possible loss of spring training, the state's two United States Senators have urged the new chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee to make baseball's antitrust exemption a priority when Congress reconvenes next month.
"We urge you to take quick action in January to address legislation to repeal the antitrust exemption so that baseball can return to the playing field even if the dispute continues off the field," Senator Connie Mack, a Republican, and Senator Bob Graham, a Democrat, wrote in a letter to Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah Friday. 
 Hatch co-sponsored unsuccessful legislation with Senator Howard Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, in the last session aimed at bringing an end to the work stoppage. It called for the removal of the exemption in labor matters if the owners unilaterally imposed new work rules.

HEADLINE: Keeping Score on the Budget

 BODY:
Under Democratic and Republican leaders alike, the Congressional Budget Office has used techniques for estimating deficits that were trusted by legislators and outside professionals. Until now, the C.B.O. has not abused that trust. But a Republican notion called "dynamic scoring" threatens that healthy bipartisan tradition and the budget office's reputation for refusing to adopt scoring techniques whose only virtue was to yield estimates that politicians wanted to see.
Under the budget laws, the practice of scoring takes on a huge importance. Those laws prevent Congress from passing bills that add to the deficit. Republicans propose cutting taxes and the deficit. Ordinary accountants say they cannot do both. Their response is to change the accounting method. 
 Republican critics condemn existing scoring rules as "static," presumably because the word sounds stodgy compared to their idea, which they label "dynamic." Indeed, many of these critics accuse the budget office of assuming that a 10 percent cut in the tax rate on, say, gasoline reduces tax collections by 10 percent.
That would be static. It would also be inaccurate -- which is why Congressional staffs do no such thing. They routinely estimate the impact of tax cuts on individual behavior -- estimating, for example, how a cut in gas taxes would encourage people to drive more, buy more gasoline and, therefore, pay additional taxes that offset part of the impact of the initial rate cut. There is, then, nothing static about Congressional scoring rules.
What Congressional staffs do not do, but some Republican leaders want them to do, is assume that a cut in gasoline taxes could boost overall economic activity -- not just gasoline sales -- enough to generate waves of new tax revenue. The idea is to make tax cuts take on a Reaganesque magic, becoming at once a gift to taxpayers and the Federal Treasury.
Put aside the fact that such supply-side nostrums proved foolish in the 1980's. It is nonetheless proper to ask why the C.B.O. should rule out by assumption a link between tax cuts and aggregate economic activity. There are three good reasons.
First, dynamic scoring would solve a nonexistent problem. Budget office estimates of revenue after tax cuts -- such as President Reagan's -- have typically been too high; dynamic scoring would enlarge the error.
Second, the budget office projects deficits only five years into the future; few economists believe that tax cuts -- on gasoline, capital gains or anything else -- could lift a $6 trillion economy very much in such a short time.
But the biggest threat from dynamic scoring is political. Economists have not settled upon reliable ways to do dynamic scoring. Tracing the loop from tax cuts through economic activity back to revenue collection is fiendishly difficult. If the idea were adopted, then, the head of the budget office would have a free hand to pick a technique that serves a favored political agenda.
A tax cut on capital gains could be made to look like a cash machine -- even though most economists would estimate otherwise. A Democrat-controlled Congressional committee predicts that the capital gains tax cut proposed in the Republican "Contract With America" would reduce tax revenues by $56 billion over five years; an adviser to the House Republicans, using a self-serving version of dynamic scoring, says the cut will raise revenues by more than $125 billion over the same period.
There is a responsible course of action. The budget office should retain its current rules because they have worked well and because they are reasonably free of political taint. But it should keep an open mind: if outside experts settle upon a reliable way to do dynamic scoring, then the budget office should certainly revisit the option. That way the decision to cut taxes would be driven by professional merit, not Republican fantasies.

HEADLINE: Wireless Bidders Jostle for Position

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
Forget Sotheby's and Christie's. The biggest auction of all time will get under way on Monday morning in the basement of a Postal Service building a few blocks north of the Capitol.
No fast-talking auctioneer will be present, no gavel, no paintings by Picasso or diaries by Da Vinci. Instead, the bidding will occur amid the quiet hum of computers. And the prizes will be invisible and untouchable: 99 licenses to use the radio spectrum for "personal communication services," a new family of wireless telephone and data services. 
 No winners will be quickly apparent in the auction, in which the total of the winning bids is expected to be somewhere between $3 billion and $15 billion. The Federal Communications Commission, which has organized the huge sale, is preparing for the bidding to last two to three months. Would-be bidders were required to make refundable good-faith deposits that ran as high as $118 million; 23 companies and alliances did so.
Both the opportunities and the risks are enormous. The 10-year-old cellular telephone industry now has 16 million subscribers and is growing by more than 40 percent a year; the new licenses will ultimately make it possible to add at least three competing services in every city.
But the required investment and the uncertainties are huge. Building a new national wireless network is expected to cost billions of dollars, and the competition in wireless services will be far keener as the number of rivals climbs in each market.
The Sprint Corporation, which has formed an alliance with three big cable television companies, and the AT&T Corporation are likely to lead the bidding. Craig O. McCaw, the billionaire who sold his cellular telephone company to AT&T, will also be prominent, along with all the regional Bell telephone companies.
Nothing quite like this has ever occurred before. In July and October, the F.C.C. held three smaller auctions for licenses to operate paging and interactive television services. Those auctions brought bids of more than $1 billion, but the licenses going on sale now are far more valuable and the bidding process will be far more complex.
"This auction represents the largest one-time launching of a start-up industry in America's peacetime history," Reed E. Hundt, the commission's chairman, said. "We don't want to focus on getting every last nickel. What we want is to focus on a technique that gets people to show the color of their money as quickly and continuously as possible."
The companies have been preparing their strategies in great secrecy. Sprint, for example, will be submitting bids over encrypted telephone lines from a sealed "war room" at a secret location somewhere in the Kansas City area. Security is so tight that visitors are blindfolded when driven to the site, which is filled with computers and has a conference room and food stockpiles.
Companies will be confronted with an auction in which they will be allowed to bid simultaneously for licenses across the country and to shift bids from one location to another. Each will be watching the others, since each bidder's move will be posted electronically, and each will be able to feint and parry through the many rounds of bidding.
In Washington, the F.C.C. has built a war room of its own. It has 20 bidding booths, each with a computer and a printer; they will be monitored electronically from a monitoring room. In a separate, locked room, 10 "telemarketing" people will accept and verify bids by telephone from around the country.
Because of the perceived risks, stock prices have slipped for many of the companies that have said they will take part in the bidding. Sprint shares, for example, closed at $29 on Friday, down from $33 a share at the end of October; those of the Bell Atlantic Corporation, which has formed a bidding alliance with three other big cellular operators, have dropped to $49 from $52. Shares of the Pacific Telesis Group, the San Francisco-based Bell company that is expected to bid fiercely for California licenses, have dropped to $28 from $30.
Indeed, several major telecommunication companies have decided to remain on the sidelines. The MCI Communications Corporation and Time Warner Inc. each decided to offer wireless services by buying capacity wholesale from other companies. Electronic Data Systems, a subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation, pulled back as well.
"This is one of the most complex business propositions to evaluate," said Joseph W. Cece, president of Cablevision Lightpath, a subsidiary of Cablevision Industries, which plans to bid on licenses in Boston and Cleveland. "Is this a cellular clone? Is this a replacement for local telephones? Depending on how you define it, you can come up with radically different business models and valuations."
F.C.C. economists decided that a conventional auction would not work for the license sale, because the value of each license is tied to the values of the others. Many companies want to assemble nationwide or large regional wireless systems, so they seek to bid with a particular package of properties in mind.
Beyond that, some companies may want to switch their bidding to different markets if the prices become too steep in the market where they started.
"The key issue here is the great degree of interdependency between the licenses," said Evan Kwerel, a senior economist at the F.C.C. who first proposed a simultaneous bidding approach.
A necessity for a successful auction would be to have the maximum amount of information available to each bidder. Simultaneous bidding over many rounds, Mr. Kwerel argued, would allow bidders to learn from the earlier bids of their rivals and change strategy quickly if needed.
Still, the process will take time. To give companies time to analyze the results of earlier rounds, the commission will hold only one or two rounds of bidding each day.
To keep the action moving, the commission has ruled that new bids must be at least 5 percent more than the previous ones. Companies must also bid on at least some licenses in every round to stay in the game.
What will make the process particularly intriguing is that the companies will be able to switch their bids from city to city. A company might devote most of its early bidding toward a license in Chicago and then surprise rivals by switching its bid to the New York market near the end of the auction.
Most participants caution that the first round of bidding on Monday will provide little real hint of the ultimate results. But investors are already concerned about the prices that companies will end up paying.
"Wall Street has been extremely cautious or has downgraded companies that filed for the P.C.S. spectrum plans, the concern being that the prices could get very expensive," Frederick W. Moran, a telecommunications analyst at Salomon Brothers, said.
Not to worry, said Gary Forsee, senior vice president of Sprint, who is coordinating the auction strategy for Sprint and its partners, Cox Enterprises, the Comcast Corporation and Tele-Communications Inc.
"The concerns about high costs are ill founded," he said. "These are rational players who are going to make rational business decisions."

CORRECTION-DATE: December 9, 1994, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Monday about the Federal Government's auction of licenses for wireless telephone and data services misstated the number of companies and alliances that made deposits to qualify for the bidding. It was 30, not 23.

(David Scull/The New York Times)
 
Chart: "Auction for the Airwaves"
 Today, the F.C.C. will hold the first of several auctions for licenses to offer wireless personal communications services, or P.C.S., that transmit voice, data and images over the air.
 
ROUND ONE: MAJOR TRADING AREAS -- 99 LICENSES
 Up for sale are two licenses in each of 51 regions that the F.C.C. has defined as "major trading areas." Each license covers a 30-megahertz swath of the radio band, roughly comparable to licenses for cellular telephones. Three licenses have been reserved for technical "pioneers"; the remaining 99 are open for auction. Bidders were required to make advance deposits based on the number of regions in which they may seek licenses.
 
Likely leading bidder: WIRELESSCO (Sprint, Tele-Communications Inc., Comcast Corporation and Cox Enterprises)
Deposit: $118 million
Potential coverage: Can bid on licenses covering 196 million people in all
 
Likely leading bidder: AT&T
Deposit: $78 million
Potential coverage: 130 million people
 
Likely leading bidder: PACIFIC TELESIS GROUP
Deposit: $56 million
Potential coverage: 93 million people
 
Likely leading bidder: P.C.S. PRIMECO (Bell Atlantic, Nynex, US West and Air Touch Communication)
Deposit: $50 million
Potential coverage: 90 million people
 
Likely leading bidder: GTE
Deposit: $50 million
Potential coverage: 83 million people
 
Likely leading bidder: CRAIG O. MCCAW
Deposit: $32 million
Potential coverage: 53 million people
 
NEXT YEAR: SMALLER AREAS -- 1,972 LICENSES
 Withing the 51 regions, there will be 493 smaller "basic trading areas," each roughly corresponding to a single metropolitan area. For each of these areas, the F.C.C. will sell one 30-megahertz license and three 10-megahertz license, which can accommodate less data but still have very large capacities. These smaller licenses will be auctioned in several rounds beginning next year.

HEADLINE: Many Questions, but Too Late

BYLINE: By SALLIE HOFMEISTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 5

 BODY:
If anyone blew the whistle on Robert L. Citron, the Orange County treasurer who was forced to resign today, it was one of his biggest backers, Peer Swan.
Mr. Swan, president of the Irvine Ranch Water District Board, may have been the first of the roughly 170 local agency heads who invested $7.8 billion in the fund, to ask questions before the county disclosed last week that it faced an investment loss of $1.5 billion. In retrospect, he says, it was already too late. 
 "People here should have paid more attention," Mr. Swan said in an interview late last week. "We knew we were highly leveraged. But it had been a winning strategy for so long."
Indeed, it was not until October, months after interest rates began their sharp climb this year, that Mr. Swan began demanding details about the fund's liquidity and the precise impact of rising rates.
Worried that the rising rates were ravaging the portfolio, Mr. Swan, who says he voted for Mr. Citron in June, asked the county in late October to begin returning his $400 million investment in chunks of $50 million a week. Mr. Swan agreed to stop withdrawing the money in November when the county administrator agreed to scrutinize Mr. Citron's activities more closely and answer some questions. When those answers were not forthcoming, Mr. Swan asked to withdraw the remaining $300 million.
"We found out that some of the things Citron told us weren't the gospel," Mr. Swan said. "He had told us in October that the fund had more than $1.3 billion in cash and we found out it was more like $400 million."
That means Mr. Citron did not have enough cash on hand to live up to redemption policies required by law. Of the $7.8 billion pool, about $4.7 billion came from Orange County agencies, including 31 school districts, that are required to invest with the treasurer. The remaining $3.1 billion belonged to "discretionary" investors, including the Irvine water district. Others in this category included the Orange County sanitation, transportation and toll road agencies, and several city governments. By law, they are entitled to refunds of their entire principal within 30 days of a request.
Some financial experts say Mr. Swan and his fellow managers among the local districts should have put the brakes on Mr. Citron sooner. Enraptured by their high returns, they failed to heed public warnings by a handful of state lawmakers and outside experts about the dangers of the fund's aggressive approach, these experts believe.
"The 170 directors were hooked on a yearly fix from Citron that allowed them to finance projects that they otherwise would not have had the money for," said John Moorlach, a certified public accountant who tried to unseat Mr. Citron in a heated campaign in June. The risks of the fund's strategy, including its partial reliance on derivatives, was the central issue in the campaign.
Some state legislators had been calling for the resignation of Mr. Citron, who has not been available for comment since the loss was disclosed last week.
Mr. Citron leveraged $7.8 billion pooled by local agencies into an investment portfolio valued at about $20 billion by borrowing and investing heavily in high-risk securities tied to the prospects of lower interest rates. While the fund returned an average of 10 percent annually in the last 15 years, its investments lost value sharply this year as interest rates bounced up. Mr. Citron was forced to put up more collateral against borrowings, creating a liquidity problem.
Liquidity in the fund, according to Standard & Poor's, which put the county on its credit watch on Friday, had declined to $450 million by late November from $1.2 billion on Sept. 1. Mr. Swan estimates that the fund has as little as $320 million today because of calls for more collateral.
Mr. Swan said his request for a withdrawal was not motivated by an immediate need for the money. Instead, he merely intended it as a tool to pry the county into appointing an investors' committee to oversee management of the fund. "We talked with him about forming one since early in the year, after interest rates started to rise," said Mr. Swan, who is treasurer of the Pacific Scientific Company and sits on the board of the Southern California Bank.
Mr. Citron provided monthly reports on the asset value and interest earnings of the fund, but Mr. Swan said there was no way to tell, for example, that a third of the assets were tied to declining interest rates. In October he asked for details on the fund's liquidity, the interest it was paying on some holdings and the adequacy of its collateral.
"We knew he was leveraged two times," Mr. Swan said. "We were surprised that he had leveraged the portfolio up by almost three times."
At the same time, another investor, the Orange County sanitation district, pushed for a review committee. With $400 million in the fund, the sanitation district set aside $25,000, and prepared to bring in an outside consultant to study the damage of rising interest rates to the portfolio.
"The next thing we knew," Mr. Swan said, "the county administrative officer had stepped in to oversee Citron and had brought in an outside adviser and law firm." That action "gave us confidence that the problems would be taken care of."
Behind Mr. Swan's request was the fear that the treasurer intended to impose a penalty fee on investors who withdrew their funds. And last Tuesday, a week after Mr. Swan asked to withdraw, that is exactly what Mr. Citron's office did.
It imposed a 20 percent penalty, and asked investors not to withdraw. Most agreed, though they privately questioned the legality of such an action. Two days later, to stop rumors circulating in the municipal bond market that the fund faced a cash-flow crisis, Orange County announced the paper loss of $1.5 billion.
Mr. Citron could have hedged against rising interest rates in February to minimize the losses, Mr. Swan said, but he did not. "By the end of March, he was locked into his position," he said. "He had sold off some of the derivatives at a $6 million loss in March and taken heat for it in the campaign, so he couldn't get rid of any more."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Some Losses But Revival of Rally Is Seen

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar declined against most leading currencies yesterday as dealers took profits after a monthlong rally.
But the dollar stopped short of falling though the critical level of 100 Japanese yen and held steady above 1.5710 German marks, which traders said indicated that the outlook for the dollar remained positive. 
 "It has been kind of quiet," said Lizbeth Goldberg, assistant vice president at Hypobank. "The dollar is just recuperating a little bit but the next move will be higher."
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar fell to 100.36 yen from 100.61 yen on Friday. It slipped to 1.5714 marks from 1.5798 marks.
Traders said the dollar would probably continue on an upward course that began early in November. The currency has been stronger since the United States entered the markets late in October to buy dollars for marks and yen. It was further bolstered when the Federal Reserve sharply raised short-term interest rates on Nov. 15.
Some investors are confident that inflation, which erodes the value of dollar-based assets like stocks and bonds, is being held in check. "That is why the dollar continues to rally," David Durst, vice president at Bear, Stearns & Company, said.
In New York trading yesterday, the market was focused on reports that Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen was planning to resign. Mr. Bentsen called the reports premature, but he stopped short of denying them outright. The decision to intervene in the currency markets is a task of the Treasury Department.
"Bentsen's resignation has been expected for a long time," Mr. Durst said. "But I don't think it will be viewed as negative."
After the markets closed in New York, firmer reports indicated that Mr. Bentsen would step down within a day or two, and would be replaced by Robert E. Rubin, head of the Administration's National Economic Council.
Dealers said that the British pound came under pressure as the House of Commons prepared to vote today on a proposed fuel tax. The vote was seen as a test of Prime Minister John Major's credibility, but was not a formal confidence vote.
"It is not that the Government is at risk of collapsing," said Amy Smith, an analyst at the consulting firm I.D.E.A. "But it would further damage Major's image and I don't think they want that political implication."
In New York trading, the pound fell to $1.5575 from $1.5596 on Friday.

HEADLINE: Panel on Trimming Programs Takes Aim at Social Security

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5 --
The staff of the committee appointed by President Clinton to remedy imbalances in the Government's health and retirement programs proposed today three possible solutions that involve the politically unmentionable subject of Social Security.
One option would be to raise the normal retirement age to 70; another would accelerate previously scheduled increases in the retirement age to lift it to 67, and a third would raise the threshold for full benefits to age 68 in a way that the full effect would be felt only by people 40 years old or younger. The third option would also reduce benefits for the more affluent. 
 But it is not certain that the bipartisan, 32-member commission itself will accept any of these possible solutions in preparing its report for the President by Dec. 15. Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, and Senator John C. Danforth, a Missouri Republican, the two heads of the panel, are expected to produce their own package of recommendations this Friday. The commission's interim report in August concluded that current budgetary imbalances would mean that Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security would entirely consume the Federal budget by 2029 if the system were not changed.
The commission is scheduled to meet in open session on Friday to receive the panel's proposals, and on Dec. 14 it will conduct its final meeting before going out of business at the end of the year. Mr. Danforth and Mr. Kerrey are trying to muster the needed 20 votes to recommend one package to the President, a prospect that remains uncertain.
The goal of the commission is not to find ways to balance the budget, but to keep the section of the budget that goes to entitlement programs from growing above the 3 percent of the gross domestic product it now consumes. Medicare and Medicaid have been two of the fastest growing portions of the Federal budget. Social Security is currently in surplus, but it is projected to begin drawing down that surplus in 2012.
The commission is made up of 11 Republican and 11 Democratic members of Congress and 10 unelected members. One member is Representative Dick Armey of Texas, who has been elected Republican majority leader. He, like other Congressional leaders and President Clinton, has declared Social Security to be off the table when it comes to discussions about cutting Federal spending.

HEADLINE: BENTSEN IS POISED TO LEAVE CABINET, OFFICIALS CONFIRM

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen plans to announce his resignation this week, senior Administration officials said tonight, ending months of speculation about the tenure of the Cabinet's most prominent member.
Robert E. Rubin, the head of the National Economic Council, will be nominated to replace Mr. Bentsen, the officials said. 
 Mr. Bentsen, 73, will not leave immediately, the officials said, although he may not stay until Mr. Rubin goes through the Senate confirmation process. If Mr. Bentsen leaves before then, Deputy Treasury Secretary Frank N. Newman would become the Acting Treasury Secretary.
Mr. Rubin, 57, is also a senior adviser to Mr. Clinton and a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, the New York investment bank.
Administration officials said today that Mr. Bentsen, who represented Texas in the Senate from 1971 to 1993 before moving to the Treasury post, had told Mr. Clinton before Election Day that he was not prepared to stay in office through 1996 and believed that a replacement should be chosen before the next round of budget struggles begins in earnest this winter. The two men engaged in a series of discussions about the timing of Mr. Bentsen's departure.
The likely candidate to replace Mr. Rubin on the National Economic Council, Administration officials said tonight, is Erskine B. Bowles, the White House deputy chief of staff. A former investment banker in North Carolina, Mr. Bowles first came to work for the President as head of the Small Business Administration and recently moved to the White House.
Rumors of Mr. Bentsen's departure have swirled periodically for more than a year. Other speculation had Mr. Bentsen replacing Secretary of State Warren Christopher, although Mr. Bentsen never tried to feed or squash that rumor.
The speculation increased this fall when Mr. Bentsen bought a large house in Houston, where his children and grandchildren live. Former President George Bush lives in the same neighborhood.
Mr. Bentsen has long spoken to his associates of returning to Texas at the end of 1994, when the Senate term he gave up to take the job would have expired.
Even Administration officials accustomed to putting the best possible face on bad developments were unable to portray Mr. Bentsen's departure in a good light today. The resignation of one of the most prominent members of the Democratic Party's moderate wing would be a political setback for a President trying to stem the sense of drift that has followed last month's electoral drubbing.
"If you could only have one person on your side in an economic debate, most people would have chosen Secretary Bentsen," said Gene Sperling, a deputy assistant to the President for economic policy.
Mr. Bentsen also has more influence and experience in working with Congressional Republicans than any other senior Administration official. Unlike other Administration officials with experience in the House, like Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, Mr. Bentsen also served in the Senate, including working on the minority side when the Republicans controlled that chamber from 1980 to 1986.
Administration officials emphasized today that Mr. Bentsen was not leaving because of personal or policy differences with his colleagues. But Mr. Bentsen has expressed frustration to associates during the last two years about long and rambling meetings at the White House that seldom started on time.
Mr. Rubin is well known in currency markets and foreign capitals, two audiences that any Treasury Secretary must impress.
Officials said that Mr. Rubin would not retain his position as head of the National Economic Council, because of the council's role as an honest broker in interagency debates. His likely replacement as head of the council, Mr. Bowles, has a reputation within the Administration as a pro-business Democrat who likes to talk about the importance of entrepreneurship to the economy. "He fits kind of well into the Rubin-Bentsen mold," one Administration official said.
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, has an outside chance of beating out Mr. Bowles for the job.
Mr. Bentsen told reporters before a speech this afternoon on trade policy that the rising speculation about his departure during the last month was premature. "When I have more information, I'll let you know," he said.
Mr. Bentsen's press secretary, Joan Logue-Kinder, declined to comment today on Mr. Bentsen's recent discussions with the President. But she did say that "he has had a number of successes, and the main things that were of uppermost interest to him he has accomplished."
She cited Congressional approval of a global free-trade accord last week and a bill two months ago that will allow more interstate banking. She also cited Congressional approval last year of the President's budget plan and the North American Free Trade Agreement, which will gradually eliminate trade barriers with Canada and Mexico in the next decade.
By contrast, the next two years are likely to be much more difficult for whoever is the Treasury Secretary. Most economists, including those in the Administration, expect the Federal Reserve's interest-rate increases to begin slowing the economy next year, while Republican control of the House and Senate will make it much more difficult for the Administration to push through legislation.
Mr. Bentsen has tended to avoid partisan confrontations with Congressional Republicans. Mr. Rubin led the Administration's attacks this autumn on the Contract With America, the election platform used by many House Republicans.
People who know both men said that Mr. Rubin was less likely than Mr. Bentsen to defend the status quo. For instance, they said, Mr. Rubin is more likely to favor tax law changes than Mr. Bentsen, who wrote many of the current tax laws when he was chairman of the Finance Committee from 1987 until last year.
Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said, "Their politics are somewhat similar, but I think Rubin is more interested in innovation."
Mr. Bentsen has told associates in the past that he planned to leave Government and go back into business at the end of this year. He has never said what industry he might enter, but he made a fortune estimated at up to $70 million when he ran a Texas insurance company during the 1960's. He represented a south Texas district in the House from 1949 to 1955 and represented Texas in the Senate from 1971 until early last year.
Speculation about Mr. Bentsen's departure began late last year when several long-time aides, who had served him in the Senate and followed him to the Treasury, submitted their resignations within a few weeks of each other. Although the resignations appeared coincidental, they also reflected the officials' frustrations in dealing with the Treasury bureaucracy after years on a relatively small Senate staff.

HEADLINE: Republicans All for One, and the One Is Gingrich

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Representative Newt Gingrich was unanimously chosen today to be Speaker of the House by ecstatic Republicans chanting "Newt, Newt, Newt," and he told them that the way to get rid of bad Federal programs was simply not to provide any money for them.
Nominated for the post by Republicans who called him "a revolutionary" and a "visionary," Mr. Gingrich, a Georgian, talked for an hour about the America he would like to help fashion and the hard work ahead for the House. He gave his fellow Representatives an eight-item reading list that included titles as diverse as the Federalist Papers and Mary E. Boone's "Leadership and the Computer." 
He was occasionally overcome and had to pause because his boyhood ambition is one step from realization, awaiting a Jan. 4 House vote that is no more than a formality. Accepting the nomination from his majority party, Mr. Gingrich compared the gray, rainy day to March 4, 1933, when Franklin D. Roosevelt was inaugurated in the depths of the Depression and assured the nation, "We have nothing to fear but fear itself."
"I think we're in that tradition," he said. "I think we want to say to the nation that we have nothing to fear but fear itself, that we can reach out together as a family, all Americans, and we can dramatically improve our quality of life, the economic opportunity and the safety of virtually every American between now and the year 2000."
He reminded Republicans that while they had broken a 40-year tradition in winning control of the House, not since the 1920's had Republicans controlled the House for four years in a row. He said their work now would influence whether that achievement could be duplicated.
But as he concluded his speech in the ornate caucus room of the Cannon House Office Building, named for Joseph Cannon, the last Speaker who used, and ultimately lost, the degree of control he seeks to exert, Mr. Gingrich said:
"The real success isn't a Republican re-election. The real success isn't even a balanced budget. The real success is no law.
"The real success is the morning we wake up on a Monday and no child has been killed anywhere in America that weekend, and every child is going to a school their parents think is worth attending, and across the country there is a smaller, more customer-friendly Government doing what governments should do, and every American has a chance to create a job or find a job, and across the planet freedom is winning and civility and decency are driving barbarism out of our lives."
It was largely a day for oratory, and the only hint of new policy came when he discussed the work the Republicans would do on spending bills. He said they had the opportunity "to begin decisively changing the shape of the Government." He said it was not necessary to repeal the authority for specific programs: "We simply have to not pay for them."
He did not specify which programs or how deep a set of cuts he intended. Nor would Representative Bob Livingston of Louisiana, his choice to head the Appropriations Committee, who said of the impending cuts: "Don't be surprised if it's a lot. We have long knives."
After anointing him as the party's candidate for Speaker against Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democrats' minority leader, the Republican caucus elected Representative Dick Armey of Texas as its majority leader. Mr. Armey, who promised fast action on the party's "Contract With America," its campaign manifesto, also had no opposition.
Another Texan, Representative Tom DeLay, won a three-way race for the No. 3 position, that of majority whip. He got 119 votes to 80 for Representative Robert S. Walker of Pennsylvania and 28 for Representative Bill McCollum of Florida.
The only discouraging words of the day came from Democrats who held a news conference to denounce Republicans as mean-spirited for dismissing more than 3,000 white- and blue-collar employees on Capitol Hill and not giving them severance pay.
Representative David E. Bonior, Democrat of Michigan, calling Mr. Gingrich arrogant and hypocritical, said: "Why are you firing over 1,500 hard-working people less than a month before Christmas without even considering giving them their due compensation? Why are you firing an additional 1,800 people who are not political appointees, who are not partisan in any way, some of whom have worked here for both the Democrats and the Republicans the past 20 or 30 years?" They include janitors, clerks and carpenters, who owe their appointments to Democrats but can be replaced in the new regime.
He accused the Republicans of professing to care about working people but then showing no regard for their circumstance. "This is not a workers' agenda, it's a boss's agenda," he said.
Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, had no estimate of how much money was involved. "They may be re-hired, they may not be rehired," he said. "There is no assurance that anyone will be back. They don't know whether their agency is still going to exist, whether it will be someplace else, or whether Newt Gingrich might have some friends who need jobs that may be coming in and taking their employment. There is no protection."
At the Republican caucus, Mr. Gingrich was nominated by Representative Henry Bonilla of Texas, a former television newscaster and executive, who called on the Georgian to lead Republicans not only against the Democrats, but in "doing battle with the liberal media." He said Mr. Gingrich was "a visionary, a revolutionary, a believer in basic values."
Representative Nancy L. Johnson of Connecticut called him "the most visionary thinker in American politics today," the appropriate leader when "evolution is too slow and revolution is too costly."
In his speech, Mr. Gingrich at times resembled the history teacher he had been before going to Congress. He offered the reading list, half historical, half futuristic, with a couple of extra-credit supplements, saying, "I think ideas really matter."
"I think that a political party willing to learn will be more capable of delivering a better America than a political party that thinks it already knows it all," he added.
He, too, complained about the news media, saying his wife, Marianne, had "endured more from the media and from the process than anybody should have to, for me to be here." A spokesman for Mr. Gingrich said the Congressman meant that his wife, like many congressional wives, suffered when her husband was attacked in print.
Mr. Gingrich laid out an imposing agenda, saying that when the House meets on Jan. 4, it would be "the longest opening day in history," with votes on nine measures, starting with a bill that would impose on Congress the same laws covering working conditions and similar matters that apply to other Americans.
After the first 100 days, he said, the House would take three weeks off. He urged the Republican members to spend one week with their families and the other two with constituents, before returning to deal with the budget resolution and with spending bills.
And he promised to support efforts by Republican freshmen "to sell at least one office building." The building they have in mind is a 433,000-square-foot structure that the F.B.I. once used to store files. It is known as House annex No. 2, but it also bears the name of a former House minority leader who later became President: Gerald R. Ford.

Ascendance of an Improbable Leader -- Richard Keith Armey

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Here is how Newt Gingrich says someone can tell that a "revolution" is truly at hand. When he and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas had to leave an important meeting of Republicans on Friday, they left Representative Dick Armey and Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi in charge.
Mr. Gingrich of Georgia, the next Speaker of the House, told this anecdote to a gathering of conservatives here, and the audience cheered wildly. 
 Mr. Armey, a 54-year-old former economics professor from Texas, is widely perceived as farther right and more hot-headed than Mr. Gingrich -- and as an improbable leader. He used to sleep in the House gym to save money; he has implied that Hillary Rodham Clinton was a Marxist, and, upon meeting her, he said, "The reports on your charm are overstated, and the reports on your wit are understated."
But today, Mr. Armey, whom the Almanac of American Politics dismissed as "hardly likely to be a power in the House," was crowned during a jubilant ceremony on Capitol Hill as the first Republican majority leader in 40 years.
Like Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Armey is eager to rise above his Dennis-the-Menace reputation and show that he can be constructive.
"We didn't win power; we gained responsibility," Mr. Armey told the sixth annual Conservative Leadership Conference on Saturday night. "We do not view ourselves as a temporary strike force. We view ourselves as a permanent presence."
Whether Republicans maintain that presence will depend in part on how Mr. Armey, who is beginning his sixth term in the House, conducts himself in the 104th Congress.
In an interview in his Capitol Hill office, Mr. Armey, a former marathon runner with a 6-foot-3-inch frame and a sunny demeanor, volunteered that his days of defiance were over.
Being a member of a "repressed minority" -- House Republicans -- had forced him to be uncharacteristically confrontational, he said. Those were the bad old days, when he did things like acidly hiss on the House floor to Democrats that "your President is just not important to us," a remark that disturbed even his fellow Republicans.
"I was just trying to fight for some turf to stand on," he explained.
Then he smiled. "Now I own the playing field."
As majority leader, he will serve as Mr. Gingrich's commander in the field. His first duty: within 100 days, to engineer votes on the 10 items in the "Contract With America," the Republican's campaign agenda, including a balanced budget amendment and term limits.
He calls the contract merely the "shakedown cruise of the counter-revolution," predicting a far more drastic paring down of Government once the Republican ship is under full sail.
He and Mr. Gingrich are expected to work well together. They are not personally close, but they share a similar background and many goals. Earlier this year, they fused their considerable powers of positive thinking to convert the Republican "minority mentality" into a "majority mentality." They forged the contract together -- sharing a deep commitment to such items as eliminating welfare payments to unwed teen-age mothers -- and helped usher in the new order on Nov. 8.
"They have managed to put aside two pretty formidable egos to form a very good working relationship," said Ed Gillespie, a spokesman for the House Republicans. "As Newt says, 'Armey put aside my ego, and I put aside Armey's.' "
As a public speaker, Mr. Armey appears less grandiose and less polished than Mr. Gingrich, but is more of an ideologue. And while Mr. Gingrich likes to theorize about the big picture -- renewing civilization, the future of the solar system -- Mr. Armey tends more toward the here and now. But their construct is the same: to transform the welfare state into what they call an opportunity society.
Although he is a central figure now in his party's establishment and was unchallenged for majority leader, Mr. Armey first came to Washington 10 years ago with the air of the citizen-legislator that the Republican contract promotes. Chairman of the economics department at North Texas State University in Denton, Tex., he was watching the House proceedings on C-Span one night in 1984 when he turned to his wife and said, "Honey, these people sound like a bunch of darn fools." She said, "Yeah, you could do that."
Beating the incumbent Democrat in his suburban Dallas district, Mr. Armey made news during his first term by sleeping on a cot in the House gym to save money. When evicted, he repaired to his office couch.
He now rents a house in Maryland, where he lives with his second wife, Susan. They have five grown children from previous marriages. He will use the limousine and driver that come with the job of majority leader only to get around Washington; to and from work, he will continue to drive his red pickup truck, which sports a "Jimmy Buffet for President" bumper sticker. He is an avid fisherman; among his angling companions is Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Mr. Thomas's wife, Virginia, is on Mr. Armey's staff.
The son of a grain dealer, Richard Keith Armey was born on July 7, 1940, and grew up in Cando, N.D. He was the first in his family to attend college, graduating from Jamestown College in Jamestown, N.D., and went on to earn an M.A. from the University of North Dakota and a Ph.D. in economics at the University of Oklahoma. He was raised in the Church of the Brethren and later became a Presbyterian. Today, he said, "I am officially Presbyterian, but I probably enjoy the Baptist Church more."
Like Mr. Gingrich, also a Baptist, he did not serve in the military. "I slotted in between Korea and Vietnam," Mr. Armey said. "I turned 18 in 1958 and registered in a small rural county in North Dakota. I never applied for a student deferment, but I ended up getting one. By the time I was 24, I had a wife and baby, and that was 1964. By that time, I think I was effectively out of the pool."
To Mr. Armey, America's chief problem is big government.
"Government is too big and in its excessive size does too much of the wrong thing in the wrong way," he said. "Fat weakens muscle." His most notable achievement as a legislator was writing a bill that depoliticized the process of shutting down obsolete military bases.
Although his role as majority leader requires him to represent his party, he makes no secret of his own conservative agenda.
During his first campaign in 1984, Mr. Armey pledged to phase out Social Security, still a long-term goal. And he wants to repeal the ban on assault weapons enacted as part of this year's crime bill, and the Brady law, which imposes a five-day delay on handgun purchases.
A strong opponent of abortion, he argued against including abortion coverage in any health care plan, saying, "Are we going to be so fem-centric that we're going to condone the self-indulgent conduct of the body of a woman who has already demonstrated" that she was "damned careless with it in the first place?"
He also favors amending the Constitution to allow for voluntary school prayer. In underscoring that prayer be voluntary, he said, "No child should be made to pray -- any more than a child should be made to sit through class with condom instruction."
He added, "We would like to experiment with prayer in schools now that we've had 30 years of your experiment with condom distribution."
Addressing the conservative meeting in Washington, Mr. Armey told the story of Charlie, a janitor he knew who was mentally retarded but kept his building clean and safe. When Congress increased the minimum wage "to make Charlie better off," Mr. Armey said, he was fired because his employer could not afford the higher wage. When Mr. Armey next saw him, Charlie was on welfare and using food stamps.
"That kind of compassion that beguiled the country into accepting a minimum wage and denied this man his dignity, his freedom and his fundamental, God-given right to work at a job commensurate with his abilities is very painful to watch," Mr. Armey said. "And I do not intend to watch that kind of misguided compassion during a Republican majority."

HEADLINE: Bethlehem Journal;
A City Prepares for Life After Steel

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BETHLEHEM, Pa., Dec. 2

 BODY:
This is a city of caldrons and creches, of blast furnace fires at the steel plant and twinkling holiday lights, of grit-coated factory windows and impeccably kept 200-year-old homes.
But the fires that shaped the backbone of American cityscapes -- the mighty I-beams that went into Rockefeller Center and the Citicorp building, the Golden Gate Bridge and the George Washington Bridge, the Supreme Court building in Washington and the new stadium in Cleveland -- will soon be extinguished. 
 "No more furnaces here," said Curtis H. Barnette, the chairman of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation.
Bethlehem and steel have long been intertwined, much as Kentucky and bourbon, Wisconsin and cheese, Winston-Salem and cigarettes. But come next year at this time, Bethlehem Steel will no longer make steel in Bethlehem; it will not make jumbo beams anywhere at all. Here it will shape smaller beams from steel imported from Steelton, Pa., but the company will turn most of its attention to steel it makes in Indiana for cars and in Maryland for ships.
Left behind in Bethlehem will be a huge industrial carcass, a monochromatic, rust-brown horizon of columns and pipes, brick walls and tin roofs that was doomed by competition and declining demand.
Left behind, too, will be thousands of people who worked at the plant, many of them descendants of those who have worked there since the furnaces were turned on 90 years ago.
For these people, making steel has been flesh-baking, often terrifying work. But it pays well; the steelworkers earn $30,000 to $100,000 a year. It is also gloriously proud and male work.
"You felt you were doing important things," said Gary Ward, the president of Local 2592 of the United Steelworkers of America. "We built the infrastructure of America."
Guillermo Lopez Jr., a millwright at the plant whose father also worked for Bethlehem Steel, said he had noticed a plaque on a wall at Madison Square Garden. It said the steel came from Bethlehem. "It made my hair stand up," he said.
Mr. Ward said: "We're not going to do that anymore. Imports are. Mini-mills are. Bethlehem is getting out of it. It doesn't make sense."
But Mr. Barnette said the demand for the jumbo beams was shrinking even as competitors, notably foreigners and efficient mini-mills that make steel from scrap, muscled into the market. The result, he said, is a plunge in the price he gets for beams, to $356 a ton from $475 a ton in 18 months. Losses there and from earlier struggles in the long-ailing American steel industry resulted in $2.2 billion in losses for Bethlehem Steel in the first four years of the 1990's. With the industry rebounding, Mr. Barnette said that this year, at last, he expects a small profit.
The chief remnant of Bethlehem Steel that will remain in Bethlehem will be the city's tallest building, the company's 21-story headquarters on the North Side. But even there, the company has retrenched. It has taken in boarders, renting half the space to other companies.
Most people here seem conditioned to the company's withdrawal. From a World War II peak of 31,600, employment has been ebbing for years, to 3,600 now. Elizabeth Kovach, a company spokeswoman, said it would drop to 1,900 next year, when the last furnace goes cold.
Mayor Kenneth Smith said: "The community has been through the worst of it. It was a great way to grow in the 20th century. I don't think we're ever going to have anything that strong again. But I'm very respectful of their current decisions."
Mayor Smith is a moderate Republican and 1961 graduate of Lehigh University, the only other institution of note among the multiethnic neighborhoods and church steeples on the South Side. With the demise of the jumbo beams, he harbors some hope for the less polluting, less hazardous production of jelly beans by Just Born, a thriving confectioner with more than 200 employees here.
Just Born and other new businesses, along with the university, the smaller Moravian College in the heart of the North Side, tourism and well-heeled settlers from New York and New Jersey, have given the economy enough lift that Mr. Smith expects Bethlehem Steel's latest contraction to reduce the city's tax revenue by just 2.8 percent, or $970,000, in 1996, the year after the shutdown.
Getting by is one thing, however; getting a new identity is another. "There are groups that want industry, groups that want tourism and festivals, groups that like the conservation aspect," Carl F. DiCello, the city's development director, said.
And there is another school of thought shared mostly by some North Side historic preservationists who consider the 20th-century intrusion of steelmaking a blot on the image of the older, Moravian Bethlehem of Christmas lights.
The conflict boiled over last month when the fellow in charge of maintaining the North Side's standards of 18th-century urban decor wrote a letter to the steelworkers union, whose locals occupy a quite pedestrian brick building on the North Side.
He asked the union to remove the bright red jumbo beam, about 30 feet long, that it installed a decade ago as a monument to its members' work. The ensuing brouhaha was overwhelmingly pro-beam, so the order was withdrawn. "The beam will stay," Mayor Smith said. "It's a symbol to many people of what their fathers and grandfathers had come here for."

HEADLINE: Fund Head Resigns in California

BYLINE: By SALLIE HOFMEISTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Under mounting pressure from state and county officials, Robert L. Citron, the manager of a public investment pool in Orange County, Calif., resigned as county treasurer after disclosing that his aggressive strategy caused $1.5 billion in potential losses for local governments, county officials announced today.
The announcement was made by Ernie Schneider, the chief administrative officer of Orange County, who also said the Securities and Exchange Commission had been gathering information during the weekend on the investment pool, made up of $7.8 billion from about 170 municipal agencies. 
 In Washington, Arthur Levitt Jr., the chairman of the S.E.C., said, "There is an ongoing investigation, and I can't comment on that."
The disclosure of Mr. Citron's resignation came at an emergency meeting of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, a panel of five elected officials who oversee the county government. Though the S.E.C. has little authority over county and state investment pools, which are not registered with the agency, it has the right to investigate whether any antifraud provisions of Federal securities laws have been violated.
In an unusually risky approach for a local government, Mr. Citron, who has been the county treasurer for 24 years, borrowed heavily to leverage the $7.8 billion in public funds into an investment portfolio valued at $20 billion.
For as much as a decade, Mr. Citron managed to generate returns of about 10 percent annually, in part by investing in volatile instruments known as derivatives, whose returns are linked to bonds, currencies and other securities and in this case were dependent on falling interest rates.
But the biggest problem this year was not the use of derivatives per se, but simply that Mr. Citron, using borrowed money, bet so heavily that interest rates would continue to fall.
When interest rates started rising in February, the fund's returns began to slide. And Mr. Citron was required to put up more cash as collateral to cover borrowings, leading to a liquidity problem that was disclosed last week.
The board of supervisors disclosed that management of the fund would be taken over by Matt Raabe, the county's assistant treasurer. In addition, Orange County last week hired Capital Market Risk Advisers Inc., a Wall Street advisory firm, which is scheduled to make recommendations by Dec. 15 about the best way to salvage the fund's losses.
In disclosing the resignation, the county released a letter from Mr. Citron. "After much thought and soul searching and with much regret, I have decided for the benefit of the county of Orange to resign from my elective office of Orange County treasurer-tax collector," he wrote. Mr. Citron has not made public comments since the loss was disclosed.
This week, Assemblyman Curt Pringle of Garden Grove in Orange County is expected to introduce state legislation that would restrict government officials from taking such risks with taxpayer money. It would also require that municipalities have a better sense of the value of their investments.
Separately, Moody's Investors Service said today that it was placing under review the ratings of the issuers that have funds invested in, or obligations secured by, the county's investment pool. Another credit rating agency, Standard & Poor's, put the county on its credit watch on Friday.
Some securities experts say the fund's losses boldly underline the need for tighter regulation of the municipal bond market. "This is a wake-up call to everyone in the muni market," said James Lynch of Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory in New York.
The S.E.C. chief disclosed that he had discussed the situation in Orange County with Gov. Pete Wilson of California. "I offered to work with his people in the state and to co-ordinate with the S.E.C. anything that he will be doing in the state," Mr. Levitt said.
He acknowledged that proving fraud could be difficult, particularly if the public agencies that invested in the fund did so willingly out of a desire to extract the largest possible return for their money.
The new Republican chairman of the House Banking Committee said today that he planned to look into the situation early next year after the Congress convenes.
"I expect a very serious review of the Orange County situation," said Representative Jim Leach of Iowa, who will take over as the committee's chairman in January. "These kinds of incidents underscore the need for public accountability."

HEADLINE: Bankers Trust and U.S. Set Pact On Disclosure of Derivatives' Risk

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
In the first big Government action against a seller of the financial instruments known as derivatives, the Federal Reserve Board said yesterday that it had reached a settlement with the Bankers Trust Company that requires the bank to increase the disclosure of risks its customers face.
At the same time, two other Federal agencies, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, are expected to reach a joint settlement against Bankers Trust in the next few weeks. 
 Taken together, these actions will substantially expand the Government oversight of derivatives, which are financial instruments with a value linked to the performance of an underlying asset or index, like a Government bond, a stock or an index of stocks. The outline of new requirements for Bankers Trust could become a de facto standard for the entire industry.
Under the new guidelines, Bankers Trust will have to detail the risks of certain volatile derivatives before they are bought. After the purchase, the bank has to report the value of those derivatives to the customer every day. Before yesterday, the bank made such information available only if it was requested by the customer.
The derivatives market, which until now has been largely unregulated, has made headlines all year because of the sharp losses attributed to these complex financial instruments.
As interest rates fell in 1992 and 1993, many companies, mutual funds and investors sought to profit from the surging bond market by using derivatives along with other financial innovations like mortgage-backed securities and reverse repurchase agreements, a form of leverage.
When rates rose sharply this spring, some of these investors found they did not fully understand the risks of their complex strategies. A fund managed by Orange County, Calif., faces losses of at least $1.5 billion because it borrowed money to invest, in part, in a volatile form of derivatives known as inverse floaters, bonds with an interest rate that declines as other rates go up.
Bankers Trust has been among the nation's most prominent dealers of derivatives. Several companies, which mainly use derivatives to reduce the interest cost on money they borrow, suffered major losses on derivative deals with Bankers Trust after rates rose. The bank has been sued by the Procter & Gamble Company and the Gibson Greetings Inc. It settled with Gibson last month in an agreement that was seen as a loss for the bank.
The Federal Reserve's action is called a written agreement, the second-strictest form of disciplinary action, which is rarely applied to the nation's largest banks. Unlike the more common memoranda of understanding, written agreements, which essentially are formal promises by the bank to take certain actions, are made public and can be enforced in court.
In choosing a strong and public response, the Fed appears to be signalling that it has found disturbing practices at Bankers Trust, though it did not detail any specific rule violations in the agreement. The Fed also seems to be asserting that it has the power and the will to supervise derivatives activity of banks without new legislation covering the market from Congress.
"They want to send a message that there is no legislation needed, so they need to act in a determined way," said Michael Bradfield, former counsel to the Federal Reserve Board and now a lawyer with Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue in Washington.
Representative Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican who is set to become chairman of the House Banking Committee, praised the Federal Reserve's action.
"What's been established is a new standard for industry practices that by contract applies to Bankers Trust, but, in effect, could well apply to all banks and potentially all market participants," said Mr. Leach, who has proposed legislation of his own to establish a new derivatives regulatory agency.
The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are negotiating a joint consent agreement with Bankers Trust, people familiar with those negotiations said. Such an agreement would probably include a promise by the bank to follow certain practices, similar to its agreement with the Fed. It may also agree to pay a fine.
Officials of both regulatory commissions declined to comment on any actions related to Bankers Trust. A Bankers Trust spokesman said the bank is cooperating with regulatory investigations, but declined to comment further.
It remains unclear, however, how much effect the new Government interest in derivatives will have on the business and whether the Government will choose to go further. Bankers Trust agreed to a variety of rules for improved disclosure related to the risks of derivatives, but it was not forced to pull back from any part of the market.
Charles S. Sanford, the chairman of Bankers Trust, said in an interview that the bank had decided to adopt more stringent standards to prevent further lawsuits by clients.
"No one ever likes to have dissatisfied customers," he said. "We don't think we did anything wrong before, but we are saying 'let's make sure we don't have any misunderstandings.' "
Still, all the agencies are taking a tougher stance than they did earlier this year, when they said the existing regulatory oversight of the derivative market was enough.
Mary L. Shapiro, chairwoman of the commodity futures commission, said today that the agency was reviewing the broad exemption it granted two years ago to swaps, the most common form of derivative. The agency is considering if it should regulate more closely derivatives activities by smaller institutions, municipalities or mutual funds.
Similarly, the S.E.C. appears close to asserting that some forms of derivatives are securities and therefore fall under its jurisdiction. Derivative dealers have argued that derivatives are private negotiated contracts with customers, not securities, which are defined as standardized financial instruments that can be easily traded.
In addition, the two commissions are negotiating with each other to divide the jurisdiction of derivatives between the two agencies, people familiar with those discussions said.
The Bankers Trust agreement with the Fed only applies to what the agreement calls leveraged derivatives, which are contracts that rise or fall in value at a more rapid rate than the underlying market. Leverage is used to take more risk in search of higher reward from investments. Bankers Trust said that at its peak, about 5 percent of its revenues came from such leveraged derivatives. Last year, about a third of the bank's profits came from all forms of derivatives.
The agreement represents a shift by Bankers Trust. When clients began complaining earlier this year, the bank in effect called them sore losers because they had bet incorrectly that interest rates would not rise. While the bank still insists that its descriptions of the terms of its deals were legally sufficient, it now says it needs to do more.
Under its agreement with the Fed, Bankers Trust said it would try to make sure its customers understand the nature and risks of any leveraged-derivative deal, providing each client with a long list of disclosure information. In the past, it only provided some information on request.
Similarly, for some of the most volatile derivative deals, Bankers Trust said it would now tell clients what their positions were worth each day instead of waiting for the customer to ask for that information.
Bankers Trust also agreed to several steps to improve its internal training, supervision and controls on leveraged derivatives. The bank has suspended six employees it says violated internal rules in connection with selling leveraged derivatives. In the agreement yesterday, it said it would notify the Fed if it returned these employees to their previous duties.
Gibson, Procter & Gamble and other customers have complained that their positions dropped in value farther and faster than they thought possible and that by the time they found out that they were losing money, it was too late to take action.
Bank stock analysts suggested that these restrictions, in fact, may not hurt Bankers Trust, in particular because all companies will be forced to follow them.
But some swap dealers complained that the rules are too tough and said that other banks would not comply unless forced.

HEADLINE: Union Official at Javits Center Is Accused of Having Mob Ties

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
In his first move to clean up the corruption that officials say has driven business away from the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, a special investigator yesterday accused a carpenters' union official of being a Mafia family's "acting agent" at the center.
The investigator, Kenneth Conboy, filed administrative charges to remove the official, Anthony D. Fiorini, the union's top representative at the center, on the grounds that he aided the Genovese crime family in its activities at the center for more than three years. While not specifying how Mr. Fiorini is to have helped the crime group, Mr. Conboy suggested that he had helped Mafia members and their associates find jobs at the center while discriminating against carpenters' union members. 
 Exhibitors have complained about shakedowns and excessive labor costs in dealing with the carpenters and other unions at the glass-enclosed center ever since it opened in 1986 as the city's major site for trade shows and fairs. In part because of the center's high labor bills, many trade-show organizers say they have moved their exhibitions to other cities -- a trend that tourism officials say has drained millions of dollars from New York's economy.
Aides to Mr. Conboy described yesterday's action as just the opening shot in a broad investigation into possible corruption in the carpenters' union, both at the Javits Center and elsewhere.
Mr. Conboy, a former Federal judge in Manhattan, also charged that Mr. Fiorini in 1984 and 1985 had physically threatened a union member who complained about illegal practices by union officials and had allowed a contractor to hire nonunion employees in violation of the union's collective bargaining contract.
Under a court order, Mr. Conboy was appointed in March to monitor the activities in the 30,000-member New York District Council of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners. His assignment was part of a settlement of a Federal civil racketeering suit brought against officials of the union in 1990 by the Justice Department. At that time, Federal prosecutors in Manhattan described the Javits Center as a hiring hall for mobsters and former convicts.
Mr. Fiorini, 34, who is the district council's representative at the Javits Center, did not return two telephone messages left for him yesterday at his office in the center at 34th Street and 11th Avenue.
Frederick W. Devine, the president of the district council, described Mr. Conboy's investigation as "a witch hunt by someone who is trying make a name for himself on the union dues of members." The court agreement requires the district council and the carpenters' international union to pay Mr. Conboy and his staff $80,000 a month until March 1997.
Mr. Devine said in an interview that Mr. Conboy had raised no objection to Mr. Fiorini's appointment in April when he notified him of his intention.
In a report in October, Mr. Conboy said the day-to-day hiring decisions at the center for some 100 carpenters who install and dismantle exhibits were made by Mr. Fiorini and Lenard J. Simon. Mr. Conboy asserted that both men had little experience as carpenters but had extensive connections to mobsters.
According to the report, Mr. Fiorini is a brother-in-law of Liborio Bellomo, the street boss of the Genovese crime family, and Mr. Simon is a brother-in-law of Ralph Coppola, a convicted arsonist with mob ties.
Mr. Devine said that Mr. Simon's job as a union representative ended in October after he helped negotiate a collective bargaining agreement with the center's management.
Mr. Conboy in his charges yesterday said that Mr. Fiorini referred "a small pool of favored individuals" for lucrative carpenter jobs at the center.
The complaint said that Mr. Fiorini since August 1991 was "the acting agent of the Genovese organized crime family of La Cosa Nostra at the Javits Center, and knowingly associated with members and associates of the Genovese crime family and other families of La Cosa Nostra, including Liborio (Barney) Bellomo and Ralph Coppola."
Asked about the charges that Mr. Fiorini was linked to organized-crime figures, Mr. Devine said, "If Conboy has proof he's a member of organized crime, why doesn't he take it to a government agency for prosecution?"
An administrative or civil hearing for Mr. Fiorini was set for Feb. 1. Mr. Conboy will in effect act as the prosecutor, and the charges will be heard by a three-member panel. The panel will consist of one member designated by Mr. Conboy and one by Mr. Fiorini, with those two appointees selecting the third.
The most stringent penalty the panel can impose is the expulsion of Mr. Fiorini from the union. Or it could recommend his removal as a union official.
Any action the panel takes can be appealed by Mr. Fiorini to Charles S. Haight Jr., the Federal District Court Judge in Manhattan, who approved the settlement between the union and the Justice Department.
Mr. Fiorini can remain in his post at the center until the charges are resolved.

HEADLINE: El Salvador Suffers Split Among Left

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN SALVADOR, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Five years ago, the Salvadoran guerrilla movement carried out a military offensive with such discipline and organization that it ultimately forced the Government to accept many of its demands.
But in its new incarnation as a political party, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front has become so splintered by animosities and differences over fundamental goals that it seems unlikely to survive the peace, many of its most important leaders say. 
 While the front's leaders squabble and much of its membership loses heart, its opponents on the right retain control of the Government and now find themselves in position to whittle away at the agreements made to end the war.
"There no longer is a Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front," said Joaquin Villalobos, leader of one of the five leftist rebel groups that came together to form the front in the early 1980's.
Facundo Guardado, a renowned guerrilla commander and now a prominent member of another group, said, "We are people who shared something that is over."
To end the civil war, the Salvadoran Government, under pressure from the United States, its principal supporter, agreed to a number of fundamental reforms in peace accords that took effect in 1992. The guerrillas then turned in their weapons in exchange for promises that they could take part in electoral politics.
It was in the transition from a rebel coalition to a political party that the former guerrillas seem to have foundered.
While the coalition always presented itself as unified, its leaders now say that it was a common enemy rather than shared ideology that held it together.
The divisions became evident in the election campaign this year. A dispirited and disorganized left saw the rightist Nationalist Republican Alliance, or Arena, retain control of the presidency and legislature and increase its number of local offices. The center party, the Christian Democrats, also lost heavily, leaving the right with much more power than before.
In trying to regroup, the left has not been able to agree on political or economic programs. The former guerrilla commander, Mr. Villalobos, now completely rejects socialism and is trying to take his group into a coalition with center and even rightist organizations.
One of the other groups retains the name Salvadoran Communist Party, and looks forward to making the government socialist. In between the extremes, other former rebels admit that they are still searching for policies on which they can agree, and which will be acceptable to voters.
The conflict within the Salvadoran left mirrors the turmoil in the left throughout Central America as socialism and rigid party structures are called into question.
In Guatemala, leaders of the region's remaining armed insurgency are negotiating a peace with the Government after three decades of war. In Nicaragua, the Sandinista party is staggering with a conflict between hard-liners like former President Daniel Ortega Saavedra and reformers.
In El Salvador, the debate has become quite personal, with leaders of the groups calling each other traitors to the causes for which they fought during the war.
Many members of the Marti Front find it frustrating that having achieved such profound changes in El Salvador's political system, the front is now in too much disarray to take advantage of them.
Looking back over what they achieved in the negotiations ending the civil war, Mr. Guardado said: "We forced the military out of politics. We've started agrarian reform. We made them reform the Constitution, the police, the judicial system, and even make elections much more fair."
But, he added, all of this is still incomplete, and could be reversed because, as he put it, "the left has come apart."
In coming apart, the Marti Front has left many angry dissidents who assert that while leftist leaders quarrel, Arena will be able to undo the reforms it accepted when it was confronted by a rebel army.
"Arena only gave in because it was forced to by a powerful left," said Horacio Castellanos, the editor of a new newspaper staffed in part by former members of the Marti Front.
"Now that the political opposition is tearing itself to pieces, there is very little outside control over Arena," Mr. Castellanos said.
Indeed, influential members of Arena contend that it is resistance from the less extreme members of the party, rather than pressure from the left, that is obliging the Government to honor the promises that ended the war.

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday amid revived investor concern over continuing strong growth that could accelerate inflation. Municipal bond prices outperformed government securities despite the potential $1.5 billion loss reported last week by Orange County, Calif.
The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell about 6/32 to 95 7/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 7.92 percent from 7.91 percent on Friday. 
 A report that showed a 1.3 percent surge in the sales of new homes in October weighed down Government securities. The Commerce Department report suggested that six increases in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve have not pushed mortgage rates high enough to slow the housing industry.
Prices of short-term Treasury bills fell sharply yesterday in anticipation of an interest rate increase. Bill rates were up an average 15 basis points in secondary market trading. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
At its regular weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills, the Treasury saw rates jump to their highest levels since early 1991.
In the municipal market, analysts continued to weigh the impact of the Orange County investment fund's troubles. Yesterday's trading offered few clues.
Robert J. Froehlich, director of research at Van Kampen & Merritt, said the market was waiting for more details to be released after an emergency meeting of the county's board of supervisors .
Late yesterday, the resignation of the Orange County treasurer, Robert L. Citron, was announced.
Mr. Froehlich noted that so far the two largest participants in the county's investment fund, the transportation and water agencies, have both agreed to stay in the fund. "If there is a mass defection," he said, "then those paper losses will turn to actual losses." The county's $7.8 billion investment pool represents contributions from 170 municipal agencies.
Of the $7.8 billion, approximately $4.7 billion is from Orange County agencies required to invest their money with the treasurer, including the school districts. The remaining $3.1 billion is from voluntary or "discretionary" investors, including the county transportation, toll road and sanitation agencies, as well as cities like Irvine and Huntington Beach. The money borrowed by the school districts is also part of the discretionary portion.
James Lynch of the Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory, said: "Right now potential sellers of these bonds will hesitate to sell because they don't know how it will all unfold and are afraid they will sell too cheap. Buyers hesitated because they want to be sure they are buying at the lowest price."
Peter B. Coffin, head of an investment advisory firm with the same name in Boston, said there was not a lot of activity for Orange County bonds, but he said the situation could give many retail traders an excuse to sell other issues.
Elsewhere, traders said South Africa was expected to sell its first post-apartheid bond issue in international markets early this week.
The Government plans to sell $500 million in five-year global notes through a group led by two investment banks, Goldman, Sachs & Company and the Swiss Bank Corporation.
The following are the results of yesterday's three-month and six-month bill auction:

HEADLINE: Light Trucks' Sales Lift Auto Makers' Records

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 5

 BODY:
The sound of breaking records has itself become something of a broken record in Motown, as, month after month, sales of light trucks have topped past performances.
November was no exception, the auto makers reported today. All three domestic auto makers set November records for sales of pickups, mini-vans, and sport utility vehicles. The General Motors Corporation sold 167,687 light trucks in the United States during the month -- 13 percent more than its previous record November, which was in 1978. 
 With one month to go in 1994, the auto makers have already sold more trucks than they sold in all of 1993. And several auto makers, including the Honda Motor Company and the Nissan Motor Corporation, reported that they had already surpassed their total 1993 sales of cars and trucks.
For the industry, sales climbed 5.4 percent over a strong November last year, to 1.16 million. While car sales edged up 1.4 percent, to 665,187, light truck sales rose 11.2 percent, to 501,428.
In sum, the auto makers appeared on track to sell more than 15 million vehicles this year, for the first time since 1988, when they sold 15.5 million. In 1993, they sold 13.9 million. The industry's best sales year was 1986 when it sold more than 16 million cars and light-trucks.
"Sales were better than we thought," said David M. Garrity, auto industry analyst for Smith Barney in New York. "I was very much impressed with what the Big Three were able to do."
In particular, Mr. Garrity said, he had expected G.M. to suffer in the month because of truck shortages. That it did not, he said, may indicate that G.M. has worked out some of the components-supply problems that have been dogging it.
Not that dealers are happy with their inventories. Indeed, the auto industry's second-ranked broken record for 1994 would have to be dealers' lamentations on this subject. "We can't get enough to sell," said Tom Ward, general sales manager at Main Motor Sales in Anoka, Minn. "It's not just me, either. There's a shortage in general, and more buyers than product."
Mr. Ward sells Cadillacs, Geos, and Chevrolets. He said he has not received a single 1995 Cavalier subcompact in two months, and he usually sells up to 15 of them monthly. G.M. has had trouble increasing production at the Lordstown, Ohio, plant that makes the car.
But, he said, the shortages have helped him sell some cars customers normally spurn, like Chevy's rear-wheel-drive Caprice sedan.
But some dealers worried that interest rates were beginning to bite into sales. "Truck sales are up, but the interest-rate increase hurt our new-car sales," said Glenn Gardner, vice president and general manager of Rice & Holman Ford in Mount Laurel, N.J. "They started strong, but new car sales went soft in the last two weeks of the month," after the Fed raised short-term interest rates by three-quarters of a point.
Industry officials and analysts remained divided on the effect of rising interest rates.
Thomas J. Osborn, the director of sales and marketing operations planning for the Chrysler Corporation, said that rates would have to climb much higher, perhaps into the teens, before they would begin to cut into sales. But Joel Pitcoff, the Ford Motor Company's market analysis manager, said that some people might be buying now to avoid paying higher rates later.
"Some of the apparent strength may be pull-ahead from people who expect interest rates to continue to go up," Mr. Pitcoff said.
Mr. Garrity argued that banks' eagerness to make loans would cause them to continue offering good deals to consumers, like letting them borrow with less money down. Further, he pointed out, consumer confidence, like the employment rate, remains strong.
The seasonally adjusted selling rate for all cars in the month was 8.9 million, compared to 8.7 million in November a year ago, and 8.8 million in October. The rate for trucks was 6.6 million, compared to 5.9 last year, and 6.5 in October.
Ford said today that it intended to continue reporting sales on the third working day of the month. G.M. has announced that, starting Feb. 1, it would report sales on the first day of the month, and Chrysler has said it would follow G.M.'s lead.

HEADLINE: THE NEEDIEST CASES;
Finding Rent Help After Brain Surgery

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
Two brain surgeries saved Joyce B.'s life. Nothing, it seemed, could stave off her brush with financial ruin.
With a steady job, health insurance and grown children and friends for support, Ms. B. was in as good a position as any to confront her illness when it struck. But even before she had fully recovered from her second operation, she was thousands of dollars in debt and facing an eviction notice. 
 Her case, though bleak, is not uncommon, charity officials say. For many regular New Yorkers with regular jobs, the loss of income due to illness often means wrenching financial hardship.
In July 1993, Ms. B., 52, a widow with two children, went to her doctor complaining of excruciating headaches. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an aneurysm on the left side of her brain. Further tests revealed a second one deeper in her brain.
Needing major surgery, she took a disability leave from her job as an assistant payroll manager at the Lord & Taylor department store on Fifth Avenue. Doctors at New York Hospital corrected the first aneurysm but were unable to reach the second. In October, she flew to Miami, where doctors at Jackson Memorial Hospital finished the job.
Until the second operation, Ms. B. had managed to survive on the twice-monthly state disability checks that amounted to barely a third of her salary. "I managed to maintain things up until October," she said. "That's when things started backing up on me."
Though insurance paid more than $50,000 for her operations, it did not cover other expenses, like X-rays and air fare to the hospital in Florida, which left her in debt. Her children helped pay the phone and utility bills, but the rent on her apartment in Corona, Queens, was left to her.
She had fallen three months behind when the first eviction notice came last December, just after she returned to work. "It came before I really put myself back together," she said.
She went to court to delay her eviction and then turned to friends for help in paying her creditors.
"My friends gave me enough to satisfy them," she said. "But I was already in arrears and I had to worry about that and about paying back my friends." Ms. B. applied for government help, but her salary made her ineligible.
She struggled for another six months. Last July, nearly overcome with hopelessness, she called the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of the charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. "To be honest, I didn't think there would be anybody out there to help me," she said. "But I was at the point of desperation. I thought I would ask, and if they said no, they said no."
She reached Judith Milone, who handles rent-assistance appeals for the federation. "Her situation was so compelling, to have gone through two brain surgeries," Ms. Milone said. "But she is really quite typical. Most of the people we help are working people who lose time at work either because of illness or stretches of unemployment." Ms. Milone asked Ms. B. to submit proof of her situation.
"Taking to Judy on the phone gave me a glimmer of hope," Ms. B. said. "And sure enough, it came through." A few weeks later, Ms. B. picked up a check for $830, enough to cover one month's rent and to give her time to get back on her feet.
"I have so much to be grateful for," she said. "After going through these two surgeries and surviving and then to seek help and be provided with it. We have a tendency to take so many things for granted. I had never been put in a situation like this before."
Ms. B. is still struggling to keep up with the rent and pay all of her debts, but she said she has a new-found optimism knowing that there are people willing to help. The Neediest Cases Fund collects donations for seven organizations that benefit struggling New Yorkers. The Times pays all the costs of running the appeal, now in its 83d year, so all contributions go directly to the charities.
Ms. Milone said she hopes Ms. B. gives New Yorkers the courage to ask for assistance. "I hope her story encourages other people to seek out the help they legitimately need," she said.

HEADLINE: Pension Gap Increases to $71 Billion

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
The shortfall in money that companies set aside to pay for Americans' pensions climbed to $71 billion last year.
"Millions of Americans still are in danger of not getting their pensions," Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said today. "Underfunding has gone up to $71 billion from $53 billion in 1992 and $27 billion in 1987." 
 The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation said underfinanced single-employer pension plans at the end of 1993 had assets of just $316 billion to pay $387 billion in benefits.
The announcement came just four days after Congress approved legislation requiring companies with pension deficits to reduce their underfinancing by more than two-thirds within 15 years. Mr. Reich said President Clinton would sign the bill on Thursday.
"This is not yet a crisis," Mr. Reich said of the gap. "But if it had not been addressed, somewhere down the line it would have been another savings and loan crisis."
"With Congressional passage of the Administration's pension reforms, we can now begin to reverse the trend that posed a risk to workers and retirees, the pension insurance program and, ultimately, American taxpayers," he said.
Officials emphasized that the vast majority of plans covered by the guaranty corporation were fully financed, with assets of $603 billion to cover $518 billion in benefits.
But Mr. Reich, who is chairman of the Pension Benefit board of directors, said underfinancing is a serious problem affecting nearly eight million workers and retirees, primarily in the steel, auto, tire and airline industries.
About 75 percent of the underfinanced plans are sponsored by financially healthy companies, the agency said. But about $18 billion of the underfinancing is in plans covering about 1.2 million people that are sponsored by businesses with below- investment-grade bond ratings.
People in underfinanced plans are at risk because the Pension Benefit coverage is limited to just $30,681.84 this year, often less than the benefit promised. The annually adjusted payment will be $30,886.32 next year.
The agency said most of increase in underfinancing in 1993 was a result of low interest rates, which reduced pension plan earnings. But it added that even if rates had not fallen, underfinancing, which has grown over the last decade, would not have improved significantly.
"Pension underfunding has been chronic and persistent and will not go away by itself," said Martin Slate, the agency's executive director.
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation guarantees basic pension benefits of 41 million American workers and retirees participating in about 66,000 plans.

HEADLINE: Sales of New Homes Rose 1.3% in October

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Despite higher borrowing costs, sales of new homes rose 1.3 percent in October, their fourth consecutive monthly increase, the Commerce Department said today.
The strong gain in sales, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 726,000, surprised many analysts who had expected a decline in sales. 
 Today's report included an upward revision in the September sales figure, to a 5.6 percent jump and a rate of 717,000. Previously, the Commerce Department said September sales had risen just 2.6 percent, to a rate of 703,000.
The report provided further evidence that the economy continues to be robust, defying efforts by the Federal Reserve to rein in growth with higher short-term interest rates.
"It suggests that the national economy is doing very well and that overall improvements in the economy are offsetting higher interest rates," said Michael Carliner, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders.
The new-homes sales report said the only region where fewer homes were sold in October than in September was the Northeast, where they plunged 33 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 63,000. The Northeast is the smallest market of the four principal regions for which sales figures are compiled.
By contrast, sales jumped in the West by 14.4 percent in October, to a rate of 230,000 a year. In the Midwest, sales of new homes rose 8.3 percent, to a rate of 117,000, and in the South they gained three-tenths of 1 percent, to a rate of 316,000.
The pattern of strong sales for new homes was the same as for existing homes. The National Realtors Association said a week ago that sales of existing homes gained five-tenths of 1 percent in October, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.91 million.
The gains in housing, however, "won't continue indefinitely," Mr. Carliner of the builders' trade group said. "The trend from now on will be downward."
The housing market has shown great resilience in the face of the Fed's six increases in short-term interest rates this year. The increases have sharply pushed up mortgage rates.
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said the average rate for a 30-year mortgage loan last week was 9.23 percent, down slightly from 9.25 percent a week earlier but still much higher than a year ago, when rates were below 7 percent.
Housing prices, however, have not accelerated.
The average sales price in October was down to $151,600 from $154,700 in September. The median sales price, at which half the homes sold were cheaper and half were more expensive, rose modestly to $130,500 from $129,300.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gasoline Prices Off on Signs A Cleaner Grade Won't Sell

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Gasoline prices fell again yesterday on concern that areas that had volunteered to use a cleaner grade of gasoline would balk at the higher costs.
Silver and lumber also declined, pushing the Commodity Research Bureau index down 0.68 point, to 227.03, a five-month low. 
 The Energy Department estimates that reformulated gasoline will cost at least 5 cents to 7 cents more a gallon than the usual grades.
So far, 28 counties in Pennsylvania and one in New York that had volunteered to use reformulated gasoline starting Jan. 1 now say they can meet air-quality standards without the new fuel, and traders are concerned more counties will follow.
"It's the uncertainty that hurts the markets," said Tom Knight, director manager of East Coast products trading at the Fina Oil and Chemical Company. "Who's to say in the anti-tax environment in the Northeast that this won't spread?"
Gasoline for January delivery fell 1.25 cents, to 49.36 cents a gallon, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. So far, gasoline is down 12.5 percent over the last three trading sessions.
January crude oil fell 14 cents, to $16.85 a barrel, an 11-week low, while January heating oil gained 0.01 cent, to 47.01 cents a gallon.
On other commodity markets, silver dropped to a 12-month low as higher interest rates appear to be keeping inflation low and choking off demand from investors. Silver for March delivery fell 12 cents, to $4.645 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange, while February gold was unchanged at $379 an ounce.
Precious metals rallied in September amid concern that a stronger American economy would generate inflation. Since then, silver prices have fallen 19 percent as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to slow growth and as inflation failed to pick up.
Elsewhere, lumber fell its daily trading limit amid concern that rising interest rates will push up mortgage costs, slowing demand for new homes. Lumber for January delivery fell $10 to $317 for 1,000 board feet on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Mortgage rates are currently at their highest in three years, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage from Freddie Mac at 9.23 percent last week.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
From the optimists' ball, a consensus that happy days are indeed ahead.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
AN increasingly optimistic outlook for growth in advertising spending brightened even further yesterday as two leading industry forecasters presented rosy predictions for 1995 and beyond.
At the opening session of the 22d annual Paine Webber media conference, Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at McCann-Erickson U.S.A. in New York, and John Perriss, chairman at Zenith Media Worldwide in London, increased their projections for total advertising spending in the United States and overseas. 
 The changes, which included higher final estimates for 1994 ad spending, reinforced data from the last nine months indicating that Madison Avenue's five years of recession might finally be ending.
"The economic climate will be very good for advertising again," Mr. Coen told an audience at the McGraw-Hill Building in Manhattan, because "there's a widening and broadening of demand across a lot of marketing categories" like appliances, automobiles, cigarettes, furniture and packaged foods.
"I am now convinced we are back on track," he added, "and advertising will grow faster than the economy for a decade." As one reason for his confidence, he cited signs that short-term promotional spending -- temporary retail price cuts, for instance -- was "drying up" in favor of long-term traditional ad spending.
And Mr. Perriss said: "Everywhere in the world we see key indicators, with one or two exceptions, moving favorably to advertising. I have been very pleasantly surprised."
The forecasts come after spending increases by big advertisers in fields like consumer electronics, drugs and computers, as well as robust revenue gains among national media like network television and magazines, and increases in classified-ad linage in local newspapers.
Advertising results are "going in the right direction and for the right reasons," said Alan J. Gottesman, the Paine Webber analyst who is the host of the media conference, which continues through Friday. "And it's going to be sustained," he added, referring to the strong growth.
The presentations by Mr. Coen and Mr. Perriss echoed each other -- something that was significant because Mr. Perriss usually sees the glass as half-empty while Mr. Coen sees it as half-full (or even three-quarters.)
"This is an historic year," Mr. Perriss said, laughing. "For the first time ever, I'm in danger of being more bullish than Bob Coen."
Mr. Coen for the second time increased his 1994 estimate for ad spending in the United States, to $149 billion, up 7.9 percent from $138.1 billion in 1993. In June he estimated 1994 domestic ad spending at $148 billion, and last December, at $146.8 billion.
National ad spending in large media outlets, Mr. Coen said, would end the year up 9.6 percent, compared with an increase in the projected gross domestic product of perhaps 6 percent. That would represent the largest such outpacing of economic growth by ad spending since 1982.
For 1995, he said, ad spending in the United States would total $159 billion, up 6.7 percent from his most recent 1994 estimate of $149 billion. In June, he forecast that 1995 ad spending would total $157.7 billion.
For 1994 ad spending overseas, Mr. Coen estimated a figure of $172.9 billion, up 7.2 percent from $161.3 billion in 1993. That would result in total worldwide spending this year of $321.9 billion, up 7.5 percent from $299.4 billion last year.
For 1995, Mr. Coen estimated ad spending overseas at $186.7 billion, up almost 8 percent from his most recent 1994 estimate of $172.9 billion; in June, his forecast for 1995 was $181.9 billion.
All this would result in total worldwide ad spending next year of $345.7 billion, up 7.4 percent from his recent 1994 estimate of $321.9 billion.
Mr. Perriss, who heads Zenith, the media services division of Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C., said his prediction for worldwide spending growth in 1994 represented his "most bullish forecast since 1988." He predicted a gain in major media of 6.4 percent, compared with the gain of 5.5 percent he forecast in July. (Mr. Perriss, like Mr. Coen, makes forecasts twice a year.)
And as long as Western nations are "determined to control inflation," Mr. Perriss added, "there is a growing optimism for world 'ad-spend,' a trend that continues through to 1997."
Declines in spending for advertising in Japan have bottomed out this year, he said, and spending next year in countries like China, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Ireland and Singapore should remain strong. Mr. Perriss mentioned Central and Eastern Europe, Latin America and Southeast Asia as areas of expected strong year-to-year gains over the next three years.
In the United States, according to Mr. Perriss, ad spending for major media will grow 4.7 percent in 1995 and 5.4 percent in 1996.

HEADLINE: Companies Rediscovering Indonesia

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia

 BODY:
General Motors is back in Indonesia, selling the Opel Vectra sedan made at its new assembly plant outside Jakarta, the first G.M. plant in Southeast Asia.
G.M. is one of many American companies that have discovered or rediscovered Indonesia, lured by the prospect of its 5 to 7 percent economic growth, abundant natural resources and a population of 200 million, the world's fourth largest. 
 The company first entered what is now Indonesia in 1930 and by the early 1960's controlled more than 40 percent of its modest automobile market. Then, in 1964, as Indonesia swung politically leftward, the auto maker and other American companies were forced to leave the country. Now it is starting over in a nation in which about 90 percent of the vehicles are Japanese.
"It's very easy to give up market share, but you pay in blood to get it back," said Leonard L. Brownfield, the president of the General Motors Indonesian venture. But he said G.M. had no choice but to come back. "It's not hard to see where all the hot economies are," he said.
Indonesia's commercial prospects were highlighted when President Clinton and Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, here to attend an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting, announced on Nov. 16 the signing of 17 agreements involving about $40 billion worth of business for American companies in Indonesia. The United States Government has also designated Indonesia as one of 10 big emerging markets for promoting American exports.
Big energy projects and the development of transportation and communications represent particular short-term opportunities for investors. In the largest agreement announced during President Clinton's visit, Exxon will join Pertamina, the Indonesian national oil company, in developing a huge offshore natural gas field. Exxon's investment could exceed $35 billion.
Other American companies are aiming at Indonesia's emerging middle class of consumers. While they represent only 10 percent of the population, that is still more people than live in Australia.
Citibank recently opened the first drive-up automated teller machine in Indonesia. Amway has begun to peddle perfume and honey-glycerine soap. A crowded McDonald's in central Jakarta operates 24 hours a day. Procter & Gamble, Avon and Levi Strauss are also doing business here.
Indonesia, once chary of foreign investment, is now worried about losing out to China, Vietnam and other countries. So the Government has been gradually liberalizing laws that severely restricted foreign investment and imports. In June, it allowed foreign companies to own 100 percent of their businesses in Indonesia for the first 15 years. Previously, most foreign ventures required an Indonesian partner.
The list of other activities closed to foreigners is shrinking. In June, foreign companies were finally allowed to engage in the business of providing roads, telecommunications networks, ports and other public works. Still, enough restrictions remain to make Indonesia a daunting place to do business. For example, foreigners are not allowed to own retail stores. And Amway is hampered by a law that requires police permits for any gathering of five or more people. The company holds 1,200 such meetings a month with distributors and customers
Corruption is also said to be commonplace in Indonesia. Some American business executives say the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act passed by Congress, which prohibits American companies from paying bribes, has put them at a disadvantage in winning contracts. During Secretary Brown's visit, an American lawyer said he was involved in three cases in which American telecommunications companies had to pass up joining multinational consortiums because of the act's restrictions.
Indonesia's economy was dominated until recently by the petroleum industry, in which American companies like Mobil, Atlantic Richfield and Caltex, a joint venture of Chevron and Texaco, have long been active. And since 1967, Freeport- McMoran of New Orleans has extracted copper and gold from one of the world's largest mining operations in Irian Jaya.
But outside natural resources, American businesses have not been that active in Indonesia, though the ban on their activities here was lifted in 1967 after President Suharto took power.
"Indonesia for some reason has not been discovered by the American public and the business community," said Louis A. Clinton, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia and head of Freeport-McMoran's activities here.
Japan has been the most active investor in the manufacturing and consumer sectors. Indonesia is the largest recipient of Japanese foreign aid, receiving $1.15 billion in 1993. Much of that is thought to go toward contracts with Japanese companies. By contrast, American foreign aid to Indonesia amounted to only $94 million last year.
From 1967 through 1993, Indonesia's Government approved a total of $13.6 billion in direct foreign investment by Japanese companies. The next largest investor was Hong Kong, at $5.5 billion. Total investment approved from American companies was $3.3 billion.
These statistics from Indonesia's Investment Coordinating Board, however, do not reveal the extent of American investments because they omit sectors like oil and natural gas or banking. Moreover, analysts say only about 30 percent of approved investments are actually made.
But American investment in Indonesia is rising. Approved investment rose from $154 million in 1990 to $922 million in 1992 before falling back to $445 million last year.
Major opportunities lie in road building, electric power and telecommunications and other projects. Indonesia plans to spend more than $50 billion on these projects by the end of the decade.
The General Electric Company and Mission Energy, an affiliate of the SCE Corporation, are among the partners in a company that will build Indonesia's first privately owned power plant. California Energy will build, own and operate a geothermal energy power plant.
In telecommunications, AT&T already makes digital switches in Indonesia. Nynex, Bell Atlantic, Motorola and GM Hughes Electronics are working on other deals ranging from wireless to more conventional telephone services. With fewer than 2 phone lines per 100 people, one of the lowest ratios in Southeast Asia, Indonesia expects to install millions of lines by the end of the decade.
The public works projects and other expansion also provide opportunities for construction companies like Fluor Daniel Inc. of Irvine, Calif., which has been in Indonesia for nearly 25 years. And Indonesia has become a low-cost manufacturing base for shoemakers like Reebok and for the toy maker Mattel.
American banks and other financial institutions can benefit from the huge need for the financing of such projects. Maarten J. Hulshoff, chief executive and general manager of Citibank Indonesia, said all his bank's customers were "seriously planning to at least double capacity in the next three years -- you can understand what that means for the banking business."
In the automobile industry, car imports, which were banned until 1992, are now allowed, but with tariffs of 200 percent. An assembly plant is required for auto makers to compete in Indonesia, so they have set up 16 automobile plants to serve a market that can afford about 300,000 vehicles, an amount that one plant could produce.
And various Indonesian taxes, like import duties and luxury taxes, keep prices high. The Opel Vectra that General Motors began selling last week has a base price of about $45,000, twice its price in Europe.
Americans doing business here warn that Indonesia's commercial laws are not yet fully in place, which makes lobbying and personal contacts essential.
Sometimes those relationship reach up to the top. President Suharto's children control vast business empires that win many big Government contracts. American companies often end up with these companies as partners. Waste Management Inc. operates a chemical waste treatment and disposal site in partnership with Bimantara, a company controlled by one of the President's sons. General Motors' partner is the President's half brother.
"The legal system does not protect the businessman as they expect in the United States," said Harvey Goldstein, chairman of Harvest International, a company that advises on doing business in Indonesia. "The three most important factors in doing business are relationships, relationships, relationships."

A Film Message
Designers are slowly learning how to wield their political clout, but few have had an opportunity to send a message more pointedly than Tracy Reese does with a cameo appearance in "White Man's Burden," a film produced by Quentin Tarantino and Lawrence Bender and expected to be released early next year. 
 Directed by Desmond Nakano and starring Harry Belafonte and John Travolta, the movie creates a world of societal reversal, in which whites are a mistreated minority. "Blacks are in control of big business," Ms. Reese said, "and Harry Belafonte treats whites as physically and mentally inferior, common stereotypes, the same kinds of things you hear today in people's private opinions."
His wealthy wife, played by Margaret Avery, plans a charity runway show to benefit poor white children, and Ms. Reese's Afrocentric clothes designed last fall for Magaschoni Inc. are the featured attraction, with Ms. Reese taking a bow at the end.
"The message of the movie is that everyone is equal," she said. "That's the moral of the story. We've heard it all before, but it's going to be interesting to see the roles played out this way."
 
Documenting an Innovator
Modern women may be, by now, taking for granted what Claire McCardell (1906-58) brought to fashion. But the fashion industry is in the throes of enshrining her.
On Wednesday, the Parsons School of Design will open its exhibition of her work, titled "Claire McCardell: Redefining Modernism."
"My message here is the cultural currency her clothes have is still extrememly high," said Kohle Yohannan, 26, the exhibition's curator, who was briefly married to Mary McFadden. "She packs a wallop for young people, and that is where popular culture really validates good design. Museum work is now becoming cross-polinated and cross-generational. My message will make sense to the teen-age hip-hop group right through to the Smithsonian."
The exhibition, at the Parsons exhibition gallery at 2 West 13th Street(Fifth Avenue), will run until Jan. 12 and includes family photos and McCardell's Coty award, along with the clothes she created that revolutionized American fashion in the 1940's and 50's.
Mr. Yohannan said he has collected pieces by McCardell never before seen in New York, many from her family's collection right from her closet in Frederick, Md., where she grew up. He is also working on a book about the designer.
The current interest in McCardell's work is due to the fact, Mr. Yohannan said, that "our economy is pointing toward fashion that makes sense." For instance, he said, McCardell always put pockets in her clothes, and hooks, eyes and zippers were "unapologetically placed." He added, "She used utilitarian fabrics before the war restrictions even asked for them."
 
Jewelry by Trigere
At her corner table at Le Cirque last week, Pauline Trigere was wearing more pieces of jewelry than there were flowers in the vases. Le Cirque is, after all, the home turf of many of her clients, who have waited patiently for her to resume business since she closed her fashion house 16 months ago after a throat operation. So what better place to display her jewelry collection?
She held up a ring, a little bird perched upright on her finger, a diamond dangling from its beak. "French men descend to kiss the hand," she said, demonstrating how well the bird behaves under those circumstances. "But American men pull your hand to their lips," and the bird becomes a dangerous object.
Ms. Trigere decided to create a small line of bibs made of gold chains to wear under suits, pretty sheer dickeys with jewels strewn across them and glittery pave bracelets, earrings and pins, partly because her clients still have plenty of the clothes she designed, she said.
"Maybe it's my mistake," she said. "They can still wear it after 15 years."

Club Owners' Labor Chief Resigns

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Dec. 5

 BODY:
No one knows when striking baseball players and the club owners will resolve their prolonged labor dispute, but if they ever reach a settlement, they'll do it without the man who served the past three years as management's chief labor executive.
They'll also apparently have to do it with something other than the owners' recent tax proposal. "We don't believe it provides a framework in which we likely will get an agreement," Donald Fehr said in his first public characterization of the owners' proposed luxury tax on payrolls. 
 Earlier in the day, Richard Ravitch, who in a life of diverse roles also ran for the Democratic nomination for mayor of New York, announced that he was resigning as president of the Players Relations Committee, effective with the expiration of his contract at the end of this month.
The move came as no surprise, given the increased role the owners have taken in these fruitless negotiations and the ill-fated history of the position Ravitch has held. Labor agreements have often been reached and work stoppages ended with the chief labor executive replaced by another member of management in the key negotiating role.
Ravitch's resignation and Fehr's view of the tax proposal came on a day when the union's executive board convened a three-day meeting at the Atlanta Merchandise Mart. Seventy-eight players, far more than are on the board, from 27 teams were on hand for the union's effort to formulate a counterproposal to present to the owners' negotiators in Rye Brook, N.Y., on Friday.
If the two sides do not have an agreement, or are not on their way to settling their differences, the owners will meet Dec. 15 in Chicago, where they would be expected to approve an impasse-implementation strategy.
Ravitch, 61 years old, was not at the last round of talks, held in Leesburg, Va., this past Tuesday and Wednesday. On Tuesday he attended a board meeting of Olympia & York, a real estate enterprise, then called Chuck O'Connor, the chief management labor lawyer, and was told nothing that required his presence was happening.
It was at an earlier bargaining session, Nov. 10 in Rye Brook, that John Harrington of the Boston Red Sox replaced Ravitch as the owners' point man in talks with the players. If it had not been obvious before then that Ravitch would not remain beyond expiration of his contract, it became obvious that day.
"I never expected this would last as long as it did," Ravitch said today by telephone from New York. "I never expected to stay more than three years. I have not wanted to leave sooner because I did not want in any way to impair efforts to make the necessary changes in baseball. We're hopefully down to the final stages of negotiations and no one can make the decisions but the owners. No one can make them on their behalf. They're sufficiently informed. I don't feel I'm letting them down in any way."
Fehr said he was not surprised at the development. "His contract was over and there seemed to be no realistic reason to think he would stay on," Fehr said. "The owners' position in these negotiations have been driven by the owners, not by their employees. My guess is it will have very little effect."
In today's union meeting, said a person who was there, Fehr told the players that Ravitch had not been a significant player for a long time.
Ravitch was hired under a $750,000-a-year contract in November 1991. His primary role was to develop a new economic system that the owners would try to sell to the players. But before he embarked on that venture, he joined Bud Selig of the Milwaukee Brewers and Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox in May 1992 in trying to induce Commissioner Fay Vincent to relinquish his authority in labor matters.
In his first months in the job, Ravitch studied the history of baseball negotiations and concluded that commissioners had long undermined the owners' bargaining position.
Vincent, who had been instrumental in ending the owners' lockout in 1990, declined to budge on labor, only to be forced out of office by the owners in September 1992.
In a more positive move, perhaps his most impressive effort, Ravitch worked for more than a year and succeeded in getting the owners last January to adopt a plan under which they would share a greater portion of their revenue.
In a statement, Selig said that Ravitch had been "instrumental in helping the clubs recognize the seriousness of the economic problems of the industry and then create a solution to resolve those problems."
The revenue-sharing plan, however, was contingent on the players agreeing to a salary cap. It has been nearly six months since Ravitch presented the salary-cap proposal, but the only way the owners will get it is to implement it unilaterally.
Ravitch's tenure has had its rocky moments, aside from the inability to forge an agreement with the players. His relationship with Fehr became strained, and Ravitch and Selig, the acting commissioner, have not had a good relationship for much of their association.
It was not known whether they would have agreed to a contract extension, but it seemed to be a foregone conclusion that Ravitch would leave Dec. 31.
In a letter to Selig, Ravitch said personal and business reasons did not make it feasible for him to consider an extension.
"This was never anything more than a temporary assignment," Ravitch said. "I have other things I want to get on to."
He said he had no other job lined up. "One of the problems I had faced," he explained, "was I was so visible in this I couldn't talk to people about the future without it leaking. I'm looking at a whole series of options. I'm not going to rush to make decisions."
He ruled out politics. "When I ran for mayor and I got 5 percent of the vote, I decided I wasn't going to run for office again," he said.
At a news conference after the players' first session, players were asked about the possibility of union members going back to work in spring training even if the players remained on strike.
David Cone said he didn't think that would be a problem. But when asked whether he thought there would be repercussions against such players, the Kansas City pitcher said: "This isn't the place to talk about violence. Repercussions will come down the line. It won't necessarily be violence, but the stigma of knowing you were one of the guys who crossed the line, the stigma of knowing you're going to carry that label the rest of your career, maybe the rest of your life."

HEADLINE: Orange County, Calif., Makes Bankruptcy Filing

BYLINE: By SALLIE HOFMEISTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Orange County, Calif., plagued by disastrous losses in its investment fund, announced today that it had filed for bankruptcy protection to keep nervous lenders and investors from draining the fund and compounding its problems.
The filing by Orange County, one of the wealthiest in the country, is by far the largest bankruptcy case involving a unit of government and the first involving a large American county. 
 The bankruptcy filing has implications far beyond the 187 school districts, cities and county units that have invested $7.8 billion in the fund and may have to make cutbacks in programs. It may also cause Wall Street firms to demand higher interest rates or to pull back on lending to local governments, particularly in California, which relies on its 58 counties to finance many of its government programs.
"Under the circumstances, filing for bankruptcy might be the most rational solution," said Peer Swan, president of the Irvine Ranch Water District, who asked to withdraw its $300 million from the fund last month. "Everyone needs to cool off. We needed to stop the clock."
The bankruptcy filing comes five days after Orange County officials disclosed that the fund faced $1.5 billion in losses because of an aggressive investment strategy used by Robert L. Citron, the county treasurer, who resigned on Monday. Mr. Citron depended on heavy borrowing and the purchase of financial instruments known as derivatives, whose returns were based on the performance of fixed-income securities and counted on interest rates to fall.
The fund's value started declining in February when interest rates began to climb.
According to investors in the fund, a bankruptcy filing became necessary after several Wall Street brokerage houses refused to renew $1.2 billion worth of short-term loans that came due today. The loans were part of the $12 billion borrowed by the fund to enable it to expand the $7.8 billion in public money into an investment portfolio valued as high as $20 billion.
County officials said after the filing that state services provided by the county, like health care programs and welfare, would continue, as well as fire and police protection and paramedic services. But some local agencies, including those for parks, libraries and possibly schools, face cutbacks, said David Kiff, a spokesman for Thomas F. Riley, chairman of the Orange County board of supervisors. Mr. Kiff said the state would also have a role in sorting out the fiscal situation.
One lawyer close to the situation, who spoke on condition of anonymity, predicted that agencies invested in the fund might also be forced to file for bankruptcy.
Bankruptcies by a municipality are extremely rare, according to officials at the National Association of Counties in Washington. Moreover, no government bankruptcy has ever involved as much money as is at stake in Orange County.
Mr. Riley emerged from a meeting late this afternoon to announce that the county was seeking protection under Chapter 9 of the Federal bankruptcy code so it could face its fiscal problems "in an orderly manner."
Rumors early in the day that Orange County was considering bankruptcy "threw the municipal bond market into chaos," said Robert Froehlich, director of research at Van Kampen Merritt in Oakbrook Terrace, Ill. While there was little activity in California bonds because of the uncertainty, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded bonds fell about a point in the early afternoon on reports that the county might file for bankruptcy. But the prices of the contracts recovered in late trading, with the average yield to maturity falling to 6.92 percent from 6.96 percent on Monday.
Moody's Investors Service Inc., the rating agency, said today that it would suspend ratings on all Orange County bonds other than those backed by a bond insurance company.
In an unusually risky strategy for a municipality, Mr. Citron borrowed money for the fund for years, often investing it in what are known as reverse repurchase agreements. Several brokerage houses lent Orange County about $12 billion by taking as collateral fixed-income securities that would be bought back at a specific date. Because of a general decline in the market, cashing in the $1.2 billion in fixed-income securities would result in a loss of about $70 million.
The county has some cash -- about $400 million in the fund, another $400 million in investments coming due within the year and at least $450 million in property taxes due before year-end, Mr. Swan said. But the county's fund would be hard-pressed to meet its obligations if all its lenders refused to roll over the repurchase agreements.
Experts in the field said Orange County would have been better off finding an alternative to outright bankruptcy, like establishing a supervisory body to oversee its investments.
"It makes little sense for a municipality to actually carry out a bankruptcy threat," James Spiotto, a municipal bankruptcy expert at Chapman & Cutler, a Chicago law firm, said before today's filing. "It reminds me of the scene in 'Blazing Saddles' where the guy puts the gun to his own head and says: 'Take one more step and I'll shoot.' "
Indeed, since 1937, shortly after the Federal law allowing local governments to file for bankruptcy was passed, fewer than 500 cases have been filed and many of the largest were never completed.
Nearly all the filings have involved tiny municipalities or districts, with the average default in cases through the 1970's less than $2 million. By far the biggest previous bankruptcy in which tax-exempt bonds were used was a project of the the Washington Public Power Supply System, which was unable to complete construction on two of five nuclear power plants. It defaulted on more than $2 billion in debt.
In 1991, Bridgeport, Conn., tried to enter bankruptcy protection but the case was dismissed when a Federal judge ruled that the city was able to pay its bills. Bridgeport had no more than $200 million in outstanding debt.
An attempt in 1991 by the school district in Richmond, Calif., was also dismissed before it could take effect, as was a 1983 case involving the San Jose, Calif., school district. In that case, teachers and other employees ended up renegotiating a salary contract. All government bodies in those cases continued to pay interest to bondholders.
The Orange County bankruptcy is expected to allow the investment fund to delay payments to the towns and school districts that have money in the fund. It may also free the fund from having to meet any margin calls from its Wall Street lenders, although there are general provisions in the bankruptcy code meant to exempt the type of short-term borrowing that the fund used.
Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code is restricted to political subdivisions of a state. The law was tightened in October by the Bankruptcy Reform Act, which says such a filing would be legal only if authorized by a state law.
There are relatively few precedents regarding Chapter 9, said Bennett J. Murphy, a bankruptcy lawyer and partner in the Los Angeles firm of Latham & Watkins. "It is a portion of the bankruptcy code that is a mystery even to experienced bankruptcy lawyers," he said. "There is very little developed case law."

HEADLINE: Choice for Treasury Wins Praise As Clinton Loses Elder Statesman

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6

 BODY:
President Clinton today accepted the resignation of Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, one of the few elder statesmen in the Administration, and said he would name as the successor Robert E. Rubin, a former investment banker who is an ally of Mr. Bentsen and now mediates economic policy at the White House.
For Mr. Clinton, the effect of Mr. Bentsen's departure is more political than economic, since Mr. Rubin has been at the center of the Administration's policy-making for two years as a quiet consensus-builder serving as chairman of the National Economic Council. [Man in the News, page B10.] 
 Indeed, in that White House role, the 56-year-old Mr. Rubin has been one of Mr. Bentsen's closest associates in pressing the Administration to reduce the Federal budget deficit.
But the loss of Mr. Bentsen, a Texan who served in the Senate for more than two decades before joining the Clinton Cabinet, deprives the President of one of his most experienced political hands, an adviser on issues that ranged far beyond economic policy. It also leaves the White House without one of its most persuasive voices on Capitol Hill, particularly with leaders of the new Republican majority there.
Wall Street and many in Congress praised the quick selection of Mr. Rubin, who has demonstrated effectiveness as head of the economic council, created by Mr. Clinton to act as an arbiter among competing interests in economic policy.
While steering clear of the limelight, Mr. Rubin has been a central figure in every economic initiative of the last two years, particularly in the battles over the North American Free Trade Agreement and most recently the world trade pact. He is not expected to encounter much opposition in Senate confirmation hearings early next year.
In an interview at his office today, Mr. Bentsen said he had long planned to return home to Houston at the end of his fourth Senate term, which would have expired next month had he not joined the Cabinet.
"It's a terrific time to be going out, with the economic numbers this good," said the Secretary, sitting amid photographs that trace his political career to the time he escorted President Harry S. Truman on a campaign swing through Texas.
Mr. Clinton's aides said that the 73-year-old Treasury Secretary first expressed a desire to resign in September and that the President was unable to persuade him then to remain.
Some also speculated that he had viewed the present as a narrow window in which to leave: the country's economic performance is strong; the new, Republican-controlled Congress has not yet convened and begun to battle with the White House over the Federal budget and the Republicans' proposed tax cuts for the middle class, and the Republican chairmen-designate on Capitol Hill have not yet been able to renew the Congressional investigations on the Whitewater affair, a matter in which a number of the Secretary's subordinates at Treasury have been under scrutiny.
"I loved having you here every day, and I'm really going to miss you," Mr. Clinton told Mr. Bentsen at a brief ceremony in the White House Rose Garden this morning.
The President said Mr. Bentsen had promised to be "part of a seasoned kitchen cabinet" that will allow the White House to retain some experienced voices. Another adviser experienced in the ways of Washington, David R. Gergen, left the White House as counselor to the President earlier this year and will quit his temporary post at the State Department at the end of this month.
"I don't think the President talked about a kitchen cabinet lightly," one White House aide said today.
Until Mr. Rubin is confirmed by the Senate, Deputy Treasury Secretary Frank N. Newman, formerly a top official at the Bank of America, will serve as Acting Secretary.
White House officials said tonight that Erskine B. Bowles, a deputy White House chief of staff, remained the leading candidate to succeed Mr. Rubin as the Administration's coordinator of economic policy.
But they said Mr. Clinton was reserving a final decision about whom to appoint to that job until later this month, when he hopes to fill a series of vacancies within the White House staff.
Mr. Bentsen and Mr. Rubin have much in common: Both made millions in the private sector, Mr. Bentsen in insurance, Mr. Rubin at the Wall Street investment firm of Goldman, Sachs & Company. Both are noted for their loyalty to Mr. Clinton. And early in the Administration both managed together to convince the bond market -- perhaps now the most important constituency on economic policy -- that the White House commitment to deficit reduction was real. That, in turn, kept interest rates low enough to allow the economic recovery to gain steam.
But they are personality opposites. The gregarious Mr. Bentsen commands any room he enters, with his gravelly voice and an ease that bespeaks a life of constant and usually successful campaigning. "The sun always shines on Bentsen," the Treasury Secretary said in the Rose Garden this morning.
Mr. Rubin is more soft-spoken, self-effacing and cerebral, an excellent listener and an intense but gracious questioner.
He cannot, however, match Mr. Bentsen in political shrewdness or in favors owed on Capitol Hill; almost no one could.
In recent months Mr. Clinton has consulted Mr. Bentsen on the timing of the military venture in Haiti and the decision to back away from the health care initiative, a proposal that Mr. Bentsen had warned early on was overambitious. And last month the President relied on him to save the day when the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade seemed headed to defeat in the Senate. In the end it was Mr. Bentsen, along with Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, who met the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, in the Watergate Hotel and cut the deal that saved the 124-nation accord.
In his new post, Mr. Rubin will be headed for many more encounters with Congressional Republicans than he has experienced in the past. He said recently, only half in jest, that he had spent his professional life getting to know Democrats in Congress -- he has long been a big fund-raiser for the Democratic Party -- and that the moment had come "to get to know a few more faces."
Mr. Bentsen said today that he expected Mr. Rubin to make the transition easily. "Anybody who can deal with the egos of Wall Street," he said, "can deal with the egos of Congress."
The departing Secretary also said he doubted that Mr. Rubin would make many changes at the Treasury Department, although others there said they suspected that the department's young chief of staff, Joshua L. Steiner, who burst into the limelight earlier this year when he disavowed his own diaries at a Congressional hearing on the Whitewater affair, might be moved aside.
Mr. Rubin will face some challenges that Mr. Bentsen was lucky enough to sidestep. He will have to lead the Administration through the political quicksand of debate on a middle-class tax cut advocated by the new Republican Congressional majority. Mr. Bentsen and Mr. Rubin have both been quick to say that Mr. Clinton can support such a cut only if a way is found to pay for it.
Attuned to the markets, Mr. Rubin is expected to hew to his reputation as a deficit hawk, warning that any increase in the budget deficit would lead to soaring interest rates. But many Democrats suspect that this position could come under attack from Mr. Clinton's political advisers as the 1996 election nears and pressure builds to show that the middle class is sharing in the prosperity reflected by economic statistics.
In the interview at his office today, Mr. Bentsen suggested that the Administration still had not learned how to communicate its economic successes to Americans. He said the rout of Democrats in the elections last month was a result of "a great product and a lousy sales pitch."
But in the next breath he said the country's biggest problem was that "middle-income job holders have not seen their incomes expanding."
"That," he concluded, "has to be addressed."

A Quiet Team Builder: Robert Edward Rubin

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6

 BODY:
The Administration's invisible man is coming out of the shadows.
For two years, Robert E. Rubin has been the glue holding together the Clinton economic team, working behind the scenes to build consensus, much as he did while amassing a fortune as co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, the New York investment bank. 
 But if his selection today by President Clinton to become Treasury Secretary goes through, he will face a very different challenge, as the Administration's most prominent economic spokesman, its emissary to Congress and liaison to the financial world.
Associates of Mr. Rubin in New York and Washington today were full of praise for his intellect and policy acumen. Any doubts they expressed had to do with how well he will handle the increase in visibility.
One associate noted that during Mr. Rubin's 12 years on the management committee of Goldman, Sachs, he almost never testified before Congress or came to Washington to push the firm's agenda the way many leaders of Wall Street habitually did.
"He was uncomfortable; he hated it," said an associate of Mr. Rubin who insisted on anonymity.
Some business executives are wondering how he will make the transition. "Bob is strong on policy, has good ties to the business community, and the challenge now is going to be how skillful he will be as a spokesman and lobbyist," said Jerry Jasinowski, a former Commerce Department official in the Carter Administration who is now the president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
Yet people who know Mr. Rubin say that it is a mistake to equate his reticence with a lack of political skill. "People sometimes associate aggressive behavior and being vocal as being politically sophisticated, and that's not necessarily so," said Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative.
In an interview this afternoon, Mr. Rubin was characteristically cautious in describing his political experience before joining the Administration. "I did have a fair bit of experience and had a fair number of relationships going back a ways."
Members of Congress portray Mr. Rubin as much better connected. He gave informal advice over the years to a succession of prominent Democrats, including Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York. And with peak earnings at Goldman, Sachs in 1992 of $26.5 million, he was also one of the most important Democratic fund-raisers in New York City.
"Because he was very interested in politics, and because he was very generous, he met everybody," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York.
But Mr. Rubin has less experience in dealing with Republicans. Some liberal Democrats blame the pro-business policies that he has overseen for hurting their party in last month's elections.
Administration officials predicted that Mr. Rubin's appointment would not result in any immediately discernible shift in economic policies because he and Mr. Bentsen collaborated closely. "I don't really foresee changes," said Eugene A. Ludwig, the Comptroller of the Currency and the nation's top bank regulator. "We've all been part of a team."
Robert Edward Rubin was born in New York City on Aug. 29, 1938, and grew up in Miami Beach, the son of a real estate lawyer. He graduated from Harvard College, summa cum laude in economics, and spent three days at Harvard Law School before dropping out to study at the London School of Economics. He later graduated from Yale Law School and spent two years at the New York law firm Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton. He joined Goldman in 1966 and traded stocks, bonds, commodities and foreign currencies as he worked his way up through the ranks.
That experience may help in office. Mr. Bentsen sometimes upset financial markets and sent the value of the dollar plunging with off-the-cuff remarks about exchange rates. Mr. Rubin is likely to say less, said G. William Miller, who was a Treasury Secretary under President Jimmy Carter. "He tends to be cautious in public statements," Mr. Miller said. "He's not a gunslinger at all."
Mr. Rubin's success as an impartial mediator as the head of the National Economic Council in many ways mirrored his job as head of Goldman, Sachs. In the White House, Mr. Rubin held his personal ambition in check while promoting teamwork, qualities prized at Goldman.
As a member of Goldman's management committee and later one of its two co-chairmen, Mr. Rubin presided over a period of tremendous success that was tarred by one high-profile embarrassment.
In 1987, Robert M. Freeman, who succeeded Mr. Rubin as head of Goldman's prestigious risk arbitrage department, was charged with insider trading. The firm paid Mr. Freeman's legal expenses and weathered an extensive investigation, which ended in 1990, when Mr. Freeman pleaded guilty to one felony count of insider trading.
Although Mr. Rubin was responsible for overseeing Mr. Freeman's department, he was never implicated in the insider trading.
Mr. Rubin drew criticism just after his arrival in Washington when it was disclosed that he had sent farewell letters to hundreds of Goldman clients saying he was "looking forward to working with you in my new capacity." Critics maintained that the letters gave at least an appearance of a conflict of interest.
But Mr. Rubin said he was merely being polite, and his former colleagues say that during his time in the White House he has been scrupulous about keeping his distance from both the firm and its clients.
Mr. Rubin lives in a hotel here, frequently traveling to New York on weekends to visit his wife, Judy, who loves the city and has not wanted to move. He has two grown sons, one of whom plans to move to Washington in June when his wife becomes a clerk at the Supreme Court.
Mr. Rubin frequently works in his office from 7 A.M. until 9 P.M., and seldom goes on official trips.
At a news conference today, he said, "Last night my wife, Judy, and I had dinner and we talked about how serving in this Administration has not been an easy way of life for us -- it involved a lot of personal disruption -- but how it has been a great opportunity to work on many of the critical issues at an important moment in our country's history."

In the Macho World of Peru, 8 Women Muscle In

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Two women are running for President and six for Vice President in elections early next year -- the first time in Peru that women have been selected as candidates for such high office.
No one expects the tickets with women on them to defeat President Alberto K. Fujimori, who the polls indicate is comfortably ahead as he seeks a second five-year term. But some Peruvians see the women's candidacies as a sign of progress in a country of 23 million where many people still think of women as the property of their husbands. 
 The surge in the nominations of women began with the feud this year between Mr. Fujimori and his now-estranged wife, Susana Higuchi, which led to her own short-lived campaign for the presidency.
"The reason we see so many women candidates in this race, especially for Vice President, is that there is a new notion among politicos in Peru that women are now more prone to vote for women candidates than in the past, and this idea is the direct result of Susana Higuchi's high-profile campaign as a woman," said Mirko Lauer, a political analyst.
Before Ms. Higuchi was forced to drop out of the race in October because she lacked the required signatures, local polls indicated 10 percent support for her, 41 percent for Mr. Fujimori and 23.5 percent for Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former United Nations Secretary General who has selected a woman as his running mate, as have five other male candidates.
In addition to accusing her husband's Government of corruption and of ignoring the plight of the poor, Ms. Higuchi asserted that Mr. Fujimori had no respect for women. But the two women still in the running for the presidency, Mercedes Cabanillas and Lourdes Flores, are not focusing on women's issues.
Like their male counterparts, they are using their candidacies to try to convince voters that Mr. Fujimori, who disbanded Congress and assumed one-man rule in 1992, should not be re-elected because he has not done enough to help the poor or to return Peru to true democratic rule.
Mrs. Cabanillas, 46, a former senator and Education Minister from the center-left American Popular Revolutionary Alliance, has called for the decentralization of government to better address the needs of Peru's provinces, expanded economic development and more social programs.
Miss Flores, 35, a congresswoman and lawyer from the conservative Popular Christian Party, said that while she was concerned about women's rights, she was offended that many people expected the issue to be at the top of her agenda.
"The question I am asked most often is, 'Why aren't you married?' " Miss Flores said. "People tell me that if I want to win, I should project a more motherly image. Well, I'm not a mother and I am still very happy. I want to be more like Margaret Thatcher, a strong leader on all the issues."
Mr. Lauer said: "These women are not really running as women. They are running as any other politician would. Neither of these women has a feminist platform, and they are not putting forward feminist demands. They are running within the macho context."
Elena Maria Delgado, a business executive who was chosen as the second vice presidential candidate for Alejandro Toledo, an economist who is rising in the polls, has urged women to shake off past notions of their role in society.
"Machismo exists today because women allow it to exist," she said. "They raise their sons in a machismo way where their daughters do all the housework and their sons can rest on the couch and take it easy. We need to change our attitudes and not raise little machistas."
In Peru, there is a First Vice President, who becomes head of state if the President dies or is incapacitated, and a Second Vice President, who is third in line to power. There are two women running for First Vice President and four for Second Vice President -- none of them on Mr. Fujimori's ticket.
Most of the women chosen as running mates have little or no political experience. But Mrs. Cabanillas and Miss Flores have been leaders in their parties for some time, and in recent years women have begun to assume more visible roles in Peruvian society. Women now head labor unions and prominent businesses, and they also have leadership positions in two of Peru's guerrilla organizations, the Shining Path and the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru.
The withdrawal of Ms. Higuchi has not appreciably helped the candidacies of Mrs. Cabanillas or Miss Flores. A survey taken after Ms. Higuchi dropped out showed Mr. Fujimori with the support of 44 percent of the voters, Mr. Perez de Cuellar with 22 percent, Mr. Toledo with 9 percent, Mrs. Cabanillas with 4 percent and Miss Flores with 2 percent.
But Violeta Vermudez, head of Manuela Ramos Movement, a leading feminist group, said the women's candidacies will force the presidential campaign to focus on women's issues that have long been ignored in Peru, including political representation, domestic violence, employment discrimination and health care.
"The mere presence of all these women running for office is having a dramatic impact on the psyche of all women in Peru," Ms. Vermudez said. "It's an inspiration. It's empowering."

HEADLINE: U.S. Shutting 1,274 Farm Field Offices

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Dec. 6

 BODY:
The Department of Agriculture will close nearly one-third of its field offices and hopes to save $3.6 billion in a vast reorganization announced today. In Washington it might have been a budget cutter's dream, but few down on the farm were happy about the changes.
Under the reorganization signed into law by President Clinton in October, 1,274 of the department's 3,700 offices around the country will be closed and consolidated with nearby ones. Many of these offices are in counties where farming has given way to urban and suburban sprawl. 
 "The U.S.D.A. is too large," Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, said this afternoon at a news conference in Washington. "We cannot justify the presence of field offices where the farm population does not exist."
The changes could take 11,000 workers off the Federal payroll in the next five years, Mr. Espy said, and farmers would have "one-stop shopping centers" for help with water conservation, erosion-abatement and other technical services, as well as help with loans, crop subsidies or crop quotas. In many states those services are now offered at different locations.
The Secretary said staff cutbacks would be realized through attrition and buyouts rather than dismissals.
In most of the heavily affected states, the shrinkage of the offices parallels a shrinkage in farms. Virginia, for example, now has only 42,000 farms, down from 136,000 in 1954, said James W. Pease, an agricultural economist at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Similarly, the number of farms in Georgia now dropped to 43,000 today from 73,000 in 1974, said Mike Hammer, deputy state agricultural statistician.
Nonetheless, in a host of rural communities, farmers said they viewed Mr. Espy's announcement as just one more affliction, joining nature's pests, droughts and floods in the catalogue of unwelcome events.
The Agriculture Department offices, these critics said, were the best evidence that farmers had a friend in the Government, the only human face of the sprawling Federal bureaucracy that often determined their fate.
"I'm not angry, just resigned," said Carlton Tate, a 78-year-old rancher in Dahlonega, Ga.
Mr. Tate's local office of the Agriculture Stabilization and Conservations Services and Soil Conservation Services will close and be consolidated with the one in Gainesville, 20 miles away. "The large farmer who doesn't really need their help will make that drive," he said, "but the small farmers like me who really need the help won't have much time to do that."
Robert E. Hall, a 41-year-old farmer who grows corn, soybeans and wheat on 500 acres outside Heathsville, Va., said the closings would turn his half-mile trip to the local farm office into a 40-mile one. He visits the office three or four times a year.
Mr. Hall said he feared that the envisioned savings to the Federal Government would prove illusory while the increase in his own fuel costs and time getting services would not. "We need to be working in the fields, not running errands," he said.
Still others saw the reorganization as so much politics, in which offices in the districts of powerful lawmakers were untouched while those in the districts of less powerful officials were axed.
Jeanette Perry, the program assistant in the Winder, Ga., office of the Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Services, said that her office in was already a one-stop shopping center for Barrow County's 400 farmers and that its services would now be split and put in three offices in other counties.
"We don't have any political pull in our county," Ms. Perry said, "but they do in those other counties."
Jim Loftus, a spokesman for the Agriculture Department in Washington, disputed such assertions, saying it was politics in the past that had kept the department from streamlining its services and consolidating the offices that had been sown like so many seeds over the years, starting with the Depression-era assistance programs.
Mr. Loftus said Mr. Espy had achieved bipartisan support from Congress for the reorganization by including a plan to eliminate "hundreds of pages of forms" that farmers must now use to get Federal financial and technical assistance.
The list of closings and consolidations released today showed that Georgia, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia were among the hardest hit. In Georgia, 193 offices are to be consolidated into 92. In Texas, more than 100 offices will be closed, leaving the state with 220. Tennessee will lose 51 of its 123 offices, while Virginia will have its 111 offices reduced to 54.
Just north of Houston, in Montgomery County, time and progress have converted what was once a rural agricultural area to a Houston suburb with three agriculture department offices that the Montgomery County Judge said were little used. All three offices will now be closed, Judge Alan Sadler said, because there is "virtually no agriculture here."
Representative Jack Kingston, Republican of Georgia, said farmers had generally been supportive of the closings, especially in his state, where Agriculture offices proliferated in the 1940's and 1950's.
In those days, Mr. Kingston said, Senator Herman Talmadge, Democrat of Georgia, headed the Senate Agriculture Committee and steered "more than our proportionate share of offices" to the state. Many of the offices slated for closing are now in suburbs of Atlanta and Savannah, where there are no longer any farms, he said.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Oil Companies Drawn to the Deep

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
Three of the biggest petroleum companies, buoyed by Shell Oil's initial success with the world's deepest offshore oil platform, have decided to wade even deeper into the Gulf of Mexico toward deep-water reserves thought to hold more oil than the giant Prudhoe Bay fields in Alaska.
In a deal recently forged but not yet announced, Amoco, Exxon and Shell Oil plan to use new and improved technologies to build a billion-dollar platform to tap into oil and natural gas from fields previously considered too deep to reach economically. At stake are a band of reserves estimated to hold some 15 billion barrels of oil -- 50 percent more than the Prudhoe Bay fields, currently one of the largest sources of United States oil. 
 The companies are emboldened by the results from the current deep-water record holder, Shell Oil's Auger platform, tethered to the gulf floor in water half a mile deep. Since the Auger went into production in April, several of its nine wells have yielded oil in daily volumes far higher than ever before recorded in the Gulf of Mexico.
Other companies, including Texaco Inc., are now also expected to start moving their deep-water plans beyond the drawing broad.
"It's become well known that Auger has performed very well," said Clive Fowler, vice president of Amoco's offshore business unit. "That's extremely positive for the entire industry."
The plan to go after that oil bears an economic importance far greater than the volume of the reserves themselves, which under full production would probably meet less than 10 percent of the nation's daily demand for oil. But with about half the oil the United States uses coming from foreign sources -- imports are expected to total about 2.73 billion barrels this year -- the deep-water fields would be a significant new source of domestic oil that would give the nation greater bargaining power in the global energy market.
Just as development of Prudhoe Bay helped dampen the impact of price shocks and ease the nation's dependence on Middle Eastern oil during the 1970's and early 1980's, development of deep-water fields in the Gulf of Mexico could help counter any new moves by the OPEC countries to revive slumping oil prices by curtailing production.
"That kind of development will slow the rate of our dependency on imports," said John Hervey, oil analyst for the investment firm Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
The plan by Amoco, Exxon and Shell calls for the companies together to spend nearly $1 billion to anchor an oil production platform 3,220 feet below the gulf's surface at a site about 140 miles southeast of New Orleans. The platform, which would be called Ram-Powell, would begin producing oil in 1998. It would be some 400 feet deeper than Shell's Auger platform, and nearly 300 feet deeper than a Shell platform named Mars that is now under construction and is scheduled to enter production in 1996.
Shell Oil's board has already approved the plan, and the Amoco and Exxon boards are expected to approve it by the end of the month.
The depth of an offshore platform must be understood as a separate measurement from the depth of the oil wells feeding into it. A platform amounts to an entire petroleum factory, collecting the oil piped to it from perhaps dozens of wells, temporarily storing it and then either loading it onto tankers or feeding it into pipelines connected to shore.
A well, by contrast, is little more than a hole bored deep into the earth's surface, often several miles or more, until it hits a pocket of oil or natural gas. Natural geological pressure sends the oil or gas to the surface through piping that has been fed into the well as it is drilled.
In terms of wells alone, the deepest undersea well right now is operated in the Campos Basin off Brazil by Petrobras, the Brazilian state oil company. That well, just past the edge of a sharp drop-off, begins 3,369 feet beneath the water's surface. But it feeds its oil back to a platform anchored in water far shallower than what is now being contemplated in the Gulf of Mexico.
The deep-water platforms in the gulf are intended eventually to allow development of hundreds of wells past the continental shelf, where the gulf's floor drops off sharply and beyond which offshore production had not been considered feasible before the Shell Auger.
Building such factories, able to withstand the winds and waves of deep waters without losing their moorings, has required new and improved technologies that include the use of deep-diving robots for construction and maintenance. And unlike earlier rigs in shallower water, which were built on rigid towers, the deep-water platforms are floating hulls tethered by steel tendons to barn-size anchors.
It is not a cheap way to build, and persuading companies to invest in such engineering feats has required the use of increasingly accurate seismic mapping techniques and the creation of detailed, three-dimensional computer models of the petroleum deposits beneath the gulf's floor.
Mr. Fowler of Amoco said the techniques could also lead to development of fields known to be lying in deep water elsewhere in the world, like off the coast of West Africa.
It may seem risky to spend nearly $1 billion to develop such platforms at a time when the price of oil -- $17 to $18 a barrel -- is low by historicalstandards.
But the Gulf of Mexico's deeper reaches are alluring to American oil companies, in light of dwindling production closer to shore, as well as in Prudhoe Bay and elsewhere in the United States, that increasingly has forced the companies to bear the economic and political risks of developing oil overseas.
In the case of Auger, on which Shell spent $1.2 billion, the main risk was not that it would fail to yield oil and gas but whether they would flow to the surface in quantities large enough to justify the investment. Of the nine wells now feeding up to the Auger, two have flowed a gulf-record rate of up to 13,000 barrels of oil a day. And the others are averaging 10,000 barrels a day -- well above the 6,000-a-day target that Shell had set.
'It's very exciting and encouraging," said Rich Pattarozzi, general manager of the deep-water division of Shell Oil's offshore unit. "It was very critical to have high flow rates to make deep water successful."
With benefit of Shell's experience, the industry expects to see the relative cost of such projects decline. Shell itself is already well along in construction of the Mars platform, which is expected to cost about the same as Auger to build, even though it is in deeper water.
And further into the future, Shell hopes to improve its techniques and reduce costs further by drawing on the deep-water experience of Exxon and Amoco. The three companies have assembled a 40-person team to develop the Ram-Powell platform.
Judy Wagner, who manages several projects in the Gulf of Mexico for British Petroleum, said, "Auger has made people much more comfortable that you can put a platform at that water depth."
She cautioned, however, that to venture significantly deeper than the Ram-Powell platform, to depths of 4,000 feet to 6,000 feet where oil is known to lie, will entail new technical challenges. Because the impact of wind and waves on such structures would be significantly greater, new and costlier safeguards will probably be needed, Ms. Wagner said.
Still, the projects, if they proceed, could be a boon to hundreds of companies, many of them based in Louisiana and Texas, that have roles in creating, setting up and maintaining the platforms. The gulf region has been hit hard by the decline of the domestic oil industry which has shrunk to about 450,000 workers currently from 920,000 workers in 1982. Hundreds of small companies have gone under or have been absorbed by larger competitors.
"Without the advent of deep water, this industry is going to continue to decline," said Bobby Rawle, vice president of North American Operations for McDermott International, a company based in New Orleans which is a major supplier and builder of offshore structures for exploration and production. "We need this."

As Bonds Rise Again, A Rally Is Played Down

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose sharply yesterday, but many traders described the rise as strictly technical trading, saying the market may have simply oversold itself during the last few months.
Municipal bond prices gained for the fifth consecutive session on renewed interest from mutual funds that offset any concern about bonds tied to Orange County, Calif., which last week disclosed its investment fund had lost $1.5 billion. 
 Talk of a possible bankruptcy filing by Orange County froze the municipal market momentarily, but the speculation was dispelled and the market finished strong.
After the close of the market, though, Orange County said it had filed for bankruptcy protection to keep investors from drawing money out of its fund and compunding its problems.
Concerning Treasuries, analysts said, it is not uncommon for the market to overshoot bottoms and ceilings and then reverse itself before heading into its next trading range.
Robin Mesch, chief analyst for Thomson Research, said the March futures contract for the 30-year Treasury bond seemed to be heading to a price of 1005/32 to 1009/32 , for a yield around 7.80 percent, "which we think will be the short-term obstacle for the market, causing it to stall."
Looking toward early 1995, she foresaw a ceiling to the price range of nearly 103, for a yield of 7.57 percent. She projects the market's key support level, which is the low price that should attract buyers, will be around 993/32 to 999/32 , or a yield of 7.89 percent.
In the cash market, the 30-year bond rose 27/32 to a price of 962/32 for a yield of 7.84 percent, down from 7.92 percent on Monday. Bills, which have shorter maturities, also gained after being hammered on Monday by speculation that the Fed would again increase interest rates.
Kevin McClintock, a manager of fixed-income portfolios for Aeltus Investment Management Inc. in Hartford, said: "If you look at bond yields since the begining of the year, they have gone straight up, and as some traders will tell you, a strong move by the market will be accompanied by small stops along the way as the market takes a breather. We are still in a bear market."
He said a number of things might explain yesterday's strong move by bonds, citing stability in the dollar, which has prompted foreign investors to buy bonds, and asset allocation trades out of equities and into bonds because of the better return. "There is also a better feeling in the market about a Republican Congress, which on the outset appears will be more friendly to the market," Mr. McClintock said.
"A 5 1/2 percent funds rate isn't high enough to slow the economy, since the market consensus is that G.D.P. in the fourth quarter is approaching 5 percent," he added. "Historically, rates have peaked when we are in a recession and not before. Currently we're in a boom economy so rates have not yet peaked."

HEADLINE: Nigerian Author Urges Boycott Against Rulers

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6

 BODY:
After fleeing his homeland three weeks ago to avoid arrest, Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian playwright and Nobel Prize winner, came to Washington today to publicize human rights abuses by his nation's military Government and to urge the United States to begin an economic boycott against his country.
Mr. Soyinka condemned Nigeria's dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, as "uncivilized" and "sadistic" as he criticized him for executing opponents, jailing writers and pro-democracy advocates and closing more than a dozen newspapers. 
 In a news conference at the Washington office of Amnesty International, Mr. Soyinka described the Abacha Government, which seized power 13 months ago, as "a terrorist organization whose stock in trade is hostage-taking." He said General Abacha has concluded that jailing prominent Nigerians is the only way he can get other countries to treat him with respect.
Mr. Soyinka, who in 1986 became the first African to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, fled to Europe last month after being told that Nigerian military authorities were planning to arrest him. The Government had already raided his office, seized his passport and banned two of his books.
Seeking to capitalize on his fame to highlight the crisis in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, Mr. Soyinka called on the United States to spearhead an international effort to isolate the military Government and urged it to freeze Nigerian assets and push for a United Nations boycott.
President Clinton has sent messages to General Abacha urging him to restore democracy. The Administration has cut off all economic aid, except for food and medicine and has hinted at freezing Nigerian assets.
The 60-year-old dramatist, who was chairman of one of Nigeria's leading human rights groups, said he was seeking to draw attention "to the enormity of the potential catastrophe in Nigeria and the severity of the human rights crisis."
He said that unless international pressure forced General Abacha to change his ways, Nigeria would move in one of two disastrous directions: either widespread factional fighting involving General Abacha would turn Nigeria into another Somalia, or the General could brutally consolidate power and become another Idi Amin, a Ugandan leader who was known for his reign of terror.
"I urge the United States community and the international community to wake up to the potential Somalia which Nigeria is today," he said.
Among the prisoners held by General Abacha is the victor in Nigeria's 1993 presidential election, Moshood Abiola, whom the Government has charged with treason, and Kenule Saro-Wiwa, who is one of Nigeria's best-known writers and president of the Movement for the Salvation of the Ogoni People, an ethnic group in southeastern Nigeria.
Mr. Soyinka said Nigerians would back economic sanctions for the same reasons South African blacks did: they might hurt, but they are worthwhile because they would help in the long term. Suggesting that sanctions would hurt the elite and not the average Nigerian, he said many people were already scavenging through trash bins to find scraps of food.

HEADLINE: Europe Seeks Latin Free-Trade Ties

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Dec. 1

 BODY:
The European Union is taking steps toward creating its first significant free-trade links with Latin America, in an effort to prevent the erosion of its markets there and to parry efforts by the United States to form a huge free-trade zone in the Americas.
During the last two months, officials from the European Union have negotiated with the four countries of Mercosur, a trading bloc made up of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, for the creation of a free-trade zone, first in industrial goods and services, and later in agricultural products. 
 The European Union has also stepped up its negotiations with Mexico to reduce tariffs, with the aim of not only expanding its Mexican trade but also gaining more access to American markets through Mexico's participation in the North American Free Trade Agreement.
"Europe stands to lose a significant share of its market in that area if we don't act," said Manuel Marin, a Spanish member of the European Commission, the union's executive body.
Late last month, foreign ministers of the Mercosur countries met with European officials here and announced plans to work toward a free-trade zone. Though no strict timetable has been set, the officials expect negotiations on short-term trade liberalization to begin next year, with formal links to be established by 2001. Such a plan is likely to be approved at a meeting of European member countries on Friday and Saturday in Essen, Germany.
The timing is hardly accidental. Many European officials believe that initiatives in Washington to expand free-trade pacts in Latin America beyond Mexico were seriously weakened by last month's Republican victories in Congressional elections.
Europe has been the largest trading partner of the Mercosur countries, accounting for 27 percent of their exports and imports between 1985 and 1992, compared with about 20 percent for the United States. Mexico is Europe's largest single market in Latin America, importing about $7.6 billion of European goods in 1993. But Mexican officials complain that the European Union maintains higher tariff barriers on Mexican imports.
Mexico's participation in Nafta and the economic growth in many South American countries since 1990 have created lucrative markets at a time when purchasing power in Europe is nearly stagnant and expansion in European markets is expected to be modest.
The extent to which the European Union can focus on Latin markets is questionable. It is preoccupied with expanding its own membership, with the proposed creation of a monetary union by the end of the decade and with its own problems of high unemployment, high labor costs, inefficiencies and lack of competitiveness.
Yet Europe is encountering more and more competition for its overseas markets, like those in Latin America and Asia. Studies here have found, for example, that if Europe does not establish strong free-trade links with the Mercosur countries its prominence as a trade partner with the region will be quickly eroded.
Next month the Mercosur countries will institute a system of so-called harmonized tariffs, with future plans for broad integration of fiscal, monetary, industrial and agricultural policies. With almost 200 million inhabitants, the Mercosur region has enormous commercial potential, and imports have more than doubled in recent years.
Other Latin countries, including Chile, Bolivia and Ecuador, are seeking to become members of Mercosur, which some economists predict could eventually form a common market in South America.
Though European officials say it will take some years for a free-trade relationship to develop with Latin America, they hope to take advantage of growing doubts in Latin countries that Washington will expand Nafta to include other countries in the region.

HEADLINE: Practices of Japanese Business Find a Home in a Brooklyn High School

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON 

 BODY:
In Valerie Costa's English class at George Westinghouse Vocational and Technical High School in Brooklyn, the 29 seniors sometimes grade each other, and Ms. Costa, too.
In another classroom, students get $4.50 an hour to repair broken fax circuit boards for the Ricoh Corporation -- and in the process, they learn how to hold down a job. 
 Down the hallway, bulletin boards recognize the Quality Employee of the Month; last month, it was Gloria O'Neal, a security officer, who won a shiny plaque and a $25 check.
Westinghouse High, a school of 1,700 students in downtown Brooklyn, is taking a page from Japanese management techniques to improve student achievement. In the nomenclature of such things, teachers are the equivalent of corporate managers; students, the customers. Instead of punishment, there is "continuous improvement."
The approach, called Total Quality Management and pioneered by the late W. Edwards Deming, has found disciples in a handful of schools around the country. Supporters see it helping a generation of schoolchildren learn to think for themselves and work together -- skills that economists say will be vital for successful workers.
"A lot of us are trying to understand it and promote it because we think it deals with some important issues," said Lew A. Rhodes, associate executive director of the American Association of School Administrators.
But skeptics suggest that Total Quality Management in education is this year's latest gimmick to be added to the list of experiments that include school vouchers, privatization and charter schools.
"Almost anything can catch people's interest in public education -- good ideas, bad ideas, in-between ideas," said Chester E. Finn Jr., a former United States assistant education secretary who is a fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington. "Most things in education turn out to be gimmicks."
The physical signs of Total Quality Management 101 are not always visible at Westinghouse High. The three-story, 74-year-old school is next to the Metrotech industrial complex in downtown Brooklyn. Its heavy metal doors are painted a bleak battleship gray, some classrooms have holes in the ceiling, and public address speakers are broken and waiting for repair.
But if the changes are not readily seen, the philosophy is discussed among students and staff. In conversation, they make lots of references to T.Q.M. -- in the squishy jargon like "continuous improvement," "constancy of purpose" and "paradigm shift."
And new sets of meetings supplant the old department meetings. In the sunny library the other day, Bob Johnson, an assistant principal, was giving his report to the Quality Steering Committee, which convenes weekly to hear from students, parents and teachers. Several student representatives groused about classmates who skipped class and questioned whether security officers were too nice. Arthur Kutcher, a jewelry-making teacher, asked when the signs for identifying classrooms would be put up.
"People are now getting involved," said Franklin P. Schargel, who recently retired as an assistant principal and now serves unofficially as quality coordinator. "If it's a gimmick, it's a great one because it works. The agenda is generated by customers, not by the principal or the administrators."
Total Quality Management, pioneered in Japan, helped turn around the failing manufacturing practices of corporations such as Motorola and Xerox in the 1970's and 1980's. Only in recent years has it migrated to a small but growing number of schools, including Westinghouse.
The number of the nation's 15,500 public school districts using total quality management to some degree grew to 135 in the last year, up from 41 school districts in 1991, according to the American Society for Quality Control, based in Milwaukee.
As in any reform, so much is at stake that even the most well-intentioned educators seem over-eager. At Westinghouse, the only New York City public school known to school officials to have adopted Total Quality Management, Mr. Schargel trailed a reporter on a recent visit. A public relations firm works with the school. A press release hails upturns in student performance.
But at least one widely published statistic cited by the school, a dramatic fall in the dropout rate from 12.9 percent to 2.1 percent, was acknowledged by the school to be misleading because it mixes two different kinds of dropout figures.
Although the dropout rate has indeed fallen, it has not been by so much. The four-year rate fell from 12.9 percent in 1991 to 5.7 percent in 1992, according to the latest Board of Education statistics; the annual rate went from 5.3 percent to 2.1 percent during that same period.
Many at Westinghouse say their school is a better place than before Total Quality Management. On a recent morning in Miss Costa's English class, students were busy helping each other write resumes. Seventeen-year-old Trelane Spencer sat with four other teen-agers, all of whom will be the first in their families to graduate from high school.
Like every other student in Miss Costa's class, Trelane keeps an evaluation sheet of his completed homework scores and test grades. By looking at the sheet, he knows exactly what it takes to be a good student.
"I feel like I'm learning a lot," said Trelane, who wants to be a cabinetmaker. "I feel like if you give teachers respect, they will return the same thing."
Not long ago, Trelane and his classmates gave Miss Costa a "reverse report card" on her instructional style. "They said, 'Miss Costa, please shut up! You talk too much,' " the teacher recalled with pride. "I think it's great. It's one of the things I needed to work on. I've cut down on teacher-dominated lessons."
Miss Costa, a veteran teacher who has immersed herself in the teachings of T.Q.M., views herself now as coach, adviser and co-worker. "As far as the students, I'm looking at them as young people I'm coaching in the best way I can to have a strong sense of self to be whatever they want to be."
Joel Bossous, a social studies teacher, agrees. Sometimes, he lets the students take over.
"When they see other students do it, they get more involved," he said.
Westinghouse High faces problems typical of many inner-city schools with troubled students. In the last seven years, school officials have attended the funerals of about 50 of their students.
Although the school is open to residents throughout the city, most students come from poor neighborhoods in Brooklyn, with half from nearby housing projects. Most of of the students, or their parents, chose Westinghouse over their neighborhood school.
The school offers training in trade skills such as cabinetry, electronics and jewelry-making. Graduates must pass an exam showing they have mastered their specialty field.
When the school's principal, Lewis Rappaport, hired an old colleague and friend, Mr. Schargel, as an assistant principal in 1987, they pondered how to improve the school. A banker in the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce told them about quality management programs. Soon, the administrators began attending corporate workshops. In 1991, a quality improvement team of staff volunteers was organized.
Some answers were simple. One of its first orders of business was to increase parents' support. The P.T.A. had only 12 members. After distributing a survey to parents, the team found P.T.A. attendance grew if meetings were held Wednesday instead of Monday. Now, the P.T.A. has 211 members.
"It's growing," said Theresa Brown, a mother who noted that 18 parents attended one recent meeting. "I do believe in my heart that things are changing for the better here at Westinghouse."
To reduce its dropout rate, Westinghouse identified 151 students who were failing every course during the 1991 spring term. They were listed on a Board of Education printout that no one had looked at. The students received counseling and tutoring and they had to sign contracts spelling out their responsibilities, as well as their parents' and the school's. By the end of the year, 58 students transferred to other schools. Of the 93 remaining, the number of students failing every class shrank to 11.
"We're now data-checking everything," Mr. Schargel said.
Attracted by the school's successes, the Ricoh Corporation, a leading Japanese maker of copiers, teamed up with the school last year, training the students as repair people. Their circuit boards are now just as good as those of Ricoh employees, a spokesman said.
Many principles embodied by Total Quality Management, such as shared decision making and teamwork, have been in place in some of the most progressive schools for decades. But Mr. Schargel says the overall approach makes the best educational practices even more effective. "I call it organized common sense," he said.
Bruce Sobers, a senior, said he got funny looks from students when he tried to explain T.Q.M. He has gone to I.B.M.-sponsored retreats and is enrolled in a leadership class, where books on Total Quality Management are required reading.
He believes it is just a matter of time before most of his classmates catch on.
"We break it down. In business, there are customers. In school, there are customers. They are students. What problems do they face? What can we do to improve it?"
And what has Total Quality Management meant to him? "My highest goal is to get a Ph.D. in any subject area," he said cheerfully.
But not everyone is sold. In fact, according to Mr. Schargel, only about 60 percent of the Westinghouse teachers use the approach in their classroom. Jerry Stern is one of those resisting change.
Mr. Stern said the school is free to try whatever it wants, but he prefers to teach the old-fashioned way. In his global history class, he stands front and center. His guide is the textbook.
"I have to spend more time getting the subject matter across than to deal with these side issues," he said with a shrug.

HEADLINE: Stocks, Ignoring Influential Factors, End the Day Mixed

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market closed mixed but essentially unchanged yesterday, despite a variety of powerful crosscurrents.
Those factors included continuing speculation about the $1.5 billion in portfolio losses of Orange County, Calif., and whether calculation problems at the nation's largest mutual fund, Fidelity Magellan, would slow the flow of money into stocks, an essential support for stock prices. 
 In the last three sessions, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 index have shown relatively little reaction to news, like evidence that the economy may be overheating, that often sends stock prices tumbling.
Some analysts say one reason is that those indexes are often used in sophisticated trading strategies known as arbitrage. In contrast, the Nasdaq composite index, which is less often used in arbitrage, has had deeper losses. The other stock indexes are bound to drop eventually, these analysts say, because of overpriced and under-yielding stocks.
Yesterday the Dow industrials rose 4.03 points, to 3,745.95, while the broader S.& P. 500 fell 0.22 point, to 453.11. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index dropped 4.48 points, to 741.23.
On the New York Stock Exchange, four stocks dropped for every three that rose, with 1,282 declining stocks and 943 advancing stocks.
On the New York Stock Exchange 300.2 million shares changed hands, about 4 percent higher than this year's average of 288 million shares.
Despite the small movements in the main indexes, "there was quite a reaction to the day's news," especially to investors' speculation that Orange County might declare bankruptcy, said Todd Clark, senior director of equity trading at Mabon Securities.
But the reaction was mostly in the bond market, Mr. Clark said. Yesterday traders were selling stocks to buy shorter-term fixed-income securities, he added, and "you can see that in the flattening of the yield curve, where people don't want to be at risk in the 30-years when you've got this uncertainty in Orange County."
For example, less than 1 percentage point of interest separates a Government security that matures in one year (7.12 percent yield) and one that matures in 2024 (7.84 percent). That lowers the cost of corporate borrowing and helps stocks.
The news that Fidelity Magellan was canceling its year-end distribution because of a mistake in calculation, was eventually shrugged off by market professionals as having little consequence for money flows into stock funds.
"When the average I.R.A. holder looks at his mutual fund statement next month and sees a minus sign, he'll say 'whoa,' " said David D. Holt, vice president, research and strategy, for Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles. "But people are slow to change. They won't let one year stampede them out of equities."
Conmed rose 3 1/2, to 26 1/4, on news that it would buy a rival medical products company, Birtcher Medical Systems, for $16.4 million in stock.
Checkmate Electronics, which makes equipment that electronically reads checks and other documents, fell 2, to 7 1/2, after an analyst at Raymond James & Associates lowered his assessment to "hold," from "buy." Intelligent Electronics Inc. fell 3 1/8, to 9 3/8, after an article in The Wall Street Journal questioned the company's marketing practices. The company disputed the article.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.23 point, to 247.85, and the American Stock Exchange market-value index fell 1.24 points, to 431.01.

Large California Utility Accepts Rate-Cut Plan

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
To prepare itself for more competition, Pacific Gas and Electric, the nation's largest investor-owned utility, said yesterday that it had agreed with consumer groups and state agencies to cut its rates by about $2.1 billion during the next five years.
Rates would be reduced by 32 percent on power produced at its huge Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant.
The announcement was unusual because the utility had a 1988 contract under which it could have collected increasing rates. 
 "We could have said, 'A deal is a deal'," Robert W. Glynn Jr., executive vice president of the utility, said in an interview yesterday. "That would have worked in the old days, but in the new world what you have to do is reflect the competitive situation."
Indeed, in the past most utilities would have fought the consumer groups, regulators and the state agencies. The California groups wanted the nuclear plant agreement renegotiated to reduce rates that totaled 11.9 cents a kilowatt-hour and would have risen to 13.3 cents by 1999. The average cost of generating a kilowatt-hour of electricity on P.G.& E.'s system is 6.2 cents.
The agreement reached in 1988 was seen by consumers and their advocates as an increasingly unfair burden and out of line with the drive by regulators to bring down the cost of electricity in California, which has some of the highest rates in the nation.
As have many other utilities, P.G.&E. has been striving to reduce operating costs and rates to prepare for the time when customers will be able to choose where to buy electricity.
The California Public Utilities Commission proposed this year that large industrial customers be able to buy electricity by 1996 from other utilities and independent producers and that small customers be able to shop for power by 2002.
Mr. Glynn said that by renegotiating the contract, the company would bring down its rates -- its goal is to lower its average rate to 10 cents a kilowatt-hour by 1999 from 10.6 cents at present -- and be in a better position to react if the commission goes ahead with its proposal.
Utilities in New York and New Jersey are also on similar drives to prepare themselves, even though regulators in those states have not yet made formal moves to encourage competition.
The Pacific Gas and Electric move results from an agreement reached in 1988 to deal with the huge cost overruns the utility faced in building its Diablo Canyon plant.
The utility absorbed the $5.5 billion in construction costs, rather than passing them through to customers in the form of higher rates. Instead, it cut its dividend.
Under the agreement, however, P.G.&E. was to be paid for the output of the plant's electricity with rates that were to go up each year to account for inflation and other costs.
When the agreement was negotiated, the cost of power was expected to go up sharply, and electricity was expected to be in tight supply. But the cost of power has been dropping and plenty is available on the wholesale market for as low as 3 cents a kilowatt-hour.
The Diablo Canyon plant, which accounts for about 18 percent of the utility's revenue, has been operating efficiently and has been a major source of profit.
The agreement announced yesterday, which was negotiated with the division of rate payer advocates of the California Public Utilities Commission, the Attorney General of California and a broad range of consumer groups, is subject to approval by the commission.

HEADLINE: Completions Of Homes Drop

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6

 BODY:
The number of housing units completed in October declined 2.3 percent from a month earlier, the Commerce Department said today.
Completions lag behind the starts of new construction by about six months. 
 October's drop, to an annual rate of 1.373 million completions, followed a revised increase of 4.8 percent in September, to 1.406 million. The September increase had earlier been reported as 4.9 percent.
The index peaked in May at an annual rate of 1.446 million, and since then has been moving in a choppy manner, with the trend downward. That is not surprising, because mortgage rates have been moving higher for much of the year, after six increases in interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
The number of housing units under construction rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in October, to an annual rate of 783,000, after increasing 1 percent in September, to a rate of 776,000.
All the figures are adjusted for seasonal variations.

In a development that was anticipated and dreaded, collective bargaining broke off in the National Hockey League today after the owners re-introduced their demand for a harsh tax on high payrolls.
The players' association said the surcharge was unacceptable because it acts as a salary cap to restrain wages and that this issue threatened the season, which has already been postponed for 67 days by an owner-ordered lockout. 
 Mike Gartner, president of the union, said there was "very little" chance of even a partial season being played and that the renewed tax proposal "was like throwing water on a flaming fire" after recent optimism, progress and compromise over other key issues.
"Right now, the owners are being gluttons about it," said Gartner, a right wing for the Toronto Maple Leafs. "They've been gobbling up everything we've been giving and now they are saying 'We want more, more and more.' "
Gary Bettman, commissioner of the N.H.L., said he introduced the tax after negotiations stalled on several other issues, such as free agency for veteran players, an entry-level salary cap for rookies and arbitration procedures for those in between.
"Before we even got to the discussion of the contribution plan, it was clear that we were too far apart on the substance," said Bettman, referring to the other issues. "The players told us that they had gone as far as they could."
With the 84-game regular season already reduced to 60 games, the N.H.L. board of governors has scheduled a meeting for Monday in New York. It is likely that collective bargaining will be discussed and that a so-called "drop-dead" date for the cancellation of the season will be considered. "The board is going to have to focus very hard on the profound decisions that will have to be made," said Bettman.
Bob Goodenow, executive director of the union, said "prospects are very bleak right now" and called the tax issue "counterproductive and dangerous."
The league has said it needs "drag" on salary inflation because, as a group, the 26 clubs lost $37.6 million last season, and more losses are expected.
Bettman called the league proposal "a graduated contribution that maxed out at 25 per cent of team payroll" and he said the money generated by it "would in essence go to help teams that need help to be more competitive."
Bettman also said the players were not compromising enough with the financial reality of the sport.
"They want to maintain the status quo, even if it is something that makes a good number of our teams unprofitable and not competitive," Bettman said. "When there is a real willingness to confront those issues, we are prepared to be flexible and open."
The players have said repeatedly that they doubt the owners assertions of financial hardship, that they have demanded nothing in the bargaining and that they, not the owners, have made all the concessions.
On the surface, Bettman's latest proposal differs dramatically from his last one, which called for a luxury tax of 122 per cent on amount of payroll in excess of a predetermined trigger point.
But the union contends that the new proposal is almost as punishing because it taxes the team's entire payroll total after it has reached the trigger point, not just the the excess over the trigger point. That point would be $18 million in the first season and would go up $1 million each year of the contract.
For instance:
If a team's payroll was $17,999,999.99, it would pay no tax. But if the payroll was $20 million, the tax would be $700,000. At $21 million, the tax would be $1.1 million.
Kelly Miller of the Washington Capitals, a union vice-president, said he disagreed with Bettman's assertion that the two sides were far apart before the new tax proposal was introduced.
Early in the day, they discussed arbitration, but came to no conclusion. Owners want it to be nonbinding for up to two players per team per season. The union, stating that only 10 players went to arbitration in the 26-team league last season, rejected that proposal, saying that if arbitration is nonbinding on the owners who don't like the decision, it also should be nonbinding on the players if they don't like the decision.
On the other issues, which neared tentative settlement on Monday, rookies would be limited to about $1 million in their first season, including signing bonuses but not including performance bonuses. Veterans would get free agency around the age of 30 or 31. Owners dropped their demand for a "franchise player" who would be exempt from free agency.
Compromise on these issues increased after Bettman removed the tax proposal, at least temporarily, last month. The talks, Miller said, broke down over re-emergence of the tax concept.
"We feel we were real close in putting together a deal," Miller said. "Overall, the framework was there. We've been bargaining under the notion that there would be no tax. It's crazy for them at this juncture to throw the tax over it. Gary Bettman has been dying to get this tax on the table and he pulled it out with flying colors today."
Gartner said he "can't see us going any further than we've gone.
"We've given them basically everything they wanted," he said, mentioning a rookie salary cap, elimination of arbitration for rookies, trimming of free-agency rights for young players and changes in arbitration rules that are favorable to owners.
"If they stick to their tax plan, the chances of a season happening right now are close to none."

HEADLINE: Mr. Clinton Will Miss Mr. Bentsen

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's resignation is bad news to a battered White House. Mr. Bentsen knows best what the Administration desperately needs to learn: how to deal with a Republican-led Congress. His consistent voice for policy moderation will be missed among a chorus of advisers who remain befuddled about what the voters meant when they rejected the Democrats.
Mr. Bentsen's clout on Capitol Hill was important to Mr. Clinton's major legislative victories. He fought hard within the Administration, and then in Congress, for a budget that would cut the deficit and raise spending on training and education -- beating back advice from White House pollsters who pushed Mr. Clinton to promise a tax cut he knew the Government could not afford. 
 He also overcame bad advice from Democrats like the majority leader, Richard Gephardt, and independents like Ross Perot to scuttle Nafta, the free-trade accord with Mexico and Canada. He rounded up desperately needed votes in the Senate last week for the GATT trade agreement.
Mr. Bentsen marshaled votes against a balanced-budget amendment that, among other glaring faults, would have stymied the Government's ability to fight off recession. He also deserves praise for refraining from taking cheap shots at the Federal Reserve Board for raising interest rates as the economy grew at a rate he knew was unsustainable.
Mr. Bentsen did not always win. His advocacy of a politically feasible health-care bill lost out to First Lady Hillary Clinton's grander plan.
And at times, he carried caution too far. He did not push for ambitious policies -- overhauling the tax code, for example -- that could address profound economic problems like the nation's stagnant productivity or pathetically low savings rate.
Mr. Bentsen has thus left a void that the Republicans intend to fill, unfortunately, with tax policies to reward the rich and punish the poor.
Robert Rubin, another fiscal moderate, who runs the President's National Economic Council, will be nominated to replace Mr. Bentsen. He is a wise choice; as one Administration official observed, Mr. Rubin, the wealthy former head of Goldman Sachs, has the "highest ratio of money to ego" in Washington. He is a seasoned financial expert who wins policy fights without bruising the feelings of his White House colleagues.
But even if Mr. Rubin counsels his President well, he will find it hard to replace Mr. Bentsen in one respect. Mr. Clinton will have lost the one Cabinet Secretary who came with built-in credibility in Congress.

HEADLINE: Is 'We the People' Too Counterculture?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Recent actions by our elected representatives make it obvious that the foxes are guarding the hen house. 
 Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican point man in the Senate on the campaign finance reform issue, has assured us that "campaign finance reform will not be on the agenda" ("New Life for Campaign Reform?", editorial, Dec. 1). Nice of him to let us know that money and materialism will continue to subvert our democracy.
Remember when we thought we might be getting guaranteed health care, like the citizens of other industrial giants? I'm so relieved that the insurance industry (with millions of dollars of bribe money) made our elected representatives see the light.
Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr., from the tobacco state of Virginia, who has been given a committee chairmanship with responsibility for the health of the electorate, has stated that he sees no reason to pursue further tobacco regulation. This despite the fact that cigarettes are laced with toxic chemicals and are an addictive health hazard.
The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has passed: a boon for the American worker, right? Yes, if you are highly trained in one of the fields for which no cheap labor or unprotected natural resources have been secured in another part of the world. Yes, the gross national product will rise, but who will benefit? The same people who have benefited all along, the rich and the powerful.
Let's face it; democracy has gotten in the way of capitalism. It's just too counterculture. We keep demanding outrageous things like preservation of the environment, equal access to education, full employment, a respectable salary and health care for all. Nice concepts, to be sure, but just too expensive for competitive advantage in the world market.
When we become consumers first and citizens second, we become collaborators in the war on humanity.

HEADLINE: Nationalism Slows Foreign Adoptions in Russia

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Seven-month-old Lena, a lifetime resident of the Vladimir children's home, made it through the confusion that rules foreign adoptions in Russia these days.
In the next crib, Alyona, 10 months old and weighing just over 4 pounds, may not be so lucky. Her adoption by American parents, which seemed imminent the day before Thanksgiving, was suddenly suspended last week by local authorities in Vladimir, 150 miles east of Moscow. 
 "I'm in a panic," said Saniya M. Baslovyak, the director of the orphanage, when she heard the news. "They just stopped the whole thing."
The adoptive parents are expected to arrive in Vladimir on Thursday, but it is not certain that they will be able to take Alyona home.
A new bill on adoption has passed the lower house of the Russian Parliament that would require a thorough and possibly time-consuming search for Russian parents. Many critics believe that if it becomes law, it will close off to American parents one of their greatest opportunities for adoption.
The uncertainty has already panicked prospective parents. It has frozen many adoptions and made it impossible for officials to predict when -- if ever -- they will resume.
"Realistically," said Tamara K. Fitzgerald, the American Embassy official in charge of Russian adoptions, "we are looking at a shutdown of at least six months."
The Russian Government has said it will permit pending adoptions to be completed. But not in all cases. Lena, the 7-month-old, went home to the United States with her American parents last week.
Though the request by Alyona's adoptive parents had been approved by local officials, the couple briefly withdrew their offer to try to measure her health problems; she weighed 1.5 pounds at birth. Once reassured, they proceeded -- too late.
The local authorities said that because the prospective parents had technically withdrawn their bid, they would have to start anew. And, until a new law is put in place, the regional administration in Vladimir said no new adoptions would go forward. Mrs. Baslovyak, who tirelessly lobbied local bureaucrats to allow Alyona to be an exception, said today that she felt more optimistic.
Supporters of the new law insist it will thwart unscrupulous baby merchants and make it easier for Russian and foreign parents to adopt. But, like a draft law that sought to mandate AIDS tests for all foreign visitors to Russia, the new adoption law also seems responsive to rising nationalism.
The American Embassy had warned that a de facto moratorium on foreign adoptions would begin in December.
Some adoption agents say that those clients who came anyway were able to pick up their children as planned. But many other couples said they could not afford the risk of coming home empty-handed.
"We are not rich and we can only do this once," said a 38-year-old woman in Westchester County, who spoke on the condition that her name not be used. "But now there is a baby's room upstairs with no baby in it, and there is a child over there who didn't get us."
Ms. Fitzgerald said she believed the bill will pass. Even if it is amended in the upper house, she said, foreign adoptions will certainly stop while new procedures are put in place.
Before the new law, the Government allowed foreigners to adopt only children with mental or physical disabilities. Many babies with minor, correctable problems were available.
The new rules would allow even healthy children to be adopted overseas, but only after a thorough nationwide search for Russian parents. That tracking process is what most concerns the bill's critics.
The law currently requires the establishment of a data bank of all adoptable children in Russia so that, for example, prospective parents in Vladivostok could be made aware of a child in St. Petersburg. But in a country without even a computerized system to record stock trades, creating a mechanism for children could bog down adoptions for years.
"We have told the lawmakers in Moscow that a federal data bank is completely impossible," said Valentina P. Khiger, director of social services for the Vladimir region. There are no computers in her office; as in most regions, orphanages keep track of data in old-fashioned ledgers.
Many people who seek to adopt children in the United States must wait for years; increasingly, even those who find a child fear the birth parents will r reclaim the child. Americans increasingly seek to adopt overseas, and Russia is particularly attractive to those who want white babies.
In 1993, 746 Russian children were adopted by American citizens. This year, the number more than doubled and the embassy says it has another 800 American cases pending.
The steep increase has become a potent issue for Russian newspapers and politicians. "Our children have become an export item," fumed Tamara V. Pletnyova, a Communist member of Parliament at a recent open meeting of the Committee on Women and the Family. "Our most important task is to exert more control over foreign adoptions."
Mrs. Pletnyova said in an interview that she had recently visited the United States to check on how American families were raising their Russian babies. "I met a little boy who was adopted six months ago," she said. "I asked him his name in Russian, and he answered me in English. I cried."
She said it was a national disgrace that so many Russian children could not be cared for by their own country.
Dr. Baslovyak, who has 100 children under her care, said she agreed -- up to a point. "But if a child cannot find a family in his own country," she said, "then he should go to a family wherever he can find one." One third of her charges are severely impaired, and the rest have minor health problems ranging from low birth weights to rickets.
She said that such children are more likely to find a home in the West than in Russia, where there is more of a stigma about handicaps. Westerners also have greater resources to correct some ailments that are almost insurmountable in Russia.
Another disputed provision is a ban on "intermediaries." The wording is vague, and most nonprofit agencies that are already licensed in Russia are confident they will be re-accredited. The provision, experts said, is aimed at discouraging adoption "facilitators" and "coordinators" who, for a fee, guide parents through the bureaucracy and paperwork, often providing transportation, housing and translation. Parents can spend as much as $20,000 to adopt a child in Russia, depending on how long they stay and how far they travel. All agencies use intermediaries to facilitate adoptions.
"The reality is that for Americans," Ms. Fitzgerald said, "it is almost impossible to adopt without intermediaries."
There are scandals. Last year, Russia's prosecutor general complained about abuses committed by Rights of the Child, a Russian adoption agency established by the Ministry of Education in 1991. Among the allegations was a charge that the agency was illegally charging $1,000 per child. The weekly newspaper Sobesednik has reported that the organization was privatized, and is still in operation.
Some newspapers have published scathing denunciations of baby-selling and profit-mongering agents.
No Government officials or legislators interviewed cited specific incidents of baby smuggling or extortion.
Instead they complained about the growing number of agencies -- and agents -- flooding the market. "It's one thing when you have one or two or three intermediaries," said Irina N. Volodina, head of the Education Ministry's department for the social protection of children. "But when it's a whole team of people, it's too big a scale -- it's an assembly line."
Felicia Van Pragh, director of international adoptions at the nonprofit Spence-Chapin agency in New York, was sanguine about the new law. "There is general confusion and some panic, but I think it is unnecessary," she said. "Yes, there will be some sort of slow-down while they reorganize to meet new requirements, but I am confident adoption will pick up again. " But even she quailed at the prospect of a national data bank. "For the whole of Russia, that would be quite a job," she said. "It will take years."
Sitting with other anxious families in a cramped office in the American Embassy, Mara Kamen, 32, an actuary from Falls Church, Va., fed 7-month old Jaclyn (whose Russian name was Anya) from a plastic bag of Cheerios she had brought from home. Nearby her husband, Russell Lusher, 38, an economist, cradled 19-month-old Steven (Slava) with one arm and signed the check for the babies' visas with the other.
They had raced to Russia ahead of schedule last week, frantic that they would miss their chance. Mr. Lusher said he was no longer upset about how Russia's new law would affect foreign adoption. "Frankly, I was most concerned that we wouldn't be able to do it," he said.
Ms. Fitzgerald, who filled out a preliminary adoption request form for herself the day before she learned of the new regulations, explained that she would not be as lucky.
"I am at the center of the storm here," she said quietly. "And I got trapped just the same as everyone else."

HEADLINE: White House Memo;
A Wounded President Strives Not to Become a Lame Duck

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
As President Clinton approaches the midpoint of his term at a new low point, he is struggling in private deliberations and public speeches to reposition himself on political ground that perpetually reopens beneath him. But he has no easy choices, faces attacks from resurgent Republicans and despondent Democrats alike and has been put to some pains simply to preserve his authority.
A national poll conducted over the weekend by the Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press found Mr. Clinton trailing a generic Republican opponent for 1996. More ominously, fully two-thirds of Democrats surveyed wanted to see other candidates challenge him for the Democratic nomination. 
 The strains showed on Tuesday night in the President's gingery address here to the Democratic Leadership Council, the centrist group he helped found and rode to victory, whose leaders now suggest that he may be a big part of the Democrats' electoral problem, not the solution.
"I ask you now once again to think about what your responsibility is," Mr. Clinton told the group just hours after its chairman, Representative Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma, an old friend, had criticized him as a "transitional figure" crippled by the tension between his New Democrat's mind and his old Democrat's heart.
"What is your responsibility?" Mr. Clinton demanded. "It's to join me in the arena -- not in the peanut gallery, in the arena -- and fight, and roll up your sleeves, and be willing to make a mistake now and then, be willing to put your shoulder to the wheel, be willing to engage, be willing to struggle, be willing to debate and enjoy this."
But enjoying "this" seems about the last thing the Clinton White House is doing these days, and there is no clear sign of what "this" is, apart from the President's oft-voiced description of himself as the champion of hard-working Americans.
White House aides say that the President is planning what they describe as a major address for next week but that it will probably not go into such detail, instead remaining a general statement of his principles, unlikely to win live network coverage.
The political team that will help Mr. Clinton refine his agenda remains incomplete -- most notably, there is no Democratic national chairman -- and the economic team that will nail down specifics has just changed with the resignation of the Administration's most grizzled hand, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. Time is short.
"I think the next four to six months are crucial for him and will be determinative in a lot of ways," said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. "It's crucial for him to be in charge of his own destiny.
"The period right now is really not about explaining what happened," Mr. Garin said of the Democrats' rout at the polls last month, "but about understanding what happened and moving forward -- smartly."
Summing up a view of many Democrats, Mr. Garin said the President's challenge was threefold: to define his legislative agenda succinctly as a fight for the economic well-being of the middle class, to claim the middle ground by seizing on any signs of extremism among the Republicans and to present a much clearer picture of himself as a persistent leader and a man of conviction.
On Monday, the Progressive Policy Institute, the policy arm of the Democratic Leadership Council, issued its own 10-point alternative to the House Republicans' "Contract With America," including government loans for worker retraining, cuts in tax subsidies for favored industries and a campaign against teen-age pregnancy.
While Mr. Clinton has been warm to such ideas and to others, including a tax cut for the middle class, he has neither embraced nor rejected details.
The bulk of Mr. Clinton's proposals on taxes and other issues is to be embodied in his State of the Union Message and his budget message early next year, but there, too, time is short. The State of the Union, whose scheduling is at the sufferance of Congress, is tentatively set for the fourth week in January, but senior Administration officials acknowledged today that there had been some talk of whether it was wise to first give the Republicans so much time to make their own case in the new Congress, which convenes on Jan. 4.
In his speech on Tuesday night, Mr. Clinton offered an impassioned defense of his efforts to cut the Federal budget deficit, promote free trade and economic growth, ban assault weapons, put more police officers on the nation's streets and even lift the military's ban on homosexuals. He suggested that he had been held to account for the very breadth and difficulty of his agenda.
"That's the thing I regret about this election more than anything else," he said. "All the people who are working harder for lower wages and less security than they were 10 years ago, they're the people I ran to help. All the people who are trying to follow the rules, and are sick and tired of people benefiting who don't, who take advantage of the system whether they're rich or poor or somewhere in between -- those are the folks that the Democratic Party ought to be championing and the ones who will ultimately benefit if we stay on the right course.
"Well," the President added, "we did a lot of things that they didn't like very much -- especially after it got explained to them, as we say at home. I think I was right when I opposed discrimination and intolerance, but a lot of folks thought I was just more concerned about minorities than the problems for the majority."
George Stephanopoulos, a senior Presidential adviser, said Mr. Clinton's speech was a "very personal statement" that he intended to "fight for the people, working people, of this country, fight hard, and the rest will take care of itself."
Aides said the President was waiting to make several staff changes at the White House until they could be announced all together, probably later this month. For example, Erskine Bowles, now a deputy chief of staff, is expected to be named chairman of the National Economic Council, succeeding Robert E. Rubin, whom the President has chosen to replace Mr. Bentsen at Treasury. And Doug Sosnick, a legislative aide close to another deputy chief of staff, Harold M. Ickes, is mentioned as a leading candidate for White House political director.
Several people in the Administration and in the party say the hope is to find someone from the Midwest, a vital electoral region for the President, to head the Democratic National Committee in time for the party's winter meeting in mid-January. Those often mentioned include William Daley, the Chicago lawyer who helped lead Mr. Clinton's effort to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement last year, and Representative Mike Synar of Oklahoma, who was defeated in a primary for re-election this fall.
In addition, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown is mentioned as a leading candidate to head Mr. Clinton's re-election effort, although several senior aides caution that any such decision will be made much later.
At least one member of Mr. Clinton's team, Mr. Bentsen, warned today against counting the President out.
"Let me tell you something about this President," Mr. Bentsen told "Fox TV Morning News." "He's a comeback fellow. He's done that time and time again."

HEADLINE: In Shift, Pataki Backs Legalized Casino Gambling to Aid Tourism

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Governor-elect George E. Pataki said today that he would support legalizing casino gambling in the state to boost a tourism industry that he said had been battered by the spread of casinos in nearby states and on an Indian reservation near Syracuse.
Mr. Pataki has in the past opposed legalizing gambling, as has Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who leaves office Dec. 31. But Mr. Pataki said that the booming casino business on Indian reservations in Connecticut and in the central New York town of Verona had caused him to rethink his opposition. 
 Legalizing gambling beyond Indian reservations would involve amending the state constitution, a lengthy process that requires having the proposal passed by two consecutively elected Legislatures and then approved by voters. The earliest a proposal could go to referendum would be November 1997.
The Governor does not play a direct role in the constitutional process because he does not sign and cannot veto an amendment. But the executive office can provide a powerful bully pulpit to advance the idea, and for that reason many proponents of casino gambling view today's comments from the Governor-elect as an important step forward.
"We have to be in a position where the state has the ability to have more control and possibility of getting revenue -- property taxes, sales taxes, income taxes -- from this industry," Mr. Pataki said in a news conference. He added that he would like to see the proposal move forward in the coming year.
Mr. Pataki's comments were made during two wide-ranging news conferences in which he also said that he wanted to review a state policy of extending health benefits to the live-in partners of state employees and that it would be difficult for the state to pick up a larger share of the Medicaid costs borne by local governments in the coming year.
His support for casinos could help win passage in the Republican-controlled Senate, where opposition has been strongest. In the last legislative session, the Democrat-controlled Assembly passed a casino bill.
"To have the support of the Governor I think would change a few minds," said Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Westchester County Republican and a leading proponent of casino gambling.
The Senate's new majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, who has opposed casino legislation in the past, said today he would not block a bill if the majority of the Senate Republicans supported it. "It isn't an issue of whether or not we should have gambling -- we already have it," said Mr. Bruno, who is an ally of Mr. Pataki.
Senator Frank Padavan, a Queens Republican who has been a leading opponent of casino gambling, said that even if the Legislature twice passed a casino bill, voters would probably reject it, as happened in Florida and two other states that had casino referendums this year.
Mr. Pataki said he still would want to study the economic and social impact of casino gambling before a proposal was presented to voters. But he said that if the state's economic and tourism climate remained shaky, he would support sending the amendment to a referendum.
Speaking on the issue of extending health benefits to domestic partners, Mr. Pataki said he was concerned that the policy would significantly increase state costs at a time when it is struggling to close a projected $5 billion budget shortfall. Those benefits are guaranteed in union contract provisions that take effect Jan. 1, the same day Mr. Pataki is to be sworn in.
Mr. Pataki seemed to open the door to rescinding the benefits -- whose costs have not been calculated by the state -- next year when his administration begins new contract negotiations with its seven unions.
On Medicaid, Mr. Pataki said that given the state's fiscal predicament, there was little chance he would be able to begin a state assumption of all local Medicaid costs in his first year.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Weakens in Reaction To Filing by Orange County

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar weakened against most leading currencies yesterday, falling below 100 Japanese yen.
Concerns that the bankruptcy filing by Orange County, Calif., would weigh on American stock and bond markets helped to drag down the value of the dollar, currency dealers said. Orange County filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday to keep nervous lenders and investors from draining its investment fund, which has dropped in value by at least $1.5 billion. Some dealers said they feared that investors would flee from dollar-denominated assets. 
 Municipal bonds were indeed shaken by the filing, more so than the market for Treasuries. Stocks fell as well, but the filing had little discernible impact on that market.
Win Thin, international economist at MCM Currencywatch Inc., said worries about the impact of the Orange County filing might have been overblown and been magnified in an otherwise slow trading day.
After falling in European trading and early trading in New York, the dollar recovered to settle just moderately lower. The dollar slipped to 99.95 yen, from 100.09 yen in New York on Tuesday. The dollar fell to 1.5677 German marks, from 1.5720 marks on Tuesday.
Though the dollar fell below 100 yen for the first time since Thursday, "people aren't seeing that as a significant level, either psychologically or technically," David Durst, a vice president at Bear, Stearns & Company, said. "Perhaps it's because we've gone back and forth so many times this year."
The dollar drew strength yesterday from comments by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, that signaled the Fed would continue to raise interest rates. Mr. Greenspan told a Congressional panel that inflation might rise soon.
In other trading, the British pound rose after the Bank of England raised short-term interest rates for the first time since September, to 6.25 percent from 5.75 percent. The pound was quoted in New York at $1.5651, up from $1.5622 on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Envisions An Expansion Of Free Trade In Hemisphere

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
At a meeting in Miami this weekend, the United States and 34 countries in Latin America will announce plans to expand the North American Free Trade Agreement to include virtually all countries in the hemisphere in the next decade, officials from several countries said today.
The agreement, reached after long negotiations over the last several days, calls for the creation of a "Free Trade Area of the Americas" by 2005. 
 Separately, the United States, Mexico and Canada are expected to announce that Chile will be included in the North American Free Trade Agreement in the next several years.
Initially the United States was reluctant to set a target date for the expansion of the trade agreement, which was narrowly passed after a long battle in Congress. But at a meeting at the State Department on Friday, many of the countries that will be represented at the Miami meeting surprised the Administration by insisting on a specific date for a free trade accord that would give them the same trade benefits now enjoyed by Mexico.
"Until then, we didn't understand how strong the momentum was," a senior Administration official involved in the talks said today.
Getting these countries up to the standards required under the terms of the free trade agreement in the next 10 years will not be easy. Mexico is dominated by a single party, a pliant Parliament and a very powerful economic elite that had a huge stake in free trade with the United States and the power to order the economic changes that the agreement requires.
But other countries in the hemisphere may find it politically difficult to accept the stringent economic requirements of a free trade accord, particularly the provisions guaranteeing basic worker rights -- from minimum wages to working conditions -- and protection of the environment.
Such protections, long an issue with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and other labor groups that contend American workers are being undercut by imports from countries that exploit workers and resources, are referred to only in the vaguest terms in the draft communique that the 34 nations plan to issue at the conclusion of the conference on Sunday.
In the draft, the countries agree to "strive to make our trade liberalization and environmental policies mutually supportive," and to "secure the observance and promotion of worker rights, as defined by appropriate international conventions."
The Clinton Administration contends that such wording was a major victory, because Brazil and other countries wanted no reference to worker rights or the environment in the communique.
"We pushed very, very hard," one official involved in the talks said. "They agreed only because everyone wants a successful summit."
But in a nine-page letter to President Clinton today, the House Democratic leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, warned that the election last month was "a wake-up call" that the priority in all trade agreements must be "improving the economic lives of working people" in the United States.
That means, he said, that the Administration must not "have another Nafta-like debate that divides the Democratic Party."
In the debate over the free trade agreement and the arguments surrounding the approval last week of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Administration has argued that free trade ultimately aids American workers by opening vast new export markets, especially in Asia and in Latin America.
But that argument presupposes a growing middle class in each of those countries, prosperous enough to buy American goods.
That has already happened in many parts of Asia and in much of Latin America. But some officials in the Clinton Administration say they fear that unless Latin American workers are guaranteed a bigger share of the region's growth, only elites will end up benefiting.
"Of course, there is a human rights issue here for workers," one member of Mr. Clinton's Cabinet said. "But there is also a commercial issue for the United States. Without a rapidly expanding middle class, there is no market for us."
The communique also calls for governments to give "serious consideration" to joining human rights protocols that they have not yet signed, to promote "equal legal rights" for women, to battle corruption with a series of specific steps "including stiff penalties for those who use their public position to benefit private interests," and to freeze funds involved in money laundering and drug trafficking.
The accord also calls for the countries to strengthen extradition treaties to fight terrorism.
At the White House today, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said that a hemispheric trade accord is vital because if the United States does not take the lead on trade "we're going to find that the Japanese and the Europeans are going to work to be their partners, and they will be the ones that will be creating jobs back home, instead of this country."
Initially, the Administration planned the meeting as largely a political event, celebrating the spread of democracy in the region. When President Johnson attended the last Latin American summit meeting, in Uruguay in 1967, 11 of the countries represented were run by authoritarian, un-elected governments. All 34 countries at this summit are democratically elected; Cuba is the only country in the region that will not attend.

HEADLINE: Stock Prices Slip a Bit On Bankruptcy Filing

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Stock prices fell yesterday after the unprecedented bankruptcy filing by Orange County, Calif., but what was puzzling was stock traders' apparently mild reaction, which analysts said was misleading.
"You've got a market that's eroding bit by bit, one day here, then one day there," said Alan R. Shaw, manager of technical research at Smith Barney, referring to a 35-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average since last Thursday, and nearly 200 points in the last six weeks. "It's like a battle where soldiers are retreating one by one, until the generals find themselves all alone at the front." 
 Yesterday, the Dow fell 10.43 points, or only 0.28 percent, to 3,735.52, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 fell 1.88 points, or 0.41 percent, to 451.23. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index fell the steepest. It dropped 6.96 points, or 0.94 percent, to 734.27.
In other important markets, the Orange County filing sent bond prices plunging and the value of the dollar lower early in the session, but traders bid up bonds and the dollar by day's end. Analysts attributed the recovery in the dollar largely to Congressional testimony from Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Mr. Greenspan implied in more direct language than ever that the Fed would continue to raise interest rates, which dampens inflation and thus tends to support bond prices and the dollar.
Considering the potential seriousness of the events in Orange County, the bond and currency markets hardly reacted. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 7.89 percent from 7.84 percent and the dollar fell to 99.95 yen from 100.09.
"Net-net, we haven't had much of a movement today," said Chris Madell, head of United States Government bond trading at First Chicago Capital Markets. "But you must remember that the textbook theories of what markets will do are now completely out the window." Economic reports that seem to call for a selloff of bonds sometimes result in a rush to buy bonds, he noted.
"The watchword seems to be, Don't trade the numbers, trade the reaction to the numbers" and join the market crowd, he said.
Beneath the surface appearance of the stock indexes, the overall stock market looked troubled, analysts said. On the New York Stock Exchange, more than two stocks fell for every one that rose, or 1,548 decliners and 691 advancers. Only 8 stocks established new highs, while 171 established new lows.
Moreover, current prices on the Big Board are falling closer and closer to long-term moving averages, a signal of a widespread deterioration in prices. The New York Stock Exchange Index fell 1 point, to 246.85 yesterday, or only 24 percent above the 200-day moving average. The lowest point for the year was Nov. 23 at 23 percent above the average.
Some stocks rose. The Continental Corporation's share climbed 4 3/4, to 18 3/4, after the insurance company agreed to be bought by the CNA Financial Corporation for $1.1 billion.
Most stocks fell. Merrill Lynch was probably the most prominent Wall Street casualty of the Orange County debacle. Merrill has collateralized debt from the county but is also a holder of millions of dollars in county bonds and other securities. Its stock fell 1 1/4, to 35, for a one-day loss in market capitalization of about $254 million.
Shares of Physician Corporation also fell 2 1/2, to 22 1/4, after analysts at Paine Webber and Merrill Lynch reduced their earnings estimates.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was about normal, with 285.6 million shares changing hands, nearly equal to this year's daily average of 288 million shares.
 The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 1.82 points, to 429.19.

HEADLINE: Gains in Productivity Reported for 3d Quarter

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
American businesses improved their productivity during the third quarter of this year while keeping wages in check and inflation at bay.
A revised report released today by the Labor Department showed non-farm productivity up at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.9 percent in the July-to-September period, higher than the 2.7 percent initially reported. 
 "Productivity is the most important silver lining of this recovery," said Stephen S. Roach, senior economist with Morgan Stanley & Company in New York. "In 14 quarters of recovery, productivity has risen a little more than 2 percent per year, half a percent faster than the productivity gains should have been, given this relatively weak recovery in our economy."
Mr. Roach said increasing productivity "reflects the positive benefits of corporate restructuring and re-engineering and a significant response to extraordinary competitive pressures."
The Labor Department said productivity -- output per number of hours worked -- rebounded from a 2.1 percent decline in the second quarter. The decline in the April-through-June period was the first since a 2 percent decrease in the January-through-March period of 1993 and the steepest since a 3.7 percent plunge in the first quarter of 1989.
The report showed also that unit labor costs, which represent about two-thirds of the cost of a product, were unchanged, the best showing since a 2.4 percent decline in the last quarter of 1993. A modest one-tenth of 1 percent increase was reported initially.
"Normally at this stage of the business cycle unit labor costs are not rising 0.8 percent year over year; they're up 6.1 percent," Mr. Roach said. "We are really in a rarefied zone of sharply diminished cost pressures, and in my opinion there's nothing but good news out there on U.S. inflation."
Investors watch closely for any signs of inflation, which can devalue long-term holdings. The Federal Reserve has pushed up short-term interest rates six times this year in an effort to stem inflationary pressures.
Many economists say labor costs have remained in check because workers fear losing jobs if they demand higher wages or more costly benefits.
Unit labor costs were held down despite an inflation-adjusted 3 percent increase in hourly compensation, compared with seven-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter. Hourly compensation rose 6.1 percent in the first quarter.
The Labor Department said output was up 4.2 percent at an annual rate, higher than the 3.9 percent reported earlier.
The increase in productivity among manufacturing businesses slowed, rising 3.6 percent in the third quarter after increases of 5.6 percent in the second quarter and 6.4 percent in the first. Manufacturing output was up 5.7 percent, compared with a 7.2 percent second-quarter increase.
Nearly 20 percent of American business sector employment is in manufacturing.
Total business productivity, including farming, was up 3.5 percent, more than the 3.1 percent first reported. That compares with a 2 percent drop from April through June.

Orange County's Bankruptcy

HEADLINE: Kmart Signs Store Lease Near Macy's

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
In a city where some of the most prominent landmarks bear names like Tiffany's, Saks and Bergdorf Goodman, another is on the way: Kmart.
For years a staple of suburban retailing, the discount chain signed a lease yesterday for what would be the company's largest store this side of Alaska, on West 34th Street a half-block from one of New York City's most famous department stores, Macy's. 
 The store, one of 2,350 in the Kmart chain, will take up about 140,000 square feet of space at One Penn Plaza (which is actually one-fifteenth the size of the unarguably large Macy's). And in its first foray into Manhattan, Kmart is adding a decidedly New York sensibility: the store will be vertical and largely underground, taking up four levels of the 57-story skyscraper, three of them below the surface.
The store, which is expected to be open for the 1995 holiday shopping season, would lead directly onto the concourse level of the Long Island Rail Road at Pennsylvania Station, meaning that suburban commuters could find a touch of home as soon as they arrived for work.
Although the idea of such a huge mass-market discount store in Manhattan may strike some as an incongruity, it is only the latest in a move toward suburbanlike shopping that has seen a dozen or more so-called superstores opening in Manhattan since 1991 in Chelsea, at Union Square and on 34th Street.
Among Manhattan's new superstores are several Barnes & Noble bookstores; the clothing stores Today's Man, T. J. Maxx and Daffy's; Bed, Bath and Beyond; Toys "R" Us and the department store Bradlees, which last month opened a store with more than 150,000 square feet just south of Union Square, the only new retail outlet bigger than the planned Kmart.
Manhattan's Kmart will offer 100,000 items, with everything from prescription drugs to best-selling books. The only larger Kmart is in Anchorage.
"Suddenly, it has occurred to a lot of retailers that people in Manhattan may not be so different from people in the suburbs or the rest of the country," said Peter Siris, a retail analyst for UBS Securities. "They are saying let's give Manhattan a shot."
No state and city subsidies or tax abatements were offered to lure the giant retailer. As America becomes saturated with discount outlets like Kmart and Wal-Mart, high-rent urban centers like Manhattan have become more attractive. The Manhattan move is part of a larger strategy by Kmart to tap fresh markets in the face of flagging earnings and sharp cost cutbacks. Because of aggressive openings in recent years, Kmart officials said they now have at least one store in each of the most populous 50 metropolitan areas.
Kmart, which had been searching for a Manhattan site for five years, acknowledged that the move represents a gamble on what it calls its most expensive location ever, though it declined to disclose its investment or financial details. In fact, Kmart is entering an already crowded retail arena. Both Sears, Roebuck and J. C. Penny have been negotiating for the space occupied by the Abraham & Straus store between 32d and 33d Streets on the Avenue of the Americas. Federated Department Stores, owner of A.& S., has said it wants to sell that store.
Nonetheless, Joseph E. Antonini, Kmart's chairman, said the company was expecting sales to be the largest of any of its stores.
"This is a win-win deal for everyone," said Peter L. Malkin, a co-owner of the building with Harry B. Helmsley and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. "Kmart will have access to the hundreds of thousands of people who work and shop in the 34th Street-Herald Square area, attend events at Madison Square Garden and ride the Long Island Rail Road and Amtrak. New York City will benefit from the 500 or more jobs created by the store, and the sales tax and other taxes generated, estimated at over $125 million in the initial term of the lease."
The property owners said that accumulating the needed square footage in a building that was not designed to accommodate a single large tenant was difficult. "Obtaining possession of the former F. W. Woolworth store, even though it was only 5,448 square feet, was the key to the puzzle," said Daniel E. North, the Helmsley-Spear Inc. executive who negotiated the deal for the owners.
Twenty-seven additional spaces were assembled. Leases with existing tenants had to be canceled and shops relocated, Mr. North said.
R. H. Macy & Company, which operates the world's largest store with a total of 2 million square feet less than a block away, had no comment yesterday.
In addition to the kinds of merchandise offered, and Kmart's more mass-market orientation, Kmart differs from Macy's in that it buys huge volumes of merchandise that are distributed from a central point, allowing the discount store to greatly shave traditional retail markups.
Mr. Antonini said that he did not think one store would hurt the other. Both Kmart and Macy's have "their core customers," he said. "Together, we'll bring more people to the hub."
Indeed, the new Kmart is expected to give a stimulus to 34th Street, which had historically been one of the world's busiest shopping strips but had lost some of its luster in recent years. "This is an extremely important development for New York," said Walter Loeb, a retail analyst and publisher of the Loeb Retail Letter. "It revitalizes another part of the city."
New York seems to be a bet more retailers are making, largely because of the improving economics of doing business in Manhattan. Faith Consolo, managing director of Garrick Aug, a Manhattan brokerage that specializes in retail space, said the chain superstores have been attracted by falling rents, large blocks of empty retail space, declining crime rates and a surge in tourism bringing new shoppers to the city.
She sees a clear place for a discounter like Kmart. "This is the value-oriented 90's," she said. "People in the city want the kind of choices this store will provide, and not have to go to the suburbs to find them."
Kmart officials say they had trouble finding a site in the past because they found real estate to be prohibitively expensive. Manhattan's landscape is also a new experience for the chain, with its one-story stores surrounded by large parking lots.
But Kmart has gradually been taking over buildings constructed for other uses in urban centers around the country. It opened a two-story store two years ago in a former Bloomingdale's in Fresh Meadows, Queens, and it has performed in the top 10 percent of Kmarts. The chain currently has a total of four stores in the five boroughs.
"Our heritage and culture has been one-story," Mr. Antonini said.
He added that a furious cost-cutting drive has increased profit margins sufficiently so that Kmart can move into areas formerly considered uneconomical because of high taxes and other costs.
The Kmart that opened on Thanksgiving weekend at Co-op City in the Bronx posted the highest opening days sales of any Kmart ever.Kmart also has two stores on Staten Island, both opened 20 years ago, and is looking for more in other boroughs.
At the same time, Kmart has closed 110 stores in other markets, mainly small ones in less profitable locations. By the end of February, the company expects to come up even in openings and closings, said Mary C. McGeachy, a spokeswoman for Kmart.
Kmart, which has taken cost-cutting steps like ordering workers to shut off office lights, has suffered from declining earnings over seven quarters. And in the third quarter of this year, net income fell sharply.
Yesterday, around 34th Street, there was a variety of unofficial views on Kmart's chances of success.
"I like everything about Kmart, the prices are beautiful," said M. Powell from Brooklyn, entering the Sports Authority on Seventh Avenue, a new sporting goods superstore partly owned by Kmart.
Others were skeptical. "Kmart is not a store I shop in," said Steve Zito, a Long Islander entering Macy's. "It's the low end."
One advantage Macy's is unlikely to sacrifice is its lure as a special shopping attraction. Rheyma Baldwin, who lives in the Poconos, said she had taken a bus to New York especially to visit Macy's. "I love everything here," she said. "They have unique things from all over.
"And," she added, "we have Kmarts in Pennsylvania."

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeking To Lift Cloud Over Rapport With Moscow

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Stung by Moscow's opposition to their proposal to expand NATO, Clinton Administration officials acknowledged today that relations with Russia had sunk to their lowest level in years.
Eager to ease the tension, Administration officials said that high-level contacts had opened this week and that Vice President Al Gore would seek to mend fences next week in Moscow. 
Several officials said they were surprised by the bitterness of the attack against NATO's expansion that President Boris N. Yeltsin made on Monday in Budapest, saying the Russian leader was not merely playing to his domestic audience but was underlining important differences between Moscow and Washington.
"We obviously have some very serious problems about how we are going to deal with Russia over the next months and couple of years about the future of Europe," said a senior Administration official.
Another official said, "Clearly, we're going through a rougher patch in our relations with Russia than we had in 1992 or 1993."
The differences were underlined at a NATO meeting last week in Brussels when Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev angered and embarrassed the United States and other Western nations by refusing to sign documents that spelled out Moscow's plans to cooperate with what NATO calls the Partnership for Peace, a loose association with former Soviet-bloc countries.
Tensions are also running high over Bosnia, with Russia joining France and Britain in opposing the Administration's calls -- now renounced -- for air strikes against the Serbs. Russia also blocked a Security Council resolution last Friday that would have tightened the embargo against the Serbs.
Experts see other reasons for worsening relations, including Russian fears that Washington is bullying Moscow and that the Republican landslide victory last month will mean more hostility.
Many Russians also protest that the West is trying to dictate economic policies to turn Russia into a capitalist replica of the West. Those tensions were aggravated on Tuesday when the International Monetary Fund warned that it might not issue $12 billion in planned loans to Russia because its economic program was not strict enough in reducing its budget deficit and slashing inflation. Russian legislators had already complained that the economic plan was far too harsh.
"I would say we're seeing the worst relations since 1984," said Dimitri Simes, a Russia expert who is president of the Nixon Center on Peace and Freedom in Washington. "We're seeing a fundamental worsening of the relations, which reflects not domestic Russian circumstances, not the Republican Congressional victory, not Bosnia, but trends in Russia that once again make it a serious power with nationalist interests and an increasingly assertive manner."
Washington and Moscow will not be able to patch up relations until they reach agreement over President Clinton's proposal to enlarge NATO, Administration officials say. The plan, endorsed by NATO, is to spell out for Eastern European nations next year the conditions for joining NATO as part of a gradual expansion.
Viewing expansion as an anti-Russian move, Mr. Yeltsin reacted bitterly in Budapest, saying, "Why are you sowing the seeds of mistrust?"
According to Administration officials, their strategy will be to explain to the Yeltsin Government that widening NATO will advance Russia's goal of stability in central Europe.
But some officials acknowledge that such an explanation might not placate the Yeltsin Government, which is worried that it is being left out of the new security structure that NATO is developing.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher spoke with Mr. Kozyrev this week to reassure him. Vice President Gore is to meet with Mr. Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin next week as part of semi-annual talks in which senior official discuss economic, environmental and other issues. But Mr. Gore will no doubt discuss NATO, Administration officials say. So will Defense Secretary William J. Perry, who is due in Moscow next Thursday.
While their talks will seek narrow difference, these officials also intend to make clear that Washington is firmly committed to expanding NATO, a senior Administration official said.
Several officials sought to play down down the differences between Moscow and Washington, noting that both nations continue to cooperate in the Mideast, Ukraine and North Korea. They also point to Russia's acceptance of international peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh, the region of Azerbaijan that is immersed in civil war.

HEADLINE: ORANGE COUNTY'S BANKRUPTCY: THE TEMPTATIONS;
The Search for Municipal 'Cowboys'

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
Are there other Orange Counties out there?
The answer, experts say, is a qualified yes. While the bankruptcy of Orange County in California has gotten the attention, there are clear signs that similar problems exist elsewhere in the country. Dozens of local governments have already posted multi-million-dollar losses from ill-fated interest rate bets. 
 "There's probably more than one cowboy out there like Orange County," Peter Jordan, a managing director at Fitch Investment Services, said.
Orange County seems in a league of its own. The county's $20 billion investment pool is bigger than most and its investments were far more aggressive. Still, with nearly 80,000 state and local government agencies having billions in public dollars to invest, the lure for higher yields tempted many into making investment decisions that have come back to haunt them.
The securities creating most of the problems at municipalities around the country are mortgage-backed derivatives. These are tailor-made securities created by dividing pools of mortgages into newly repackaged instruments, some of which move in the same direction as interest rates, some in the opposite direction.
In all cases, though, their central attraction is that they take simple interest rate swings and accelerate the moves.
Best of all from Wall Street's point of view, these derivatives are highly profitable products for brokers to sell to local officials, who, many now say, did not fully understand what they were buying.
"All major Wall Street firms sold this stuff and anyone who now says they didn't handle derivatives is not telling you the truth," said Guy Cecalla, publisher of Inside Mortgage Securities, an industry newsletter.
About $200 billion of the $700 billion of mortgage-backed derivatives outstanding, Mr. Cecalla estimated, were particularly risky.
"Once the safer ones were sold," Mr. Cecalla said, "there were more volatile ones left over. Those are the ones that were sold to many of these municipalities. The fact that school systems ended up buying this stuff is inconceivable. Why would anyone in their right mind touch this stuff, if you understood its downside risk?"
Across the country, these kinds of mortgage-backed derivatives have already led to financial pain. A Texas junior college faces a potential loss of $22 million; a Chicago city college has $96 million invested in an asset that cannot be sold. An Indian tribe lost $5 million. San Diego's investment fund, which has about a quarter of its $3.3 billion fund in derivatives, has lost 10.7 percent of its value, county treasurer Paul Boland said yesterday.
All this comes atop large losses that many local governments are facing simply because of the general decline in bond prices this year. Cuyahoga County, Ohio, for example, paid off 80 other investors in a $1.8 billion fund, absorbed the rest of the losses itself and recently said it must cut its operating budget next year by at least $11 million.
A Texas state investment fund holding cash for 1,300 schools, utilities and local governments said yesterday that its estimated losses have escalated to $70 million.
"You can throw darts at a map of the United States," said Joe Mysak, editor of the Grant's Municipal Bond Observer newsletter, "and wherever one hits, there will be losses."
One of those darts hit Auburn, Me., where $16 million of the city's $43 million operating budget is invested in mortgage-backed derivatives that are now worth only $10 million. This money, invested by the town's former finance director, is earmarked to run the city and its schools.
"We are going to have to cut back on services and some capital items," Patricia Finnegan, the acting city manager, said.
Should state and local treasurers, often lacking the skills of more sophisticated corporate managers, be able to invest such huge sums of taxpayer dollars with so little oversight, disclosure and accountability?
"You look at some of the municipal finance managers," said Barry Barbash, director of investment management for the Securities and Exchange Commission, "and you have to question how much expertise they have. It raises some real questions and there will be some real inquiries by Congress."
Derivatives are securities linked to underlying assets -- stocks and bonds or financial indexes. The gain or losses of the derivatives depend on the performance of the asset. Derivatives can result in losses that investors may never have imagined.
The Government Finance Officers Association, a trade group that helps local municipalities, issued a warning earlier this year about derivatives, saying they should be approached with "extreme caution."
"We had a number of our members," said Betsy Dotson, a spokeswoman for the association, "saying that they had gotten a lot of cold calls from brokerage houses and they were promised a lot of things by these brokers."
Besides Wall Street firms, a large number of the municipal derivatives sold came from a small group of Houston firms, some of which are now being sued by disgruntled local governments. The Houston brokers involved in many of the problem situations are: the Government Securities Corporation; Hart Securities Inc.; MGSI Securities Inc., and Westcap Securities L.P.
Some states have already banned the use of derivatives by public agencies. Colorado approved investment guidelines in 1993 that prohibit the use of long-term and volatile bonds, as well as derivatives.
In the New York area, the legislature in Albany prevents state and local governments from investing in derivatives. No such rules exist in New Jersey, but state officials in Trenton say that no problems with derivatives or major investment losses have cropped up.
Fortunately, most municipal finance officers are conservative investors. "I don't think that you are going to see a great deal of these heavily leveraged situations," said Richard Larkin, a managing director at Standard & Poor's Rating Group. "I'm not so naive to think we won't see more. But I think it is a handful who will get into trouble."
Still, S.E.C. commissioner Richard Y. Roberts said, no one can anticipate what problems may arise.
"I've got my fingers crossed," he said.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Keycorp Will Take $100 Million in Charges

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Keycorp, the latest Midwest banking casualty of rising interest rates, said today that it would take $100 million in charges against its earnings in the fourth quarter and next year's first quarter.
The nation's 11th-largest banking company said the charges would reduce its vulnerability to rising rates, which squeezed profits on its fixed-rate loans and complicated its merger with the Society Corporation earlier this year. 
 "With all of the things that have happened to our company in the last 10 months, with the merger and rapid loan growth, we got ourselves in this situation," Robert Gillespie, company president, said.
Keycorp joins other major banks that have warned Wall Street that 1994 or 1995 earnings could be reduced because of rising interest rates. Those banks include Banc One of Columbus, Ohio, and PNC Bank and Mellon Bank of Pittburgh.
"There are only a couple of companies that we can find that need to restructure their balance sheet, and most of them have done it already," said a Paine Webber analyst, Thomas McCandless. "PNC is the exception."
Keycorp's shares slipped to a 52-year low of $23.625 after the company disclosed the charges, but they later rebounded to close at $24.625, up 62.5 cents for the day.
Keycorp said the $100 million in pretax charges stemmed from the planned sale of about $1.5 billion in low-yielding United States Treasury and Federal National Mortgage Association securities. Derivatives aren't involved, Mr. Gillespie said.
The company said the charges are expected to produce 1994 net income that is 4.2 percent less than Wall Street's mean earnings estimate, and 5.8 percent below 1995 mean earnings estimates. The Cleveland-based company still expects to report record 1994 net income.
The charges from selling low-yielding, longer-maturity securities "will likely result in a pretax loss of up to $100 million spread over the remainder of 1994 and the first quarter of 1995," said Jim Wert, Keycorp's chief financial officer.
Because of the actions, the company expects to recognize a fourth-quarter charge of $25 million to $35 million, or 7 cents to 10 cents a share.
Keycorp was expected to earn 94 cents a share in the fourth quarter, based on the mean estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by Institutional Brokers Estimate System.
The charges will trim 1994 earnings to between $3.45 a share and $3.50, compared with a Wall Street mean estimate of $3.60 a share.
The remaining charges of $65 million to $75 million will likely be recognized in the first quarter of 1995, said Victor Riley Jr., chairman and chief executive.

20 Castles for Sale (With 65 Handyman Specials)

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BOITZENBURG, Germany

 BODY:
Like scores of central European villages, this one is dominated by an imposing castle from which the surrounding region was once ruled. The Boitzenburg castle is an imposing mass of towers, gables, steeples and cornices that has been owned by a series of noble families from the time it was first occupied in 1271.
Set on a 24-acre plot in a forested landscape that has changed little over the centuries, it is surrounded by streams and ponds and has more than 150 rooms. It is also one of 20 castles in eastern Germany that have been put up for sale. 
 They range from palatial mansions worth millions of dollars to several that may be had for just one mark, the equivalent of about 65 cents. The sale is being run by the agency charged with selling off property that formerly belonged to the Communist Government of East Germany.
Hundreds of bidders have already submitted offers, and the privatization agency has sent out more than 6,000 copies of its lavishly illustrated catalogue, which is titled "Fairy Tales for Sale." Bids will be accepted until Dec. 14, and the Government hopes to complete the sale of at least some castles within a few months.
"Price will not be the deciding factor," said Elke Schicktanz, an official of the privatization agency. "We are looking for offers that provide solid, long-term, economically feasible proposals for how the properties will be used."
Miss Schicktanz said that the largest number of bids so far had come from Germany, but that of the offers from abroad, most had come from the United States.
"Americans have capital, initiative and flexibility," she said. "They realize that each of these castles is a unique historical and architectural treasure. Chances to buy properties like these don't come along very often."
In recent decades, the Boitzenburg castle was used as a vacation resort for officers of the East German Army. It is in good structural condition, and some of its most famous features, like the richly decorated stucco ceiling in the "hunter's room," which was created in 1630, remain intact. But much of the original floor plan has been altered, and many rooms have been spoiled with tasteless wallpaper and cheap linoleum.
About 1,500 people live in the village of Boitzenburg, and many of them hope that whoever buys the castle will help revitalize a region stricken by unemployment and the dashed hopes of prosperity that followed German unification in 1990.
"People have mixed feelings," said Gabrielle Macher, who runs the local public library. "A hotel or a conference center would be nice, but we don't want mass tourism or something that will ruin our peace and quiet. Maybe someone could turn it into a clinic or a retirement home, or even something cultural, like a center for exhibitions or concerts."
Not all of the 20 castles now for sale offer as many possibilities as Boitzenburg. Thirty miles west of here, in the isolated village of Zernikow, a brick manor house that was once home to a medieval order of knights is in an advanced state of decay. Although there were apartments on the second floor as recently as a decade ago, the challenges for a buyer would be considerable. By one estimate, renovating the property would cost $3 million and upkeep would run to $65,000 a year.
Near the manor house on a recent afternoon, a farmer laughed when asked what he thought a future owner might do with it. "Tear it down, I guess," he said. "I can't imagine that anyone would actually buy it."
Although the Government has not placed price tags on either property, officials are hoping to get at least $10 million for the Boitzenburg castle. They would sell the Zernikow manse for one mark to a bidder with an imaginative plan and the money to execute it.
Other castles now for sale are spread across the entire territory of the former East Germany. Among those for which the most offers have been received are several in southern Thuringia and Saxony, regions that border on the wealthy western states of Hessen and Bavaria.
Many of the castles are registered historical landmarks, and new owners will have to work with preservationists when planning renovations.
"It's a shame that these monuments have to be sold to private owners, but I can't see any other solution," said Sibylle Badstubner-Groger, an art historian who works with groups seeking to preserve German castles. "Local communities can't afford to renovate or maintain them, and neither can state governments. We would welcome new users, especially if they keep the buildings at least partly open to the public.
"You can come up with all kinds of fantasies for these places. How about a small museum, with a few apartments upstairs? There are plenty of rich art collectors in western Germany and the United States who don't have a really outstanding place to display what they own. Why not buy a castle that's a work of art in itself?"

Greenspan's Comments Send Bond Prices Lower

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of longer-term Treasury securities fell sharply yesterday after Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, indicated to Congress that the central bank would be raising interest rates again. Prices were also pulled lower by worries about the bankruptcy filing of Orange County, Calif., which faces big losses in its investment fund.
In testimony before the Joint Economic Committee, Mr. Greenspan said the economy was continuing to grow briskly despite six interest-rate increases by the Fed already this year. And he said that he expected inflation, which is running at about 3 percent, to begin rising soon. 
 Mr. Greenspan did not say specifically that the central bank would raise interest rates, but his comments were interpreted as a clear signal of intent. While most analysts are expecting the Fed to raise rates, but are debating when, the comments added to concern in an already nervous market.
Mr. Greenspan's comments seemed to dispel any notion that the Orange County situation would slow a plan to raise rates. The county filed for bankruptcy protection because it faces $1.5 billion in losses in its investment fund. The potential losses stem from a strategy of heavy borrowing, the purchase of of often-volatile financial instruments called derivatives and a bet that interest rates would fall, even as they began to rise this year.
In an effort to calm the nerves of investors and play down Orange County, Mr. Greenspan said, "I don't consider it as something that gives me great concern." He added that the situation was being closely studied by regulators.
Treasury prices at the close of New York trading were mixed, with the 30-year bond down 14/32 , to a price of 9517/32 for a yield of 7.89 percent, up five basis points from Tuesday's session. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The shorter end of the Treasury market was buoyed by what appeared to be a flight from stocks and the municipal market.
Traders said prices of municipal bonds having nothing to do with Orange County fell sharply, with the yield on the Bond Buyer muni bond index jumping to 7.06 percent, from 6.92 percent on Tuesday.
But it was much harder to tell what happened to Orange County municipal bonds and to those of the school districts and other units that invest in the county's fund. There appeared to be little trading in those bonds, as investors decided to wait on developments in the bankruptcy case. But Bloomberg Business News reported that some traders said some Orange County paper was being offered at 50 cents on the dollar, apparently without many takers.
Many investors decided quickly yesterday that Orange County would not be the only municipality to show losses because of aggressive investing in risky products, like derivatives, or because of heavy borrowing. James Hale, a fixed-income analyst with MMS International, said Texpool, the $3.7 billion Texas investment pool, reported that it had paper losses of $70 million. "It fueled more fears that there are probably many more agencies in trouble," Mr. Hale said.
Chris Leary, a senior vice president and portfolio manager for SunAmerica Asset Management, said there were many shifting winds in the market yesterday. "We appeared to be unwinding from flattening trades," he said, "where people sell short maturities to buy long maturities." He said short maturities were the beneficiaries of a flight to quality stemming from the confusion surrounding Orange County. He said Treasury bills were also volatile.
John C. Mooney, portfolio manager on the muni side at SunAmerica, said there were many bids out yesterday, with yields on general municipal paper rising 15 to 20 basis points.
"Investors were mostly testing waters for reaction when they put bids," Mr. Mooney said. "There is so little known about municipal bankruptcy.".
Mr. Hale said he had not heard any specific talk about unannounced buying by the Fed. "While Orange County's bankruptcy obviously upset the markets," he said, "the fear is that they are not alone in having complex derivative problems." But he said he thought the Fed would want to insure adequate liquidity in the banking system to keep rates from moving higher.

HEADLINE: ORANGE COUNTY'S BANKRUPTCY: THE OVERVIEW;
Orange County Crisis Jolts Bond Market

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The sudden plunge of Orange County, Calif., into bankruptcy shook the market for public borrowing across the country yesterday, threatening to make it more expensive for many localities to borrow. It also left some Wall Street firms facing the potential of big losses.
And it served as a warning of how rapidly new and popular financial strategies can sour, leaving an apparently prosperous county unable to pay its bills. 
 Orange County, a suburban area south of Los Angeles that is more than twice the size of Long Island's Nassau County, filed for bankruptcy late Tuesday, after heavy borrowing and risky investments in its investment pool turned into big losers as market interest rates rose.
The investments had been made by a county desperate to get additional profits on its investments to pay for government services. But the fund, with about $8 billion invested in it -- and with borrowings of about $12 billion -- now faces a loss of at least $1.5 billion. And local governments that invested in the fund may also be unable to pay their bills, raising the possibility of additional bankruptcy filings.
"The bankruptcy filing by Orange County will have a far greater and far longer impact than just missing a payment on their debt," said Richard Larkin, a managing director of the Standard & Poor's Corporation, a bond rating agency.
The county said late yesterday it was able to meet all its payrolls. "The county has use of all its finances," said Bruce Bennett, the bankruptcy lawyer at Stutman, Treister & Glatt who is handling the case, adding that it did not need judicial approval to make the payments. "We are clearing all checks. Welfare checks went out today."
But the municipal bond market -- one of the largest in the country, with more than $1 trillion in outstanding issues -- was shaken. Traders said the bonds from most California issuers were quoted at sharp drops in prices -- with yields about 40-hundredths of a percentage point higher than Tuesday's level -- but there was no activity in them.
"There is no market in California issues," said Austin Tobin, president of the Delphis Hanover Corporation, which prices municipal bonds. "There probably won't be one for a couple of days."
The decline was felt in municipal bonds across the country, with the yield on the Bond Buyer municipal bond index leaping to 7.06 percent yesterday from 6.92 percent on Tuesday, while the rates on taxable Treasury bonds rose much less.
Much of the decline represented buyers pulling back in fear that other counties might have similar problems. It seems unlikely that any county invested quite as recklessly as did Robert L. Citron, who was forced to resign as the Orange County treasurer on Monday, but other governments took lesser risks.
"More losses will come out," said Joe Mysak, editor of Grant's Municipal Bond Observer, a New York publication that follows the municipal market. "The municipalities will blame Wall Street and the tight financial situation they are in."
The Wall Street exposure stems from billions of dollars in loans that firms made to Orange County's investment fund and to the possibility of lawsuits from the county stemming from the risky investments it made. It used those investments to bet on lower interest rates, both through conventional bonds and more esoteric investments, including derivative securities, whose rates fall when market interest rates rise. No such suits have yet been filed, and Wall Street firms have said they have no liability.
Still, there is a risk of suits. "The more complicated and the fancier these so-called investments are, the more the question of appropriateness comes to the fore," said Felix Rohatyn, a partner in the investment banking firm of Lazard Freres and a former chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which was formed in 1975 to help New York City after it was unable to pay its bills. "How can you allow taxpayer funds to be gambled with in this manner?" Mr. Rohatyn asked. "That is just inconceivable to me."
The largest of the investment banks to deal with Orange County was Merrill Lynch, whose shares fell $1.25, to $35, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. Merrill Lynch said its $2 billion in loans to the county were fully collateralized.
The restrictions on local investment policies have often dealt with the credit quality of the investments. But in this case, that was not a problem. The issue was losses stemming from changes in interest rates.
J. Chester Johnson, president of Government Financial Associates, an adviser to local governments, noted that cities and states were forced to disclose more financial information after the New York crisis. Now, he said, investment policies would have to be disclosed, and rules would be adopted to limit the riskiness of investments.
At a Congressional hearing yesterday, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, voiced caution about the need for legislation on the derivatives market.
"The trouble with legislation," he said, "is that it is very likely in this type of market to become rapidly obsolete, and could very readily become counterproductive to the required flexibility that we need to address the types of problems that we are addressing."
The Orange County fund had borrowed heavily to speculate on interest rates staying low or declining. As the rates have risen this year, the county's losses mounted, but until last week, the county maintained that there was no problem.
So unaware were local officials of the mounting losses that in June four education authorities with money in the fund -- the Orange County Board of Education, the Irvine Unified School District, the Newport-Mesa Unified School District and the North Orange County Community College District -- borrowed a total of $200 million solely to invest in the funds. Those borrowings were underwritten by Rauscher, Pierce Refnes, whose officials did not return telephone calls yesterday. Those notes will come due next June.
The fund had obtained higher yields than were generally available in the market through a variety of techniques, including borrowing to buy more securities. On Tuesday Wall Street firms began refusing to roll over those loans. That forced the bankruptcy filing, which the county said would stop the investment banks from seizing its collateral.
Whether the filing will accomplish that is not clear. Investment banks said they still had the right to sell the collateral, and it seemed likely that issue would end up in court.
The county tried on Tuesday to get the Securities and Exchange Commission to intervene to stop investment banks from seizing the collateral, but the agency declined.
Orange County's bonds had been rated AA by both Moody's Investors Service and S.& P., a very high investment grade rating. Yesterday, S.& P. cut its rating to CCC, a low junk-bond rating. Moody's suspended its rating.
It is not yet clear if bondholders in Orange County will suffer any losses. But it is clear that the county and many of its agencies will have to deal with lower income. That is likely to mean cuts in government spending, because tax increases are very hard to get in California, as a result of Proposition 13, which holds property taxes in check.
"You can pin this almost 100 percent on Proposition 13," said Dale Scott, a San Francisco financial adviser to local governments.
"The only reason people are out there trying to turn two dimes into a quarter is they can't finance basic needs anyway else," he added. "The Music Man comes in and says, 'I can get you 10 percent when everyone else gets 5 percent,' and he's a hero."


GRAPHIC: Many American investors are suffering from Orange County's decision to file for bankruptcy protection. The aftershocks are hitting them where it hurts -- in their pocketbooks.
 
Orange County's bondholders
Chart: "Millions of Losers"
The county has sold well over $500 million of tax-exempt bonds, which are generally bought by individuals, and hundreds of millions of dollars of taxable debt. Nobody knows whether the county will continue to make payments on its debts -- or even if if, legally, it can. And some kinds of bonds, such as those backed by insurance, may fare better than others.
Moody's Investors Service, which had given the county's debt high marks, suspended its ratings. Standard & Poor's cut its ratings on $1.6 billion or Orange County's debt to "speculative." The county's bonds are clearly worth less now than before the bankruptcy, but how much less remains uncertain, because the bonds did not trade yesterday.
 
Other bondholders
Some 180 cities, school districts, sewer agencies and the like invested in Orange County's ill-fated investment fund and now can't get their money out. These agencies sell bonds, too, and Standard & Poor's said it might lower the credit rating on more than $800 million of their debt.
In fact, all California bond issues suffered yesterday, as did the entire municipal bond market. The most actively traded issues, as measured by the Bond Buyer Municipal Index, lost $10.50 for every $1,000 of face value.

Portfolios with the most money in Orange County debt of all kinds, according to CDA/Spectrum's Bondwatch:

Putnam California Tax Exempt Income: $71.5 million
Merrill Lunch CMA Tax Exempt Fund: $68.9 million
Alliance Municipal Income Calif.: $65.6 million
Allstate Insurance Company: $45 million
 
Mutual funds
Bond funds that specialize in California debt fell 1.6 percent yesterday, according to Lipper Analytical Services. Hardest hit was Alliance Municipal California, which dropped almost 2.5 percent -- but many funds did not report their prices. California funds are owned almost exclusively by residents of that state, but some national funds may also own some affected bonds.
Early estimates showed a number of funds with big positions in the affected bonds, but fund companies say their exposure may be less than it appears. For example, Franklin California Tax Free Income, which looks like one of the bigggest holders, reports that only 0.16 percent of its $12.6 billion portfolio is in direct obligations of Orange County.
 
What investors should consider
Zane Mann, editor of the California Municipal Bond Advisory newsletter, suggests that bondholders sit tight. "If you don't sell, even the downgrading doesn't mean anything," he said.
For mutual fund investors, "It's tough luck," said Richard Lehman of the Bond Investors Association. Because mutual funds must mark their portfolios to market every night, investors in those funds have already lost money. But he, too, recommends hanging in until the picture becomes clearer. That way, "they may get a recovery," he said. "If they get out in the interim, they will take a hit." Leslie Eaton (pg. D1)

HEADLINE: ORANGE COUNTY'S BANKRUPTCY: THE PEOPLE;
Shock and Confusion In Offices and Streets

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: IRVINE, Calif., Dec. 7

 BODY:
It was easy money. As the California economy crashed all around them, local governments here in Orange County enjoyed what sometimes seemed a guilty pleasure: building, expanding and improving with the profits of a risky, high-wire investment fund.
While other cities around the state were making painful cutbacks, Huntington Beach built a children's addition to its library. 
 The City of Orange, which invested $28 million of its $125 million portfolio in the fund -- $8 million of it borrowed money -- used its profits to keep down fees and property taxes. "If you can make a two-point spread on $28 million, you're doing quite well," said David Dixon, the city manager, referring to extra return on the risky investments.
But the bubble burst on Tuesday. After years of high profits from its investment fund, Orange County declared bankruptcy when it was unable to roll over $1.2 billion in loans to its investment fund. Thus, it became the largest municipality ever to file for Federal bankruptcy protection. The action fended off creditors but also locked up funds invested by cities, some utilities and, most painfully, by school districts, which had been required by law to deposit their entire budgets into the fund.
At the Irvine Unified School District, with $106 million in the fund -- the most of any district -- officials were cloistered in meetings today, and only their secretaries, turning away a reporter, reflected the level of their pain.
"He is secluded," said the secretary to Paul Reed, the district's financial officer. "Let's just say he is secluded. We don't know, really, what all this means, and he's just trying to get some answers."
At the Anaheim City School District, not far away, Mel Lopez, the superintendent, said the questions were straightforward and frightening.
"All the school districts have a payroll to meet on Friday," he said. "If they don't allow us to withdraw from the fund at all, we don't know what we will do."
His district, with 18,000 students from kindergarten through the sixth grade, is the largest elementary school district in the county, with an annual budget of $71 million.
"We thought we were pretty solvent and we were pretty smug about our financial picture," he said. As of today, the district has stopped every purchase order that is not essential to the schools' survival and has rescinded job offers to new teachers.
"We are not spending any money, even for new books," Mr. Lopez said.
Don Watson, the city treasurer in Huntington Beach, said that city, too, had put a halt to spending. "Now we have to make a close watch on everything and not spend on anything we don't have to," he said.
One concern now, he said, is whether the city will be able to keep any new tax revenues it collects or whether those revenues will be impounded to make payments on the county's debt.
But officials of larger communities appeared less alarmed. "Don't panic" were the watchwords around the county, said Paul Brady Jr., the city manager of Irvine. Like officials in other larger cities, he insisted that day-to-day operations would not be affected because the investments represented discretionary capital and because the city's portfolio was diversified.
But he said long-term prospects were more uncertain.
"We are truly in the dark along with everyone else," he said. "We are getting bits and pieces of information and are all speculating, just like everybody else. Nobody really knows the whole picture. It's too big."
Even with all the uncertainty, the investment fund has its defenders.
Here in Irvine, a pristine, meticulously planned city that has risen on open farmland over 20 years, "It's been wonderful for us, " Mr. Brady said of the fund.
He said Irvine had increased its earnings by $8.5 million over the last 15 years by investing in the fund, sometimes borrowing millions to augment its investment. The profits paid for a senior center, built roads and parks and financed municipal improvements.
At the moment, Mr. Brady said, the city has $209 million in the county's investment pool as well as $315 million invested elsewhere.
At gasoline stations and shopping centers, the only places where people can be seen on the streets in this futuristic city of industrial parks and corporate headquarters, the bankruptcy touched off sparks.
"I think it's just typical of the respect that your average politicians and government officials have for your working people that pay the bills," said Bob King, a newspaper delivery man with a stack of copies of The Orange County Register bearing two-inch-high headlines reading simply, "BANKRUPTCY."
Tony Comella, an electronics salesman, glared at one of the newspapers. "You have all these legal minds and all this staff," he said, "and yet they ran it to the point here they have to declare bankruptcy."
And Helen Uldrich, who is retired from her job at a Christian broadcasting station, paused in her shopping to declare: "I'm shocked. Sometimes they tell us everything is O.K. when it isn't."

He insisted that daily operations would not be affected, despite investments in the Orange County fund, because the city's portfolio was diversified. But not all citizens were comforted. Helen Uldrich, above, leaving an Irvine grocery store, said, "I'm shocked. Sometimes they tell us everything is O.K. when it isn't." (Photographs by Jan Sonnenmair for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: GREENSPAN HINTS AT FURTHER RISES IN INTEREST RATES

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
In an unusually clear signal that the Federal Reserve will continue raising interest rates, its chairman, Alan Greenspan, said today that inflation might rise soon and that the economy was continuing to grow briskly.
The Federal Reserve has sought with six rate increases since February to brake economic growth in an effort to forestall inflationary shortages of goods and skilled workers. Mr. Greenspan told members of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee that "there is very little evidence throughout this economy of any degree of slowdown," 
 Producers of consumer goods face rising raw material prices and other expenses, he added, warning, "With demand for their output strong, finished-goods producers may soon attempt to pass on their higher costs."
Mr. Greenspan warned that if the Federal Reserve allowed inflation to rise now, Americans would begin to expect rising prices. "It is these expectations that make an inflationary process, once begun, difficult and expensive to reverse," he said.
When asked at a routine news conference today, Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, challenged Mr. Greenspan's prediction of rising prices. "At this point we don't see any inflationary pressures within the economy," she said. "We see continued growth, strong growth, very low inflation."
While Ms. Myers refused to discuss interest-rate policy, Clinton Administration officials have begun to chafe privately about the Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising rates this year.
Mr. Greenspan did not say explicitly that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates further. Like most Federal Reserve chairmen, he usually limits his public statements to careful generalities, avoiding language that could affect financial markets unduly. His unusually candid statements today coincided with a monthly report by the Federal Reserve concluding that the economy continued to grow in November at about the same pace as in previous months.
Labor Department statistics have not yet shown high inflation -- the prospect of which has so alarmed the Federal Reserve this year. Consumer prices rose only 2.6 percent in the 12-month period through October, and the pace of increases slowed in September and October. Producer prices actually dropped by half a percentage point in September and again in October.
But the monthly report, compiled by the Federal Reserve's 12 regional banks, found that producers were beginning to pass along their rising costs to consumers.
The Labor Department is scheduled to issue November figures for producer prices on Tuesday and for consumer prices on Wednesday.
When asked explicitly today whether the Federal Reserve would raise rates at the next meeting of its top policy committee on Dec. 20, Mr. Greenspan responded that he did not know. But he then volunteered that private economists' forecasts and changes in financial markets had indicated that short-term interest rates, which the Federal Reserve controls, would continue to climb next year.
Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, urged Mr. Greenspan not to be "the Grinch that stole Christmas" and added, "Let's hope that you're all not going to be Ebenezer Scrooges."
Financial industry economists have been divided over whether the Federal Reserve will act again on Dec. 20 or wait for the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee's subsequent meeting on Jan. 31. But interest rates have already risen for short-term Treasury securities to an extent that suggests a consensus is developing among private investors that the Federal Reserve will act again on Dec. 20.
Mr. Greenspan has the personal authority to push up interest rates between meetings.
The Federal Reserve has already raised rates six times this year. It has increased its target for the Federal funds rate, which banks pay to borrow money overnight, by a total of 2.5 percentage points, to 5.5 percent. The less important discount rate, which banks pay the Federal Reserve for short-term loans, has climbed by 1.75 percentage points, to 4.75 percent.
Any action at the Dec. 20 meeting would be likely to add fuel to the debate that followed its three-quarter-point rate increase last month. While inflation hawks worried that the move might not have gone far enough to damp down rising prices, other economists, along with some Democrats, business executives and organized labor worried that the Federal Reserve was hitting the brakes too hard.
Bruce Steinberg, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch, said that further interest rate increases could be risky. "They haven't reached the threshold for a recession in 1996 yet, but as you reach 7 percent on the Federal funds rate, the risk rises," he said.
Some business executives have suggested that basic changes in the American economy -- like growing international trade, the spread of new technologies and the shrinkage through layoffs of many big American companies -- have reduced the risk of inflation from brisk economic growth.
Executives of the Ford Motor Company said today that they saw no danger of inflation for this reason. Edward E. Hagenlocker, the president of Ford's automotive operations, said the auto maker was holding the line on its raw materials prices, urging its suppliers to contain costs by increasing productivity.
"Because of the strong productivity in the manufacturing sector, I don't see inflation, so from my perspective I don't see the need for another rate increase," Mr. Hagenlocker said in a briefing with reporters. He said expanding production capacity in the auto industry would keep auto makers from raising prices, although he refused to discuss Ford's own pricing plans.
But Mr. Greenspan took issue today with the idea that the American economy's susceptibility to inflation had changed much. "There is a significant element of truth in these arguments, but these developments are evolutionary, working slowly and incrementally over time," he said, later adding, "If we ignore experience, we would be taking unacceptable risks of higher inflation, economic and financial instability and ultimately subpar economic performance over time."
Two Republicans at today's hearing, Senator Connie Mack of Florida and Representative Jim Saxton of New Jersey, were mildly critical of the interest-rate increases. But Mr. Mack also said that he would seek legislation next year to change the Federal Reserve's mandate.
The current Federal Reserve goals of holding down unemployment and maintaining moderate long-term interest rates would be eliminated under the legislation, leaving a single goal of fighting inflation. Mr. Mack said that the Federal Reserve should have a target of limiting consumer price inflation to 2 percent, and Mr. Saxton said that he completely agreed that controlling inflation should be the Federal Reserve's sole job.
Mr. Greenspan said that he favored such legislation in principle, although he preferred a more vaguely worded inflation target, given the Labor Department's periodic revisions in how it calculates the Consumer Price Index. But Mr. Greenspan also cautioned that he could not speak for the Federal Reserve Board. It endorsed such a narrowing of the Federal Reserve's goals two years ago, but since then President Clinton has nominated two governors to the board, both of whom favor multiple goals.

HEADLINE: ORANGE COUNTY'S BANKRUPTCY: THE RULES OF THE GAME;
A Strategy's Creator Also Drafted the Law

BYLINE: By SALLIE HOFMEISTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 7

 BODY:
No one took advantage of a section in California state law allowing extra borrowing by counties as much as Robert L. Citron, the Orange County treasurer whose risky investment strategy drove the county into bankruptcy court on Tuesday. And who wrote the law? Mr. Citron.
In 1979, Mr. Citron, who was then the head of the state association of county treasurers, drafted a change in state law on counties' investments. The change allowed county treasurers, with permission from their boards of supervisors, to borrow money through so-called reverse repurchase agreements, or repos. Those instruments allow the purchase of securities with borrowed money, using the securities themselves as collateral. 
 The change was introduced into the Legislature by Chester Ray, a former Assemblyman from Orange County.
Having cracked open the gate, Mr. Citron drove right through it. In Orange County, Mr. Citron managed to buy $20 billion of securities with a down payment of about $7.8 billion, the amount invested by local government units. But when interest rates started rising this year, he found his large portfolio falling further and further behind, and county officials disclosed last week that its value was down 20 percent. Mr. Citron resigned on Monday.
"Many county portfolios are operating at a 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 percent loss because the market is down," said Terry Brennand, a lobbyist for the treasurers' group. "I don't know any county with a 20 percent loss, or any that were that leveraged, that much on margin, that much at risk."
The state law also accounts for why the losses did not come to light for so long. The law, which was intended to insulate day-to-day investment decisions from interference by local elected officials, left Mr. Citron to set strategy without supervision. Apart from the requirement that the county's five-member board of supervisors approve the use of repos, the board had no specific authority over Mr. Citron's portfolio, said David Kiff, spokesman for Thomas F. Riley, the chairman of the Orange County board.
And aside from monthly statements on interest income and the net asset value of the fund, the 187 local government units that invested in the county fund had little solid information on Mr. Citron's investments.
In the most recent annual report, dated Sept. 26, Mr. Citron painted a rosy picture of the investments. "We have constructed a well-balanced portfolio that we believe can withstand the impact of current interest rates," Mr. Citron wrote.
Mr. Citron was not alone in his power: With the exception of three appointed county treasurers who answer directly to their boards of supervisors -- in Los Angeles, Sacramento and Santa Clara counties -- all elected county treasurers in California operate independently, said Barbara Coates, president of the county treasurers' group.

HEADLINE: Consumer Borrowing Rises Again

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Consumer borrowing rose $11.62 billion in October, the 23d consecutive monthly gain, as retail sales remained healthy heading into the holidays, Federal Reserve figures showed today.
Robust consumer spending has continued to help economic activity, even though the Fed has made borrowing costlier by raising interest rates six times since February. The Fed's aim is to cool the growth rate and contain inflation. 
 So far, however, the combination of higher debt and higher interest charges is showing little evidence of reducing economic activity, although the consumer borrowing figures released today come from a month before the Fed's last rate increase on Nov. 15.
Today's report showed installment credit totaled $891.581 billion during October. In September, consumer credit rose a revised $10.333 billion. Initially, the Fed said consumer credit increased by $10.567 billion in September.
The Fed said that the annual rate of consumer borrowing ran at 15.8 percent during October compared with a 14.3 percent pace in September.
By category, credit-card borrowing increased by $4.886 billion in October, auto borrowing rose by $2.907 billion for the month and other types of personal loans climbed by $3.827 billion. The Fed's report does not track home equity loans.
Before today's report, a survey showed, economists expected an $11.1 billion increase in consumer credit in October.
Many analysts believe the economy, buoyed by strong Christmas sales, is growing at more than a 4 percent annual rate in this year's final quarter. In October, for example, retail sales increased 1.1 percent, the fifth consecutive monthly gain. Excluding autos, sales also advanced a solid six-tenths of a percent during the month, according to Commerce Department figures.

HEADLINE: German High Court Bans Energy Subsidy on Utility Bills

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Dec. 7

 BODY:
It is called the coal penny, or Kohlepfennig, and for two decades this surcharge on German electricity bills has subsidized the country's unprofitable coal industry, becoming a symbol of German insistence on maintaining costly energy production and mining jobs at consumers' expense.
But today, Germany's high court ruled that the surcharge was unconstitutional. In a decision that will force Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Government to increase taxes and possibly slash employment in the coal industry, the court ruled that the coal penny was a hidden tax and that the Government had to budget it as tax by moving it off consumers' bills and onto Government ledgers. 
 Economics Minister Gunter Rexrodt said that although the ruling would result in new taxes, "through the disappearance of the coal penny, the taxpayers in their role as electricity users will be relieved of some burden."
Still, it creates political problems for Bonn, with the tax increases expected to run more than $4 billion a year. The German people already pay high tax rates to support extensive social welfare programs, plus more than $400 billion to date to rebuild the formerly Communist east. And in January, tax rates are to go up 7.5 percent because the costs of restoring the east have been even higher than expected.
The coal penny was an 8.5 percent surcharge on all electricity bills, providing the billions to protect jobs in the Ruhr Valley, the cradle of German industrial might.
But over nearly three decades, employment at the deep anthracite mines -- where the coal cannot compete in price with open-pit mines in Poland and the United States -- has fallen from 530,000 to 90,000. Financial analysts who cover the industry say many of these underground coal mines should eventually be closed.
Some of the analysts said today's decision would give the Government an excuse to reorder national energy policies, away from what has essentially been a regional subsidy to a plan based more on energy security.
Officials of the miners' union, however, said they already had an agreement with the Government for subsidies to run through the year 2000.

Avis Says Costs Force a Rental Rate Rise

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, L.I., Dec. 7

 BODY:
Avis Rent A Car System Inc., citing higher fleet costs and recent interest rate increases, said today that it was raising its daily, weekly and weekend rental rates by as much as 6 percent across the country.
Avis, the nation's second-largest rental company behind the Hertz Corporation, said the new rates would be effective Jan. 6. 
 Daily rates will rise $2, weekly rates $10 to $20 and weekend rates $1.
On a typical midsized car in Chicago, Avis said the daily rate would rise $2, to $59.99, and the weekly rate would increase $12, to $215.99. In San Francisco, the daily rate will rise $2, to $46.99, and the weekly rate will jump $20, to $195.99.
"As fleets convert to the 1995 models, the industry is experiencing tremendous cost increases," James Collins, executive vice president of Avis, said in a statement. "This is the third year in a row that car makers have boosted pricing for the industry. At Avis, the average monthly cost of our cars has risen 50 percent in past two years, with 15 percent price increases for 1995 cars.
"On top of this, interest rates are also going up. In a highly leveraged business such as rent-a-car, the impact of a 1 percent increase in interest rates is major.
"The car rental industry remains in a fiscal crisis. Keen competition has kept industry pricing unrealistically low for years -- and now companies cannot absorb additional increases."
In September, Hertz raised rental car rates by 8 to 10 percent nationwide to offset higher fleet costs and interest expenses.
A spokeswoman for Avis predicted further rate increases in 1995. "I think this is just the start," she said. "With these enormous cost increases, we just can't absorb them."
In addition to the higher leisure rates, Avis said it would negotiate price rises as corporate contracts came up for bid. The company estimated it would get a 5 to 8 percent increases in corporate rates.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Poverty rates have actually fallen, a new book argues.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
HAVE you had your fill of charge and countercharge swirling around the authors of the "The Bell Curve," who assert that I.Q. is destiny? Are you ready for something equally subversive from the frontiers (or the fringes -- take your pick) of social science?
Consider the work of Dale Jorgenson and Daniel Slesnick, economists with impeccable academic credentials (Harvard and the University of Texas, respectively) and no apparent ideological bone to pick. They argue that properly measured, poverty rates have actually fallen sharply in the two last decades. 
 Almost none of their fellow poverty researchers agree. But the work -- much of which has been published in peer-reviewed scholarly journals -- does expose the Achilles' heel of research in standard-of-living trends in general, and poverty in particular. It is very difficult to measure the consumption of people at the bottom of the economic pecking order. And it is even more difficult to compare the material needs of say, a mother with two teen-agers in Minnesota with those of, say, a retired couple in San Diego.
The official poverty rate measure was developed in the mid-1960's. At its heart is an estimate of how much food individuals of varying ages need to live a healthy life, and an assumption that an income three times as large as the basic food budget would put people above the poverty line. The Government then uses survey data on incomes to measure the percentage of Americans who do not make the cutoff.
Even a cursory look, though, makes it clear that the poverty rate calculation is conceptually flawed. It makes no distinction between the needs of a 3-month-old and a 14-year-old or between a rural family in a cold climate and an urban family in the subtropics.
By the same token, it draws no distinction between income and purchasing power: A welfare mom living on $400 a month is treated identically to a graduate student who earns $400 a month at a part-time job and borrows an additional $1,500 from her parents. Nor does it tackle the problem of income from the underground economy, presumably a major source of sustenance for the very poor.
But most specialists still think the Government's measure is good enough for examining trends in poverty, in contrast to absolute rates. The fact that the poverty rate was 9.9 percent in 1971 may not prove much. Adding the fact that 11.3 percent of Americans were officially poor in 1991 does, however, strongly suggest that times were growing harder for low-income families.
Or does it? Christopher Jencks, a sociologist at the University of Chicago, raised doubts a decade ago. He argued that trends in measured income for the bottom few percent of the population diverged from consumption in the 1970's because of the rapid growth of in-kind subsidies for the poor: food stamps, Medicaid and the like.
Now Mr. Jorgenson and Mr. Slesnick are taking aim at the other weak link in the calculation, the Government's simplistic method of calculating the cost of living for people of differing ages, sex, household sizes and location. By their numbers, for example, the average family of four headed by a female needs just 62 percent as much income as an average family of four headed by a male, largely because the female-headed households contain fewer adults and more young children. The Census Bureau, by contrast, assumes the female-headed household needs 99 percent as much.
Since virtually all of the growth in low-income families has been in female-headed households, it should thus be no great surprise that the Jorgenson-Slesnick calculations show poverty falling steadily through the 1980's. Indeed, they estimate that the percentage of Americans in poverty in 1990 was just half as large as in 1970.
What should one make of this? As much to the point, what will Newt Gingrich and the New Republicans, who want to cut welfare costs, do with it?
The focus on income rather than consumption has certainly been misleading -- and is now probably unnecessary since better data on consumption are available. And the use of food costs as a proxy for living costs will always make the poverty index suspect. But the core of the controversy is the assumption of equivalency scales for different sorts of families. Mr. Jencks (among many others) is deeply skeptical that female-headed households can, in reality, "live on air."
What Mr. Slesnick and many of his critics do agree about, however, is that the traditional measures of poverty will always be open to challenge. "We've pushed cash comparisons too far," Mr. Jencks argues.
He, for one, would prefer to go back to basics, saying: "Are people eating well? Are they going to the doctor when they're sick? These are the sorts of questions that really matter."

HEADLINE: Guide for Last-Minute Shoppers and Shippers

BYLINE: By ELAINE LOUIE 

 BODY:
IN the United States, there are Santa's helpers who deliver presents on Christmas Day. They don't sit in department stores or slide down chimneys, but they will come dressed in red suits.
They are Postal Service carriers. The Postal Service is the only mail service that will deliver a package on Christmas Day -- but only if it is sent by Dec. 23 by Express Mail. 
 Here's how it works: If a package is sent Express Mail from one major metropolitan center to another on Dec. 23, the Postal Service guarantees delivery on the 24th. If the destination is far from a metropolitan center, Express Mail will take two days. On Christmas Day, the mail carrier will arrive, most likely in a red suit, said Larry Dozier, a spokesman for the Postal Service.
Neither Federal Express nor the United Parcel Service will do this.
Mail services and catalogue houses have different deadlines for guaranteed delivery of Christmas gifts by Saturday, Dec. 24. The blithe spirit who wants to send gifts at the last minute should take note or he may find himself the family Scrooge.
At the Postal Service, after Express Mail -- the fastest service and the only guaranteed one -- there is Priority Mail, with delivery in two to three days. For early birds, parcel post takes seven to 10 days for delivery. Neither Priority Mail nor parcel post is guaranteed.
Mr. Dozier suggests senders "use strong tape, a strong secure box, wrap in brown paper, and put a name, a complete address, including the apartment number, and a ZIP code. Don't use string and twine, because that can damage our machinery." He also suggests that people put the address inside the package, too, in case the address on the outside gets smudged.
Federal Express has two services for domestic delivery, overnight and two-day delivery, and as many deadlines as there are cities.
For a package sent overnight on the 23d, delivery is guaranteed on the 24th, provided the customer meets the deadline and pays the regular Saturday $10 surcharge. A second-day delivery requires a package to be sent on the 22d, for delivery on the 24th, with the same $10 Saturday surcharge. If you don't want to pay the $10 surcharge, send a package on the 22d for delivery overnight on the 23d.
Information about a city's Federal Express deadline, is available by calling (800) 463-3339.
U.P.S. guarantees its next-day air delivery service in the United States. If a package is sent Dec. 23, it will arrive the 24th. But U.P.S. does not guarantee second-day air service if it is sent after Dec. 8. Ground service is never guaranteed, but from New York to California, the normal time in transit is six days. At Christmas, delivery time is never normal.
 
Deadlines for Catalogues
 Catalogue houses can usually guarantee delivery only of in-stock merchandise. On the telephone, a customer service representative can probably tell via a computer whether or not an item is in stock. Here are some catalogues that will accommodate last-minute shoppers, listed in order of deadlines. (Alacrity, however, is encouraged.)
* Hearthsong -- (800) 325-2502 -- sells children's toys and books from Berkeley, Calif. Its deadline is Dec. 15 at 10 P.M., Pacific standard time, for guaranteed delivery by Dec. 23 via regular U.P.S. For delivery by Federal Express on the 23d, the deadline is the 20th at 10 P.M., Pacific standard time.
* The Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan -- (800) 447-6662 -- has two deadlines for domestic packages. To ship by U.P.S., MOMA guarantees delivery by the 23d if the item is ordered from the catalogue by Dec. 16 at midnight, Eastern standard time. To ship by Federal Express, MOMA charges an extra $20, and orders must be placed by Dec. 20 at midnight, Eastern standard time. Delivery is on Friday, the 23d.
* At L. L. Bean -- (800) 221-4221 -- in Freeport, Me., Dec. 19 is the deadline for Dec. 23 arrival, via regular-carrier economy Federal Express. Order by the 21st for arrival on the 23d by standard Federal Express, and you'll pay more. Should the order be placed on the 22d, it may or may not arrive on Saturday the 24th, since not all ZIP codes have Saturday delivery, said Nikki Kayser, a customer service representative. "There's a priority Federal Express," Ms. Kayser said, "but only certain areas are served by that."
* Calyx & Corolla -- (800) 800-7788 -- in San Francisco guarantees delivery of fresh flowers, plants and dried arrangements by the 24th, if the order is placed by Dec. 22 at noon, Pacific standard time. All orders are shipped Federal Express.
* The deadline for ordering from Williams-Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Hold Everything, Gardeners Eden and Chambers -- all (800) 922-5507 -- in San Francisco, is Dec. 23 at noon, Pacific standard time. Delivery by Federal Express is the next day. Large furniture items cannot be shipped overnight.
* Hammacher Schlemmer -- (800) 543-3366 -- in Chicago has a deadline of Dec. 23 at noon, Eastern standard time, for delivery by the 24th via Federal Express.
* At the Sharper Image -- (800) 344-4444 -- with headquarters in San Francisco orders must be placed by Dec. 23 at 6 P.M., Pacific standard time, for Federal Express delivery on the 24th.

Will the N.E.A. Be D.O.A.?

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
At the Kennedy Center Honors in Washington last weekend, the playwright Wendy Wasserstein was struck by the sight of Alan Simpson, the conservative Republican Senator from Wyoming, joining the enthusiastic standing ovation for Pete Seeger, the old-left folk singer who was one of the night's honorees.
It just goes to show that culture can transcend politics. And that Washington's ideological spectrum has shifted so far right since Nov. 8 that Mr. Simpson, who was deposed from his own party's leadership last week for the pure Gingrichite Trent Lott, may now count as a moderate. Could Mr. Simpson possibly be recruited as a leader in the coming battle to save the National Endowment for the Arts? 
 At this moment the arts need all the unlikely friends they can get. Though even a complete elimination of the N.E.A.'s minuscule budget ($167 million) would do nothing to offset the $200 billion in tax relief promised by the "Contract With America" over the next five years, the agency is a major target for Draconian new cuts because of its disproportionate symbolic value to the far right. Bashing the N.E.A., like boosting school prayer, is a high-profile, low-cost way for the Gingrich G.O.P. to distract the faithful while avoiding the hard choices about cutting multibillion-dollar entitlements that might really downsize the budget.
Already Donald Wildmon's American Family Association, rabid cultural watchdog of the religious right, is combing through N.E.A. grants, searching for some new gay recipient whose art can be demonized by Jesse Helms. More genteel right-wingers also play the game. Writing in The Washington Post, Charles Krauthammer put abolishing the N.E.A. high on the agenda for the new Congress's first 100 days, as a means of eliminating "welfare check writers for the intellectual classes."
This is a misinformation campaign. Intellectually elite cultural institutions, from the Metropolitan Opera in New York to the Los Angeles Philharmonic, receive less than 1 percent of their yearly budgets from the N.E.A.; they'd hardly feel a cut. The tiny direct grants to individual artists -- some of whom must be and inevitably will be as controversial in our day as Walt Whitman was in his -- total only 4 percent of the N.E.A. pie.
The biggest victims of a maimed N.E.A., far from being scatological performance artists or the cultural elite, will instead be smaller arts organizations -- including, say, the Atlanta Opera and Center for Puppetry Arts, both of which use Endowment funds and perform in Newt Gingrich's own district.
An ax could fall after New Year's. Although the "Contract With America" is imprecise about N.E.A. cuts, the Speaker-to-be has called for "privatizing" the agency -- which is code for defunding it. Other Republicans, invoking the current policy panacea, say the N.E.A.'s function should be turned over to the states -- which defeats the whole point.
The value of a Federal arts agency is to set a national standard for excellence, however imperfect, that can be exploited by arts groups in their private fund-raising. As an Oscar sells tickets, so the imprimatur of an N.E.A. grant brings in contributions -- so much so that each dollar given by the agency last year was matched by $11 in local giving.
Thriving museums or theaters, meanwhile, generate still more money for their communities -- sending audiences into a restaurant down the street, or bringing tourists into hotels, or attracting corporations whose employees don't want to spend every night at home channel-surfing. Yet the economic arguments for the N.E.A. -- like sociological arguments about the value of arts in schools or prisons -- are secondary to the real issue: What, if anything, does culture mean to the soul of this country?
If the right really deplores the trashy values of Hollywood -- and what it calls the counterculture -- you'd think it might increase, rather than reduce, N.E.A. seed money to promote a higher culture. But given last week's revelation that Mr. Gingrich is writing a novel featuring a "pouting sex kitten," no American who loves the arts should sit around hoping for a miraculous change of heart.

HEADLINE: CLINTON & CONGRESS;
The L-Word Lives On

BYLINE: By Theodore C. Sorensen; Theodore C. Sorensen, a lawyer, is the 20th Century Fund's new chairman. This essay is based on remarks to its 75th-anniversary dinner.

 BODY:
Reports of the death of American liberalism are greatly exaggerated. True, on Nov. 8 the electorate and new majority party moved sharply to the right. True, politicians in both parties shrink from any use of the L-word except to denounce it, and pundits of every ideological stripe now note (or celebrate) its demise.
If liberalism is defined as its detractors would define it -- as a simple-minded political philosophy that instinctively endorses reckless government spending, shameless personal conduct, toothless responses to crime and a spineless foreign policy -- then that philosophy has a barely perceptible pulse in American political life. 
 But that has never been the true meaning of liberalism. The liberal mind is (or should be) the liberated mind -- liberated from prejudice and hatred and cant, open to new ideas and solutions, neither permanently tethered to the dead hand of the past nor rigidly fettered to any faction or fortune. The liberal's commitment is to better government, not bigger government; to enlightened change, not the status quo; to the politics of hope, not the politics of pork.
Genuine liberals, in the original sense of the term, do not believe that government, big or small, centralized or local, can or should solve every problem or shoulder every task. On the contrary, liberals have always led the battle against unwarranted government interference with liberty, free speech, a free press and other basic freedoms.
Today, liberals, unlike their detractors, lead the battle against unwarranted government intrusion into matters of privacy and prayer. But they have not abandoned the belief that government -- if honest, efficient, democratic and representative -- can facilitate, not obstruct, the improvement of economic, educational and human conditions.
The liberal tradition, thus properly understood, represents the very antithesis of the 1994 election campaign. In theory, both a political campaign and the liberal approach call for the presentation and debate, the winnowing and sifting, of alternative public policy proposals.
But the typical campaign waged by candidates from either major party is concerned with what is popular, while liberalism is concerned with what is right. Campaigns now deal largely in headlines and slogans, while liberalism rests on full-blown ideas. Campaigns are all about tactics and image. Liberalism dwells in the realm of the strategic and factual. Campaigns are financed by special interests. Liberalism's only guiding star should be the national interest.
This year's campaign was characterized by rancor and resentment, by negative, often personal, attacks, generating much heat but little light. Liberals seek quietly to shed light on public questions, not private lives. This year's campaign in particular belabored symptoms -- crime, violence, teen-age pregnancy, illiteracy and economic malaise. Liberals look for underlying causes and remedies.
Overall, the campaign focused on the great harm done by bureaucrats. Liberals still believe that great good can be done by public servants.
Authentic liberalism -- the liberalism of Jefferson and Lincoln, Wilson and the two Roosevelts, Truman and Kennedy -- lives on. But let no one pretend, in the face of the election results, that it is thriving. Whatever excuses are offered about low voter turnout and a poisoned atmosphere, the fact remains that the people spoke and rejected liberal programs and projects of the past.
Now we must apply anew the principles of the liberal mind to search for new progressive, acceptable, democratic solutions to new problems, difficult problems: persistently stagnant pay scales and living standards; crumbling public infrastructure; pervasive parental concerns about the safety, health, education and future job opportunities of their children -- problems that will not be solved simply by tax cuts, term limits and the electric chair. To find those new solutions, the need for an open, searching mind, the liberal mind, is greater than ever before.

HEADLINE: REPUBLICANS SEEK SWEEPING CHANGES IN HOUSE'S RULES

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Republicans in the House of Representatives today ripped up the rule book by which Democrats controlled the chamber for 42 years and offered a radical new one that, they promised, would make the unwieldy House smaller, more open and far more parsimonious.
Among many other changes, the new rules would dismantle three House committees and 25 subcommittees, eliminate 660 employees from the committees' payrolls, end closed-door hearings and unrecorded committee votes and require any tax increase to gain the votes of three-fifths of lawmakers rather than half. 
 The next Speaker, Newt Gingrich of Georgia, said later that the individual changes were, in a way, outweighed by the collective message they sent to the nation's angry electorate.
"The biggest thing felt beyond the Beltway is that we are doing real things," Mr. Gingrich said. "For the first time in many, many years, there is a political leadership that is doing after the election exactly what we said we were going to do before the election."
The changes announced today must still be approved by the full House before they can take effect, and some are sure to rankle those Republicans whose power and prestige will ebb as their committees shrink. But given Mr. Gingrich's hold on the new Republican majority -- a grip that would be further strengthened by the changes proposed today -- it seemed unlikely that much of the package would be rejected.
The next chairman of the Rules Committee, Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon from upstate New York, said the proposals amounted to the farthest-reaching overhaul of House procedures since Congress passed its own reorganization law in 1946.
"This is what the American people have been calling for," Mr. Solomon said. "We are going to try to restore this body to the once-proud body that it was in the eyes of the American people."
To do that, the Republicans propose to do away with a multitude of regulations and restrictions that have dictated, for better or worse, the basic functions of Congress's lower chamber.
The most eye-catching proposals, affecting committee sizes and staff, were also part of the "Contract With America" that was the House Republican campaign platform this fall.
The Republicans plan to abolish three panels -- the Merchant Marine and Fisheries, Post Office and Civil Service, and the District of Columbia committees -- and hand over their duties to three existing committees.
As promised in their contract, they also propose to cut the overall staff of House committees by one-third, to about 1,300 workers next year from about 1,960 workers now. And they would require the remaining committee chairmen to eliminate 25 of the 120 or so existing House subcommittees.
But the committee changes go beyond simply streamlining the House's lawmaking authority. The new majority also proposed today to limit the tenure of committee chairmen to no more than three House terms, or six years, dealing a serious blow to a seniority system that Democrats tried half-heartedly to dismantle in the late 1970's.
And the Republicans moved to limit further the power of committee chairmen by prohibiting several panels from claiming authority over important or politically popular bills. The effect would be to avoid logjams like the one over health care legislation this summer, when three House panels tried to write three separate and contradictory bills.
Other proposed rules would make it more difficult to raise taxes and easier to cut spending, largely by changing the way legislation is passed on the House floor.
The new rule that would require a three-fifths vote of the House to approve any legislation containing an income-tax increase, as opposed to the simple majority that is currently needed, would also bar all retroactive tax increases, so that legislation enacted in, say, October could not levy a tax increase covering income before that date.
Retroactive tax increases were an important part of the package of tax increases and spending cuts that the White House secured during President Clinton's first year in office.
A second rule change would in effect allow any lawmaker to propose cuts in spending bills when they reach the House floor without having to leap over a procedural hurdle called a motion to rise. The new rule would bar committee chairmen from making such a motion in an attempt to block votes on spending cuts; instead, only the House majority leader could raise this barrier.
Yet another batch of rules changes would open House committee meetings and floor debates to more public scrutiny. Those new rules would ban closed-door meetings, which committees can currently hold at will, except during discussions of national-security information, sensitive law-enforcement issues or matters that "tend to defame, degrade or incriminate any person."
The Republicans also proposed to require House members to show up for committee votes instead of allowing them to hand their proxies to a fellow lawmaker, and they proposed to publish almost all committee votes in the Congressional Record.
A daily account of House proceedings, which is published in the Congressional Record, would become a verbatim transcript of what lawmakers say in debate. The current rules allow members to say one thing on the House floor, then rewrite their remarks in the next day's Record for posterity.
Finally, in a symbolic gesture to Democrats, the Republicans proposed giving the minority party a free shot at killing Republican initiatives it dislikes by allowing them an up-or-down vote on sending any bill off the House floor and back to committee.
Republicans are frequently granted that privilege now, but it has not been made part of the official rules. If the overall proposal passes next month, it will be.
A top aide to the House Democratic leadership, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said today that even Democrats were likely to vote for many of those changes.
With a handful of exceptions, including limiting the tenure of committee chairmen, "a lot of our people will be receptive to doing something similar," he said.
But other changes were certainly rankling some Democrats. Black and Hispanic members of Congress warned the new Republican leadership today that a proposal adopted on Tuesday to cut off money for their caucuses would amount to an assault on minorities and said that they were prepared to fight back.
Representatives Kweisi Mfume, the Maryland Democrat who heads the Congressional Black Caucus, and Jose E. Serrano, the Bronx Democrat who heads the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, called the Republican move to bar taxpayer money for their special-interest groups an effort to stifle diversity.
"They have energized, not diminished, the spirits of these caucuses," Mr. Mfume said of Tuesday's action. "They have created 41 pit bulls who will chase this elephant day in and day out," he said of the 41 members of the black caucus.
Mr. Serrano said the action was a purely political move to eliminate voices of dissent. "Their idea is to try to take us away as a force that will debate with them on the issues," he said. "It's easier to do a number on the poor if we aren't organized."

HEADLINE: House G.O.P. Would Replace Scores of Programs for the Poor

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
House Republican leaders are preparing plans to abolish more than a hundred social programs and replace them with grants to state governments, which would then have a virtual free hand in redesigning aid to the poor, although with substantially less money than the current programs provide.
The move would sweep away more than $60 billion in Federal programs that provide cash, food, job training, child care, foster care and other services. The amount spent by the Government in each category would be reduced, perhaps by as much as 20 percent, and the money would be handed over to the states with a few broad guidelines. 
 The strategy, which has not yet been made public but has been the subject of meetings among Republican lawmakers in recent weeks, goes well beyond the welfare cuts already outlined in the House Republicans' campaign document, the "Contract With America." It is being pushed hardest by Republicans who will become the chairmen of important House committees in the new Congress.
Although the move will probably meet considerable resistance, if enacted in full it would reverse a six-decade-old trend, dating from the New Deal, in which power over social programs has been concentrating in Washington. It would leave the Federal Government less able to intervene in local affairs, and as a result less able to protect the neediest.
"We're looking at everything," Representative Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania, who as the next chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee will oversee a proposal to consolidate job training programs, said in an interview. "There's no stone that will remain untouched."
The bold talk coming from the newly powerful Republicans has left President Clinton on the defensive with regard to his own vision of welfare and other social programs. In one step to regain a leadership role, he met with a bipartisan group of 10 governors today and announced that he would convene a national conference on welfare policy next month.
Although his aides spent 17 months drafting an elaborate welfare-overhaul bill that was introduced in Congress earlier this year, Mr. Clinton himself made no mention of it today. Instead, he said, "Washington doesn't have all the answers," and his aides had no comment on the House Republicans' new block-grant strategy.
The House Republicans' enthusiasm for that strategy is likely to meet a respectful though more cautious reception from the new Republican majority in the Senate.
The strategy was the subject of a meeting here today among ranking Republicans in both houses of Congress; the Republican national chairman, Haley Barbour, and several influential Republican Governors, including John Engler of Michigan and William F. Weld of Massachusetts, as well as aides to Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, Republican of Wisconsin.
A jubilant Mr. Engler left the meeting with a prediction of "a revolutionary new form of relationship between the states and the Federal Government." He said most of the nation's governors would be willing to accept reduced financing "in order to gain freedom and flexibility."
But a wholesale Government redesign is sure to be criticized by advocates for the poor as an abdication of Federal responsibility to protect them. Some of the largest programs, like Aid to Families With Dependent Children and food stamps, were established by laws guaranteeing benefits to anyone who meets qualifications.
Folding those programs into grants to the states would strip away their "entitlement" status, meaning that the states would provide benefits only until the money ran out. It is entirely possible that in economic downturns, when state revenue dwindled while the number of needy grew, some families would be left without food or a way to pay their rent.
"There is a great danger that a group in need of protection may be seriously underserved," said Mark Greenberg, a lawyer with the Center on Law and Social Policy, a public interest legal group in Washington that specializes in antipoverty policy.
Mr. Greenberg added that even in prosperous times, states could choose to exercise their new flexibility by ignoring the most needy, who tend to be the most difficult and most expensive to serve. Job-training money, for instance, might be redirected from ghetto youths toward unemployed mid-career workers.
Policy experts of both parties have long lamented the fragmented nature of Federal programs that seek similar goals but are characterized by conflicting rules and deadlines. Congress's auditing and investigative arm, the General Accounting Office, has counted more than 150 Federal programs to provide job training, and there are dozens of others that provide child care or nutrition.
Efforts at consolidation have typically run into opposition, however, not only from interest groups that benefit from a particular program but also from important legislators, who take pride of authorship in such programs. The creator of a food program for the elderly, for instance, may not want to leave states free to spend its money on infants.
Some of those legislative obstacles may be removed by the change in majority control of Congress and the resulting shake-up of the committee structure by the Republicans, whose strategy calls not just for consolidation but also for major cuts in overall spending.
"If you consolidate properly, you probably could cut 20 percent and have enhanced services," said Mr. Goodling, the chairman-in-waiting of the Education and Labor Committee.
But Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr. of Florida, who will become chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee responsible for welfare reform, predicted more modest reductions. "Today we were talking about like 10 percent," he said.
Governor Thompson, meanwhile, warned against overly optimistic savings estimates. "The block grant should not be cut too much at the beginning," he said. "It's usually more expensive at the beginning, and the savings come on the back end."
Beyond the extent of reductions, a number of other questions remain, including which programs would be consolidated into block grants and how much latitude states would have in administering them.
People who attended today's Republican meeting said concrete proposals had been drafted in three areas. One would create a block grant from money now spent on Aid to Families With Dependent Children, the main cash-assistance welfare program. Another would create a block grant from several dozen child care programs. And a third would create a single block grant from a variety of foster care and other child welfare programs.
In addition, the "Contract With America" calls for creating a single block grant from food stamps and a host of other nutritional programs, including the popular Women's, Infant and Children program, which serves pregnant women and young children.
And Republican leaders are contemplating a fifth grant, which would encompass from 80 to more than 100 job training programs.
"We're going to be looking at a whole host of programs," said Mr. Shaw. "There are literally hundreds of antipoverty programs."
Mr. Shaw said that although Representative Newt Gingrich, the next House Speaker, was not at today's meeting, he had agreed to the strategy in principle. "Newt is fully behind our efforts," Mr. Shaw said.
Among those who did attend the meeting was Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas, who has devised a different strategy for shifting responsibility to the states. She would swap programs, having the Federal Government take over Medicaid in full while leaving the states entirely responsible for A.F.D.C. and food stamps, without any Federal financing.
Senator Kassebaum said she preferred drawing "a clear line of responsibility" for programs. As long as the money comes from Washington, she said, "you'll start to see more and more strings attached."

HEADLINE: A Default By Orange County

BYLINE: By SALLIE HOFMEISTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 8

 BODY:
The fiscal hemorrhaging of Orange County worsened today as it defaulted on a $110 million bond issue. In addition, the county said it would sue several brokerage firms in an effort to keep its loss-plagued investment fund from collapsing.
Adding to alarm and confusion surrounding Tuesday's bankruptcy filing, the county, which pledged to meet all school and local government payrolls, acknowledged that it could not pay all its outside suppliers. "Some vendors are probably not going to get paid," the County Administrator, Ernie Schneider, told a meeting of the Orange County City Managers Association at City Hall in Irvine, Calif. 
 Orange County was forced to file for bankruptcy on Tuesday after it was unable to roll over a $2 billion loan with the CS First Boston Corporation. The action followed the disclosure last week that the county's investment fund had lost more than $1.5 billion because of interest rate bets that went bad.
"We bit the bullet and defaulted on a $110 million bond that was due today," Mr. Schneider said, according to Bloomberg Business News.
County officials said investors in a pension bond backed by the investment pool, now frozen by the bankruptcy, were not paid on schedule today. No other details were made available today.
In September, the county sold a novel pension obligation bond issue in two parts, the second of which totaled $110 million. That part, called the Pension Obligation Bond Series 1994B, was described at the time as being backed by the liquidity of the county's investment pool.
By selling pension obligation bonds, a municipality in effect borrows money from public investors to cover payments owed to its own pension fund; thus, the default today does not immediately imperil any payments owed to the county's pensioners.
At the same time, in an attempt to protect the ailing fund, the county said it would sue several brokerage firms that have sold collateral that the county contends was frozen by Tuesday's bankruptcy filing. Since Tuesday, CS First Boston, Nomura Securities International, Smith Barney, Prudential Securities, Morgan Stanley and Sanwa have sold an estimated $8 billion in securities backing loans to the county.
Though county officials would not disclose which firms would be named, they said a suit would be filed Friday morning in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana.
An exception to the selling of collateral was Merrill Lynch & Company, which said it would not call its $2 billion in credit or sell its collateral. "We've done business with these guys for 20 years," a Merrill executive told Bloomberg Business News. "We're not going to walk away from them now."
Under what are known as reverse repurchase agreements, or reverse repos, Wall Street brokerage firms lent the county about $13 billion and took as collateral securities worth a little more than that amount. Robert L. Citron, the county treasurer who managed the investment fund and resigned on Monday, used these agreements to augment $7.8 billion from 187 county agencies, school districts and cities into a portfolio worth $20 billion. As much as a third of his investments were tied to falling interest rates and soured when rates turned up in February.
The county contends that Chapter 9, the Federal bankruptcy provision that governs municipalities, prevents brokerage firms from selling the collateral. Some bankruptcy experts, however, say repurchase agreements are exempt.
The county defaulted on repo payments to Nomura Securities and Smith Barney last week, but according to Wall Street traders, the two brokerage houses had agreed to roll them over. CS First Boston, however, called its loan to the county on Tuesday and sold $2.1 billion in collateral that day, forcing Orange County into bankruptcy.
Prudential Securities and Morgan Stanley sold $2 billion each in Orange County collateral today. Smith Barney sold $800 million and Nomura unloaded slightly under $1 billion, according to Wall Street traders.
While none of the brokerage firms would comment on the action planned by the county, many Wall Street brokers said firms were allowed under their agreements with Orange County to liquidate collateral in the event of a bankruptcy filing.
Attempting to reassure investors and taxpayers, the county today named a former state treasurer as the new manager of its troubled fund and hired Salomon Brothers as an investment adviser.
The new manager is Thomas W. Hayes, a Republican who was state treasurer from 1989 to 1991 and lost re-election to Kathleen Brown. He said today he could restructure the pool within a year.

HEADLINE: Pataki Tries Bracing State For Bad News On Spending

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UTICA, N.Y., Dec. 8

 BODY:
In a swing through three upstate cities that was reminiscent of his campaign, Governor-elect George E. Pataki today began the public relations spadework for what will surely be his most arduous legislative battle next year: winning passage of a budget that he is already warning could hurt a broad array of New Yorkers.
Facing a projected deficit of $5 billion, Mr. Pataki, who takes office Jan. 1, strenuously appealed to two of his strongest constituencies, business leaders and upstate voters, to help him win legislative support for cutting taxes, trimming spending and shrinking government. 
 Even as he cloaked his grim message in talk of partnership and cooperation, Mr. Pataki broadly hinted that he expects the Legislature to have trouble adopting his budget, which he is required to present by Feb. 1. And he called on the residents, local officials and business leaders of Syracuse, Utica and Binghamton, three communities that strongly supported him in last month's election, to lobby their lawmakers on his behalf.
"I need you to call your Assembly people and your senators and tell them that this is the right course for New York State," he told about 700 people at a Chamber of Commerce breakfast in Syracuse. "It's time for the rhetoric to end. It's time for the blaming of others to end. It's time to accept responsibility. It's time to achieve action. It's time to put in place a real tax-cut plan."
In a news conference in Utica, he said the state will have to "cut more, and more quickly," than he had anticipated just a month ago, not only to close the projected shortfall but also to enact the 25 percent cut in income tax rates that he promised during the campaign and which he has since repeatedly vowed to carry out.
Mr. Pataki said that never in his 10 years as a legislator did he see a lobbyist trying to convince a lawmaker to spend less, adding, "I understand the pressures that the Legislature will be under during the course of the budget process. That pressure will be to spend more."
Sounding almost upbeat about what is likely to be a brutal fight in the Legislature over spending cuts, Mr. Pataki said, "We don't live in a dictatorship, thank God, we live in a democracy. And the changes we are talking about, the vast majority of them, are going to need the support of the Senate and the Assembly. I am very optimistic we will have that support because of the enthusiasm of the people for the changes we are talking about."
Spending more is a bipartisan tradition in the Legislature. Members assume they will be measured by voters back home by how much money they win for local roads, schools and economic development programs. As a legislator, Mr. Pataki was no different. He consistently worked to increase state spending in his Hudson Valley district, even in the many budgets he ultimately voted against, saying they were fiscally irresponsible.
Mr. Pataki, a Republican, has not released details about what he will propose cutting in the budget. But the general outlines he has presented suggest he will focus on reducing spending for health care and welfare programs for the poor.
If that is the case, he will face his toughest battles in the Democratic-controlled Assembly, which has traditionally opposed such cuts. To succeed, Mr. Pataki will have to win the support of upstate Democrats by splitting them from their more liberal downstate colleagues.
Perhaps with that in mind, Mr. Pataki told his Syracuse audience, which included at least one Democratic senator, that his transition team is uncovering many examples of "out of control" spending by the state bureaucracy.
He said, for example, that State Education Department officials sometimes send letters across the street via Federal Express. He said the state could save $250,000 a year by requiring bureaucrats to deliver more packages themselves.
Alan Ray, a spokesman for the Education Department, said he did not know of any cases like the ones cited by Mr. Pataki.
Mr. Pataki also decried a Medicaid reimbursement system that he said might pay $150 to a taxi driver to bring a patient in a rural area to a doctor who is paid only $11 for the visit.
"A simple change would be to pay the doctor $35 or $40 to make the house call," Mr. Pataki said. "We'd save over $100, the patient gets better service and everybody wins.
In Utica, where Mr. Pataki met with local businessmen as well as county officials and state legislators, a reporter gave Mr. Pataki an opportunity to hedge a bit on his grim avowals, asking whether he would support programs to revitalize downtown shopping areas in small cities.
Mr. Pataki flatly said no. "The fiscal realities are such right now that I don't think any new spending programs can be afforded in the upcoming fiscal year," he said.
