HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Bermuda Takes theRisk;
From Tourist Paradise to Haven for Insurance Business

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

DATELINE: HAMILTON, Bermuda

 BODY:
The construction project in the middle of town tells the tale of how things have been going lately on this lovely island of pastel bungalows and perpetual spring. The grand old Bermudiana Hotel and its luxuriant gardens have been leveled; in their place two big insurance buildings are rising.
With relentless competition and changing tastes, Bermuda's tourist business has been fading. But with no corporate taxes and light regulation, the island has quietly developed a booming insurance business, making Bermuda the third leg with New York and London in the world's central insurance triangle. 
 In the low-rising, vaguely dated village of Hamilton, underwriters, actuaries and brokers are the new princes. The resident lawyers and accountants depend heavily on insurance business, and the construction trades have seldom been busier. Not far from the Bermudiana site, an even bigger block of insurance offices is just being completed. At night, tables at Little Venice and the pricier Cafe Lido are filled with insurance executives and their clients.
"We'd be lost without the insurance people," said Tullio Lombardi, an assistant manager at the beach-front Cafe Lido.
And a lot of insurance people would be lost without Bermuda.
Much as Liberia and Panama have provided flags of convenience for the world's maritime fleets, Bermuda has blossomed as a convenient extension of the American insurance industry. A self-governing British colony, it has generally managed to steer clear of money laundering, drug smuggling and most of the fly-by-night financial scams that have tarnished other so-called tax havens.
And it has attracted a cadre of insurance technicians from the United States and Europe that, as Government business recruiters like to point out, adds to the ease of setting up shop here.
Bermuda is the land of megadeals, where corporate policies are written that often kick in only after losses hit more than $100 million. For the buyers and sellers in this highflying world, Bermuda's oversight is a model of restraint. Here, the issue is financial strength. The details of day-to-day business are between the insurers and their customers.
With that philosophy, Bermuda has become a place where new twists in coverage can be worked out in a few days -- or at worst -- a few weeks, rather than the months, if not years it takes in the United States. Its laissez-faire supervision contrasts sharply with the thickets of regulation that have grown up in all 50 states with the goal -- rarely fully realized -- of protecting the smallest policyholder rather than oiling the wheels of commerce.
Bermuda's overall success has recently inspired regulators in the United States to begin easing up. Half a dozen states have agreed to let corporate buyers and sellers negotiate the terms and prices of high-level coverage just as all coverage is handled here. And similar legislation is being considered in New York and a dozen other states.
The regulatory and tax advantages of Bermuda -- just an hour and a half by air from New York -- made it a natural for solving the industry's problems. When heavy losses caused even Lloyd's of London to back away from offering high-ticket, high-risk coverage against product liability lawsuits and the ravages of hurricanes and earthquakes, Americans with deep pockets and a sense of opportunity turned to Bermuda to set up companies that would consider almost any proposition.
Bermuda's main customers are America's corporate giants, whose transactions here mean less money for insurers in the United States. Yet the big American insurers are not complaining. Indeed, they helped create Bermuda's insurance business. Some have profited by setting up their own subsidiaries here; many others have become buyers of catastrophe reinsurance, which at first was available almost nowhere else and now helps them diversify.
Still others have been delighted to have Bermuda sharing the market for stratospheric coverages so they are not faced with either taking on more risk than they can comfortably handle or disappointing corporate clients.
So, out of self-interest, American insurers have quietly accepted the rise of Bermuda. "The other insurers need Bermuda as much as Bermuda needs them," said Sharda Cherwoo, an insurance specialist at Ernest & Young, the international accounting firm.
Bermudian companies pioneered financial coverage that pays off on fluctuations of foreign currency rates and commodities prices, often packaged with protection against, say, plant fires and lawsuits. And the Bermudian titans -- Ace Ltd. and X. L. Capital Ltd. -- have begun extending their reach. They have turned the tables on their elders, buying up older -- and sometimes bigger -- companies in the United States and prowling among the Lloyd's syndicates that once tried to use their influence to crush the island upstarts.
In the slimmed-down, customized world of Bermudian insurance, there are fewer protections for corporate customers. For example, most Bermudian policies require that disputes be worked out in binding arbitration, rather than in the courts. Also in the United States, insurers are required to contribute to a so-called guarantee fund in each state that provides money to pay claims if an insurance company collapses. In Bermuda, there is no guarantee fund.
But Bermuda has no shortage of customers. For many of its clients, the ability to work out new coverage quickly to solve an immediate insurance problem and to take on enormous risk outweighs concern about a forum for resolving disputes that may never materialize. For big corporations with policies in the tens of millions of dollars, American guarantee funds are of little value anyway because they are often worth only a few hundred thousand dollars, little help if an insurance company fails to pay off a multimillion loss.
Moreover, oversight does not end with the regulators. Many of the Bermudian companies are publicly traded in the United States and subject to the reporting requirements of the stock exchanges and of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The rating agencies periodically examine the books of all major insurers, including the Bermudians, and publish their findings on financial strength, which provides a powerful measure of their ability to pay claims. "A company with a low rating is just not going to get any business," said Barbara Stewart, an insurance consultant in Atlanta.
The foundations for Bermuda's insurance industry were laid shortly after World War II. That was when American corporations realized they could save money with a paper device known as a captive insurance company, which enables a corporation to effectively sell itself insurance and deduct the premiums from its taxable income. And for tax and regulatory reasons as well as Bermuda's reputation for probity, many American corporations began registering their captives here. Today, there are roughly 1,400 captives in Bermuda, more than anywhere else in the world.
But it took a few decades before the first big mainstream Bermudian insurance companies were created. They began in the mid-1980's with New York money, knowledge and technical skill. When traditional insurers cut back on high-end coverage, Robert Clements, a senior executive at the Marsh & McLennan Companies, the world's largest insurance broker, persuaded 34 corporations, including I.B.M., Ford Motor and Royal Dutch/Shell, to go offshore to Bermuda and start their own insurance company. That was how Ace was started. Six months later, Mr. Clements brought together other corporations to form Exel Ltd., now X. L. Capital. It is Ace and X. L. that are building the new offices that are going up on the grounds of the Bermudiana Hotel.
As a prerequisite for the new companies, Mr. Clements roughed out a new kind of liability policy that carved a middle path between the most restrictive and most liberal policies.
In the early 1990's, big hurricane and earthquake losses convinced major insurance companies that they should be buying a lot more reinsurance. But traditional reinsurers, who provide backup coverage to the front-line insurers, did not want to put more chips into a game that was looking increasingly dangerous. So Mr. Clements dusted off his old blueprints and started Midocean Reinsurance Ltd. to sell nothing but coverage for other insurers against the worst calamities. Eventually, eight catastrophe reinsurance companies were created.
Others' disasters were a timely salve for Bermuda's economy. For decades, Bermuda has been like a big country club for the East Coast golf and tennis set. It also has been a favorite of honeymooners. But Bermuda's popularity is waning. Visitors in recent years have complained that the island is horribly expensive -- a couple of sandwiches and drinks can easily run $40. While peace and quiet were once big selling points for Bermuda, visitors today often complaint that there is not much to do.
The economic balance tipped in favor of insurance and other international business three years ago and since then the gap has been widening. In the last fiscal year, insurance and other international businesses pumped $757.6 million into Bermuda compared with $472.3 million from tourism.
Partly because of the stagnation of tourism, Bermudians last fall voted out the United Bermuda Party, which governed for 35 years. The new Prime Minister, Jennifer Smith of the Progressive Labor Party, is in a delicate political position. She must encourage the growth of insurance, but she must not be seen to be favoring it over tourism -- even though there is some overlap -- because even now, tourism provides more jobs. By her count 2,400 people work in insurance and nearly 6,000 have jobs in hotels, restaurants and other businesses in the tourist trade.
As practiced in Bermuda, insurance is a fast-paced business. The companies have small staffs. There is a lot of give and take and a blurring of ranks that often make the companies seem more like research centers than like hierarchical insurance concerns. Ties, and sometimes even shoes, are optional at some companies.
While the insurers would like to do more local hiring, most of their highest-paying jobs go to fairly young expatriates, attracted by money, a balmy climate and the opportunity to work on big, important transactions. After work on Fridays, underwriters, actuaries and brokers crowd into the Robin Hood, a pub on Richmond Road, to let off steam.
They bring their energy to what was once a pretty sleepy place.
"They've got a certain amount of sassiness and arrogance coupled with real entrepreneurial spirit," said Bill McGannon, who, for years, was in charge of the insurance budget of the Nova Chemical Corporation in western Canada. "They don't come up with a lot of reasons they can't give you what you need. They want to do a deal."

HEADLINE: Park Place To Buy Casinos From Starwood

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
In a deal that will reshape the gambling business in Atlantic City and Las Vegas, Nev., Park Place Entertainment, a recent spinoff from Hilton Hotels, agreed yesterday to acquire the Caesars casino operations of Starwood Hotels and Resorts for $3 billion in cash.
The deal will create a serious rival in Atlantic City to Donald J. Trump, where Park Place will have three casinos with nearly as much gambling space as Mr. Trump's, while casinos owned by Park Place Entertainment in Las Vegas will dominate three of the four corners at the Strip and Flamingo Boulevard, the most valuable gambling real estate site on earth. 
 Shares of Park Place jumped nearly 25 percent yesterday, closing at $11.375, up $2.25, while Starwood fell 68.75 cents, to $34.3125.
Analysts said that Park Place's cash flow, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, would be about $1.3 billion, nearly twice that of the next largest gambling company, Harrah's Entertainment.
For Starwood, the world's largest hotel company, the cash payment will allow it to reduce its $8 billion of debt by more than one-third, lowering interest charges enough to increase earnings by about 7 cents a share in the first year, said Jim Gallagher, a Starwood spokesman. "This will bring us much closer to our goal of being able to issue investment-grade debt," he said.
He said that the price "might represent a small loss" for Starwood on the price it paid plus improvements to the casino properties, which it acquired 17 months ago.
Others estimated the loss at more than $500 million based on the purchase price and investments Starwood made.
Arthur M. Goldberg, Park Place's chief executive, said: "By acquiring the Caesars brand name and related customer data base, we plan to heavily cross-market between our destination resorts. This will boost revenues and expand the markets where we operate."
He projected savings of $50 million a year in operating costs, a figure that two analysts said was probably low given Mr. Goldberg's record of cutting costs in previous deals by as much as twice what he promised.
The deal to sell the casinos comes less than four months after Park Place was created by spinning off Hilton's gambling properties, including the Flamingo in Las Vegas and the Bally casinos in Atlantic City and Las Vegas.
The deal is a triumph for two casino executives known for making smart deals who joined forces in December 1996 when Hilton Hotels acquired Bally Entertainment. One is Mr. Goldberg, who was a New Jersey trucking company owner before 1990, when he took over Bally Manufacturing, a debt-ridden maker of slot machines and operator of casinos and health clubs. The other is Stephen F. Bollenbach, the chief executive of Hilton and chairman of Park Place Entertainment.
For nearly all of 1997, the two men tried to buy the casino and hotel properties of ITT Inc., the conglomerate run by Rand Araskog. But Hilton dropped out of the bidding in December 1997, with Mr. Bollenbach saying that the price ITT wanted was too high. Starwood was the winning bidder.
"This deal leaves them gratified that they were right and that this was the wrong acquisition for Starwood at the wrong price," said William H. Moore, an analyst at Forum Capital Markets in Old Greenwich, Conn. "This deal shows that they were justified that they walked away when the price was too high, especially since the guy who paid too much has to come back and sell to them. And Steve Bollenbach likes to be right."
Another analyst, Jason Ader of Bear, Stearns, said the deal "could be a positive for the Atlantic City market because you will have a greater concentration within fewer companies and are less likely to have foolish marketing decisions" such as big coin giveaways to lure slot machine gamblers.
"That's bad for the value gambler, good for the investors," Mr. Ader said of the expected tight rein on giveaways to customers.
It cost 11 percent more to gamble at Bally Park Place than next door at Caesars, which was more willing to extend complimentaries like free drinks for blackjack players and private jets to fly in high rollers, a 1990 study by National Economic Research Associates showed.
Now Bally's Park Place, an extension of its gambling area called Wild West and Caesars will be owned by the same company. Park Place Entertainment also owns the Atlantic City Hilton, formerly the Golden Nugget, at the south end of the Boardwalk.
These three Atlantic City properties will have 27.6 percent of the gambling floor space, compared with 29.9 percent for the three Trump casinos, records of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission show.
On the Las Vegas Strip, Park Place will acquire Caesars Palace. It already owns three casinos across the Strip from Caesars: the Flamingo Hilton, Bally's Las Vegas and Paris, which is scheduled to open in the fall.
After the deal closes, the company will have 15 percent of the casino space on the Strip and 18 percent of the hotel rooms, said Adam Brecht, a spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers.
The deal was a loss for Mirage Resorts Inc., which owns casinos on each side of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas that its chief executive, Steve Wynn, wants to connect with a monorail.
Park Place is also acquiring Caesars casinos in Lake Tahoe, Nev., riverboat casinos in Mississippi and Indiana, slot machines at Dover Downs Race Track in Delaware and interests in various gambling operations from Canada to South Africa.
Park Place did not buy Starwood's Desert Inn, which, with its own golf course on about 35 acres, is one of the large tracts of developable land left along the Strip in Las Vegas.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE EUROPEANS;
In Uniting Over Kosovo, A New Sense of Identity

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BERLIN, April 27

 BODY:
A month of war in Europe has already brought deep changes to the continent, awakening a new sense of European patriotism, rekindling tensions over "American imperialism" and reviving the sagging fortunes of some leaders.
Raised after World War II to reject military violence but also to insure that the barbarism of Hitler and Stalin never be repeated, a generation of Europeans has been abruptly forced by events in Kosovo to a painful choice between these principles. 
 In general, they have come down in favor of using military power to try to stop the "ethnic cleansing" of Kosovo and have increasingly portrayed the fate of the province as a decisive test of Europe's commitment to a continent freed in the 21st century of the mass deportations and killings that marked this one.
Ludger Volmer, Germany's Deputy Foreign Minister and a member of the once pacifist Green Party, said: "We have to fight for our Europe where boundaries no longer matter, against old notions of a Europe of ethnic identity and race-based violence. An integrated Europe with an open wound in the Balkans is unimaginable."
Despite the unconvincing results of more than four weeks of NATO bombing and the failure of past appeals to rally to a European rather than a national ideal, such ideas have had a surprising resonance as image after image of desperate refugees hounded from Kosovo have filled the news media.
A majority of people in Britain, France, Germany and Italy support the military campaign. A poll last week in France showed 70 percent in favor of the NATO intervention. Support for Gerhard Schroder, the German Chancellor, has surged as his chief preoccupation has become war rather than unemployment.
Indeed, such is the popular support that the British and French Governments have gone further than President Clinton in suggesting the use of ground forces, although the allies' summit meeting in Washington over the weekend suggested that support for a land war is limited.
"We have to be ready to die for Pristina," Kosovo's capital, "because to die for Pristina is to die for the future of Europe," said Andre Glucksmann, a leading French philosopher. "Americans have died for Europe twice. Now we have to make sacrifices to show this continent will no longer tolerate policies that recall Stalin."
Further, Europeans have been looking to their own future. Many see the conflict as a decisive moment for the politics of the continent -- one that could give Europe the political and military identity it has lacked.
Images of stunned deportees with unseeing eyes have stirred terrible memories. In a Europe no longer divided by the cold war, the images have prompted a determination to act, and to establish a continent-wide respect for human rights that will serve as the basis for the Europe of the next century.
But this bold new determination to salvage Europe's pride after a wounding century is by no means shared by everyone.
With an American general directing the NATO military campaign, deep concern or outright anger over European dependency on Washington and over what some see as America's control over the post-cold-war world has surfaced.
Deploring Europe's premature decision to cash in the "peace dividend" and cut military spending, Lamberto Dini, the Italian Foreign Minister, said, "The United States cannot be the gendarmes of the world, nor the mercenary soldiers for countries that do not intend to assume military responsibility."
In a distinctly anti-American tone, some French intellectuals have portrayed the war in Kosovo as the latest attempt by Washington to satisfy the appetites of its military-industrial complex, undermine Europe and bolster the unilateral power that the United States has enjoyed since the Soviet Union collapsed.
"The undeclared war in the Balkans is not a war against the Serbs," Guy Declos, a French sociologist, wrote in the French daily Le Monde. "It is a war against Europe."
Of course such anti-Americanism is not new in France, and up to now, it appears that a crisis of European-American relations has been averted.
A rupture in relations with Russia has also been avoided, and Western governments now seem determined to back a Russian-led peace bid because President Boris N. Yeltsin's influence in Belgrade is considerable. Whatever the outcome of this diplomacy, concern is strong, particularly in Germany, that Moscow not be alienated.
After Europe's profound failure in Bosnia, a war the European Union initially volunteered to stop and much later saw halted by a "Pax Americana," the desire to assert a political and military identity with a success in Kosovo is strong.
And with the arrival this year of the common European currency, the euro, the continent has been casting around for some new catalyst for the integration that has been missing.
"Kosovo could be our military euro, creating a political and defense identity for the European Union in the same way as the euro is the expression of economic and financial integration," said Ulrich Beck, a professor of politics at Munich University.
But the attainment of a "military euro" is evidently a long way off. A month of bombing has failed to bring any of the results NATO had sought, and the longer the war continues, the sharper the tensions in Europe are likely to become.
Mr. Volmer, the German Deputy Foreign Minister, said he thought his Green Party, the junior partner in the governing coalition, would be unable to accept the dispatch of ground troops if NATO moved in that direction to break the impasse. "This could bring down the German Government," he said.
The Greens are to hold a congress on May 13 at which they are likely to vote on this issue. The tensions in the party reflect the way the conversion of Mr. Volmer and of the Foreign Minister, Joschka Fischer, to supporting military force against Yugoslavia has by no means been followed by all members of the party.
Similar tensions may emerge in Italy's coalition Government, where the former Communists are very uneasy about ground forces, even as the British and French Governments push the view that a long war fought only with air power may risk losing public support.
Certainly a war in which the only victims are civilians does not appear likely to command widespread support indefinitely in a continent where the idea of "body bags" is more acceptable as a price of war than it is in the United States.

HEADLINE: A Supermarket as a Spur for Change;
New Harlem Pathmark Promises Competition and Convenience

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
Like many Manhattan residents, Olga Hayes is used to doing her major grocery shopping outside the borough -- in her case, at the Pathmark on Bruckner Boulevard in the Bronx -- and picking up a few things between trips at her local food stores.
Lately, however, Ms. Hayes, who lives on East 114th Street in East Harlem, has noticed that the Associated market two blocks from her home is looking nicer. The items she wants are placed at eye level instead of out of reach, and she no longer spots canned goods on display after the expiration date has passed. 
 "The quality of the fruits and vegetables is not great," Ms. Hayes said as she left the market one night last week with enough soda and juice to get her family through the weekend. "But they've changed a lot of things in there."
It is probably no coincidence that this transformation is occurring just as something else has happened to Ms. Hayes's neighborhood: A $15 million Pathmark supermarket, about eight times the size of the independently owned Associated that Ms. Hayes patronizes, opened April 15 on 125th Street and Lexington Avenue.
Built with private and public money by two black community groups, it is the first chain supermarket to open in Harlem in three decades and the first major commercial development completed in the neighborhood since the riots of the late 1960's. On Friday, Gov. George E. Pataki and other dignitaries will gather on the rooftop of the Pathmark to welcome the store.
In most communities, the opening of a grocery store would not be something to make a fuss over, much less invite the Governor to. But this Pathmark in this community is a very big deal -- because Harlem has been without a chain supermarket for so long, and because this one was delayed so long, in part by a bitter fight put up by owners of independent markets.
For many people in the neighborhood, who have often had to pay more for inferior quality or travel long distances to have the kind of choices that residents of other neighborhoods take for granted, the Pathmark became more than just a grocery store.
"We've been waiting a long time for a nice supermarket in Harlem," said Dorothy Reece, a retired clerical worker who lives at 135th Street and Park Avenue. "In Harlem, we always have to wait for everything, so we're used to that."
One of thousands of Harlem residents who have already been sizing up the new 24-hour Pathmark, Ms. Reece said she was so dissatisfied with the meat available at her local markets that she often used to ask her daughter to shop for her in the Bronx.
Ms. Reece predicted that the Pathmark would force the independent markets to work hard to compete. Even though the broccoli at her local Associated and CTown was cheaper -- $1.19 a bunch compared with $1.50 -- Pathmark's was more appealing, "so I don't mind spending the extra change," Ms. Reece said.
But several shoppers said they were disappointed by Pathmark's prices. "For me, it's a beautiful place just to look," said Josefa Perez, who lives on 115th Street but does not plan to return to the new store until the prices have dropped.
Harvey Gutman, a senior vice president of Pathmark, said he was unaware of these complaints. But he added: "To the extent that we're not properly priced on a particular item, that's something we'll be correcting."
The new Pathmark, one of three in Manhattan, occupies a section of East 125th Street that is disfigured by tattoo parlors, boarded-up windows, and roll-down gates covered with graffiti. Near the store's entrance, men with shopping carts full of bottles and cans recently lined up in front of the recycling machines. Not far away, a small crowd of people with shopping carts crammed with bags of groceries waited for gypsy cabs.
For people accustomed to the cramped aisles that are typical of Manhattan markets, the new Pathmark (which is about the same size as its sister store on the Lower East Side) is almost breathtaking in its spaciousness. It has 25 aisles that are more than wide enough for two-way shopping-cart traffic and it offers a large array of products for Hispanic shoppers: an aisle full of packaged or canned food, a special section of personal-care products, and a sizeable selection of root vegetables like yuca.
There is a deli counter, a separate seafood section and enough varieties of cheese to satisfy Charleen Jones, a nurse at North General Hospital. Ms. Jones said she used to order cheese through the mail and go downtown to find Stouffer's frozen products for her son or hot ketchup to spice up her meals.
Carolyn Boyd, a secretary from Central Harlem, said she was used to dragging her two young sons from store to store to get her shopping done. "I'm just going crazy in here," Ms. Boyd said. "Everything I need in a store is right here." The market also contains a Chase Manhattan Bank branch, a pharmacy and rooftop parking for 125 cars.
For decades, most big supermarket chains had stayed away from the inner city. The buying power of residents was assumed to be minimal, and the likelihood of shoplifting and other types of crime seemed all too real. But Pathmark has operated in tough New York neighborhoods since 1965, when it opened the Bruckner Boulevard market. Then Pathmark started opening stores in partnership with community groups -- first in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn in 1979 and in Newark's Central Ward in 1990. The success of both markets convinced the company that there was money to be made in underserved communities.
Today, about two dozen of Pathmark's 133 supermarkets are in urban locations, Mr. Gutman said. But none has taken as long to open as the one in East Harlem.
It was to keep local families from spending their food dollars in other neighborhoods in New York -- or even in Yonkers or Paramus -- that Alice Kornegay, a community advocate in East Harlem who died in 1996, dreamed of converting the city-owned parking lot on 125th Street into a supermarket.
In 1991, the city requested proposals for building a market. When it became clear that the project could not be developed solely with private dollars, the city asked Local Initiatives Support Corporation, a national nonprofit organization known as LISC that assists local development corporations, to help find a community group with the wherewithal to get the market built and lease it to Pathmark. Profits would be plowed back into the community.
LISC, an investor in the project, identified the development arm of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Central Harlem, a group that had created hundreds of housing units, as the best choice to team up with Ms. Kornegay's organization, the Community Association of East Harlem Triangle. The partnership was blessed by Community Board 11, which represents East Harlem, after it was agreed that most of the 200 jobs generated by the market would go to local residents.
Proponents of the market had anticipated opposition from the independent markets in East Harlem, many of which are owned by immigrants from the Dominican Republic, but they were caught off guard by the vehemence of the campaign that was mounted against them.
As the market owners saw it, they had been willing to fill a need after the large chains left the inner city. Now they were being accused of running shoddy, overpriced stores, and they felt that the city was treating them unfairly by helping a mammoth competitor come in and drive them out of business. (The Fairway market that opened in a former meat-packing plant on the West Side Highway and 133d Street in 1995 did not inspire a similar protest because it is a privately developed store that caters as much to Upper West Siders as to Harlem residents, and it is not in an area saturated with medium-sized markets.)
As supporters of the Pathmark saw it, the owners of the independent markets were seeking to protect their own economic interests by raising unjustified fears that the supermarket would put 200 neighborhood bodegas out of business and by falsely claiming that the chain itself was being subsidized. In fact, Pathmark, which was acquired in March by Royal Ahold, a Dutch food retailer, is paying an annual rent of $1.5 million -- above the market rate -- because it expects the store to be profitable, Mr. Gutman said.
Because it involved a transfer of city land, the project required the approval of the Manhattan Borough Board, which is made up of City Council members, the heads of the community boards and the Borough President. In April 1995, the Pathmark squeaked through by a single vote of the board only after Guillermo Linares -- a City Council member from from a heavily Dominican district in Washington Heights and a close friend of Alfredo Rodriguez, the leader of the independent market owners -- took a political risk and decided at the last minute to support a project that even opponents conceded was supported by most members of the community.
But the project still needed the endorsement of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. The Mayor, who had campaigned against ethnic politics, now found himself under pressure from the markets and Hispanic politicians. Mr. Giuliani insisted that the city be given a 49 percent ownership in the market until it could be transferred to a Hispanic group. No Hispanic partner has yet been selected, Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington said recently.
Had the Pathmark deal collapsed, said Charles A. Gargano, the state Commissioner of Economic Development, "it would have been a major setback for economic development plans in Harlem." Instead, the store may attract future projects, including a 10-screen United Artists multiplex that has been proposed for a site across the street.
But the independent markets did not come away empty-handed.
Chase Manhattan, a major investor in the Pathmark, set up a program that has given out $12.1 million in loans to mid-sized markets, including six in East Harlem, bank officials said. One of the beneficiaries was Mr. Rodriguez, who said he got a $700,000 loan for a store he owns in Westbury, L.I.
After the Pathmark was approved, Mr. Rodriguez sold one market on 120th Street and Third Avenue, but he continues to operate a second store on 116th Street, near Lexington Avenue, where one of his customers, Ms. Hayes, has noticed some improvement. "We lost," he said, "but we gained respect."
Mr. Rodriguez's store on 120th Street was purchased by Efrain Martinez, who said he had spent $150,000 on improvements, including new shelves and flooring. "I'm going to try not to go out of business," Mr. Martinez said.

HEADLINE: DuPont's Profit Down 4.2% in Quarter

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del., April 27

 BODY:
The DuPont Company, the nation's biggest chemicals company, said today that its first-quarter profit fell 4.2 percent, less than expected, helped by a rebound in demand from Asia and lower costs of raw materials.
DuPont said first-quarter operating profit fell to $749 million, or 66 cents a diluted share, compared with $782 million, or 68 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Analysts expected the company to earn 60 cents a share, according to the First Call Corporation. Sales rose 1.6 percent, to $6.3 billion from $6.2 billion. 
 DuPont had a charge in the latest quarter of $121 million from its acquisition of Hoechst A.G.'s paints unit and $35 million in income from its interest in Conoco Inc., which DuPont plans to sell later this year, making net income $663 million, or 58 cents a share.
The company had a $145 million charge in the period a year earlier related to a revision in the purchase price for Protein Technologies International and $269 million in income from discontinued operations, making net income $906 million, or 79 cents a share.
In the most recent quarter, shipments to Asia, which contributes about 11 percent to DuPont's annual sales, increased 6 percent. Struggling Asian economies had dragged down profit the last few quarters, and DuPont shares rose after the company said 1999 earnings could be slightly stronger than previously expected.
Shares of DuPont, based in Wilmington, rose $2.375, to $69.125.

HEADLINE: Too Scared to Save Social Security

 BODY:

To the Editor:
An April 23 front-page article asserts that a plan developed by Representatives E. Clay Shaw Jr. and Bill Archer has been "certified by Social Security actuaries as sufficient to keep the system solvent for at least 75 years." This statement is misleading. Social Security's actuaries did calculate that the plan would keep the system solvent, if the stock market produces 7 percent real returns on average over the next 75 years. 
 The actuaries did not project that this would be the rate of return in the market over this period; they just applied the historic rate of return in their calculations. The actuaries project profit growth to be less than half as rapid in the next 75 years as in the last 75 years. Current stock prices are at record highs in relation to earnings. No economist has yet shown how the stock market can match its historic rate of return under these circumstances.

HEADLINE: City Gardens Endure

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "City Rejects $2 Million Offer for Gardens" (news article, April 23): As a professor of environmental psychology at the CUNY Graduate Center in the 1970's, I conducted the first extensive study of community gardens in New York City. Of the 10 community garden sites we studied, nine are still operating today, more than 20 years later. When compared with nearby city parks and playgrounds, the gardens were consistently rated by residents as safer, more heavily used and more beautiful. Since then, the number of gardens throughout the city has sharply increased. 
 I would characterize community gardens today as the new American commons. To sell them off is like selling pieces of Central Park for their economic development value.

New Jersey to Use Fund To Help Keep Port Lines

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
A New Jersey task force that holds the purse strings to a harbor-dredging fund yesterday approved spending $100 million to keep the state's two biggest shipping lines in New York Harbor.
The spending was approved by the Dredging Facilitation Task Force, a body that was created in 1996 to administer a $300 million bond fund approved by state voters to finance dredging, cleanup and economic development projects in the harbor, said Frank McDonough, executive director of the task force. 
 The expenditure was proposed by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman to allow the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to save $100 million it would have spent on dredging and to pass the savings on to the shipping lines in the form of lower leasing fees.
Sea-Land Service and Maersk Lines have threatened to relocate from ports in Elizabeth and Newark, respectively, to Baltimore, Halifax, Nova Scotia, or Norfolk, Va., which could send ripples through the local shipping industry, which officials say accounts for 170,000 jobs and $20 billion a year in economic activity.
John Boyd, a Maersk spokesman, said the company was "still deliberating." A Sea-Land employee said there was no word from the company yesterday on the possible move.

HEADLINE: In America;
Unmasking Poverty

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The cities have not been in the news much lately. Crime is down, unemployment is down and the ghettos are not burning down. What's to cover?
Compared with Monica and impeachment, the war in the Balkans, high school massacres and Hillary's quest for fulfillment, the status of daily life in places like Rochester, N.Y., or Flint, Mich., is -- to most people -- not worth thinking about. 
 But now comes Andrew Cuomo to awaken us from our urban snooze.
Despite a booming national economy and the creation of millions of jobs, many American cities still face a bewildering array of very serious problems. In an important new report called "Now Is the Time: Places Left Behind in the New Economy," Mr. Cuomo, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, argues that the current economic environment "offers the best opportunity in a generation to effectively address these problems."
Feel-good stories about the economy are waved in our faces like pompoms, making it easy to miss the astonishing fact (to cite just one example) that the poverty rate for the city of Miami is 42.8 percent.
That should be unacceptable, and a big story. But it's not even part of the national consciousness.
Most cities are doing reasonably well. But Mr. Cuomo's report, released yesterday in Washington, says that one in three central cities are struggling with persistently high poverty rates, one in five are experiencing steady population losses and one in six are faced with chronically high unemployment rates.
The problems are pervasive. According to the report, "The comparatively high unemployment areas, most of which are small or mid-sized cities, are found throughout the nation, from farm cities to former industrial giants, from timber towns to former mining centers: Yuma, Arizona, saw its unemployment rate fall modestly, from 19 percent in 1992 (pre-recovery) to 18.8 percent in 1998; Madera, California's rate fell more than 5 percent over the last six years but remains high at 18.3 percent; North Chicago, Illinois, saw a modest drop from 10.7 percent in 1992 to 10.3 percent last year; and unemployment in Yakima, Washington, has declined from 13.7 percent to 10.2 percent, still more than twice the national average in 1998."
The jobless rate in Madera, Calif., or Yakima, Wash., is not high on the list of most Americans' concerns. They are out of sight and far out of mind. And even in big cities like New York and Chicago, the ugly pockets of poverty and joblessness lie hidden and neglected in the shadows that surround the glittering economic successes.
"This economy is in some ways deceptive," said Mr. Cuomo. "It is so strong that it has generated almost an economic euphoria. But when you look at the numbers underneath, you see a widespread group of cities and counties which are lagging behind."
Because most of the country is doing well, and because of the residential and employment patterns that have emerged in the last few decades, most Americans never see the areas of extreme economic distress, and don't encounter their fellow citizens who are struggling.
Mr. Cuomo said that as he traveled the country talking about these problems, the reaction he frequently got was surprise. "You have to expose it because people don't see it anymore," he said. "They're surprised that it still exists."
The report lists what it describes as the economic successes of the Clinton Administration, including the creation of 18 million jobs, the lowest peacetime unemployment rates in decades, decreases in poverty rates among blacks and Hispanics, and a record rate of home ownership.
But despite those successes, the report says in its conclusion, "The great project of our nation -- extending opportunity to all -- remains incomplete."
The problems of America's cities are not limited to the cities. They have bled into the suburbs and they are evident in many areas of chronic economic distress, including Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta region and many of the nation's Indian reservations -- places Mr. Cuomo refers to as "economic flatliners."
If those problems are not forcefully addressed when the national economy is strong and budget surpluses are huge, said Mr. Cuomo, then when?

HEADLINE: To U.S., With Friendship and a (Semi)Fast Ball

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 28

 BODY:
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi prepared today for a meeting with President Clinton, working on his economic policy and on his pitching arm.
Mr. Obuchi, who is to leave on Thursday for the first official visit by a Japanese Prime Minister to the United States in 12 years, is expected to throw out the first ball at a Cubs game at Wrigley Field in Chicago on Saturday. So Mr. Obuchi, 61, who said he last threw a pitch about 50 years ago, spent part of the afternoon in his backyard with a baseball glove and a former pro pitcher. 
 "I'm really worried whether the ball will reach home plate or not," Mr. Obuchi said.
Judging from the practice session, which Mr. Obuchi good-naturedly allowed reporters to watch, he has good form but not much consistency. All in all, he seems to have a strong chance of getting the ball to home plate -- at least by the third bounce.
Other prime ministers have made working trips to Washington, but this is a more formal official visit and includes stays in Los Angeles on Thursday night and in Chicago on Friday and Saturday nights. Then Mr. Obuchi is to travel to Washington for talks on Monday with President Clinton and a White House dinner that evening.
This is a time of relative harmony in American-Japanese relations, and officials say the main purpose of the summit meeting is to reaffirm and strengthen the relationship rather than to resolve any particular disputes. But the backdrop will be Japan's faltering economy and American insistence that Japan do more to revive it.
The Group of Seven major industrial nations issued a communique on Monday calling on Japan to "implement stimulus measures until growth is restored, using all available tools." But in a meeting today with American reporters, Mr. Obuchi did not seem to take the hint; he suggested that Japan has already taken enough action for now and needs to allow time for results.
"We've adopted numerous measures," he said, pointing to various economic legislation passed in the last year. "I trust that favorable effects will emerge."
Asked specifically whether Japan would consider a supplementary budget to provide a stronger fiscal stimulus if current steps proved inadequate, Mr. Obuchi poured cold water on the idea, saying, "At this stage, we have no intention of drawing up a supplementary budget."
He emphasized that Government spending is only a modest part of the economy and suggested that there may be only so much that he or any official can do to revive the economy, which has been in an on-again-off-again slump since the early 1990's. He noted that the greatest part of the economy is private consumption, and added, "We are somewhat concerned that personal consumption so far has not yet shown a rising curve."
He said there are some areas where the Government can help, like promoting the housing industry and deregulating the economy. But he gave no indication that he was planning any dramatic program.
Mr. Obuchi and Mr. Clinton are also to discuss American military bases on Okinawa, where bases are concentrated and the opposition to them has traditionally been strongest. But the anti-bases movement in Japan has lost steam in the last few years, and public support for the bases and for the military alliance with the United States now seems stronger than ever.
"Our relations with the United States are the very foundation of Japanese foreign policy," Mr. Obuchi said today. "My own perception of Japan-U.S. relations is that they are at their best and most stable since Japan opened its doors to the outside world."
Mr. Obuchi has long been friendly to America, and today he recounted how as a college student in 1963, he visited the United States for the first time, staying in Washington at the Y.M.C.A. The son of a member of Parliament, Mr. Obuchi won a meeting with Robert F. Kennedy, who was then Attorney General, and was given a 1960 Kennedy-for-President tie clip showing a PT-109, the boat John F. Kennedy commanded when fighting Japan in World War II.
Inspired by that example, Mr. Obuchi said, he has used tie clips in his own campaigns in Japan. He said he was thinking about wearing the PT-109 clip on this trip but was afraid he might lose it.
On this trip to Washington, Mr. Obuchi will enjoy fancier accommodation, at Blair House, the official guest residence.
"Back in those days, the Y.M.C.A. was the cheapest place in Washington, $1.50 a night," Mr. Obuchi said. "But this time will be even cheaper. Blair House -- no charge!"

HEADLINE: A Police Chief In Khmer Rouge Resurfaces

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia, April 28

 BODY:
Long presumed dead, the chief of the secret police who directed a torture center for the Khmer Rouge has resurfaced, a convert from Communism to Christianity who has been living freely in western Cambodia, The Far Eastern Economic Review reports in an article to be published on Thursday.
The man, known as Duch, told reporters that he was deeply sorry for his actions and willing to face justice, the news magazine, based in Hong Kong, said. 
 Mr. Duch was found by chance by a freelance photographer, Nic Dunlop, who videotaped him. The magazine reported that Mr. Duch, 56, had admitted his identity and confessed to his role in the atrocities committed in the Khmer Rouge years in power, from 1975 to 1979.
Mr. Duch disappeared when the Khmer Rouge were toppled in 1979 and was long presumed dead. But, the magazina said, for at least several years he became an evangelical Christian and worked with international aid organizations that were unaware of his identity.
Mr. Duch's emergence could increase pressure on Prime Minister Hun Sen to put Khmer Rouge leaders on trial on charges of crimes against humanity. The Cambodian Genocide Program, financed by the United States, estimates that 1.7 million Cambodians from a population of 7.9 million were murdered, tortured, starved or worked to death under the Khmer Rouge.
Only one senior Khmer Rouge figure, Ta Mok, a hard-line commander, is in custody awaiting trial. Other surviving leaders have been allowed to live freely in exchange for making peace with the Government. Mr. Duch could be an important witness, able to implicate those above and below him.
Mr. Duch headed the Santebal or internal security organization, and was also responsible for Tuol Sleng, a former high school here that became a prison where at least 14,000 men, women and children were tortured before being killed.
The Khmer Rouge kept methodical records of the tortures. A document from 1978 shows that 17 children whose parents were suspected of treachery were taken to Tuol Sleng. Mr. Duch signed an order that said, "Kill them all."

DaimlerChrysler Has 23% Rise in Profits

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 28

 BODY:
Fueled by strong vehicle sales in the United States and healthy heavy-truck sales, DaimlerChrysler A.G. reported today that first-quarter profits increased by 23 percent, exceeding some analysts' forecasts.
Net profits totaled 1.6 billion euros, or $1.75 billion; the equivalent of $1.64 euros, or about $1.79 a share, versus 1.43 euros, or about $1.56 a share, for the corresponding period in 1998. Revenues rose 10 percent, to 35 billion euros, or about $38.28 billion. Profits and revenues were up in every category in which DaimlerChrysler competes. 
 These comparisons, provided by DaimlerChrysler, are based on the combined totals of Daimler-Benz A.G. and the Chrysler Corporation, which merged in November.
DaimlerChrysler is riding the wave of strong United States vehicle sales, which ran 10 percent above a year ago in the first quarter at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of nearly 17 million vehicles.
Chrysler products, such as the new Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Dodge Durango sport utility, have been well received as Chrysler has increased its market share. Profits from the sale of Chrysler vehicles rose 12 percent, to $1.5 billion, in the quarter. More than half of DaimlerChrysler's 2.8 billion euros, or $3.06 billion, in operating profits came from Chrysler, the company said.
"Chrysler is selling what people want and selling what people are willing to pay a premium for," said James Collins, an auto analyst with the London office of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "Chrysler's revenues were up slightly, but its operating margins improved from 9 percent to 9.6 percent. It's clearly a matter of the mix of vehicles Chrysler is selling."
Income from the sale of Mercedes-Benz and Smart vehicles, the second- largest contributor to DaimlerChrysler's operating profits, rose 4 percent. Mercedes is being dragged down by slow sales of the Smart car, a new minicar sold in Europe. Sluggish sales have led the auto maker to cut production by a third.
"Mercedes saw a good quarter, but it was slightly hidden under the continuing problems with the Smart car," Mr. Collins said. "The recent news of Smart sales has been better, but it's difficult to see longer term if the car will be viable. In the meantime, the Smart car is hurting the margins at Mercedes."
Mr. Collins predicts the Mercedes margins will be hurt only temporarily. The expected high profit margins of the new Mercedes top-of-the-line S-Class, introduced in Europe late last year and on sale since March in the United States, have yet to have an impact on DaimlerChrysler's balance sheet.
Strong sales of Freightliner heavy trucks helped profits in the commercial-truck segment increase by 12 percent, to 1.63 billion euros, or $1.78 billion. Profits from the company's aerospace unit more than doubled, and income from financial services operations also rose.
DaimlerChrysler's strong first-quarter results suggest increased revenues for the rest of the year, which are now expected to surpass its initial revenue target of 137 billion euros, or $149.84 billion, DaimlerChrysler's chairman, Jurgen E. Schrempp, said in a statement. Strength in the United States should offset a possible slowdown in sales in Europe during the second half of the year and continued economic problems in Asia, the company said.
The company's stock closed at $99.125, down $2.1875. European auto stocks declined after Volkswagen A.G. reported lower than expected profits, raising concerns about sales on the Continent.
Created by the $36 billion takeover of Chrysler by Daimler-Benz A.G., DaimlerChrysler, now the world's fifth-largest auto maker, also continues cost-cutting that will help increase operating profits at a rate greater than revenues over the year.
In a conference call, DaimlerChrysler executives told auto analysts that the cost-cutting benefits from the merger were minimal in the first quarter but would total $1.4 billion in savings for the full year.

China Toughens in Negotiations on Trade Group Membership

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, April 28

 BODY:
China appears to have toughened its stance in talks aimed at gaining entry to the World Trade Organization, making United States negotiators pay for President Clinton's decision earlier this month to delay a final deal.
In the latest turn in China's long and complex path toward membership in the group that makes the rules for global commerce, Chinese negotiators have accused American officials of making excessive demands. 
 "Some negotiators are reaching out for a yard after taking in an inch," Wu Yi, a State Councillor and senior trade official, said in Beijing. "They are demanding too high conditions that are impractical and unacceptable for China."
China also seems to be trying to use international leverage with European trade officials to put pressure on the United States to agree to a World Trade Organization deal more quickly.
Today, Chinese negotiators met for a third consecutive day in Beijing with negotiators from the European Union, in preparation for a visit by Sir Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner, who is scheduled to arrive in Beijing on May 5 and is expected to announce an agreement that China should finally be allowed into the world trade body.
Two separate groups of negotiators met about tariffs and on trading services, the New China News Agency reported.
Long Yongtu, China's chief negotiator, was quoted by the agency as saying that China was prepared to make extensive efforts to push forward the negotiations, apparently appealing for international support to counter American demands in its trade talks with China.
Just before Prime Minister Zhu Rongji's trip to the United States early this month, China made a broad array of concessions aimed at overcoming United States opposition for Chinese entry to the trade body, which China has sought for 13 years.
China agreed to import more American beef, citrus products and wheat, and to allow more openness in the telecommunications, financial services and entertainment fields. President Clinton rejected a proposed agreement, though, apparently judging the anti-China mood in Washington to be too strong to accept an accord.
After vigorous protests from United States business leaders that a good deal had been within reach, the Clinton Administration authorized a fresh round of negotiations aimed at preserving the momentum that had been achieved.
With the Americans on the defensive for what is widely seen to have been a lost opportunity during Mr. Zhu's visit, Chinese negotiators seem to want to take advantage of a suddenly strengthened negotiating position.
American officials now say that their latest round of talks with China, held last weekend, focused on financial services, an area where they say the most obstacles remain. They have demanded full rights for foreign banks operating in China to conduct business in local and foreign currencies and to serve both local and foreign customers.
The American negotiators say that China is insisting on too many restrictions on United States banks, insurers and other financial companies that want to enter the country. In response, Chinese officials argue that equalizing market access for Chinese and foreign banks could be disastrous for domestic banks.
"Excessive growth of nonbank financial institutions could lead to a financial crisis," The China Economic Times reported, quoting a position paper from the State Development and Planning Commission. "Foreign-invested firms, supported by their banks, could easily take over sectors of the market and monopolize industries."

HEADLINE: Corporate Conduct Code Is Proposed for Third World Nations

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28

 BODY:
Corporations around the world will be encouraged to offer employees stock-ownership plans and other profit-sharing incentives under a new code of good corporate conduct that finance ministers from 29 industrial countries are expected to endorse next month.
The code was drawn up by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development at the request of member governments last year after the financial meltdown in Asia. The organization said the crisis highlighted what it called the need for better standards of business behavior in that region of the world. 
 Introducing the code today, the organization's secretary general, Donald J. Johnston, called it a "cornerstone for attracting foreign investment into the developing world."
He described the code as complementary to the efforts of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, which are holding their annual spring meetings here, to strengthen the international financial system after the crises in Asia and Latin America.
"The Asian crisis highlighted the weakness in transparency, in regulation and in overall good governance in the corporate sector in a number of countries," Mr. Johnston said.
The code, which will be approved at a meeting in Paris on May 26, comes a few months after the organization banned corporate bribery and after ratification by 12 governments including the United States, Germany, Japan and Britain. Mr. Johnston said France was expected to ratify the code this summer.
This prohibition on bribery, which closely follows existing American law, requires ratifying countries to introduce domestic legislation making it a criminal offense for their corporations to bribe foreign officials to win business contracts.
Although the code will be voluntary, Mr. Johnson said that the World Bank and the monetary fund could insist that governments encourage companies to follow its prescriptions as a condition for loans they offer.
Most of the code's provisions are already accepted practice in the Western industrialized world. The recommendation that corporations offer profit-sharing plans to employees comes in the section dealing with "the role of stakeholders in corporate governance," which calls for "active cooperation" between businesses and all those with a stake in their success, such as workers and suppliers.
Other sections of the code define the rights of shareholders and provide for their equitable treatment. The code also lays down general principles for corporate disclosure of finances and management and defines the responsibilities of a board of directors.
After a meeting of the joint Development Committee of the World Bank and the monetary fund, which deals with poorer nations and those recovering from conflicts, the World Bank president, James D. Wolfensohn, said today that he expected the number of Kosovar refugees to rise from 600,000 at present to 950,000.
Within 30 days, he said, the World Bank and the European Union plan to establish a jointly financed relief operation and to start planning for the refugees' eventual return as well as for the reconstruction of Kosovo.
He also said that the longer the bombing lasts in Yugoslavia, the greater the economic damage to surrounding countries like Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania and Romania, which are suffering trade and investment losses.

HEADLINE: Orders Up in March For Durable Goods

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28

 BODY:
Orders for big-ticket goods made in the United States rose in March for the fourth time in five months, a sign that the rebound in manufacturing is real, Government figures showed today.
Orders for products like cars, washing machines and computers rose a stronger-than-expected 2 percent last month, Commerce Department figures showed. Even counting a 3.9 percent decline in February, first-quarter orders rose at the strongest quarterly pace in four years. 
 The gain in orders for durable goods last month suggests the drag on manufacturing from last year's recessions in Asia, Russia and Latin America may be waning.
In March, durable goods orders rose in almost every category surveyed by the Government. Orders for planes and cars rose 3.6 percent, for example, and electrical equipment orders -- including household appliances -- rose 3.1 percent. Industrial machinery orders, which includes personal computers, increased 2.9 percent.
Excluding airplanes, autos and other transportation equipment rose 1.5 percent after falling eight-tenths of a percent in February.
In addition, orders for nonmilitary capital goods, excluding aircraft, rose 4.5 percent last month, the fourth increase in the last five months, suggesting businesses are optimistic enough about the future to invest in new equipment.

Out at Last, Prisoner 3514 Catches Up on 40 Years

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, April 23

 BODY:
For four decades in prison, Woo Yong Gak coolly handled just about every challenge life could throw at him, from the most brutal tortures to endless spells of solitary confinement.
Yet a few things do intimidate Mr. Woo these days in a way that torturers never could. Vending machines, for example. 
 "How do you do this, anyway?" Mr. Woo asked, staring in puzzlement at a hot-drink machine on a Seoul street. "I've never used one of these contraptions."
Mr. Woo, 69, emerged in February after 40 years, 7 months and 13 days in prison, after becoming known in human rights circles as the world's longest-serving political prisoner. After decades simply as Prisoner 3514, he has recovered his name and he has a nice new watch on his wrist and he is even taking lessons in using computers.
"But," he said quickly, "I haven't gotten as far as getting an E-mail address."
Nowhere could a Rip Van Winkle encounter greater changes in four decades than in South Korea, the world's fastest-growing economy in that period. These changes are particularly poignant because they seem to challenge everything that Mr. Woo believed in, everything that carried him through beatings and sickness and the constant threat of anonymous death in the darkness of his prison cell.
Mr. Woo endured because of his faith in the Communist Government of North Korea, and in 1958, when he was arrested, that might have seemed a good bet. North Korea then was booming economically and was regarded by many Koreans as a more legitimate government than the American-backed dictatorship in the South.
Yet now Mr. Woo has been released into a different world, one where South Korea is a rich, industrialized country and a vigorous democracy. North Korea, on the other hand, is so poor that it is suffering a famine, and it remains a tightly run authoritarian nation halfway between a Communist country and an ancient Korean kingdom.
None of this persuades Mr. Woo to change his loyalties. In a long conversation in the offices of a human rights group that battled on his behalf, he comes across as friendly, humorous and polite -- and a dedicated North Korean Communist.
"The real issue isn't economic development," he said stoutly, dismissing South Korea's economic gains. "G.N.P. -- that's just numbers. The fact that the living standard has increased might be an interesting research topic, but it's not everything."
As for politics, Mr. Woo is not particularly impressed by the degree of freedom in the society that imprisoned him for 40 years. For a determined Korean nationalist like Mr. Woo, the crucial issue is whether a country is self-sufficient and can stand on its own. And there he finds North Korea does better.
"We have lost our self-reliance here," he added, referring to South Korea. "Economically, politically and militarily, the level of dependence on the outside has increased."
South Korea, as a vibrant democracy whose President, Kim Dae Jung, is himself a longtime dissident, may seem like an odd place to have held the world's longest-serving political prisoner. But South Korea somehow manages to be deeply authoritarian as well as vigorously democratic, and there is strong public support for repressive laws that punish anyone who praises the enemy in the North.
Minkahyup, a leading human rights group, says South Korea still has more than 200 political prisoners. The longest-serving political prisoner now that Mr. Woo has been released is Sohn Song Mo, 70, who has been imprisoned for 18 years.
"President Kim Dae Jung has been honored with human rights awards and touted as a 'human rights President,' " said Nam Kyu Sun, the secretary general of Minkahyup. "But such things don't make a 'human rights President.' "
The way for Mr. Kim to really earn the title, Mrs. Nam said, would be to ease the National Security Law that punishes Communist sympathizers and to curtail the security organizations that now run around seizing people who praise North Korea.
Although Mr. Woo came to be renowned as a political prisoner, he started his prison career as an ordinary spy. He was commander of a boat that was gathering intelligence on South Korea's coast when he and his comrades were captured in July 1958.
But such intruders were quickly released if they agreed to denounce North Korea and cooperate with the South, and indeed some of Mr. Woo's companions were freed in this way. Even terrorists who blew up a South Korean airliner and attacked the presidential mansion were pardoned after switching sides, and no one doubts that Mr. Woo would have been freed as well if he had not stubbornly clung to his faith in the North.
Day after day, the torturers battered Mr. Woo, trying to force him to sign a statement denouncing North Korea. He lost his teeth to the torture -- now he is outfitted with dentures -- and he says his best times in those decades were the moments when he felt himself fainting from the pain.
"It was such a peaceful feeling," he recalled. "I was so comfortable."
"The most unbearable thing was watching my friends dying of the torture, one by one," he said, adding that 12 of his companions died that way. The worst heartache, he said, was when a childhood friend, Choi Seok Ki, was stomped to death in his prison cell for refusing to renounce North Korea.
When Mr. Woo left on his mission, he had a wife and a 4-year-old son in North Korea, and he says the knowledge that they were safe was an enormous comfort to him.
"The thought that my child would remember me as a father who went missing while fighting for reunification was a source of great strength to me," he recalled.
North Korea and South Korea have talked publicly about exchanging prisoners, so that Mr. Woo could go home and see his family again -- although he has no word on whether they are still alive. But those talks quickly broke down, and so Mr. Woo remains stuck in South Korea.
He is trying to make the most of it by taking his computer classes and trying to acquire skills that might help him get a job in some charitable organization. But he has a lot to catch up on, for until his release he had never done something so simple as ride a subway or make a telephone call.
"Things that are common knowledge to other people are all new to me," he said with a laugh. "I've made some phone calls, now, but I'm still really bad at speaking on the telephone."

HEADLINE: A German-Italian Merger

 BODY:
The economic integration of Western Europe, as signified by the common euro currency, was designed in part to help European businesses unify to become world-class competitors that could compete with giant American companies. A merger of Deutsche Telekom and Telecom Italia is unlikely to produce such a company.
The merger, agreed to last week, would create one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world, as measured by market value. But for that company to be an effective competitor it would need to pursue efficiencies under a management dedicated to making money and improving service. Nationalistic interests would need to take a back seat. 
 But those goals seem to have been overlooked in this deal. The merged company is to be managed on the basis of "parity," with neither old company dominating the merged entity and the German Government agreeing not to meddle in management although it will own 45 percent of the stock.
This is a marriage born of desperation, not of love. The Italian company wants to fend off a hostile takeover offer from Olivetti, a much smaller Italian concern. Deutsche Telekom and Telecom Italia -- once state-owned monopolies in their countries -- have been struggling with the deregulated and internationalized telecommunications market. They have entered into a variety of foreign alliances that so far have shown little in the way of results.
It will be difficult for a merged Italian-German business to overcome internecine rivalries and provide superior service at a reasonable cost. If it fails to do so, the result will be a huge company that will gradually see its markets picked off by more nimble competitors.

A soft-spoken plan for global reform that lacks a big stick.

BYLINE: By Michael M. Weinstein 

 BODY:
TREASURY Secretary Robert E. Rubin's proposal for reforming international financial institutions, announced on the eve of this week's gathering of the world's finance officials in Washington, was greeted mostly with yawns. His ideas were described as modest or cautious -- tinkering in a financially hazardous world that cries out for bold architectural overhaul.
But the problem with Mr. Rubin's proposal, some prominent economists say, lies not with its cautious ideas. Prof. Barry Eichengreen of the University of California at Berkeley argues that modest reforms are what are needed. "The problem with Mr. Rubin's policy announcement," he said, "is too little follow-through." 
 Gary Hufbauer of the Institute for International Economics agrees. "Mr. Rubin failed to outline concrete steps that would translate pleasant words into effective action."
Financial crisis struck Asia hard in the summer of 1997, spread to Russia and Brazil last year and continues to threaten Japan and China. The International Monetary Fund intervened but could not prevent steep recessions in any of the countries. The question that lingers is how to stop currency crises before they spread.
Mr. Rubin would discourage the use of pegged exchange rates -- rates that are temporarily linked to the dollar but easily abandoned during crises. Countries inevitably run out of dollars to prop up their currency, accelerating the flight of investors and precipitating a currency crisis. "At the center of each recent crisis," Mr. Rubin argues, "has been a rigid exchange-rate regime that proved ultimately unsustainable."
To discourage the practice, Mr. Rubin would, with caveats, deny large bailouts to countries that peg their currencies. That could persuade most developing countries to adopt floating rates or currency boards, which bind the value of a currency to the dollar with no easy way to opt out.
Mr. Rubin also proposed that creditors bear more of the cost of bailing out insolvent governments. And he wants developing countries to accept fewer short-term loans, the kind that cause creditors to flee at the first whiff of financial trouble. That prescription might encourage developing countries to adopt measures that the industrialized powers have historically opposed, including taxes on short-term capital loans.
Economists point out that it takes more than hortatory language to achieve Mr. Rubin's goals.
To force creditors to bear some of the cost of bailing out insolvent governments requires rewriting contracts that govern the issuing of their bonds. Those contracts would need to allow a majority of creditors to renegotiate on behalf of all bondholders rather than require unanimous consent. The bond contracts would also need to require creditors that sue delinquent governments to share settlements with all bond holders. Only then could creditors as a group accept lower interest payments rather than driving the debtor government into default.
But, Professor Eichengreen points out, no developing country can rewrite bond contracts on its own. If Ecuador tried to write anti-creditor provisions into its contracts, creditors would take their money elsewhere. There is, however, one country that could proceed with impunity. Professor Eichengreen says that Mr. Rubin could have announced that the United States would take the lead and incorporate majority voting and settlement-sharing provisions into its bond offerings, giving cover for other countries to mimic.
Mr. Hufbauer makes a similar point about Mr. Rubin's call for steering developing countries away from short-term loans. Mr. Rubin could have made headway had he proposed, for example, that the banking authorities in the United States impose higher reserve requirements on banks that make such loans. Mr. Rubin calls instead for international guidelines.
Mr. Hufbauer and Professor Eichengreen are more supportive of Mr. Rubin's decision to avoid the many grandiose ideas that have been proposed to solve the international financial crisis. Some want to create an international "lender of last resort" -- an international central bank that would make loans to distressed governments, just as the Federal Reserve does to distressed banks in the United States. Others call for an international agency, modeled on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to insure foreign loans. The idea would be to reassure skittish investors that their loans were safe so they need not bolt at the first signs of financial stress.
But Professor Eichengreen exposes the flaws of ambitious institution building in a book published earlier this year. International pledges to insolvent governments encourage investors to take unwarranted risks.
Besides, international authorities cannot provide unlimited loans or insurance to individual governments or banks without the right to halt activities that threaten solvency -- an invasion of sovereignty that no proponent of these new institutions has yet to tackle.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS;
In Clinton's Words: 'Speak With a Single Voice'

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's statement on Kosovo and questions and answers yesterday at the White House, as recorded by The New York Times, and a letter he wrote to House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert :
 
Statement by Clinton 
 I just had a good meeting with a large bipartisan delegation from both houses of Congress on Kosovo. It was our fourth meeting since the air strikes began. We spoke about the NATO summit, its unity and determination to achieve our objectives in Kosovo, about the progress of our military campaign and the intensification of economic sanctions, about the humanitarian challenge that we face and the work that we and our allies are doing to meet it.
Just on Monday, some 3,500 Kosovar refugees in trains and buses arrived in Montenegro. Yesterday about 5,000 entered Macedonia. Almost 3,000 arrived in Albania exhausted, hungry, shaken, all by the violence and abuse they experienced on the way.
At one point, 1.8 million ethnic Albanians lived in Kosovo. Nearly one and a half million have been displaced since the start of the crisis. . . .
We are also providing more funds to the U.S. High Commissioner for Refugees and to NGO's to deliver food and supplies to the refugees. Our Defense Department has found a site for the facility it will build in Albania for up to 20,000 refugees. We hope it will begin taking in refugees in about two weeks.
I spoke to members of Congress about all these efforts today. I told them that now is the time to pass the supplemental funding for Kosovo that I requested nine days ago. We needed to maintain our military readiness. Just as important, we need to sustain humanitarian relief and support for the front-line nations that have absorbed the brunt of this emergency.
Let me stress that my request fully funds our military and humanitarian needs in Kosovo. The Congress should resist the temptation to add unrelated expenditures, even important ones, which could delay the process, because that would undermine the very goals that this funding is intended to meet. We must get a Kosovo funding measure passed and to my desk now.
We also talked about other legislative initiatives pending on Kosovo in the Congress. I stressed that the 19 NATO allies are speaking with a single voice. America must continue to speak with a single voice, as well. I told them we would welcome the support of the Congress, so that Mr. Milosevic will have no doubt that we have the determination and the patience to persevere until we prevail.
Each day our military campaign takes a toll on Serbia's machinery of repression. The Serbian leadership has failed to divide us and will not outlast us. The combined military might and moral determination of Europe and North America will endure.
We know what the final outcome will be. The Serbian forces will leave Kosovo. An international security force will deploy to protect all the people there, Serbs as well as Albanians. And the refugees will return with security and self-government.
Q -- Mr. President, do you see any signs that Milosevic is losing his grip, Sir? Any signs at all?
CLINTON -- We have some indications that there are differences of opinion, obviously, developing in Belgrade. And we saw some of it public this week. There are some things that we know that I -- I think I should not comment on.
But the thing I want to tell the American people is we know objectively what damage has been done. We know now we're going to be in a position to fly around the clock at lower altitudes from all directions in better weather. Historically, the weather is better in May than in April, better in June than in May, better in July than in June.
Letter to Hastert --
Dear Mr. Speaker:
 I appreciate the opportunity to continue to consult closely with the Congress regarding events in Kosovo.
The unprecedented unity of the NATO members is reflected in our agreement at the recent summit to continue and intensify the air campaign. Milosevic must not doubt the resolve of the NATO alliance to prevail. I am confident we will do so through use of air power.
However, were I to change my policy with regard to the introduction of ground forces, I can assure you that I would fully consult with the Congress. Indeed, without regard to our differing constitutional views on the use of force, I would ask for Congressional support before introducing U.S. ground forces into Kosovo into a nonpermissive environment. Milosevic can have no doubt about the resolve of the United States to address the security threat to the Balkans and the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo. The refugees must be allowed to go home to a safe and secure environment.
 
Sincerely,
Bill Clinton

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Paper and Chemical Issues Send Dow to One More High

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Chemical, paper and other stocks sensitive to the business cycle turned in another strong performance yesterday while technology and other longtime market leaders sagged.
The sharply split performance, which resulted in a flat market over all, left analysts struggling to figure the significance of this month's sudden but erratic revival of cyclical stocks. 
 "The market doesn't have a well-organized, broad-based economic theme to support itself any more," said Christine A. Callies, chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. "It's confusing. The market goes in several different directions at once."
The Dow Jones industrial average, driven by cyclical stocks, sailed above the 10,900 mark for the first time but swooned late in the session and managed to hang on to only 13.74 points of a gain that had swelled to more than 103 points. Still, the one-tenth of a percent rise, to 10,845.45, was a new high.
The Nasdaq composite index, meanwhile, lost 52.04 points, or 2 percent, to 2,550.37, as software and computer stocks slumped, led by Amazon.com, which fell 12 3/8, to 193 1/2. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 11.89 points, or nine-tenths of a percent, to 1,350.91.
All of the top-performing blue-chip stocks from yesterday stand to benefit from stepped-up global economic growth. Alcoa added 6 5/8, to 62; DuPont rose 4 3/8, to 73 1/2; Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing climbed 3 11/16, to 84 1/2;Exxon increased 3 1/4, to 81 1/2, andAllied Signal was up 3 1/16, to 59 1/16.
The biggest drags on the Dow were I.B.M., down 7, to 205, and American Express, down 5 11/16, to 133 1/16.
"We're seeing continued rotation away from consumer stocks, particularly pharmaceuticals, into industrial companies and oils," said Timothy E. Woolston, a portfolio manager at Boston Advisors. Merck fell 2 13/16, to 70 3/4, and Johnson & Johnson dropped 2 7/16, to 99 1/2.
Vernon Winters, chief investment officer at Mellon Private Asset Management, called America's large-capitalization growth stocks "perhaps the most overpriced asset" in the world. Money should flee them, he said, and "flow to the broader universe of stocks."
Dow Chemical jumped 8 1/2, to 126 1/2, to lead a strong showing by chemical companies. The paper group featured Mead, up 4 3/4, to 43 5/16, with the aid of a recommendation by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter; Bowater rose 5 7/8, to 52, after earnings fell less than expected, and Georgia-Pacific increased 4 1/16, to 94 1/8. Its gain is now above 60 percent for the year.
The most actively traded issue, McKesson HBOC, the biggest drug wholesaler, was one of the biggest casualties. It plunged 31 1/4, to 34 1/2, after restating earnings because of improperly recorded sales.
Aetna joined the long list of big companies that beat Wall Street's expectations this spring and its shares soared 10 3/8, to 92. But America Online, whose report after the close on Tuesday did little better than match forecasts, dropped 10, to 143, still more than eight times its price on Sept. 1.
Nasdaq, which fell for a second consecutive day after five advances, reflected losses in its dominant high-technology sector, with Microsoft, down 1 7/8, to 82 1/8, having the biggest effect. Next were Cisco, which was down 3 5/16, to 111 3/4; Dell, which fell 1 9/16, to 41 5/8, and Amazon.com. Ebay skidded 16 11/16, to 192 9/16, and Yahoo fell 11, to 173 1/2.
The Morgan Stanley cyclical index jumped 2.6 percent, its biggest gain since April 15, and lifted its gain for the month to more than 20 percent.
On the New York Stock Exchange, volume was a moderately heavy 951.8 million shares as 1,753 stocks rose and 1,279 fell. New 52-week highs were made by 82 issues compared with 28 new lows.

Bond prices fell yesterday as the dollar dropped against the yen, oil prices surged and investors bought $17.1 billion of new debt securities.
The Treasury sold $15 billion of two-year notes, and the Delphi Automotive Systems Corporation led yesterday's corporate sales by issuing $1.5 billion. The Sprint Corporation plans to sell $3 billion of bonds today, and investors are worried that the new sales will swamp demand.
The price of the benchmark 30-year bond fell 19/32, to 95 8/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.58 percent from 5.54 percent. Yields on two-year notes rose to 5.01 percent from 4.99 percent.

HEADLINE: 2 Key Republicans Press Ahead on Social Security, Offering Investment-Account Plan

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28

 BODY:
Hoping to breathe life into the dying effort to shore up Social Security, two pivotal House Republicans laid out a plan today that they said would assure the retirement system's long-term health without cutting benefits or raising taxes.
The plan would plug the projected hole in Social Security's balance sheet by taking trillions of dollars in Government revenue in coming decades and giving it to workers in the form of tax rebates. The workers would then have to invest that money in the stock and bond markets through individual accounts, with the proceeds going to help finance their retirement benefits. 
 Although the proposal is similar to the approach advocated by most Republicans, it has been shunned by the party's leaders, in part to avoid what they fear would be a losing political fight with Congressional Democrats and President Clinton. As a result, the plan has virtually no chance of passage, and some members of both parties said Social Security was all but dead as a substantive issue until after the 2000 elections.
But the plan's authors, Representatives Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and E. Clay Shaw Jr. of Florida, the chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security, said they intended to push ahead anyway, in the hope that they could create momentum for bipartisan negotiations this year.
Insuring that Social Security can weather the retirement of the baby-boom generation and be there for future generations should be a matter of "principle over politics," said Mr. Archer, who, retiring from Congress at the end of this term, is freed of some of the political pressure that is a concern of the other leaders.
Mr. Clinton's aides said he believed that a deal was still possible. The President is to map his next move in a strategy session with his advisers on Thursday, and, while Administration officials said they were not considering any dramatic new proposals, they also said they would look for ways to make a gesture to Mr. Archer and other Republicans. Among the options on the table are technical changes in the way Mr. Clinton's current plan would use the surplus to help Social Security. Also being considered is an effort to convince Republicans that Mr. Clinton's proposal for a new type of individual retirement account outside of Social Security could be part of a package to strengthen the system.
Seeking to nurture the remnants of bipartisan good will on the issue, White House officials gave the Archer-Shaw plan a gentle reception today, saying they objected to some of its components but appreciated Mr. Archer's willingness to tackle a subject that many Republicans have been loath to touch.
"This looks like a serious attempt to engage in a very important debate," said Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary.
Although many House Democrats attacked the plan, others, including Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, muted their criticism. After being briefed on the plan by Mr. Archer and Mr. Shaw this afternoon, some committee Democrats said that although they found it deeply flawed, it could be the basis for negotiation if the Republican leadership was willing to engage on the issue.
Without any changes, Social Security will run short of money needed to pay the full level of promised benefits starting in 2034, after the retirement of the baby-boom generation. Mr. Clinton's approach relies largely on using the projected budget surplus to bolster Social Security's finances and allowing the Government to invest a part of the retirement system's reserves in stocks.
The Archer-Shaw plan uses the same basic tools but in a very different way. Each year all workers would receive from the Federal Government a tax credit equal to two percentage points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax that finances Social Security benefits. Because the payroll tax is currently levied only on the first $72,600 of wages (the amount is adjusted each year for inflation), the maximum annual credit if the plan were now law would be $1,452.
The money would be automatically deposited in a Social Security account in the worker's name. The worker would then choose from among a variety of mutual funds, all of which would be required to hold 60 percent of their assets in stock indexes and 40 percent in high-grade corporate bonds. Any gains in the account would accumulate tax-free.
At retirement, the money in the account would be used to help finance the worker's Social Security benefit. All workers would receive at least as much as promised under the current system, regardless of how well their investments fared. Those workers whose accounts did particularly well would come out ahead.
Democrats said the plan had two major flaws. It relies on budget surpluses to finance the tax credit, and the surplus, they said, is likely to be exhausted sometime in the next several decades. And it creates what Democrats said would be an unwieldy system of more than 100 million individual accounts that would be very expensive to administer.
While the chances of serious bipartisan negotiations this year remain dim, some in both parties said there might be an opportunity now to look at other compromise proposals, including one being developed by Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland.
In a nod to the Republican desire to shift more control to individuals, Mr. Cardin's plan would establish savings accounts within Social Security but would have them supplement the current system rather than replace part of it. And in an effort to appeal to Democrats, his plan would also allow the Government to invest a part of the system's money on Wall Street, but only under restrictions that would limit political meddling in the investment decisions.

HEADLINE: De Niro and Miramax Plan a Film Studio at the Brooklyn Navy Yard

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The actor Robert De Niro and Miramax Films plan to announce a tentative deal with city officials to build a $150 million Hollywood-style film studio at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, the sprawling complex where tens of thousands of workers once built and launched warships and tankers.
According to executives on both sides of the negotiations, the proposed movie studio would include 12 sound stages in three buildings on a 15-acre site within the Navy Yard and would employ thousands of people. It would be used by Mr. De Niro's TriBeCa Productions, Miramax Films and other companies in the industry, which has overrun New York in recent years, spending $2.6 billion last year alone on crews, equipment, supplies and services. 
 Still, the $150 million plan faces major obstacles, particularly regarding its financing and questions about the long-term viability of such a venture. The project's backers are investing $35 million; they have already raised an additional $35 million from city government sources, and will need another $80 million in financing, people involved in the talks said.
Despite the growth of film and television production in New York, the plan to develop the Navy Yard into film studios has had a tortured history ever since it was first suggested last June. But Mr. De Niro, Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax, and another partner in the venture, Steven Roth, chairman of Vornado Realty Trust, are expected to take an important step at the Navy Yard next Monday by signing a nonbinding letter of intent to go ahead with the project.
Even as recently as last week, the negotiations nearly unraveled over a rent dispute between officials at the Navy Yard and the studio group. After frantic meetings over the weekend, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani met with Mr. De Niro and Mr. Weinstein on Monday and put the deal back on track. The meetings were first reported yesterday in The New York Observer.
The studio group, which is led by Mr. De Niro, has been hampered by insufficient financing. A week ago, however, the Union Labor Life Insurance Company, a union-supported pension fund that has invested in New York real estate projects, notified the group and the city that it is considering whether to finance or invest in the project.
"We're taking a hard look at it," said Michael Steed, senior vice president for investments at Union Life in Washington. "It's clear that New York doesn't have enough studios to handle both the television and film production that could take place there. What's unclear to us is exactly what types of studios should be there -- film or television -- and where they should be."
Under the terms of the tentative deal, the city would provide a $25 million, low-interest loan and the city's Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation, which oversees the industrial park there, would contribute up to $10 million in cash.
The rent would rise from almost nothing to market rates over the term of a 50-year lease.
"This is the equivalent of a Universal Studio, where they could shoot a whole movie from start to finish," said one person involved in the negotiations. "If this is a success it could revitalize the entire area."
Another recent participant in the talks has been the Fisher real estate family, a major Manhattan landlord. The Fishers would oversee construction and, possibly, become a partner in the project.
A deal would not only rejuvenate an area that was long a main source of the city's economic muscle, but would also provide growth space for the city's booming film industry. The number of feature films shot in New York City soared to 221 last year, up from 69 in 1993. During the same period, the number of television production shooting days jumped to 7,680, from 3,598. But most of the post-production work is done elsewhere and many companies prefer to shoot interior shots in Toronto or Los Angeles.
There are a number of small sound stages in New York already, including Chelsea Piers, home to "Law and Order" and "Spin City," and Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, where "Sesame Street" and the "Cosby Show" are recorded. But a number of proposed projects have had difficulty finding financial support because the stages, which require a large investment, are generally at the mercy of filmmakers who do not want to pay a lot of money for short periods of work.
Union Life had planned to finance Hudson River Studios, a proposed $120 television sound stage atop the St. John's Center, at Houston and West Streets on the West Side of Manhattan. But when the developer ran into delays in acquiring additional financing, Union Life withdrew. Union Life is now considering getting involved again in Hudson River Studios, Mr. Steed said.
Last year, the Shooting Gallery, an independent film production company, announced plans to build a $75 million movie lot in Harrison, N.J. In the end, the company scaled back its plans for 15 sound stages and opened a $5 million production center in lower Manhattan.
"It's a very tough, very fluid business that's hard to keep going," said Hal G. Rosenbluth, president of Kaufman Astoria Studios. "If Harry and Bob can fill the studio with their own work then they're way ahead of the game."
The idea of building a studio at the Navy Yard originated not with Mr. De Niro, but with Cary Dean Hart and Louis Madigan, a movie-set designer and computer consultant, respectively, who proposed building a $160 million complex at the Navy Yard last June, but were unable to raise capital, despite support from the city. Sony Pictures Entertainment Company agreed to manage the studio at one point, but declined to invest in the project.
About six months ago, Mr. De Niro approached city officials about building a studio. Mr. Giuliani suggested that he look at the Navy Yard and talk to Mr. Madigan and his partner.
Mr. Hart and Mr. Madigan declined to comment yesterday.
More recently, Mr. De Niro approached Mr. Weinstein about the project. "I'm told De Niro was having dinner with Harvey Weinstein who got excited about it," one city official said. "The whole thing got serious in the last six weeks."

HEADLINE: Man Charged With Receiving 7 Years of School Pay Illegally

BYLINE: By JULIAN E. BARNES 

 BODY:
For more than seven years, James Hardy collected a paycheck, was given satisfactory evaluations and received cost-of-living raises. But in those seven years he never worked a day at his public school job, the Special Commissioner of Investigation for the New York City schools charged yesterday.
Investigators from Special Commissioner Edward F. Stancik's office arrested Mr. Hardy, 32, of Brooklyn on charges of stealing $193,259 from the school system by continuing to receive pay from an internship program that he left in 1990. 
 From September 1984 until August 1990, Mr. Stancik said, Mr. Hardy was enrolled in New York State's Substitute Vocational Assistant program. The program, which now has 47 participants, trains high school graduates for vocational teaching jobs. These interns draw a salary while getting technical training in a trade or craft and helping classroom teachers.
At the end of the five-and-a-half-year program, the participants must pass a final exam to become certified teachers. Mr. Hardy never passed that test, but he was never dismissed, either. In 1990, his salary was $25,000; by 1997, it had risen to $27,500.
During the course of the scheme, Mr. Stancik said, Mr. Hardy collected his paychecks and submitted forged time sheets as an intern at Van Arsdale High School in Brooklyn. He was found out in September 1997 after the state cut financing for the program at Van Arsdale. The principal, Bruce Billig, then met with Mr. Hardy and fired him after he admitted that he was not working for the Board of Education, according to Mr. Stancik's report.
After he was fired, Mr. Hardy tried to apply for unemployment benefits, but was met by an undercover investigator from Mr. Stancik's office in February 1998. Mr. Hardy was arrested yesterday and is in jail awaiting arraignment, the commissioner's office said. The office had no record of the name of his lawyer.
Mr. Stancik's report singles out the former and current principals at Van Arsdale High School, two former payroll secretaries at the school and two former administrators of the internship program. Mr. Stancik recommended yesterday that the current employees be disciplined and the former employees never again offered jobs.
In interviews yesterday, several of those current and former employees blamed one another or the school district for failing to catch Mr. Hardy. Carla Barnet, the payroll secretary at Van Arsdale until 1993, who now works at Canarsie High School, said that there was no way for her to know Mr. Hardy's time sheets were faked and that the high school administrators or the intern program supervisor should have caught Mr. Hardy.
Dwight Threepersons, the coordinator of the internship program from 1984 to 1990, said human resources officials should have fired Mr. Hardy.
"It was the system that failed, not me," said Mr. Threepersons, who now works for the White Plains public schools.
John Woodman, the principal at Van Arsdale from 1987 to 1993, gave Mr. Hardy six satisfactory evaluations during the time he was doing no work and not supposed to be in the program. "If he was missing for seven years, this was a mystery to me," Mr. Woodman said. "I had no reason to be looking for him."
The alleged theft undermines confidence in the city's public schools, especially its evaluation procedures, Mr. Stancik said.
"No one was paying attention," he said. "It is hard for me to have any confidence that these people are handling their other jobs properly."
A spokeswoman for the Board of Education, Margie Feinberg, said the Schools Chancellor, Dr. Rudy Crew, had not read Mr. Stancik's report yesterday afternoon and had not yet determined if he needed to take any action.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Agrees to Make Loan, But Not Send Cash, to Russia

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund announced a preliminary agreement tonight to lend Russia $4.5 billion over the next 18 months, the first resumption of loans since the country defaulted on its debts and devalued its currency last summer.
But in a highly unusual element of the deal that was not mentioned in tonight's announcement, the money will never actually be sent to Moscow. Instead, at the insistence of the United States Treasury and some European nations, the loans will essentially be transferred from one of the I.M.F.'s accounts to another -- allowing Russia to avoid default on money it owes the lending agency this year and next. 
 The Western allies feared that if the loan was made in the usual way, with the money transferred directly to Russia's central bank, the cash could disappear in days. That is what happened last July, when the I.M.F. sent $4.8 billion to Russia.
The deal will enable Russia to get through to elections in the year 2000 without a default to the lending agency that would undercut whatever strands of credibility the country still has with private investors.
Negotiations over the loan had sputtered along for months, as the I.M.F. had sought to extract commitments from Russia over its spending policies, reluctance to collect taxes, and failure to reform a collapsing banking system. But the renewed drive by the West to complete the deal this week reflected a wish to avoid another nasty dispute with the Russians at a moment when Moscow is being courted to play the role of mediator in the Kosovo conflict.
"We are trying to make sure that Russia does not feel even more alienated from the West," one senior official involved in the talks said earlier this week.
In a statement released tonight about the loan agreement, Michel Camdessus, the lending agency's managing director, said: "I am pleased that we have agreed with the Russian authorities on an economic program for Russia that I hope to be able to recommend to the executive board in support of a new stand-by arrangement as a new step in the cooperation between the I.M.F. and Russia. There are still a few technical elements to be settled in the next few days."
Mr. Camdessus added: "The program includes many measures in the fiscal, banking, and structural areas that the authorities have undertaken to implement, including through enacting the necessary legislation, as quickly as possible."
He said Russia also had agreed to provide the I.M.F. with an explanation of how earlier loans had been used, a veiled reference to widespread suspicions that past loans had been funneled to benefit some of Russia's wealthy oligarchs or secretly sent abroad.
The decision to lend money to Moscow without actually sending it there reflected some behind-the-scenes pressure from Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and finance ministers from other European nations, who had argued that any credible new loan program for Russia must include safeguards to prevent a repeat of last summer's embarrassment. In mid-March, Mr. Rubin told a Congressional panel that much of the $4.8 billion pumped into Moscow's foreign exchange reserves at that time "may have been siphoned off improperly."
Mr. Rubin was referring to investigations showing that when the I.M.F. money briefly propped up the value of the ruble, the country's richest oligarchs raced to convert their cash into dollars at a favorable exchange rate. More than $4 billion flowed out of Russia nearly immediately, much of it headed for Swiss bank accounts and other safe havens.
This time, officials say, Mr. Rubin's aides made it clear to the lending agency that the United States would seek to block any effort to resume loans to Russia unless the I.M.F. retained direct control over the money at all times. That means the aid amounts to little more than rescheduling Russia's payments. The country owes the lending agency more than $5 billion over the next 18 months, and nearly $2.5 billion by the end of June. Even with the tentative agreement reached today, Russia's new loans will total less than its repayments.
"The bottom line is that the I.M.F. will get a bit more from Russia than Russia gets from the fund," one senior official involved in the talks said.
Russia's Finance Minister, Mikhail M. Zadornov, who has been in Washington all week holding talks with the I.M.F. and the World Bank, had hinted that an agreement was close earlier today, saying, "We do not have any special problems."
The chairman of Russia's central bank, Viktor S. Gerashchenko, had hoped to borrow about $4 billion.
But the agreement alone will not get Russia the money it has sought for so long. Before the board of the I.M.F. formally approves any accord, the lender is insisting that the Russian Parliament pass several bills to remake Russia's bankruptcy laws, strengthen its tax collection and overhaul its banking system. Last year, the I.M.F. transferred money to Russia before the Parliament acted -- only to discover that the Communist-led body failed to fulfill several commitments made by the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin.
A senior European official who had been briefed on the negotiations said today that "the way the agreement is now set, not a dollar will actually enter Russia, so the risk is very small."
The lending agency's board made another demand: a report by Price Waterhouse on the operations of Fimaco, an offshore company based in Britain's Channel Islands, where the Russian central bank was secretly sending a portion of its foreign reserves. The I.M.F. was never informed by Russian officials that they were moving some of the the reserves -- presumably including some of the I.M.F. loan -- outside of Russian territory.
To this day, Russia has yet to provide a convincing explanation of why the money was sent to the offshore haven, exactly who had control over it, and who may have benefited from management fees or investment proceeds.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: DEATH AT NOONTIME;
Inside an Accident of War: Sirens. Blast. Grief.

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: SURDULICA, Serbia, April 28

 BODY:
"We grew up together," said Momir Andjelkovic, his eyes veined and red, staring fixedly at the green, encircling hills. "He was my finest friend."
Mr. Andjelkovic stopped, dropping his clouded eyes to the mounded rubble across narrow Zmaj Jovina Street, where Aleksandar Milic, 37, died on Tuesday. Mr. Milic's wife, Vesna, 35, also died. So did his mother and his two children, Miljana, 15, and Vladimir, 11 -- all of them killed about noon when an errant NATO bomb obliterated their new house and the cellar in which they were sheltering. 
 "We lived together here for 32 years, for good and bad," Mr. Andjelkovic said. "He was a great man, a great friend."
He sobbed once, briefly. "This was a completely new house, three stories, with completely new furniture," he said, still astonished at the jagged pile of refuse where it used to stand. "It had a large basement. Everyone felt safe there. But the whole family died."
Dying with them were at least two cousins: Stanica Rasic, 21, and Dragan Manoluv, 18. Altogether, Yugoslav officials said, 20 civilians, half of them children, died in Surdulica, this small town of 11,000 people 200 miles south of Belgrade, near the Bulgarian border. At least six houses were destroyed and another 20 or so had significant damage.
A short distance from Mr. Milic's house, his father, Vojislav, head bent, sat on a broken bit of wall, cupping an unlit cigarette in his palm.
He was in shock. Two women hovered, arms around his shoulders, squeezing them through his black jacket as if he might otherwise fall over. They urged him in steady whispers to stand up, to eat something, to drink some water.
Mr. Milic rocked silently, oblivious, his head bobbing up and down with the even beat of a human heart.
NATO officials in Brussels said that this was yet another accident of war. At least one laser-guided bomb, they said, fell 200 or 300 yards from its intended target -- an army barracks and military depot previously bombed on April 6.
The barracks is at least 500 yards away. Only after Western journalists saw another large crater a half-mile from Mr. Milic's house did NATO officials concede that they "could not exclude" that another bomb might have gone astray. NATO did not say what might have caused either to do so, though they have said in the past that weather and other factors can throw the weapons off.
The other crater -- a nearly perfect scoop in the earth, 30 feet across and 20 feet deep -- had blasted three houses away on muddy Beogradska Street. The hole, slowly filling with ground water, was scattered with the debris of human life: filthy clothes, exploded sofa cushions, pill boxes, the back of an oven, the cracked circuit board from a television set.
No one died here, officials said, although at least five people were wounded.
"Death can be a blessing, too," said Borica Novkovic. The house of her son, Stanko, 35, was obliterated. He, his wife, Tatjana, and their 8-month-old daughter, Andrijana, were not in the house. "My son is not here," Mrs. Novkovic said, with pride. "Stanko is in the army now."
The noise was indescribable, she said: "The sound was like a huge blow on my head. Everything turned over and rolled down the hill.
"Radica was screaming, screaming, when we came to help her," Mrs. Novkovic added, bending to pull up her coarse woolen stocking.
Radica Rastic's house was closest to the impact. "She was taken from the house all twisted and bent over," Mrs. Novkovic said. "She was shaking and shaking, her hands were pressed tight over her ears."
Perica Jovanovic, a 44-year-old economist at the Narodni Bank, said: "I'll never forget the strange voice of the bomb. When the plane is flying and drops the bomb the noise changes. It's awful. It's like the static on the radio but so loud, and then there is this awful crash and pressure and everything moves and boils up."
Mr. Jovanovic was outside with his two children, Biljana, 13, and Nemanje, 8. "Somehow we stayed alive," he said quietly, with care. "But I think these NATO bastards will come back."
He stopped and glared.
"You should pass through that," he said. "Americans should have this experience."
He softened then, to say: "People think I'm very calm, but I'm not, I'm very upset. Here you have 11,000 people who are crazy, nervous. People died here and what was the aim? There is nothing around here."
He threw up his hands. "We were very brave for 34 days, but we've moved now," he said. "I've moved the family now to a lake in the hills."
About 200 yards from the crater, a half-finished house was badly damaged. Over the door was a handpainted sign: "Kuca na prodaju" -- house for sale -- "Tel: 85-552."
On Zmaj Jovina Street, Slobodan Milosevic, 48, the bearer of a common Serbian name, stood covered with dust in the ruins of his own house, across the street from Mr. Milic's. Photographers had scrambled up to the second floor, easily visible from the street because the entire front of Mr. Milosevic's house had been ripped away.
"This house is a ruin," he said. "To build it I worked four years in Africa -- two in Tunisia and two in Algeria." He laughed sourly. "Now I'll have to go there again."
Mr. Milosevic, a civil engineer, was out visiting relatives with his wife, Sladjana, 45, son Sasa, 25, and daughter Suzana, 22, when the bomb hit his street.
"My first thought when I saw it all was that we were very lucky not to be in the house, because we would have died," he said. "We're alive, so we will build another house."
He said he was sure that NATO had aimed for the houses. "It's impossible for the pilot to make this mistake," he said. "The sky was clear. He couldn't miss. The barracks isn't even that close."
Asked about his neighbor, Mr. Milic, Mr. Milosevic said he worked in a small factory, PES, that made components for Zastava, the huge car and munitions factory in Kragujevac that NATO destroyed. Mr. Milic also owned two small convenience stores in town, and it seemed he was returning home for lunch when the air raid sirens sounded and he and his family and neighbors went down to the basement of his fine new house. "But Momir," he said, "was really his friend."
Mr. Andjelkovic described how he went down to his own basement with his parents and emerged to see what had happened.
"I couldn't understand what was going on," he said. "There was dust everywhere, and the houses existing two minutes before -- right in front of my house -- were just gone. I heard people screaming, and one of the people down there was my uncle. We tried to dig with our hands, I made him a small hole to breathe until first aid could come."
The uncle, Stojanka Petkovic, 65, "was the only one to survive this house." He pointed to the elder Mr. Milic, still sitting frozen on the wall. "He came from somewhere else," Mr. Andjelkovic said. "He lost everyone."
Asked quietly if he thought that keeping foreign troops out of Kosovo was worth this kind of price, Mr. Andjelkovic looked up, stunned. "I don't understand the question," he said. "You shouldn't ask me that now -- we can talk about that in 10 or 15 days."
He shook his head. "We haven't buried these people and you want to ask me that?"

HEADLINE: City Council Sweetens Correction Officers' Pension Plan

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
In a surprise vote that angered Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the City Council approved a plan yesterday that would increase retirement benefits for correction officers, a change that the Mayor said could eventually cost the city $100 million a year.
Peter F. Vallone, the Speaker of the City Council, said correction officers deserved the extra retirement money because their jobs were among the most dangerous in the city. He pointed out that the city was already giving supplemental retirement benefits to police officers and firefighters, and said correction officers had been treated unfairly. 
 "This is just a parity bill," Mr. Vallone said yesterday afternoon, after the legislation passed, 45 to 1. "Correction officers have always been treated as stepchildren since I got to this Council, and it's simply unfair."
The plan, which needs approval from the State Legislature, would put stock market profits from the correction officers' pension plan into a separate fund that would supplement their retirement benefits. Until now, such profits have been reinvested in the pension plan itself, increasing its worth.
Aides to Mr. Giuliani complained that if the stock market profits are taken out of the pension plan, a formula that set mandatory levels of financing would mean that the city would have to make up the difference, which is expected to reach $65 million to $100 million a year eventually. Randy L. Levine, the Deputy Mayor for economic development, said he feared that other unions would seek similar changes from the Council.
"This is just a raw political giveaway that sends a very bad signal," Mr. Levine said. "It's really outrageous, because something like this should be done in collective bargaining and the union should be giving us something in exchange."
But Norman Seabrook, president of the 11,000-member union representing correction officers, said the union had requested supplemental retirement benefits in its most recent negotiations with the city, and the city had refused. In any case, Mr. Seabrook said, correction officers should not have to make any sacrifices in labor negotiations because their jobs are so stressful.
"I don't think that anyone in city government has ever worked in a jail with some of the most violent individuals in society," Mr. Seabrook said after the vote yesterday. "I don't think these individuals who enjoy such a cushy life of air-conditioned offices should criticize correction officers, or ask us to give back to anybody."
Mr. Seabrook and Mr. Vallone both pointed out that most of the city's correction officers were black or Hispanic, and said that their union was less politically powerful than the union representing city police officers, most of whom are white. The difference in race and political power, they said, made the city more willing to make concessions to the police union.
"Correction officers have not been able to obtain through collective bargaining what all the other public safety workers have gotten," Mr. Vallone said. "We're talking about people who risk their lives every day."
Mayor Giuliani said yesterday that he would urge Albany to reject the plan, but in the past the State Legislature has pushed similar proposals through. Just last month, the Legislature passed a bill giving 25,000 state correction and security officers the right to retire with a tax-free disability pension of three-quarters pay if they have any kind of heart ailment. Although the bill aroused some opposition, Gov. George E. Pataki has indicated that he will sign it.
Both the state and the city correction officers' unions have sharply stepped up their lobbying and political donations in recent years, becoming major contributors to politicians in Albany and New York City. Mr. Vallone said his decision to support the plan had nothing to do with political support.
Council leaders put the pension legislation on the agenda at the last minute yesterday, one day after the Committee on State and Federal Legislation approved it. The only Council member to vote against it was Sheldon S. Leffler, a Queens Democrat who heads the Public Safety Committee. After the vote, Mr. Seabrook made it clear that the union would not support Mr. Leffler in any future campaign.
"How dare he insult this organization and say that he doesn't care about us?" Mr. Seabrook said. "He can forget about correction officers supporting him."
But Mr. Leffler said that increased retirement benefits should come through collective bargaining, and that the correction officers should give something in return. "They have a tough job and a good case for more compensation," he said. "But this is not the way to do it."

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
That Silence In Albany? Budget Talks

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 28

 BODY:
Even for Albany, this is bad.
The state budget will be a month overdue on Friday, a milestone that would have made lawmakers blush a decade ago, but has become ho-hum. What amazes and concerns many legislators, lobbyists and advocates this year is not so much the lateness, as the absence of serious budget negotiations among legislative leaders and Gov. George E. Pataki. The talk of the Capitol is that there is no talk. 
 "I've never seen an April like this, where, four weeks into the fiscal year, there's a complete vacuum," said Andrew Rein, senior research associate at the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit group that closely follows the process. "It's phenomenal and disturbing. There's one major thing they have to get done every year, and nobody's even really talking about it."
The usual barriers stand in the way of progress, from serious disagreement over how much to spend, particularly on education and health care, to Mr. Pataki's ever-chillier relationship with the Legislature. Nor is there evidence that the public much cares about late budgets, making it easier for lawmakers to go past the deadline.
But perhaps the more important brake on budget progress this year is a series of fundamental changes the Governor is pressing in the way budgets are proposed, negotiated and completed, part of a campaign to seize much greater power over the final product and marginalize the Legislature. Those changes have left the Legislature reeling, unsure how to proceed, and desperately searching -- so far unsuccessfully -- for a way to reassert its influence.
The stalemate has implications not just for the budget, the main business of the Legislature, but for nearly every issue taken up here. In Albany, most significant legislation is held hostage through budget negotiations, as factions use the budget as leverage on unrelated matters, and then disposed of in a flurry of deal-making.
But the later the budget goes, the harder it becomes to take care of other business before the Legislature's annual session draws to its scheduled close in June. Not coincidentally, the very late budgets of recent years have been accompanied by a steep decline in the number of bills enacted.
"I've been here a lot of years, and I thought the last few years were bad, but I've never seen such a lack of movement, on the budget or anything else," said Lester M. Shulklapper, who has been a lobbyist in Albany for 25 years.
Of course, experience has shown that when motivated, New York's lawmakers can break the logjams and pass a budget in as little as three weeks. No one here rules out something like that happening soon, but no one expects it, either.
His words drawn out by a protracted sigh, Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., the normally ebullient Manhattan Democrat who heads the Ways and Means Committee, which drafts spending bills, said, "I think it could run very, very long."
The Democratic Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, and the Republican Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, have been carping at each other, and at Mr. Pataki, each trying to fix blame somewhere else.
"I talk to the Governor, I talk to Shelly, and I think they talk to each other," Mr. Bruno said. "I don't know." But he conceded that those conversations had been neither frequent nor productive. His assessment of the situation? "It's a cartoon."
Asked whether there was any progress, he said, "No, there really isn't. Not a thing."
Mr. Pataki, a Republican, takes the unusual position that the stalemate has nothing to do with him, but is entirely up to the Legislature to resolve. Asked this week whether there was anything he could do to get the process moving, he said, "Not that I'm aware of."
Mr. Silver and Mr. Pataki have not met face to face since April 6.
New York already has a record of budget tardiness unimaginable in any other state. For 15 straight years, lawmakers have failed to enact a budget by the April 1 deadline, going as late as 126 days in 1997.
This year, Mr. Pataki has proposed a $72.7 billion budget, keeping the spending increase within the rate of inflation by cutting education and health care programs. The Democrats who control the Assembly want to spend $2 billion to $4 billion more, depending on whose figures one believes, and the Senate Republicans are between the two, but closer to the Governor's numbers.
Until last year, budgets were negotiated by the Governor and the two legislative leaders in closed-door meetings, a process derided as secretive and undemocratic.
Mr. Pataki repeatedly prodded the Legislature to do what Congress does: have members of both houses meet in conference committees to hammer out their differences, then pass a budget and send it to him. Last year, the Assembly and Senate finally took him up on the idea, and it was, at first, viewed as a great success. Rather than only two legislators being directly involved in the negotiations, dozens had a hand in it.
But the new approach turned out to be a coup for the Governor. Under the old system, he was obliged to negotiate, and then to abide by the resulting compromises. In the new system, he was freed of both duties.
When the Legislature sent him its budget last year, he vetoed 1,300 spending line items, well more than $1 billion. It was a stinging defeat for the Legislature, particularly the Democrats who control the Assembly, whose pet projects were the bulk of the veto targets.
The legislative leaders say they do not want to return to the old "three men in a room" practice, and if they tried, they would risk not only harsh criticism but possible rebellion among their colleagues. They also want to avoid a repeat of last year's fiasco, but don't know how.
Mr. Pataki gave them a couple of new things to worry about this year.
First, he insisted that in exchange for approving a pay raise for the state's elected officials, that legislators' salaries be withheld as long as the budget is late. Many legislators, including some who voted for the law, complain that it gives the Governor great power to outwait them, and could cause the Legislature to cave in after a time.
Second, Mr. Pataki dramatically changed the way his budget bills were drafted, making it much harder for the Legislature to make the kinds of alterations that were once considered standard. Some legislators say the changes are illegal, though no court challenge has been mounted. Legislative leaders are still debating how to counter the Governor's move.
"The Governor wants to establish the imperial governorship," Mr. Farrell said. "He's created a series of really deep, institutional problems for us, and he's convinced we'll collapse under the pressure. He's decided this is the year to break us."
For now, Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver are mired in a spat over whose fault it is that they have not yet begun conference committee meetings, and there is ample evidence that neither is in a hurry to start.
"I think anyone making plans for the summer is going to have to reconsider," Mr. Shulklapper said.

HEADLINE: Documents Say Microsoft Considered a Blow to Novell

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
Bent on breaking the spirit of the Novell Corporation, its Utah-based archrival in the network software market, the Microsoft Corporation in 1994 considered a recommendation that it lock up sales accounts at both the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Brigham Young University, documents filed yesterday in Federal court contend.
In an E-mail message to Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, Mike Murray, a high-ranking Microsoft executive, wrote that at a retreat for company executives he had proposed that while the accounts were not Novell's largest, they were important psychologically and emotionally. "The influence of the L.D.S. church in the Utah economy and culture is difficult to appreciate from a distance," Mr. Murray wrote. "I recommend we throw some significant weight at this account." 
 The message was part of 188 pages of evidence filed in Federal court in Salt Lake City by Caldera, a software company that is suing Microsoft for as much as $1.6 billion.
The E-mail message added: "In addition, it would be great for Billg to make time for a trip to Salt Lake City to meet with church leaders. It may be possible to leverage your mother's membership on the KIRO board."
At the time, Mrs. Gates, who has since died, was on the board of KIRO, a Seattle TV station owned by a church subsidiary, Bonneville Communications. In the end. Mr. Gates never visited Salt Lake City for this purpose and his mother never intervened, the company said today.
Caldera contends that Microsoft set out to destroy public demand for DR-DOS, an operating system that competed against Microsoft's MS-DOS. Caldera was formed by Novell's former chairman, Ray Noorda, who filed the lawsuit in July 1996 after acquiring DR-DOS.
Caldera contends that Microsoft integrated MS-DOS with its Windows graphical user interface in part to damage its competitors. Microsoft's own filings contend that DR-DOS was a flawed product and that its customers were provided with inadequate technical support.
The filings are aimed at defining the scope of claims that will be allowed at a trial now scheduled to begin next January. Until now, Microsoft has been successful at keeping much of the pretrial evidence sealed under a broad court order.
Caldera executives said they believe the evidence drawn from more than 1.5 million pages of documents filed in the case demonstrates that Microsoft used misleading product announcements to dampen DR-DOS sales and that it made false and misleading statements about DR-DOS to sow what Caldera called F.U.D. -- for fear, uncertainty and doubt -- in the computer industry.
Caldera also said the evidence showed that Microsoft developed intentional incompatibilities to make it appear to be difficult for DR-DOS to work with Windows and that it used "per-processor" and other exclusionary licensing terms to block DR-DOS in the market.
"These aren't just random E-mails," said Bryan Sparks, chief executive of Caldera. "We think this material is significant, and much of this has never been seen before because it's been under protective order."
But a Microsoft spokesman said all accusations raised by the company had previously been reviewed and rejected by the Justice Department. "This is an attempt by Caldera to rewrite the history of the high-tech industry by pasting together these handpicked excerpts," said Mark Murray, a company spokesman.
He said that in many cases the Caldera document took the E-mail comments of Microsoft executives out of context. For example, one excerpt from an E-mail sent by James Allchin, the Microsoft executive who now heads the company's Windows 2000 effort, states: "If you're going to kill someone there isn't much reason to get all worked up about it and angry -- you just pull the trigger. Any discussions beforehand are a waste of time. We need to smile at Novell while we pull the trigger."
But taken in context, Mr. Murray said, Mr. Allchin was writing an appeal to instruct Microsoft executives to stop "trash talking."
"He was saying we should just compete in a way that is more professional," he said. "He was saying this is hurting us with the customer."
The Caldera document asserts Microsoft integrated MS-DOS and Windows in an effort to damage competitors' operating systems. The document quotes Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft's chief technology officer, as arguing for integrating the two products for a strategic reason: "We put a bullet in the head of our would-be competitors on DOS, like DRI, Desqview, DOS extenders etc." DRI was Digital Research Inc., the company that developed DR-DOS.
The Caldera accusation is not supported by history, Mr. Murray said: "This is them excerpting a small snippet of a memo and trying to create a narrative that does not reflect the facts of the situation. Even the Department of Justice has acknowledged that Windows 95 is a completely new operating system."

HEADLINE: More Scrutiny Is Sought for Firms That Runor Lend to Hedge Funds

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
Worried that Wall Street will soon forget its brush with financial meltdown six months ago, Federal regulators are proposing to further scrutinize the trading practices of investment banks and closely examine the books of private investment funds.
While not calling for regulators to have direct control over the investment pools for the wealthy known as hedge funds, the Clinton Administration plans to introduce legislation soon that would give the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission enhanced powers to examine the dealings of Wall Street trading firms that lend to the funds. 
 The White House will also seek Congressional backing for rules that require hedge funds, which are traditionally unregulated, to disclose more information about borrowing and trading practices even if that drives some funds out of the country.
The proposals do not seek to directly control how Wall Street firms trade or lend money, but to give regulators a closer look at their books, which would give them more time to intervene to avert a crisis.
The recommendations are found in a long-awaited Government report, the product of an investigation into Wall Street practices that began after the Government-brokered rescue of Long-Term Capital Management, a large hedge fund, in September.
The report falls short of recommending direct control over the financing and activities of hedge funds -- which would have provoked strong opposition within the financial industry -- but the authorities do plan to adopt new powers over investment banks, among the biggest lenders to Long-Term Capital. The measure would make the Wall Street houses subject to some of the same controls commercial banks face.
The recommendations are part of a long study on financial borrowing prepared by the nation's top financial regulators, led by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. The report was obtained by The New York Times and is expected to be released today.
Though Long-Term Capital's near-collapse -- and the turmoil it caused in world financial markets -- happened only six months ago, it is no longer a pressing concern on Wall Street in a booming market. Long-Term Capital was rescued by 14 Wall Street companies, which injected $3.6 billion at the height of the crisis. The fund has since posted solid returns and profits for its new owners.
But the bailout of Long-Term Capital was orchestrated by the Federal Reserve, the nation's central bank, and regulators said at the time that the hedge fund's failure might have prompted a worldwide financial crisis. Officials now argue that the lessons of that brush with disaster would be lost unless they adopted new measures designed to limit the risks that financial companies take.
The regulators called the amount of money that Long-Term Capital borrowed "extraordinary" and complained that many of the best-known banks and securities companies adopted "excessively liberal" lending policies. But they said the problem went well beyond the fund.
"The L.T.C.M. episode illustrates the need for all participants in our financial system, not only hedge funds, to face constraints in the amount of leverage they can assume," the report says. "Some of the same weaknesses that permitted L.T.C.M. to achieve its extraordinary market leverage were evident in other market participants."
The report uses strong language to describe the increasing tendency of financial companies to leverage bets on financial markets with borrowed money. The ratios of borrowed money to capital at the top five investment banks average 27 to 1, according to the report, a bit higher than Long-Term Capital.
The securities companies may not be much better able to withstand a sharp downturn in financial markets than that hedge fund was, the report contends. A collapse of a major Wall Street firm is widely dreaded because it could have ripple effects on financial markets everywhere.
But regulators did not propose legal limits on borrowing. Instead, they expressed hope that more intensive scrutiny of borrowing and trading practices by regulators, the public and industry rivals would prompt financial companies to reduce their risk levels voluntarily.
If they do not, however, the authorities are threatening much sterner measures. These include imposing tight capital requirements on investment banks not unlike those now imposed on commercial banks. The Government is also considering direct regulation of both hedge funds and derivatives dealers, which are now largely free of oversight.
"If these steps don't work to reduce the leverage in the system, then there are other options we can take," said a member of the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, the regulatory committee that studied the Long-Term Capital fallout. "These would be likely to raise a great deal of noise from the industry, and we are hoping that it will not be necessary to take these steps."
The report recommends these steps:
*Bank and securities regulators should insure that financial companies adopt better risk-management practices, saying that the risk-management system "broke down" when companies allowed Long-Term Capital to borrow so much money.
*Banks and brokerage houses should provide a more detailed summary of their lending to individual borrowers so that both regulators and other financial companies could spot excessive risk building up.
*The Federal authorities should take action to insure that other countries, and particular popular offshore financial centers like the Cayman Islands, toughen their regulatory policies in tandem with the strengthened United States rules.
*Congress should speed passage of updated bankruptcy laws. The laws would make it easier to unwind the intertwined financial securities a hedge fund or other big financial company holds, allowing it to collapse without severely disrupting the entire financial system.
Wall Street executives reached yesterday said they had not yet seen the report, and most declined to comment. But the proposals on the whole seem unlikely to prompt a strong protest from banks and brokerage houses. Many traditionally secretive hedge funds seem likely to bristle at the demand for more disclosure. But they are not viewed as a strong industry lobbying group, and many already operate from offshore bases.
"The hedge-fund industry will object to disclosing more than they do now; they won't like it," said Roy Smith, a professor of finance at New York University. "But it's a nuisance they brought on themselves."
As for the proposed requirements on banks and brokerage firms, Mr. Smith said they sounded moderate. "It does not appear to be a major overhaul in the way things work now," he said.
But at least two recommendations seem likely to raise at least some industry and Congressional reaction. The first is the proposal to expand the powers the S.E.C. has over investment banks and their affiliated companies. Investment banks often use affiliated companies to conduct financial transactions, including those that involve instruments known as derivatives. The affiliates are almost completely unregulated.
The S.E.C. will propose that it have more authority to police those affiliated companies just as commercial bank regulators have the power to scrutinize bank subsidiaries. The Commodities Futures Trading Commission also hopes to gain new examination powers over companies it regulates, including firms that specialize in underwriting futures contracts and other derivatives.
Specifically, the two regulatory bodies are demanding more information about trading strategies, risk management practices and record keeping at the affiliated companies. The regulators want the authority to look at trading positions one by one, not only in the aggregated way investment banks usually report them.
With those increased powers, the regulators could then put pressure on the investment banks or derivatives dealers to reduce risk levels.
One sign of a possible struggle over these proposals is noted in the report. In a footnote, the report says that Mr. Greenspan, the Fed chairman, "declines to endorse" the enhanced powers sought by the two regulatory bodies. Mr. Greenspan, it adds, "deferred" to the individual supervisory authorities in allowing the recommendations to go forward.
The second area of contention involves hedge funds. Many hedge funds now face no regulation of any kind, though a few larger ones are subject to light reporting requirements. Under the new proposals, all hedge funds of significant size would have to file quarterly reports on several measures of their risk taking, which would be published for public scrutiny. But they would not have to reveal detailed proprietary trading information the way banks and securities firms do.

The new policy, which had long been sought by farm-state lawmakers and lobbyists for several large corporations, will make a general exemption for food and medicine whenever trade sanctions are put on countries considered adversaries of the United States. 
 The shift would not directly affect trade sanctions against Cuba, Iraq and North Korea, in part because American companies are already permitted to carry out some trade in food, medicine and other supplies with those countries.
Stuart E. Eizenstat, Undersecretary of State for Business and Economic Affairs, said that President Clinton had approved the policy after a two-year review concluded that the sale of food and medicine "doesn't encourage a nation's military capability or its ability to support terrorism."
In fact, he told reporters, a ban on such sales can backfire by eroding support for American foreign policy, by depriving American companies and farmers of the chance to sell their goods and by harming innocent civilians abroad who are deprived of needed food and medicine.
Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said President Clinton had decided that "food should not be used as a tool of foreign policy, except under the most compelling circumstances."
The policy shift reflects a growing sense, in the corridors of the White House and on Capitol Hill, that sanctions are not an effective way to make foreign policy and punish rogue states.
Business leaders have long argued that economic sanctions rarely produce changes in foreign governments and instead often taints American corporations as unreliable suppliers.
Human rights groups disagree, insisting that economic sanctions have been a factor in the collapse of pariah governments, notably the apartheid Government of South Africa.
Cargill, Farmland Industries and a number of other large agricultural and commodity-trading companies had lobbied intensively for the policy change.
USA Engage, a powerful coalition of more than 670 companies that has sought an easing of American trade sanctions, welcomed the Administration's announcement.
"This is good news for American agriculture, it's good news for U.S. producers of farm equipment and it's an outstanding development for American foreign policy," said Bill Lane, Washington director of Caterpillar Inc. and the coalition's chairman.
Clinton Administration officials insisted that today's move was not meant to be a gesture of friendship toward Iran, but they acknowledged that the action would doubtless encourage improved ties between the United States and the Government of President Mohammad Khatami, who is perceived to be a relative moderate among Iranian leaders.
The policy shift comes only two weeks after President Clinton made strikingly conciliatory comments about Iran during a public appearance in the White House in which he saluted that nation's "enormous geopolitical importance over time" and said that it had "been the subject of quite a lot of abuse from various Western nations."
An American exporter, Niki Trading Company, recently sought a special export license from the Treasury Department to sell millions of tons of food products, mostly grain, for about $500 million, to Iran, a deal that now seems likely to be approved.
Administration officials had seen the deal as a promising line of contact with Iran after two decades of bitter hostility following the 1979 Iranian revolution.
While the State Department labeled Iran last year as the "the most active state sponsor of terrorism," the Administration is hopeful that easing the sanctions might help give Mr. Khatami leverage that could allow him to rein in rival factions of the Government that support anti-American terrorist groups.
Under the policy shift, the sale of food, medicine and other "human necessities" would be included in trade sanctions only if a nation is in armed conflict with the United States or is diverting food and medical supplies for military purposes.
Today's move by the Administration would not affect trade with Cuba, which is limited principally by Congressional sanctions.
Mr. Eizenstat noted that the sale of medicine and medical supplies to Cuba was already allowed under legislation approved in 1992, and the regulated sale of food, pesticides and related items was permitted under a policy shift announced in January.
American companies are allowed to sell food, medicine and other goods to Iraq under the so-called oil-for-food program overseen by the United Nations.
American companies are already permitted to trade food, medicine and other goods to North Korea under a deal brokered by the State Department to end that country's program to develop nuclear weapons.
The United States Government has provided tens of thousands of tons of donated food to North Korea as a result of the widespread famine in that country.
Few of the countries affected by today's decision offer large markets to the United States. With a population of nearly 70 million people and its oil riches, Iran is a notable exception.
The official Iranian news agency reported this week that more than 15 percent of Iran's food was imported last year, worth about $3 billion. It imported about 3.8 million tons of grain in 1998.
Iran had been eager to resume trade with the United States. In August, it lodged an official complaint with the United Nations, asserting that the American sanctions had created a "scarcity of essential goods needed for the improvement of the nutritional and health-care standards of the Iranian people."
The decision to permit trade in food and medicine could also ease tension somewhat with Libya.
A variety of international economic sanctions on Libya were lifted earlier this month when two suspects accused of bombing Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988 were handed over to prosecutors in the Netherlands. Separate American trade sanctions remain in place.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE WHITE HOUSE;
Clinton, Asking Quick Approval of Funds, Talks of a Campaign of Many Months

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28

 BODY:
President Clinton warned today that NATO's bombardment and economic pressure on Yugoslavia would persist for many more months and called on Congress to quickly pass his request for $6 billion in emergency funds to pay the mounting costs of the conflict.
"Each day, our military campaign takes a toll on Serbia's machinery of repression," Mr. Clinton said in a Rose Garden statement after a meeting on the Balkan conflict with 46 members of Congress. "The Serbian leadership has failed to divide us and will not outlast us. The combined military might and moral determination of Europe and North America will endure." 
 But hours later, the House dealt the White House a sharp rebuke, voting not only to ban use of ground troops without Congressional approval but rejecting a symbolic resolution supporting the air campaign.
The President said that additional air power was arriving in the region and allied pilots were beginning to fly round the clock on missions to destroy Serbian troops who are terrorizing the ethnic Albanian population of Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia. The Serbs have already driven hundreds of thousands of Kosovo's people out of the province.
Mr. Clinton said that the air campaign, today ending its fifth week, had been hampered by rain and clouds and said the pace would now pick up as the skies clear.
"Historically, the weather is better in May than in April, better in June than in May, better in July than in June," Mr. Clinton said in a clear sign that he intends to prosecute the air war for months. "And I feel very strongly that we should stay with and be very strong in determination to pursue our strategy, as well as the very important decisions we made at the NATO conference to intensify the economic pressure."
Mr. Clinton also said that signs of dissension were beginning to appear in Belgrade, including public criticism by senior officials of Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav President.
Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, said that Mr. Clinton pleaded for forbearance from lawmakers during their meeting, saying they had to give air power time to work to undermine Mr. Milosevic.
But she said that the Administration's "gradualism and incrementalism" were frustrating many in Congress, who want quicker consideration of the use of ground troops to end the war.
Ms. Snowe and other members of Congress who attended today's session with the President said he repeated his determination not to dispatch ground troops to Kosovo.
"On the contrary," said Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts. "He indicated that he intended a stepped-up prosecution of the air war and the blockade of oil supplies."
But other members said that Mr. Clinton's aims -- the removal of Serbian forces from Kosovo and the return of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees -- could not be achieved with air power alone.
Representative Sonny Callahan, an Alabama Republican, said the Administration had been sending confusing signals about the goals of the war, its costs and the Administration's plans for relocating refugees.
"The messages coming out of the White House have a great deal of ambiguity," Mr. Callahan said. "But it's very obvious to me that this is going to be a prolonged and costly endeavor."
Mr. Clinton urged the lawmakers to move quickly on his funding request, which would provide money to replace munitions already used and to build weapons stockpiles for a lengthy air campaign. The Administration's $6 billion package also includes about $1 billion for food and shelter for refugees displaced by the fighting in Kosovo.
The President said that Congress should resist the temptation to attach to the legislation money for unrelated activities, no matter how worthy, because it would slow the bill's progress.
"We must get a Kosovo funding measure passed and to my desk now," the President said.
Draft proposals in the Senate and the House would add $6 billion to $7 billion in Pentagon programs, bringing the emergency spending bill requested by Mr. Clinton to roughly $12 billion to $13 billion.
The Congressional add-ons include projects arguably unconnected to NATO's operations in the Balkans. For example, the House bill would spend hundreds of millions of dollars on construction programs sought by the military to increase soldiers' morale and efficiency, such as refurbishing 50-year-old barracks, building car washes and garages, and paving parking lots at bases in Germany.
Many Republicans are eager to approve them as a show of support for the military, and to bolster their argument that Mr. Clinton has starved the Pentagon. But the emergency money must come from surplus Social Security revenues, which both parties have pledged to keep their hands off.
At least five Republican senators, loath to break their vows of fiscal abstinence, are ready to break with their colleagues instead of supporting a $12 billion emergency bill, according to senior aides. They want the spending limited to what the President has requested. Others want to see even more money added to the bill.
Given the intensity of the internal debate, it will be at least two weeks before any money is approved.
In his White House remarks, Mr. Clinton said that the terror in Kosovo was the product of a "meticulously planned" campaign by Mr. Milosevic's Serbian troops to drive the ethnic Albanian majority out of the province. "A campaign organized by the Government of Belgrade for a specific political purpose -- to maintain its grip over Kosovo by ridding the land of its people," Mr. Clinton said.
Before the expulsions began, ethnic Albanians made up about 90 percent of Kosovo's population of two million.
Mr. Clinton cited continuing reports of atrocities, including one unconfirmed report brought to him by Brian Atwood, the Administration's humanitarian coordinator for the region. Mr. Atwood, who just returned by Albania, said he had been told of one village in Kosovo where most of the men were rounded up, tied together and burned alive.
"It's the kind of story that would be too horrible to believe if it were not so consistent with what so many refugees have been saying," the President said.

HEADLINE: It Dawns on Hartford: Patriots May Never Arrive

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, April 28

 BODY:
The idea of luring a major league team like the New England Patriots to this blighted insurance town between the lights of New York and Boston had seemed so grand, so exciting, so downright unlikely, that many Hartford boosters had feared that they would wake up from their blissful dream.
Sure enough, that seemed to be happening this morning, when the breakfast television shows were dominated by shots of Gov. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts, surrounded by legislative and business leaders, declaring shortly before midnight that his state was putting aside years of bitter negotiations with the Patriots' owner, Robert K. Kraft, and offering a package of subsidies for a new football stadium next to the one at Foxboro, just south of Boston. 
 The fate of the stadium is far from decided; Mr. Kraft, in fact, has taken no public position on his home state's offer. But to many people here, and to executives of the National Football League itself, momentum appeared to be moving rapidly away from Hartford and toward Boston.
In some quarters here, the stadium was even being discussed in the past tense. "We would have loved to have had it," said State Representative Annette W. Carter, a Democrat from Hartford.
The N.F.L. issued a statement saying, "The Massachusetts political leadership's agreement last night regarding a stadium proposal is a step in the right direction towards a Patriots alternative in Foxboro."
Officials in Connecticut are so concerned that the deal is slipping away that they are working on a possible suit against the N.F.L., which helped broker the Massachusetts plan, charging the league had undermined the state's contract with the Patriots.
"We're not going to sit by idly while our legal rights get trampled," said State Senator George C. Jepsen, a Democrat of Stamford who is the majority leader. "We believe that a wide range of people, including taxpayers and the trade unions that would have had all these construction jobs, would be damaged," he said.
The outcome of the stadium tug-of-war is likely to determine the future face of Hartford, which had received a psychic lift from the football frenzy. The loss of the stadium would dash hopes for renewing the city's downtown, since it would sink, or at least stall, an ambitious hotel and convention center complex that was to be built around the stadium.
Losing the deal would also be potentially devastating for Gov. John G. Rowland, a second-term Republican who insisted that he had "bonded" with Mr. Kraft in their months of talks and who has said he would stake his legacy on the outcome of the huge gamble on the Patriots.
For their part, leaders of the Massachusetts effort said that if Mr. Kraft resists their overture, they were prepared to make their case directly to his fellow league owners, three-fourths of whom must approve any move by a team. The proposed Patriots' move is scheduled for a vote by owners in late May.
The recent back-and-forth over the Patriots represents an escalation in the pattern of demanding owners who extract lavish offers from competing cities. Now, it appears, a victorious city cannot rest easily even after a contract has been signed.
The Massachusetts offer came not just with the blessing of the N.F.L., but at its instigation. A league executive first flew into Boston on Jan. 6, three weeks after Connecticut had approved its deal, and the league has been working ever since to promote an alternative to the Hartford move. League executives are concerned because of the disruption to the team's fans and because the Patriots would be leaving the nation's 6th-largest television market for the 27th.
The league, which in recent years has lost teams in Los Angeles and other major markets, has become more aggressive in trying to keep its teams in big cities, knowing that its lucrative contracts with television networks depend on high ratings in those markets.
The Boston-Hartford situation is slightly different in that Patriots games would continue to be televised in Boston. Even so, media analysts said the league could expect an erosion of viewership in Boston if the team were playing two hours away. "Fans try to be loyal at first, but that rarely lasts," said Terri L. Ritenour, a sports analyst for Paul Kagan Associates, in Carmel, Calif.
In Connecticut, today was a day for gallows humor, with legislators and lobbyists chatting about all they could do with the $100 million that was supposed to be spent this year on a stadium for the Patriots.
Critics of the Connecticut stadium deal, who have long feared that Mr. Kraft was using the state's generous offer as a $1 billion bargaining chip to help him extract an acceptable offer from his home state, felt vindicated.
"I hate to be the crepe-hanger at the funeral, but there's nothing worse than being caught trying to buy self-respect," said William E. Curry Jr., a former Connecticut Comptroller and State Senator who ran against Mr. Rowland in 1994.
Mr. Rowland, who typically talks off the cuff, prepared carefully before going before television cameras today, armed with 13 talking points, including No. 11, "Nothing has changed." Even so, he looked a bit rattled as he faced the huge pack of Boston and Connecticut journalists keeping what he calls "the death watch."
"I know that people would like to see this fall apart -- it's not going to fall apart," he said. "If I quote my critics they say this is one of the best plans in the country. Why would he walk away from this?"
Mr. Rowland knew he would be accused of giving away the store when he signed his stadium deal, knew the site was contaminated by coal tar and toxins, and knew he was dealing with a canny owner who was sure to wind up with the upper hand.
But for all the hurdles Mr. Rowland had faced with the happy-go-lucky air he has kept from his days as a fraternity president, his aides say he was blindsided by still another: the clout of the N.F.L.
According to people who have talked privately with Mr. Rowland, he feels betrayed. The N.F.L. Commissioner, Paul Tagliabue, had called to congratulate him the night he signed the deal with Mr. Kraft.
On Thursday, according to Mr. Rowland, Mr. Tagliabue had phoned to assure him that he was "just listening" to the Boston officials -- that it was his responsibility to be sure every avenue had been explored. The very next day, according to people who were in the meetings, Mr. Tagliabue was aggressively lobbying business and political leaders to offer a deal to Mr. Kraft.
In response, Greg Aiello, the N.F.L.'s spokesman, said: "In order to make a recommendation to the owners, he has to be able to explore all alternatives. To develop an alternative you have to be aggressive. That's not inconsistent."
In Massachusetts, meanwhile, business and civic leaders were kicking off a drive to sell sky boxes -- at prices running up to $325,000 a year -- in the stadium they were suddenly hoping to build. Among the leaders of the stadium effort is the Rev. J. Donald Monan, the Chancellor of Boston College, who said the city's leaders had realized that retaining the Patriots "wasn't just a matter of sports."
"This was a sport that was a business which has a tremendous economic impact on the Commonwealth, and we thought that it was a real tragedy for the team to leave the state," he said.
The Patriots issued a statement saying the team was "not involved with any efforts to develop, or discussions pertaining to, a new Massachusetts stadium." Mr. Kraft has until Sunday to exercise one of several clauses in his deal with Connecticut that would allow him to walk away from the deal with no penalty.
The Massachusetts group is proposing a new stadium on the site of a former horse track at Foxboro that is now used for special tailgate parties.
Mr. Kraft would have to pay to build the $250 million stadium, and the state would pay $70 million for related improvements, including roads, parking lots, utilities and landscaping. The offer includes a requirement that the team pay the state $1 million each year for using the improvements. The state also would receive a $400,000 annual fee from some of the stadium's parking lots.
The Connecticut offer is a much better financial deal for Mr. Kraft. The state would pay the entire $375 million cost of the stadium, although he has agreed to invest $70 million in a hotel in the development. The Boston leaders are banking on the fact that he would accept the less favorable terms in exchange for the stability of keeping the same fans.
But N.F.L. officials warned in their statement that "other essential steps must be taken" by the group beyond Tuesday night's offer, "the most immediate being a long-term commitment by the business community to support the stadium project through the purchase of suites and club seats."
The Patriots' lobbyist in Connecticut, Jay Malcynsky, who was a senior adviser to Mr. Rowland's re-election campaign last year, said the Massachusetts deal was similar to ones that Mr. Kraft had rejected in the past, even without the lucrative Connecticut offer in his back pocket.
"You can put a tuxedo on a scarecrow, but it's still a scarecrow," Mr. Malcynsky said. "These are desperate people in desperate times, scrambling to at least proffer the illusion that there's a viable alternative in Boston."

HEADLINE: Federal Panel to Recommend Some Gambling Restrictions

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28

 BODY:
A Federal commission is preparing to recommend to Congress and the President a moratorium on gambling expansion and more Federal regulation of the giant casinos on Indian reservations.
But after two years of studying the economic and social effects of gambling, the National Gambling Impact Study Commission is likely to issue a report that, as expected, leaves major commercial casino operators free of Federal regulation. 
 In addition to the moratorium, the commission, meeting here for two days this week, is likely to recommend that all forms of Internet gambling be prohibited, that state lotteries curtail advertising and that states that sponsor lotteries be required to contribute some of their revenues to treatment programs for problem gamblers.
Although the nine-member commission, which includes gambling supporters and opponents alike, is not expected to advocate any Federal taxes or regulating of the country's casino industry, it does appear that more Federal oversight of casinos operated by Indian tribes will be recommended.
The commission was created in 1996, and at the time casino operators feared that it would lead to Federal policies that could stifle their businesses and impose taxes and layers of regulation. But after vigorous lobbying by the casino industry, the panel's major recommendations are likely to be aimed mostly at other forms of gambling, and even those recommendations could face tough opposition. Before the recommendations could take effect, they would have to be approved by Congress, state legislatures or tribal governments.
"The battle over the commission and the hearings have educated the American people about the money and power" that the $40 billion-a-year casino industry has, said Representative Frank R. Wolf, the Virginia Republican who sponsored the legislation that led to the commission's formation. Mr. Wolf, an immovable opponent of gambling, said he was pleased, nonetheless, that the commission was "putting the spotlight" on the industry.
"There will be a lot of information and data in the report," he said. "You had to have the commission report to take these guys on."
The commission faces a June 18 deadline for its report, which will be delivered to Congress, the President and tribal governments. Although no drafts of the report have been released, it has become apparent in commission meetings, which are open to the public, that there is some disagreement on the panel. While members agree on issues like raising the minimum age for gambling to 21 and banning Internet gambling, they remain divided over the extent of compulsive gambling in the country and whether the social costs of legalized gambling's growth outweigh the economic benefits.
"Although there is now a great deal of consensus, on some issues that just won't happen," said Kay C. James, the commission chairman, who resigned this week as a dean at Regent University in Virginia.
With some form of gambling now legal in 47 states, commission members are expected to express concern in their report about the speed with which gambling has spread since the last Federal study, in 1976.
One of the most heated debates here today concerned whether a moratorium should be imposed on expansion of gambling, which would include any form of gambling a state or local jurisdiction does not currently have. Some commissioners argued that such a move would give local governments a chance to evaluate the impact of their gambling operations before adding more.
But others commissioners, including J. Terrence Lanni, the chairman and chief executive of the MGM Grand casino in Las Vegas, said that recommending a moratorium was not necessary.
"When people hear the word 'moratorium,' they think, 'That's it. They want to end it,' " Mr. Lanni said.
After a majority of commissioners voted to recommend a moratorium, Mr. Lanni said he might submit a minority report.
Commission members considered expanding regulation of Indian casinos because they have had too much difficulty getting information from tribes about their gambling operations. While the commission members say they have agreed to respect the sovereign status of the tribes, they are taking aim at the National Indian Gaming Commission, a part of the Department of the Interior that oversees tribal gaming.
"There is a concern that there needs to be more Federal funding for regulating," said Robert W. Loescher, an Alaska businessman who is the sole Indian on the panel.
But tribal leaders contend that they are already regulated, and they are likely to oppose any further efforts to do so.
Besides the content of the report, commission members are also wrestling with its tone.
"What's missing in my view is an explicit recognition of the fact that the American people love to gamble," said John W. Wilhelm, president of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union, which represents 75,000 casino employees. "While I don't think it's the only thing to say, I certainly don't think it should be ignored."
The commission has traveled around the country to explore the consequences of gambling's expansion, and it has also financed several studies to help reach its conclusions. One study found that more than 5 million Americans are considered problem or pathological gamblers, and an additional 15 million are at risk. Another study found that an estimated 1.8 million American adults and 1.1 million young people between the ages of 12 and 17 exhibit severe, or "pathological" gambling behavior each year.
But gambling advocates on the panel said the language in the studies on compulsive gambling was misleading and exaggerated the dangers. They felt, for example, that it was unfair to say that all 15 million people who have gambled at least once to relieve uncomfortable feelings should be classified as "at risk."
Opponents of gambling were unhappy that one study found that the economic cost of gambling addictions is about $5 billion a year -- for things like legal fees for divorce, court and jail costs, bankruptcies and lost wages -- much less than gambling opponents have estimated.
Although it does not appear that the commission will recommend action that would severely affect the nation's large casino companies, some members want to make sure it reflects a concern about the role the casino industry plays in society.
"At one time gambling was rare and considered exceptional," said Richard C. Leone, the former New Jersey Treasurer and now president of the Century Fund in New York.
Gambling now is "common and unexceptional," Mr. Leone said. "The point is bring home to people that the change has been dramatic."
Raising the minimum age for all gambling could affect race tracks, which in many states allow 18-year-olds to wager. States with legalized casinos have already set the minimum age at 21, but the commission agreed that stricter enforcement of the age requirements was needed.
The final report is expected to be highly critical of the lottery industry. Some panelists argued in favor of referring to politicians as "addicted to the revenue" that comes from state-sponsored gambling. Ultimately, they agreed to change the language, but they are still expected to call for independent boards to oversee regulation of lotteries. They are also likely to recommend that states stay away from video lotteries.
One study financed by the commission found that about 5 percent of lottery players buy over half of the tickets and that poor people spend a greater portion of their income on lottery tickets than other players.
Although it is expected to be extremely difficult for one country to regulate activity on the worldwide Internet, the commission appears to be unanimous in its belief that action must be taken to stop the hundreds of millions in dollars that are bet with on-line gambling companies. Although the companies are based outside the United States, American legislators have been trying to pass legislation that would make it difficult for them to do business with customers in this country.

HEADLINE: Big Steel's Problems Are Home Grown;
Low-Cost U.S. Mills Play a Bigger Role Than Imports in Eroding Profits

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: WEIRTON, W. Va.

 BODY:
It was a scene that summed up so much about this quintessential steel town, here where the Alleghenies roll seamlessly into Appalachia.
Beneath a handwritten sign saying "Buy America or Bye America," Mark Glyptis, a union boss and proud of it, was counseling two laid-off steelworkers at the union hall. Sunday hams are now available, he told them, but yes, unemployment benefits for Weirton Steel's idled workers were running dry. 
 As an awkward silence filled the room, Mr. Glyptis broke it with a vague but supportive message to the glum workers: "You guys are great. Don't give up the fight."
What they are fighting for, Mr. Glyptis says, is nothing less than their jobs, their way of life and the fate of the American steel industry. Weirton is still reeling from events that started last year in lands far away -- Asia, Russia and Latin America -- where economic turmoil and sagging currencies sent cheap steel flooding to American shores, pushing down prices here. For Weirton, this meant dropping its prices, shutting one of the company's two blast furnaces and, even though employees own a healthy chunk of the stock, laying off 1,000 workers -- nearly a quarter of the work force -- just before Christmas.
Now Weirton's workers, along with those of other big, old-line steel companies, have taken their pain to Washington, going by the bus load to promote a measure that would impose quotas on imported steel and roll back imports to pre-1998 levels. The quota bill passed the House by an overwhelming majority in March, and is before the Senate.
Critics deride this legislation as dangerous, illegal and unnecessary. Not only do they say that it would cost American consumers an estimated $6 billion, but it would violate world trade agreements and could lead to a trade war. Two weeks ago, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, waded into the debate, saying such protectionist efforts were both futile and harmful.
For Big Steel, the plea for protection has come periodically for a quarter-century. But, many say, this cry has an increasingly hollow ring. Rather, these companies are at the wrong end of a number of trends, mostly inevitable, mostly unfavorable. More troubling than imports is the competition posed by lower-cost, more efficient American minimill steel companies, which account for nearly half the steel market.
"We no longer need these giant facilities to make steel," said Robert Crandall, a steel expert at the Brookings Institution. "Minimills are building sheet plants and making life miserable for the big guys. We're talking about a long, drawn out endgame for Big Steel."
Yet it is a measure of the enduring power of Big Steel, which is far from disappearing, that so much political effort is being devoted to saving a shrinking industry. After all, today there are only 160,000 steelworkers, compared with 400,000 as recently as 1980. And, in financial weight, steelmaking pales in comparison with the technology sector: The stock market value of a single Internet company, Amazon.com, is twice that of the entire steel industry.
In places like Weirton, this changing reality carries painful human costs.
 
An Industry Divided Against Itself
Big Steel -- consisting of integrated steel companies, like Weirton -- is dependent on a more than century-old process to turn iron ore, limestone and coal into finished steel. With huge blast furnaces and oxygen furnaces, this is the same process used by Ernest T. Weirton in 1909 when he founded the company and the town.
In reality, though, there are two American steel industries, one growing and the other not; one profitable, the other struggling. Better times are had by steel minimills like the Nucor Corporation in Charlotte, N.C., turning cheap scrap metal into steel with efficient electric-arc furnaces, largely nonunion work forces and lower costs.
Output from minimills has surged in the 1990's, after the development of a technique called thin-slab casting in 1989. The technique enabled minimills to start making the flat-rolled steel that only big integrated mills like Weirton, LTV Group and Bethlehem Steel could produce before. As a result, minimills, which had a fraction of domestic output when founded in the early 1980's, now account for almost 50 percent of domestic steel output.
The sad irony is that the pain felt in Weirton comes just as the appetite for steel -- for the sport utility vehicles, washing machines, shopping malls and office buildings Americans want -- is at an all-time high.
By many measures, the American steel industry is doing quite nicely. Driven by the booming economy, American steel consumption reached a record 138 million tons in 1998, up from 96 million tons in 1987.
This means most American steel mills have been running nearly flat out, at up to 95 percent of operating capacity -- easily outpacing the rest of manufacturing. And that still is not enough to meet demand.
As a result, for the last decade, steel imports have been necessary to fill the gap between what American steelmakers are producing and what Americans consume. Despite the role of foreign steel in last year's short-term price plunge, throughout the 1990's, steel imports accounted for more than 20 percent of the domestic steel market. In fact, American steel companies themselves, including Weirton, buy a quarter of this foreign steel -- mainly raw slabs that become finished steel.
American steelmakers have also made enormous strides in increasing productivity and efficiency.
"What steel crisis?" John Reilly, a steel industry consultant at Nathan Associates in Arlington, Va., asked. "There has been some turmoil in the marketplace. But certainly, there is no crisis in the steel industry. The demise of the steel industry is nowhere on the near horizon."
 
A Future of Doubt For One Steel Town
The mill that stands on Main Street in this town of 22,000 once employed 13,500. Today, it has 4,300 workers, with 780 of them still furloughed.
To Mr. Glyptis, the union boss -- who remembers when President Clinton campaigned in Weirton in 1992 promising to protect American steel from foreign "dumping" -- steelworkers are now being sacrificed on the altar of globalism and open markets.
"Clinton's not welcome here and neither is Gore," said Mr. Glyptis, whose organization, the Independent Steelworkers Union, has removed the President's picture from the union hall, leaving a bare spot on the wall. "I'd run them out of town."
Around town, handwritten signs displayed in store windows say "Let's Buy Steel" and "Don't Let Clinton 'Steel' Our Jobs." At Renee's Cafe, at the bottom of a menu featuring homemade cakes, pies and 50-cent hot dogs, is the postscript "Stand Up for Steel!!!"
With Weirton paying up to $60,000 a year, in a town where a five-bedroom house rents for $350 a month, employees rarely want to leave.
Aaron Bennett, 25, is a third-generation steelworker, laid off and working as a courtroom magistrate to support his wife and four children on a salary of $20,000 a year.
"We did everything we needed to do to make our mill the best," Mr. Bennett said. "But this has a lot to do with economics and world affairs."
"Thank You Sen. Rockefeller, Sen. Byrd," read signs outside the union hall, referring to the state's two Democratic United States Senators, John D. Rockefeller 4th and Robert C. Byrd. They are spearheading the Senate quota bill -- following Richard A. Gephardt, minority leader from Missouri, who led the House fight.
Senator Byrd, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, also tucked a long-shot rider onto a pending hurricane relief bill to provide $1 billion in loan guarantees for steelmakers. In Washington, this rider is known as the Weirton Bill.
Either measure could give some much-needed relief to Weirton Steel. But even at the best of times, profits are razor thin. In 1998, the company lost $6.1 million on revenue of $1.25 billion, and more losses are expected this year. Weirton's stock is now at $2 a share.
The company is so mired in debt from a recent modernization program that nearly every dollar it earns is devoted to interest payments to its debt holders. And like many steelmakers, Weirton cannot take advantage of low interest rates to reduce its borrowing costs because there is virtually no market for steel-industry bonds.
Weirton's situation is especially poignant considering that in 1984, with its former parent company, National Steel, threatening to close the mill, Weirton was bought by its employees for $386 million in one of America's largest employee stock ownership plans. Today, employees own 24 percent, having sold off chunks in the public markets to raise money.
"Our whole community is on pins and needles," Dean Harris, Weirton's Mayor and a steelworker, said. "If I lose my job, where do I go? How do we take care of the dreams of our children?"
 
Imports Take A Growing Toll
Although Big Steel has railed against imports for years, last year's surge was particularly significant. Over two months, the price of flat-rolled steel fell to $250 a ton from more than $320. "When prices get down to the $250-a-ton level, the whole industry is losing money," said Richard K. Riederer, Weirton's chief executive.
Still, Big Steel suffered much more than did minimills.
In the 1998 fourth quarter, when the foreign pricing pressures were most severe, the nation's 11 biggest integrated-steel companies were able to sell twice as much steel as the 14 largest minimills -- $5.9 billion in combined revenue, compared with the minimills' $2.6 billion.
Despite greater sales, the big mills' higher production costs meant they earned less than minimills, which recorded operating profits of $199 million for the period, compared with $138 million for big mills.
Since then, steel prices have recovered somewhat, rising last month to around $290 a ton. This came after the Commerce Department imposed anti-dumping tariffs against Brazil and Japan and negotiated a trade agreement.
Despite these events, Weirton is in a bind.
The company's cash cow is a tin mill accounting for 40 percent of its revenue. Though company executives take comfort that tin is rarely imported and is not made by minimills, the market for tin -- mainly for food cans -- has stopped growing.
And the bulk of Weirton's output, around 60 percent of revenue, comes from rolled steel, a commodity subject to the vagaries of global pricing.
Weirton is dabbling in new businesses, forming a steel-trading E-commerce Web site, entering joint ventures with overseas mills and inventing new specialty products like steel roofing shingles. But these early efforts have yet to pay off.
"It's not that we haven't done things right," Mark Roach, a Weirton steelworker, said. "We've spent money on modernization. We just can't compete with slave wages. Until recently, we were the largest employer in the state. It's kind of embarrassing to say now Wal-Mart is."
 
Can Outside Help Forestall the End?
For big integrated mills, it was not supposed to be this way. Over the last decade, to compete globally, the American steel industry pumped $50 billion into a huge modernization that paid off handsomely -- though with a human cost.
Twenty years ago, it took 10 man-hours to produce a ton of steel; today, that is down to under 4. Steel is being produced with fewer than 2 man-hours a ton at minimills, and, remarkably, even at Weirton, too.
With fewer jobs, most workers left at places like Weirton are in their mid-40's.
"We used to have an influx of young bodies," Mr. Harris, Weirton's Mayor, said. "We'd have 20, 25 guys in the hot mill. Now it's 8. You can walk for long periods in the mill and not see anyone."
Yet, even as Weirton and other steel companies lobby in Washington for protection against these trends, some say it may not matter.
"The handwriting is on the wall for the big integrated steel mills," said Daniel T. Griswold, a trade expert at the Cato Institute. "There is nothing that Congress can do about it."
Even Mr. Bennett, the laid-off steelworker, hedged his optimism: "Even if they resolve this thing fast and they call everyone back, it doesn't mean it's over. If I leave this magistrate's job, should I go back? But there really is nothing else around here."

HEADLINE: ANTIQUES;
Eames Chairs Are Bending The Market

BYLINE: By Wendy Moonan 

 BODY:
In 1928 Charles Eames, an architecture student, was kicked out of Washington University. Then he went on to have one of the most distinguished careers in design.
Eames's legacy is being celebrated in an exhibition that has been touring Europe and that opens at the Library of Congress in Washington on May 20. It will remain there through Sept. 14; in October it moves to the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in Manhattan. The show, "The Work of Charles and Ray Eames: A Legacy of Invention," also honors the contributions of Eames's wife, Ray, who worked with him. The accompanying book, published by Harry N. Abrams, costs $49.50. 
 The exhibition is part of a renewed interest among auction houses, galleries and museums in Eames and in 20th-century design in general.
"Twentieth-century design is stronger than ever," said Mark McDonald, owner of the Gansevoort Gallery in Manhattan. "As the century comes to a close, mid-century things are now antiques." He continued: "Americans were at the forefront of design in the postwar period. There was a concentration of talent -- people like Florence Knoll, the Eameses, George Nelson, Noguchi -- and a market fueled by all the G.I.'s coming home from the war."
Richard Wright, a Chicago dealer, said, "Americans are finally realizing Eames was one of the most important designers of the 20th century." He added, "It's sad that European museums were ahead of us in collecting Eames furniture." He was referring to the Vitra Design Museum in Germany, which has a large Eames collection and is the co-sponsor of the traveling exhibition.
Wlodek Malowanczyk, who owns Collage 20th-Century Classics, a Dallas gallery, said: "Even Dallas is catching up. My customers won't buy the expensive things yet, but they will buy collectibles like Eames's 1945 DCM Chair, with metal legs and a plywood back and seat."
After his dismissal from Washington University in St. Louis, involving his advocacy of the ideas of Frank Lloyd Wright, Eames (1907-78) traveled to Europe and designed a church in Arkansas that caught the eye of the Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen, then president of the Cranbrook Academy in Michigan. He offered Eames a fellowship at the academy. At Cranbrook, Eames met other groundbreaking modernists like the artist Harry Bertoia and fell in love with Ray Kaiser, an art student from California who would become his second wife.
In 1939 Eames went to work in Saarinen's architectural office. The following year, while Eames was working as a resident instructor at Cranbrook with Saarinen's son, Eero, the two collaborated on a prototype of a modern chair that won first prize at the Museum of Modern Art's Organic Design in Home Furnishings competition. Nicknamed the Conversation Armchair, it had a plywood shell, foam rubber cushioning, custom upholstery and four tapering angled wood dowel legs. It was the first time a molded plywood shell was shaped into three-dimensional curves. And it made a lot of news.
In 1941 Eames married Kaiser, and they moved to Los Angeles "to try to mass produce molded plywood with complex curves," said Eames Demetrios, Eames's grandson.
He has created a Web site, www.eamesoffice.com, and opened the Eames Office Gallery in Santa Monica, Calif., to educate people about the Eames philosophy. "It's not about chairs," he said. "It's a way of looking at the world."
During World War II the United States Navy commissioned Eames to develop plywood stretchers and leg splints for wounded American soldiers. After the war the Eameses adapted their experience to the design of furniture. In 1948 they designed the Eiffel Tower Chair, which had a fiberglass shell with metal rod leg supports. It won the second prize at the Museum of Modern Art's 1948 International Competition for Low-Cost Furniture Design. The Eameses went on to create chairs, storage units, tables and folding screens, most of which were manufactured by Herman Miller in Michigan.
Over the next two months work by Eames is expected to show up at several auctions and at a fair devoted to 20th-century decorative arts, beginning tomorrow with David Rago's 20th-century modern auction in Lambertville, N.J. (Information: 609-397-9374.)
Meanwhile, dealers from as far away as Italy are expected to participate in the Los Angeles Modernism Show at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium on May 8 and 9.
"L.A. is driving the market right now," said John Meany, a San Francisco dealer who will be there. "Since the movie colony embraced modernism and started buying and restoring modern houses, mid-century modern has gotten very trendy. Five or six years ago it was Tokyo that was driving the market."
Los Angeles Modern Auctions, or LAMA, which specializes in Eames, will also be at the Los Angeles show, along with Mr. Malowanczyk. In addition, LAMA is conducting its own auction on May 16 in Beverly Hills. Highlights include the Eames Conversation Armchair and three rare pieces that the architect R. M. Schindler designed in 1934 for the Van Patten residence in Los Angeles.
On May 23 the John Toomey Gallery in Oak Park, Ill., in conjunction with Mr. Wright, the Chicago dealer, and the Treadway Gallery of Cincinnati is having four separate 20th-century sales in Oak Park. For one, Mr. Wright assembled 150 Eames pieces for an all-Eames sale.
Sotheby's 20th-century decorative arts sale in Manhattan is on June 10; Christie's is on June 11, at its new home in Rockefeller Center, another icon of modernism.
Mr. McDonald of the Gansevoort normally sells to American architects and designers like Lee Mindel, Michael Formica and Thad Hayes, but on Sunday he was in the Netherlands at the first Amsterdam Arts and Design Fair, which focused on design after 1880. He was one of three American dealers selling American furniture. Peter Loughery of LAMA sold some Eames leg splints at the fair.
"The icons go for very high prices," he added. "In Europe many can't afford to spend thousands on a side chair."
But the number of collectors is increasing everywhere.
"There was a time when I recognized everyone who bid at my sales in L.A.," Mr. Loughery said, "Now it's maybe 20 percent."
The Lambertville auction, also organized by John Sollo, will offer several pieces by the craftsman George Nakashima, including an end table with a beautifully figured Buckeye burlwood top, a rare Makassar ebony console table with a trestle base, and a spectacular walnut music stand.
The market for mid-century modern pieces today "is a lot like the stock market," Mr. McDonald said. "The business runs the way the economy runs. People have money to spend, and they are optimistic about the economy. Good things come out because people think they will get good prices for them."

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on page 11.
 
Now Playing
 
 * "ANALYZE THIS," starring Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal. Directed by Harold Ramis (R, 110 minutes). The title, concept and teaming of these co-stars are all funny before the lights go down, so think of this comedy as an offer you can't refuse. Cast as a mobster whose confidence is shaken, Mr. De Niro is hilarious simply by playing his role halfway straight, in classic goodfella style. His mobster finds just the right comic foil in Billy Crystal, as the psychiatrist who utters the immortal, "When I got into family therapy, this wasn't the family I had in mind." There's a lot more where that came from in this breezy comic treat (Janet Maslin). 

* "CENTRAL STATION," starring Fernanda Montenegro. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 115 minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless older woman crosses paths with an orphaned boy. There's plenty of room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Mr. Salles's film is all in the telling. As these characters develop a fractious bond, then embark on a road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Mr. Salles brings great tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their journey. Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance was one of last year's very best (Maslin).
 
 * "COOKIE'S FORTUNE," starring Charles S. Dutton, Glenn Close, Patricia Neal and Julianne Moore. Directed by Robert Altman (PG-13, 118 minutes). What a treat. The sweet assurance and guerrilla wit of Mr. Altman's vintage ensemble films make a copacetic return with a Southern small-town black comedy. Seamlessly made and completely enveloping, it tells of the machinations set off when a wealthy old woman (Ms. Neal) outrages her diabolically genteel niece (Ms. Close) by committing suicide. As the old woman's dearest friend and the niece's unwitting nemesis, Mr. Dutton is rock solid and appealing. The entire cast works on a single wavelength as Mr. Altman makes the most of a well-woven screenplay by Anne Rapp (Maslin).
 
 * "THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS," starring Elodie Bouchez and Natacha Regnier. Directed by Erick Zonca (R, 113 minutes; in French with English subtitles). In this very special French film about two freewheeling young women, their turbulent friendship is frayed by sexual passion and economic realities. The weaker and more head-turning of the women (Ms. Regnier) falls for the advances of a rich nightclub owner, while her fiery friend, played with unforgettable immediacy by Ms. Bouchez, rages against what she views as imminent disaster. In the process, Mr. Zonca shows astonishing acuity in observing how the women's diverging values affect every aspect of their lives. A rare and wrenching drama (Maslin).
 
 * "EDTV," starring Matthew McConaughey, Ellen DeGeneres, Woody Harrelson, Jenna Elfman and Rob Reiner. Directed by Ron Howard (PG-13, 120 minutes). In this good-humored, deceptively easygoing satire, Mr. Howard holds up a fun-house mirror to a world ruled by voyeurism and specious fame. The subject matter is familiar by now, but this film about a Trumanesque nobody as 24-hour-a-day television star has a shrewd way of drawing the audience into its web. Permeated by all the crassness and absurdity inherent in celebrity-mad culture, and by our collective obsession with snoopy trivia, it features a fine ensemble cast and a dependably jokey screenplay by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel. It helps that most of the principals, in a cast that also includes Elizabeth Hurley, have played this game for real and act their roles with a comic vengeance (Maslin).
 
 * "ELECTION," starring Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 105 minutes). From the acerbically funny director of "Citizen Ruth" comes this caustic satire of the American electoral process in a high school setting. Its leading candidate, Tracy Flick, played tartly by Ms. Witherspoon, has a mother who sought tactical advice for Tracy from Connie Chung and Elizabeth Dole. Mr. Broderick plays the hapless good-guy teacher who thinks this wicked little front-runner needs to be stopped. And hunky newcomer Chris Klein plays Tracy's reluctant opponent in a style best described as early Keanu. With a lovely ear for hypocritical conversation, the screenplay specializes in keeping all the characters a few beats off of what they actually mean (Maslin).
 
 "EXISTENZ," starring Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law. Directed by David Cronenberg (R, 90 minutes). Not for Mr. Cronenberg the sleek futuristic look of other films that play virtual reality games. This one has the insinuatingly ghoulish hallmarks of other Cronenberg fever dreams (like "The Fly," "Crash" and "Naked Lunch"). And it uses them to weirdly enveloping effect as a renowned game designer (Ms. Leigh) and her wary companion (Mr. Law) try to play the most dangerous game she has yet created. This sci-fi scheme is disturbingly effective as it plays its own mind games with the viewer, complete with a sharp final twist. The title is pronounced "eggs-is-tense" (Maslin).
 
"GO," starring Sarah Polley, Katie Holmes, Timothy Olyphant, Taye Diggs, Scott Wolf and Jay Mohr. Directed by Doug Liman (R, 100 minutes). This three-episode demimondaine comedy borrows truckloads of inspiration from "Pulp Fiction" but still has some flash and personality of its own. Mr. Liman, who shot the film as well as directed it, uses a supermarket as ground zero and sends a sullen cashier (Ms. Polley) out to make a drug deal. Then he embellishes this situation fully enough to send his film down the rabbit hole into neo-Tarantino adventures, some of which (guys go to Las Vegas, then get into trouble with strippers, gunplay, car theft and a brake-screeching chase) are a lot more tired than others. The ensemble cast shows cool comic flair (Maslin).
 
 * "HIDEOUS KINKY," starring Kate Winslet. Directed by Gillies MacKinnon (R, 99 minutes). Ms. Winslet knew best when she took on this offbeat, richly atmospheric adventure in the wake of "Titanic." The leading role in Mr. MacKinnon's vividly colorful film offers her a field day. She plays a young hippie mother who brings her reluctant English daughters to Marrakesh, circa 1972. The film, about the mother's willfulness, the girls' reaction and the sheer headiness of their surroundings, belongs to the striking sub-genre in which it is baby-boom adults, not their children, who most need to come of age (Maslin).
 
 "LIFE," starring Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence. Directed by Ted Demme (R, 105 minutes). Though it's hard to miss the basic unfunniness of seeing two black men sentenced to life at a Mississippi State Prison, this mild-mannered comedy is more likable than it sounds. If it awkwardly straddles the line between period piece (it begins during Prohibition) and comedy, it also keeps the stars kidding their way from youth to curmudgeonhood. Mr. Murphy in particular gives a more substantial performance than might be expected here. Stick around for closing out-takes that show (for instance) a cell phone ringing during a scene set in 1932 (Maslin).
 
 * "LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS," starring Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Vinnie Jones and Nick Moran. Directed by Guy Ritchie (R, 106 minutes). Not since "The Usual Suspects" has there been such an oversupply of cool macho schemers in a single film. And they're served up with a quick, tart economy that bespeaks the filmmaker's background making videos and commercials, actually an advantage for a change. There's not much beneath the surface here; what's most entertaining is Mr. Ritchie's droll, hard-boiled storytelling and the rogue's gallery of a cast that he has assembled. All the film need do is juggle assorted miscreants and four separate gangs who, figuratively speaking, can't shoot straight (Maslin).
 
 "THE MATRIX," starring Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne. Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski (R, 120 minutes). The time-traveling story steeped in virtual reality will be all but incomprehensible to nontechnofreaks. And the film borrows unapologetically from other sci-fi extravaganzas, with a big debt to "The X-Files" in the paranoia department. But the storytelling is intricately bizarre and the special effects are indeed special, notably when it comes to midair martial arts with a gravity-defying gusto. And Mr. Reeves shows that you can look like a Prada model while behaving like an action hero. One of the main stars here is Bill Pope, an inventive cinematographer. He and the Wachowskis provide a couch-potato epiphany: while the characters seem to be performing marvelous feats, they're often lying stock-still in the grip of virtual reality (Maslin).
 
 "PUSHING TIN," starring John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, Angelina Jolie and Cate Blanchett. Directed by Mike Newell (R, 115 minutes). This story of air-traffic controllers betrays its origins as a magazine article, since it has more interesting data than built-in drama. But with a cast like this, and with the director of "Four Weddings and a Funeral" at the helm, the tacked-on soapy plot here has plenty of sparks. Mr. Cusack and Mr. Thornton, both tersely good as professional rivals, become even more competitive once Ms. Jolie sashays into view as the latter's show-stopping biker-chick wife. Whatever possessed Ms. Blanchett to play Mr. Cusack's wife, a heavily accented Long Island housewife who talks about casseroles in the oven, she brings off the role with good humor and unexpected grace (Maslin).
 
 * "SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE" (the Oscar winner for best film, best original screenplay, best art direction, best costumes and best comedy score). Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow (the best-actress winner), Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench (best supporting actress). Directed by John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate delight, with an exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets better as the film unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of his "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead," dares to imagine whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty. Meanwhile, this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving we enjoy today and has great fun presenting the creation of "Romeo and Juliet," glitches and all. Mr. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
 
 "SLC PUNK!," starring Matthew Lillard and Michael Goorjian. Directed by James Merendino (R, 97 minutes). Maybe only real experience as an alienated teen-ager in Salt Lake City in 1985 could have led a filmmaker to such a (perhaps deservedly) overlooked time and place. But Mr. Merendino supplies enough absurdist humor to make sense of the setting. His film follows Stevo (Mr. Lillard), the kind of anarchist who likes making rules, and whose rebel streak is about as authentic as his blue hair. As the rare punk who may be headed for Harvard Law School without even trying, Stevo is glib but entertaining. For all the film's appealing outlandishness, it's finally as mainstream as its hero proves to be (Maslin).
 
 * "A WALK ON THE MOON," starring Diane Lane, Viggo Mortensen, Liev Schreiber, Tovah Feldshuh and Anna Paquin. Directed by Tony Goldwyn (R, 107 minutes). This evocative 1969 period piece, set on the brink of Woodstock in a Catskills holiday camp, is as seductive as the handsome, itinerant hippie who turns its heroine's life upside down. Thoughtfully conceived and movingly acted, it sweeps a housewife and mother named Pearl Kantrowitz (Ms. Lane) into a torrid extramarital romance and then weighs the consequences. With a tenderness that's unusual for a contemporary American film, it tells an enveloping tale enhanced by artfully selected Woodstock-era music. Mr. Mortensen may strain credulity as the foxiest blouse salesman in the Catskills, but he certainly does wonders for the movie (Maslin).
 
Film Series
 
 "TOUT TRUFFAUT." Cinematic treats in profusion await visitors to Film Forum, where a nine-week, 21-film series devoted to Francois Truffaut (1932-1984) is in progress. This major retrospective offers a double bill this weekend that mingles the comic and the melancholy. Through Monday, the attraction is a double bill of "Shoot the Piano Player" (1960) and "The Story of Adele H." (1975). In the former, Truffaut's follow-up to "The 400 Blows" and an often satirical homage to Hollywood's gangster films, Charles Aznavour stars as a burned-out pianist who becomes entangled with the underworld. In the latter, Isabelle Adjani delivers a wrenching portrayal of the daughter of Victor Hugo and her obsessive love for an English officer. The series continues until June 24 at Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, South Village. Admission is $8.50 per program; $4.50 for members. Information: (212) 727-8110 (Lawrence Van Gelder).

'Limbo' Means What It Says

BYLINE: By James Sterngold 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, April 29

 BODY:
It is a season of certainty in Hollywood, at least as far as story lines in popular movies are concerned. There is often a very pronounced difference between the good guys and the bad guys, and movies tend to end on a note of clarity. There is a winner and a loser, a resolution. It is no accident that many movies now are based on comic books, which tend to have a clear conception of good and right. 
 John Sayles (above) attacks that approach in his latest movie, "Limbo." In fact, few films have ever been as ambiguous as "Limbo," Mr. Sayles's 12th movie, which will play at the Cannes Film Festival in May and is to open in theaters in the United States on June 4. Suffice it to say that the word "cliffhanger" hardly captures the uncertain note on which the film abruptly ends, on a lonely, wooded island off the Alaskan coast.
"That's why it's called 'Limbo,' " said Mr. Sayles, who wrote, directed and edited the picture. "One of the things about an ending to a movie is it should send you back to the movie itself, and it should make sense. This movie is about risks, emotional and physical, and so I want it to end focused on that, not what happens to them ultimately. People will fill in the end for themselves."
The movie is about a group of good-hearted misfits in Juneau, Alaska, who slowly work their way into each other's lives. David Strathairn plays a fisherman who no longer fishes because of an accident years earlier in which two of his friends were killed; Mary Elizabeth Mastrantino plays a lounge singer who stumbles into one bad relationship after another before falling for him, and Vanessa Martinez plays her daughter, who is afraid of drawing close to anyone because of her mother's tempestuous love life.
Little by little, they begin to pull together when they find themselves at a physical risk that mirrors the emotional risks they are taking in trying to build a family.
Mr. Sayles said the movie's tone was a throwback to the 1960's and 70's, when ambiguity was more usual. "I don't think it's as common now to end a movie on a question as it was in the 60's and 70's," he said. "Those were the days of the counter-culture and challenging authority. Heroes were flawed."
At the least, Mr. Sayles added, films with open endings make audiences think. "What you're hoping for is you don't want someone to consume your movie like a fast-food meal and then forget about it," he said. "You don't want them to walk away thinking about other movies, but about their own lives. This may do that."
 
 Creating Effects
 George Lucas's "Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace" is expected to be a major hit when it is released in May in a business sorely hurting for blockbuster-size profits. But the film also marks a coming of age for computerized special effects.
When Mr. Lucas produced his first three "Star Wars" pictures, he all but invented the modern special-effects industry. He made innovative uses of computers and models of space ships, aliens and the like to create realistic images of faraway worlds and far-out characters. He eventually organized this expertise into a company, Industrial Light and Magic, which was a pioneer in the special-effects world and which rode the crest of Hollywood's huge special-effects boom.
Although "The Phantom Menace" is perhaps the most sophisticated and one of the most costly special-effects pictures ever made, it comes as Hollywood's ardor for the computer has cooled, said Jim Morris (above), president of Lucas Digital, the parent company of Industrial Light and Magic. He said this was partly because of the costs, and partly because audiences were no longer thrilled by what had become run-of-the-mill effects, like brilliant explosions. As a result, the industry has been in something of a recession.
"There's been a real cooling at the studios in greenlighting these pictures, and some of the infrastructure built up is collapsing under its own weight because there's not enough work going around," Mr. Morris said. He said his company had been kept on an even keel because of its work on "The Phantom Menace," as well as "The Mummy," "Wild, Wild West" and a large number of television commercials.
Mr. Morris said roughly half the new "Star Wars" movie's $120 million budget was used to produce special effects, an unusually high figure. He added that the picture had more computerized effects than almost any previous live-action film, with about 2,000 special-effects shots, compared with 200 or so in a regular special-effects movie.
In making "The Phantom Menace," Industrial Light and Magic geared up considerably, from about 650 employees a couple of years ago to about 1,000 now. In addition, it had to make huge investments in computers and software.
Mr. Morris said that when the original "Star Wars" pictures were made, about 90 percent of the costs of creating special effects was labor, and 10 percent computers. Today, he said, the ratio is about half and half because of the growing expense of computer stations and software.
Mr. Morris also said that in the old days, the Industrial Light crews often had to put in grinding hours and seven-day weeks to complete their work Now, he said, the company has learned to pace itself better.
"They're doing their best work ever because they're not coming in in a haze of exhaustion," Mr. Morris said. "We avoided the last-minute crunch." And so now, he said, several weeks before the movie opens, many of the staff members have already left for well-deserved vacations.
 
 A Hip 'Tarzan'
"Tarzan" is one of the most-filmed subjects in Hollywood history, with Disney estimating there have been 47 adaptations of the Edgar Rice Burroughs stories, second only to the number of adaptations of "Dracula." But it is a safe bet this famed ape man has never before been a skateboarder.
The Walt Disney Company's big animated feature film this summer will be "Tarzan," and as in its previous efforts, the company is both trying to bring to life a classic story known to many and to make it new, so it will be the foundation for everything from merchandise sales to theme park rides.
The resulting movie is long on outright adventure, with the hero, Tarzan (above), adept at shooting through the jungle because he slides along trees as if on a skateboard. The directors, Kevin Lima and Chris Buck, both veterans of several Disney animated movies, used a new computer technique, called Deep Canvas, to enhance the sense of motion and excitement and to give depth to the jungle background. But their goal, also in keeping with the unwritten rules of this genre, was to make the movie something of a psychodrama, a record of a youth's wrestling with his identity in a world in which he does not quite fit. Indeed, one of the bigger changes from many previous Disney films is that the personal struggle at its heart is more adolescent.
The plot follows the boy who is raised by gorillas and struggles to be one of them, until he catches his first glimpse of humans. Tarzan, with Tony Goldwyn's voice, ultimately feels he has to choose between the jungle, a world he knows but in which he remains something of an outsider, and civilization, a world he does not know but to which he feels drawn, even though he remains an outsider.
"It's really the classic struggle most kids feel of wanting to be in control of their worlds," Mr. Buck said. "He's going through an early college-age kind of struggle."
And there is a Jane, with the voice of Minnie Driver. But the attraction is innocent, the directors said, not sexual. As in other Disney animated movies, there is music, provided by Phil Collins, but it is used differently. "This is the first Disney movie for a long time where the characters don't sing themselves," Mr. Lima said. "The songs are the voices of their emotions."
Glenn Close provides the voice of the gorilla who raises Tarzan; Rosie O'Donnell is his gorilla sidekick, and Lance Henriksen of "Millennium" is the voice of the gorilla patriarch. They are the friends who counsel Tarzan, helping him make his difficult decision, and making him probably the first skatehoarder best known for his emotions and thinking.

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW;
For Vietnamese, a New Apocalypse

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
"Three Seasons" is a wistful, rain-streaked elegy for a Vietnamese culture that is being swept away on the flood-tide of globalization. Too tender-hearted and lyrical to deliver a political indictment, this touching film, which was chosen best dramatic feature at the Sundance Film Festival in January, is a dreamy cinematic poem whose interwoven voices offer different variations of the same sad story.
In that story, the gentle, common folk of Saigon are being left behind as an emerging, hard-edged international culture symbolized by Coca-Cola signs, luxury hotels and the peddling of plastic lotus blossoms on the streets takes over the city. One of many symbols of bald commercialization is a popular hangout once frequented by American servicemen that is now vulgarly named the Apocalypse Now Bar. 
 "Three Seasons" is the first feature film by Tony Bui, a 26-year-old director who escaped from Vietnam with his parents when he was 2 years old and grew up in California. After returning to his native country for a visit when he was 19, he became fluent in Vietnamese and went back to make a short film, "Yellow Lotus." Filmed in Saigon with a cast of Vietnamese actors, "Three Seasons" portrays the Vietnamese capital as a city of dissolving pastel colors, and the diffused palette reinforces the film's romanticized vision of a worldmelting away under warm tropical rains.
All four of the film's principal characters are viewed as innocent, struggling victims of economic forces beyond their control. The opening scenes introduce us to Kien An (Nguyen Ngoc Hiep), the latest recruit in an all-female work force hired to pick white lotus blossoms on the temple estate of a reclusive boss. After gathering their crop, the women are bused to Saigon, where they sell baskets of flowers on the streets. Business is good until one day Kien An suddenly finds herself competing with vendors of plastic, artificially scented imitations of the real thing.
Summoned by her mysterious employer, who has heard her singing a work song that transports him back to his childhood, Kien An discovers an embittered poet dying of leprosy. This once handsome man whose face is decomposing is the film's most jarring symbol of a traditional culture being pushed into the shadows.
Another strand of the story follows Hai (Don Duong), a cyclo driver who falls in love with Lan (Zoe Bui), an imperious Vietnamese prostitute. Hai assiduously courts her by offering her free rides from the luxury hotels in which she plies her trade. Lan scornfully accepts his transportation until the day he reaps a windfall from winning a taxi race and purchases her professional time. Beneath her hard, high-fashion exterior, he discovers a frightened, alienated woman awash in shame and confusion.
Finally, there is Woody (Nguyen Huu Duoc), a wide-eyed street boy who sells trinkets out of a suitcase. At the Apocalypse Now Bar, the boy meets James Hager (Harvey Keitel), an American soldier who has returned to Vietnam to search for his grown-up daughter. When Hager leaves for a moment, the boy nods off and has his suitcase stolen. Woody spends most of the rest of the movie trying to retrieve the source of his meager livelihood in a drenching rainstorm.
"Three Seasons" doesn't pretend that its stories or characters (who all cross paths before the movie is over) are realistic.
Each is a symbolic thread in a larger fable of people searching for their roots. The movie is so languidly paced that it occasionally turns vague and meandering.
And its characters, especially the adorable, saucer-eyed Woody and the sweet, self-abasing Hai, are sentimentalized to the brink of saintliness. So much misty sadness and soft-focus guilt swirls around that you almost wish for a purgative eruption of anger.
But such an eruption would violate the movie's sweetly uplifting agenda. Determined not to revisit the Vietnam War and to open up old wounds, "Three Seasons" preaches reconciliation, forgiveness, reverence for tradition and the salvaging of all that was best about the past.
 
"Three Seasons is rated PG-13. (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes sexual situations.

Brazil Pushes Ahead on Bank Inquiry

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, April 29

 BODY:
Brazilian lawmakers pressed forward today with an inquiry into allegations of inside information leaks at the country's central bank.
Lawmakers called Francisco Lopes, a Harvard-educated economist and former central bank president who is at the center of the inquiry, to testify before a panel of senators for a third time. 
 Mr. Lopes is accused of engineering, perhaps illegally, a bailout of two banks caught off guard by the central bank's decision to devalue the currency in January. He is also suspected of receiving payment in an offshore account for services at a consulting firm he once owned while employed as a central bank director in 1996.
These accusations have not been substantiated. But Mr. Lopes has refused twice before to testify and was detained by the police briefly earlier this week for his defiance. It was not clear today whether he would agree to testify this time.
Even with the uncertainty over Mr. Lopes, Brazil's financial markets are beginning to shrug off the effects of the inquiry, a sign that it is losing momentum. Less preoccupied with the potential for new allegations to emerge, the country's currency, the real, strengthened today to a four-month high of 1.65 to the dollar, before weakening slightly. On Wednesday, the central bank made another in a series of interest rate cuts because of growing confidence in the economy. And in recent days Brazilian banks have successfully sold bonds abroad to foreign investors for the first time since Russia's economic meltdown last summer suppressed demand for emerging-market debt securities.
"For us it appears this investigation is nearing the end," said Carlos Castanho, the managing director of Credit Suisse First Boston Garantia, an investment bank that is one of the largest traders of Brazilian bonds.
The investigation may still hurt the credibility of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's administration, and Pedro Malan, Mr. Cardoso's Finance Minister, may be called to testify. Mr. Malan may be criticized for his role in the affair because, in Brazil, the president of the central bank is subordinate to the finance minister. Another high-ranking official, the Budget Minister, Pedro Parente, could also be called to testify since he was deputy finance minister in mid-January when Mr. Lopes bailed out the two institutions, Banco Marka and Banco Fonte Cindam.
But it is unlikely that the scandal will spread to other members of the Government's elite bureaucracy. The current central bank president, Arminio Fraga, whose work has been praised by investors, is considered largely untouchable because at the time of the events in question he was managing a hedge fund in New York for George Soros, the multibillionaire investor.

HEADLINE: Almost a Microsoft Witness, But Definitely a Hot Potato

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
He was personally asked to be a witness in the Microsoft antitrust trial by the software giant's chairman, William H. Gates, but he was quickly dropped from the company's witness list after he was questioned by a Government lawyer last fall.
 Yet judging from his deposition testimony released this week, Michael L. Dertouzos had a lot to say -- and he would have been a most unusual witness, blunt and direct, with views not tailored to either side. 
 The 62-year-old director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's laboratory for computer science at first refused to be a witness for Microsoft when the company's lawyers reached him. But last July, Mr. Dertouzos said, Mr. Gates called him and he agreed to testify but only on one narrow issue: that in the interests of simplicity, the distinction between the Internet browser and the operating system would become "increasingly blurred in the future."
Coming from a leading computer scientist, this was music to the ears of the Microsoft legal team. It seemed to echo a central defense argument -- namely, that Microsoft's Windows operating system and its Internet Explorer browser are one seamlessly integrated product and not two products bundled together to stifle competition.
Yet as his deposition testimony makes clear, Mr. Dertouzos did not have a legal agenda in mind. In his books and speeches, he has advocated the need to simplify the use of computers if information technology is to truly pay off, making the economy more productive and people's lives richer.
To do that, he explained, a person ought to be able to easily retrieve information from a desktop PC or from some distant place through the Internet by using a few simple commands -- "a steering wheel, a gas pedal and a brake, so to speak."
Besides speaking his mind on only one issue, Mr. Dertouzos informed Microsoft that he would be an unusual witness in other respects as well. He would take no pay, whereas fees of more than $1,000 an hour are common for expert trial witnesses.
Most witnesses at the Microsoft trial prepared for days or weeks, reviewing documents and being coached by lawyers, but not Mr. Dertouzos. "I would like to behave and be treated as a judge's witness rather than as Microsoft's witness in the European tradition of being neutral," he said. "And I did not want to be prepared in any way by Microsoft attorneys."
He was willing to be a trial witness despite what would inevitably be questioned as a possible conflict of interest. He told the Justice Department lawyer at his deposition that nearly a year earlier, in November 1997, Mr. Gates had pledged to donate $20 million to M.I.T. to build a new computer science building.
The news of the Gates donation, which was publicly announced only a few weeks ago, would certainly have been used at the trial by the Justice Department lawyers to question Mr. Dertouzos's independence.
But the computer scientist answered any doubts about his independence as his testimony proceeded. He volunteered that he and Mr. Gates see the future of the information age differently. A key disagreement between the two men, Mr. Dertouzos said, was "my statement that the new world of information, if left to its own devices, would increase the gap between rich and poor." He added, "Mr. Gates felt it would shrink it."
When asked whether the browser was now considered part of the operating system or a separate application, Mr. Dertouzos replied, "Historically and today, it is the case that browsers are treated as applications, yes."
With that, the hopes of the Microsoft legal team fell, as did Mr. Dertouzos's value as a defense witness. Legal cases tend to be decided by facts, rooted in the here and now. No matter what Mr. Dertouzos may think about the future course of computing, he said that the browser was currently treated as a separate product, as the Justice Department contends, and not part of the operating system.
That single quotation from the Dertouzos deposition was featured in the Microsoft trial and presented as evidence by the Government.
Go a little further into his testimony, though, and Mr. Dertouzos emphasizes the difficulty of drawing clean dividing lines, given the malleability of software, rendered in the digital code of 1's and 0's. His goal of simplicity, he testified, could be accomplished in many ways -- giving the operating system the functionality of a browser, giving a browser the functionality of an operating system, or placing most of these capabilities centrally in a network, which can be tapped into with simple Internet devices.
"There are a lot of possibilities there," he said. "Software design is still an extremely primitive activity based primarily on art and craft. So depending on the designer's inspiration, mind-set and approach, one of these approaches might turn out to be best."

HEADLINE: Initial Jobless Claims Are Down; Purchases of New Homes Climb

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
More Americans are buying new homes and claims for jobless benefits are falling, Government reports showed today.
New single-family home sales rose 2.1 percent in March, reversing a 2 percent decline in February, as sales in the West posted their biggest monthly gain in four years, Commerce Department figures showed. 
 First-time claims for state unemployment benefits fell a larger-than-expected 20,000 last week, to a seasonally adjusted 294,000 after decreasing 5,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported. Analysts expected claims to fall to 310,000 last week.
A 24 percent rise in March new-home sales in Western states proved to be more than enough to offset declines in other regions of the country. The overall gain for the month translated into an annual rate of 909,000 units, higher than last year's record sales total of 886,000 homes.
"I've been doing this since 1972, and this is one of the best periods," said Roy Hooper, a Phoenix real estate broker and relocation director at the Cendant Corporation's Century 21 Real Estate Corporation. "You have a lot of new people coming in, and they want new homes."
While most analysts do not see housing setting another record this year, builders say they are confident business will improve in the months ahead.
The inventory of new homes for sale at the current sales pace rose to a 4.1-month supply in March from a 4-month supply in February, the Government report also showed. And the median price of new homes fell 1.5 percent in March to $153,000 from $155,400 in February.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Japan's Nutcracker Suite

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
For the past decade whenever anyone told me Japan was finally opening its economy and lowering its trade barriers, I always thought of that story of the prisoners who were in jail together for so many years that they didn't need to actually tell each other their jokes anymore. They would just say "Joke number 3," and everyone would laugh. In my case, the simple phrase "Japan is really opening up its economy this time" always had a similar laugh-inducing effect.
Well, laugh no more. After visiting Tokyo a few weeks ago, I left convinced that Japan has indeed begun its third great modernization -- something Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi will be touting on his visit to the U.S. beginning today. The first modern opening of Japan began when Commodore Perry broke down the doors and arrived in 1853, triggering the Meiji restoration. The second was Douglas MacArthur's imposition of democracy on Japan after World War II, and the third is being driven now by the invisible hands of globalization: the Internet and global capital flows are breaking the shell around Japan like a nutcracker. 
 Let's be honest: For the past 50 years Japan was just the most successful Communist country in history. It was only a matter of time before the forces that brought down the Berlin wall and the Soviet Union felled the wall around Japan as well.
It's hard to talk to anyone in Tokyo these days without hearing the "Nutcracker" suite in the background. A friend at the Japanese Foreign Ministry began a conversation like this: "My son informed us the other day that he wants to be a fund manager, but he doesn't want to work for a Japanese bank. He wants to be with an international bank. The Japanese institutions that young people of my generation would automatically like to join, like the major banks, are crumbling. That is new. My wife couldn't understand my son. So he said to her, "If you want to understand what I want to do, watch this film." He gave her a video of the movie "Other People's Money," about a New York financier who takes over a dying company in New England. . . . My wife is still worried."
Another Japanese friend who works in executive recruiting informed me that she always had a hard time recruiting Japanese to work for U.S. companies because these companies, unlike those in Japan, practiced "the three K's -- Kitsui, the Japanese word for 'very demanding'; Kaiko, Japanese for 'firing people' when they did not perform, and Kyoso, Japanese for 'competition.' " This friend now tells her clients: "Even if you think you are signing up for life with a Japanese company today, you could wake up in the morning and find yourself working for a foreign-owned company very soon, so you might as well join one now and learn to adapt to it."
So I've got good news and bad news and good news. The good news is that Japan is really changing. The bad news is that the Japanese Government is still using its savings to prop up inefficient companies. "The good news, though," said a foreign banker in Tokyo, "is that the state is now running out of money, and that guarantees that the free market is going to increasingly decide where capital and labor should go, and that will bring about the new Japan. But it will take 10 years."
Indeed, many Japanese companies, strapped for cash, are now seeking foreign partners, and those partners are bringing foreign business practices. The French auto maker Renault just came in and took a chunk of Nissan, while GE Capital, AIG, Merrill Lynch and Goldman, Sachs are all buying up cash-starved Japanese businesses and restructuring them.
While the transformation taking place in Japan today is going to make it a formidable competitor over time, it will be a wrenching transition. Sure, Japan's economy was a rigged game in many ways, but it provided enormous social stability and cohesion. There is much to admire in Japanese society, and it is not clear what is going to go and what is going to stay in this transition.
Stephanie Strom, a Tokyo reporter for The Times, wrote a moving article the other day about a Japanese manufacturer who stabbed his brother -- who was also his business partner -- to death after their once-high-flying welding company went bust. It went bust after the walls around Japan started to fall and the company had to deal with more open, global competition. Ironically, their bankrupt company had specialized in making metal doors.

HEADLINE: Potential Mayor of Baltimore Has City Guessing

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, April 27

 BODY:
State lawmakers shortened a city residency requirement to allow him to run. Prominent civic, business and church leaders formed a draft committee to encourage him to run. Three former mayors have implored him to run.
Supporters of Kweisi Mfume are so convinced he is the only choice to succeed Kurt L. Schmoke, who is stepping down after three terms as Mayor of Baltimore, that they predict dire consequences for the city if anyone else from what they view as a lackluster field prevails in the November election. 
 But as much as they want a candidate of Mr. Mfume's stature -- a five-term Democratic Congressman from west Baltimore who left the House in 1995 to become president and chief executive of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People -- they can only cross their fingers and hold their breath.
As the city approaches its first mayoral election campaign without an incumbent in 28 years, Mr. Mfume says he has not decided whether to run for mayor or remain at the N.A.A.C.P., which is based here. The uncertainty has kept the city's political forces on edge, would-be candidates on the sidelines and officials of the civil rights organization in the dark. Even Julian Bond, the association's chairman, says he has no idea what Mr. Mfume will do.
"Everybody wants this on their timetable," Mr. Mfume said in an interview on Monday, during which he expressed ambivalence over a decision that he is promising by mid-May. "But at the end of the day, it's my call, it's what I'm comfortable with. In my heart of hearts, I have to choose the best thing I can do to help the greatest number of people."
"You know," he added, "I go back and forth between my head and heart, back and forth, day and night. What I ought to do. What I should do. People think I have made up my mind about this. That's not the case at all."
Baltimore is one of those places that have always strained to maintain big-league stature among American cities. Mr. Schmoke, a former Rhodes scholar and assistant United States attorney, has helped. So has a vast urban redevelopment effort over the last 20 years, creating a vibrant downtown, stabilizing neighborhoods and stemming a slow but steady migration to the suburbs.
Chronic problems remain, though, including a large number of homicides (about 300 a year), underachieving public schools and an abundance of crumbling low-income housing.
Mr. Schmoke, a Democrat in an overwhelmingly Democratic city, has endured much of the recent criticism for the problems' persistence. The complaints only heightened interest in Mr. Mfume as a problem solver once the Mayor announced in December that he would not seek a fourth term.
While other Democrats, including Mr. Mfume's second cousin, Lawrence A. Bell 3d, the City Council president, say they are running for mayor no matter what he decides, none can match Mr. Mfume's credentials. A former member of the City Council, Mr. Mfume, now 50, went on to gain national prominence as a Congressman and chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus before being chosen to lead the nation's oldest civil rights organization.
At the outset, Mr. Mfume played down any interest in becoming mayor. He had two years remaining on a five-year contract at the N.A.A.C.P., where he had inherited an organization facing discord, debt and a struggle to make a case for its own relevance. He has since restored financial stability, brought in new leaders and expanded membership, especially among those of college age. But he contends that the association needs more time to re-establish its once-weighty role in the nation's social conscience.
"That's the dichotomy I face," he said. "I don't feel that what I've started here is finished. The foundation is stable, but now it's up to the association to put up the superstructure."
Only recently has Mr. Mfume begun sounding more like a prospective candidate. As members of the City Council discussed increasing the mayor's salary of $95,000 as an added inducement -- Mr. Mfume earns about $220,000 with the N.A.A.C.P. -- he said in a speech last week that if anything ultimately persuaded him to run, it would be his love for the city and public service, not money.
"I don't need to be enticed to be mayor of this city," he told his audience, in what was regarded as the strongest indication yet that he was giving serious consideration to a run.
The speech came shortly after Gov. Parris N. Glendening signed a measure that reduces the city's residency requirement for political candidates to six months prior to election, from one year. The state initiative allows the Baltimore City Council to restore the one-year requirement, and on Monday night Councilman Norman A. Handy, with strong support from Mr. Bell, introduced a measure that would do so. But that bill is not expected to gather enough votes.
Although Mr. Mfume moved last month from a suburban home into the city, he said in the interview that his change of residence had nothing to do with the new law or the mayoral race. And to those trying to read him for signals, he urged caution for now, saying, "I have been trying to run away from this for four months in a dignified, respectful fashion."
"And I appreciate people expressing support," he added. "But I am not a messiah."
With Mr. Mfume on the sidelines, the campaign leading to the September primary sputters on. Mr. Bell is regarded by many as the front-runner in an Mfume-less Democratic field, whose winner is all but assured of victory in the general election.
While Mr. Bell has announced plans to run, he has not yet filed with the city's election board, as candidates must by July 6. Five other Democrats have filed, including former Councilman Carl Stokes. But none of the campaigns have taken off, largely because Mr. Mfume's decision will have such a strong bearing on the field.
Mr. Schmoke, among others, predicted in an interview that if Mr. Mfume decided to stay out, other candidates might emerge, perhaps even William Donald Schaefer, who served a record four terms as Mayor before serving two as Governor and, last year, winning a four-year term as State Comptroller at the age of 77. Mr. Schaefer, who has been joined by former Mayors Clarence H. Burns and Thomas D'Alesandro 3d in urging Mr. Mfume to run, has offered no public sign that he is seriously interested in returning to City Hall.
As for Mr. Mfume, he said he began to consider the race in earnest last Friday, sounding out his five sons, ages 25 to 30. In a perfect reflection of his own ambivalence, two urged caution, he said, while two encouraged him to run and one expressed uncertainty.
In the weeks ahead, Mr. Mfume said, he intends to "pray on the issue" and discuss it further with his family before meeting with the N.A.A.C.P. board next month in Miami.
After that, he said, he will announce his decision.
Mr. Bond, the association's chairman, who lives in Washington, says he has been following developments only through published reports. Those developments include a draft movement that he called "certainly impressive." More than 250 city leaders, including 11 City Council members and a handful of state lawmakers, endorsed Mr. Mfume's candidacy in full-page newspaper advertisements last week.
"We would hate to lose him," said Mr. Bond, who expects to meet privately with Mr. Mfume next week. "But the institution is bigger than any individual chairman or C.E.O. It would take a search, but we would find a replacement."

HEADLINE: Two Convicted In Spying Case

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio, April 29

 BODY:
Two Taiwan executives who paid an employee of the Avery Dennison Corporation to pilfer corporate secrets from the United States adhesives maker were convicted of economic espionage on Wednesday in the first case tried under a United States law designed to combat trade-secret thefts.
Jurors in Federal court in Youngstown deliberated for about 18 hours over three days before finding P. Y. Yang, chief executive of the Taiwan-based Four Pillars Ltd., and his daughter, Hwei Chang Yang, guilty of economic espionage. 
 The pair were acquitted of mail fraud charges. Four Pillars itself was also convicted on the espionage charges. The Yangs were accused of paying Ten Hong Lee, a senior research engineer at Avery Dennison, $160,000 over eight years to obtain adhesive formulas and innovations developed by the company, which is based in Pasadena, Calif. Four Pillars and Avery Dennison compete in the Asian adhesive-label market.
The Yangs each face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and $250,000 in fines for violating the espionage law. Four Pillars could be fined up to $5 million. United States District Judge Peter Economus has not set a date for the Yangs' sentencing. He allowed the Yangs to remain free on bond. Avery Dennison's shares rose $3.0625 today, to $67.125, on the Big Board.

HEADLINE: Greenspan's Advice for Emerging Nations

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, urged central banks in developing nations today to manage their foreign exchange reserves more efficiently to help prevent financial crises.
In a speech at the World Bank, Mr. Greenspan suggested central banks in emerging economies would be well advised to follow a basic rule of thumb: hold a sufficient amount of reserves to survive for at least one year without additional borrowing. 
 "The Asian financial crises have reinforced the basic lesson that emerging-market economies should pay particular attention to how they manage their foreign exchange reserves," Mr. Greenspan said.
He also urged developing nations to beef up their disclosure policies and provide financial markets with more detailed information on their reserve positions.
Mr. Greenspan recalled the examples of South Korea and Thailand, where the Asian financial crisis started in 1997. The lack of detailed information on their reserves had "contributed to misperceptions by market participants of resources available to the authorities" to defend their exchange rates and, thus, encouraged speculative attacks against their currencies, he said.

Jockeys Sign For a Dollar And a Dream

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON 

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky.

 BODY:
THE rain left town and the sun came out and it finally felt like spring, like Kentucky Derby week at Churchill Downs. But for a couple of hours yesterday, the race became secondary for about half the jockeys in the 20-horse field. The potential winnings, from tomorrow's 125th running of the most famous horse race there is, mattered less than a few jars stuffed with one dollar bills.
The jars sat on tables set up under the grandstand, out by the paddock, affixed with yellow stickers asking autograph seekers for a suggested donation of $1. At a time when people attach gross inflationary value to almost anything with an athlete's signature scribbled on it, this was a bargain in the name of benevolence. 
 The cash would go straight into the Disabled Jockeys Fund, a collection that doesn't require much explanation, only a heart. The Jockeys Guild stages a number of promotional events around the country to help stock the fund, which was begun in the early 1990's and supports those who have lost livelihoods and limbs in the matter of a horse's misstep.
"There are about 2,700 jockeys registered nationwide, and there were 2,500 reported injuries last year," said John Giovanni, the Guild's national manager and secretary. "Most of the jockeys know it's not a matter of if, it is a matter of when."
Then the only question is how bad it will be.
"You want to complain when you fall off your horse and you wind up losing the hearing in your right ear, like I did, but who do you complain to when you see people who never got up again to walk?" said Kent Desormeaux, last year's Derby and Preakness winner aboard Real Quiet, who tomorrow will ride the touted filly Excellent Meeting for the trainer Bob Baffert, unless she runs today in the Kentucky Oaks.
Desormeaux's time came in December 1992, riding Judge Hammer at Hollywood Park. He fell in the lead, which made him an obstacle to the field. The last horse to pass kicked him in the head. He awoke 30 hours later, would get to see the son his wife was soon to give birth to and would reclaim his career and come within a nose of a Triple Crown in the Belmont Stakes last June.
The 51 disabled jockeys currently under the care of the fund weren't as lucky. They lost their careers, their ability to walk. A jockey named Linda Hughes was recently confined to a wheelchair after a fall at Calder Race Course in Florida. She has a daughter to raise, a $100,000 on-track insurance policy for her medical costs and a weekly $200 disability check. The money goes fast, and the unforeseen needs pile up, and that is when a hand reaches into the fund and then out to help.
Stephanie Young, a disabled jockey who lives in Louisville, had a baby recently and bought a van, but couldn't afford the $18,000 it cost to make it disabled-ready. The money came out of the Disabled Jockeys Fund, as did a new furnace this past winter for another former jockey in the middle of an Idaho blizzard. "Part of it is basic life needs," Giovanni said. " But we don't just want our disabled jockeys to survive. We want them to think: 'I can get out. I can travel.' "
I remember going to a pre-race chapel once at the Daytona 500, looking around at all the famous Nascar drivers, with their wives next to them, kids on their laps, and thinking that only a strong sense of community, of trust, could make bearable the occasional late-night dread. Professionalism does not allow race car drivers or jockeys to dwell on danger, but it is always there. The Disabled Jockeys Fund, Desormeaux said, is as much an insurance policy as it is philanthropy.
After winning his first Derby in 1993, aboard Sea Hero, Jerry Bailey stopped a sponsor who was awarding him a brand-new car in mid-sentence to say he was donating it to the Disabled Jockeys Fund. Bailey, Desormeaux, Pat Day, Shane Sellers -- the most recognizable riding names in the sport -- signed yesterday for cash, not for profit. A dollar wasn't much to ask, especially in the context of what contemporary sports owners and other athletes too often demand.
Some fans dropped a dollar or two in the jars. Many more did not. "People are people," Desormeaux said. "Some care, some don't."
After last year's close Triple Crown call, Desormeaux was kept at his post long after the others had gone. He signed every last program and card, until there were no more. His jar was three-quarters full when it was removed, its contents dumped into a large bag. Richer for his effort, Desormeaux walked off, in the midafternoon sun.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
After 7 Years, East Side Condominium Is Selling Quickly

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
The Gotham, a 239-apartment building at 170 East 87th Street, at Third Avenue, was designed as a condominium. But its opening in 1992 was buffeted by the ups and downs of Manhattan's housing market, and for the last seven years it has been used mostly as a rental building.
Now a real estate partnership headed by the sons of one of the original developers has bought the 151 unsold apartments and put most of them back on the market for sale. 
 In February, Arthur W. Zeckendorf and his brother, William Lie Zeckendorf, along with their partners, Starwood Capital Group and the Whitehall Street Real Estate Fund, which is managed by Goldman, Sachs & Company, bought the units, 100 of them unoccupied, for more than $71 million in cash. They range from 650-square-foot studios to 2,000-square-foot four-bedroom apartments, and they can be combined. Since sales reopened two weeks ago, 50 units have been sold at an average price of $500 per square foot. The partners paid $279 a square foot for the apartments, Arthur Zeckendorf said.
The $500-a-square-foot sales price is significantly higher than the $350 per square foot the units were offered for almost a decade ago. But it is consistent with the price of existing Upper East Side condominiums and lower than that of new ones, which are selling for an average of $800 to $900 a square foot, brokers said.
The seller in the Gotham deal, which also included 50,000 square feet of retail space, was the original lender, Fuji Bank, which held a loan of $90 million on the 27-story building, and Tobishima Properties of Manhattan. Tobishima developed the $200 million tower with partners, including Arthur and William Lie Zeckendorf's father, William Zeckendorf Jr., but ultimately bought out their interests after the Gotham opened in 1992 and had sold 88 units before the market soured and buyers vanished.
Since then, the unsold apartments have been rented, with rare exceptions. Last year -- with the economic crisis in Asia, the building's loan due to mature in 1999 and the condominium market improving -- Tobishima and Fuji decided to stop renewing leases and sell all 151 unsold units as a group, rather than sell them to individual buyers.
"The bank was ready to exit the project," said Darcy A. Stacom, an executive director at Cushman & Wakefield, the national brokerage company that handled the sale for the seller. As one of the last large blocks of units to come onto the market, the sale "drew heated bidding from investors hungry for new product," she said, adding that the new owners had outbid 12 other investors.
William Lie Zeckendorf said that buying the units "in a well-located building we knew gave us the ability to get out of the gate quickly and offer product at a price well below the cost of new construction."
Arthur Zeckendorf added, "It also offers instantaneous feedback to buyers who can move into the units within 20 days." The brothers are co-presidents of Zeckendorf Realty, a real estate services company that had managed the Gotham and still does. The company is also the project's sales agent.
Timing is also on the side of the sales campaign, since demand outstrips supply for condominiums and co-ops in Manhattan in general and on the Upper East Side in particular, brokers said. There are "multiple offers for one property, bidding wars and overbidding," said Joanne Douglas, a vice president at the Corcoran Group, a Manhattan brokerage. She added that the Gotham, which "has nice-sized apartments at competitive prices, should do well."
Prices at the Gotham, which have been raised an average of 5.5 percent since sales began two weeks ago, range from $237,000 for a studio to $1.4 million for a four-bedroom apartment. The average price for a 1,400-square-foot, two-bedroom is $675,000 and is $880,000 for a 1,706-square-foot three-bedroom.
Arthur Zeckendorf said the apartments at the Gotham, many with terraces or balconies and some on two levels, were being marketed to young single professionals and couples, empty-nesters and families. He said the remaining 51 units would be put on the market in the next nine months as their leases expired.
Among the amenities in the building are indoor and outdoor children's play areas, a fitness center and an indoor pool. Monthly maintenance charges are $349 to $1,692 and real estate taxes, thanks to a city abatement that is seven years into its 10-year life, are $134 to $1,161, a month. When the abatement ends in 2003, monthly taxes will rise to $189 to $1,627.
Doreen and Hernando Courtright, who have two children, are moving from their three-bedroom rental across the street to a four-bedroom at the Gotham, created by combining two units. "Last year, we looked in East Side neighborhoods in the 70's and 80's, but we thought prices were prohibitive," Mrs. Courtright said. "Then we saw that the units at the Gotham were available and the price was in our ball park."

HEADLINE: Wage Growth In '99 Below Expectations

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
Despite declining unemployment and a shortage of workers in some industries, wage and benefit increases slowed markedly in the first three months of the year, the Government reported today.
The Government's broadest gauge of compensation, the employment cost index, rose just four-tenths of 1 percent in the first quarter, the Labor Department said. The quarterly increase -- the smallest since the index was created in 1982 -- was half what economists had been predicting, and showed that compensation growth has now slowed for two consecutive quarters even as joblessness has declined to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent. 
 The slowing was driven to some degree by a steep decline in bonuses paid to Wall Street executives following last fall's financial market turmoil and a decline in commissions earned by real estate agents as the housing market cooled.
A number of industries, including construction and retailing, showed accelerating wage gains, indicating that tight labor markets are benefiting some workers. And as they have since 1996, workers are still enjoying wage gains after accounting for inflation, a turnabout from long stretches in both the 1980's and 1990's when wages were stagnant or falling in inflation-adjusted terms.
But the overall slowing trend in compensation costs was pronounced in the first quarter, analysts said, and was in line with a slowdown in another key wage indicator, hourly earnings. With inflation dormant, the trend highlighted a conundrum that has economists and policy makers at the Federal Reserve scratching their heads: Why has the combination of steady growth and low unemployment not forced a run-up in wages and then prices as history and traditional economic models suggest it should?
"It does not appear to be a fluke," said Stuart G. Hoffman, an economist at the PNC Corporation in Pittsburgh. "No matter how you slice it or dice it, the story is the same, that total compensation and wages in particular have actually been rising more slowly in the face of a declining unemployment rate over the last several quarters."
The report suggested that there were no inflationary pressures building in the economy and that compensation costs were unlikely to squeeze corporate profits. Bond prices and blue-chip stocks rallied, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up 32.93 points, to 10,878.38, its third consecutive record close.
The four-tenths of a percent increase in the employment cost index in the first quarter followed a seven-tenths of a percent rise in the fourth quarter of last year and a nine-tenths of a percent jump in each of the two previous quarters.
The figures showed a 3 percent increase in wage and benefit costs for private industry in this year's first quarter compared with the same period last year. That was down from a 3.5 percent year-to-year comparison in last year's fourth quarter and a 3.8 percent increase in the third quarter.
Wage growth in private industry was up 3.3 percent in the first quarter compared with the period a year earlier.
Overall compensation costs were also held down by a decline in the growth of benefit costs. Benefit costs were up just three-tenths of a percent in the first quarter, half the rate of the previous quarter, belying predictions that resurgent medical costs would lead to increased health care expenses for businesses.
To a large extent, economists said, the explanation for the slowdown in compensation appears to rest with the realization among employees that inflation is no longer eating away at the purchasing power of their paychecks. Consumer prices last year rose only 1.5 percent, meaning that even a 3 percent wage increase still puts them ahead of the game.
"We're seeing nominal wages being pulled back down by lower inflation expectations," said James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. "Both workers and companies were surprised by how low inflation was last year, due in part to lower oil prices."
With wages in private industry having grown 3.9 percent last year and inflation at 1.5 percent, workers enjoyed a real wage increase of 2.4 percent last year, the best in two decades, Mr. O'Sullivan said.
At the same time, companies are making extra efforts to hold down their costs because intense global competition has left them with little ability to raise prices to maintain their profit margins. When they do agree to wage increases, they often demand flexibility from workers in helping the company be more efficient and productive.
Increases in the last several years in the rate of productivity growth have helped companies to absorb higher compensation costs without putting undue pressure on either prices or profits. Economists are debating whether the absence of inflation results from temporary factors like low oil prices, cheap imports and weak economies in much of the rest of the world, or some fundamental improvement in the economy's capacity to grow and create new jobs without igniting inflation.
At the Wisconsin Central Transportation Corporation, a small rail line serving the upper Midwest, 300 locomotive engineers recently approved a union contract that gives them a 3 percent pay increase this year and 2 percent next year. The pay increase was coupled with an agreement to formalize flexible staffing rules that allow the rail line, which is trying to build a business on tracks abandoned as unprofitable by bigger carriers, to respond to the needs of its customers.
"The wage increases we're talking about here are above the rate of inflation," said Ann G. Thoma, a spokeswoman for the railroad. The local union representative, Ken Davis, said he was "very pleased with the result."
When the United Steelworkers of America agreed to a deal with the RMI Titanium Company in Niles, Ohio, this month, it concentrated on winning improvements in its pension package and in job security. The pay increase was 50 cents an hour for five years, or a little over 3 percent a year for a worker earning $14.50 an hour. RMI is a unit of USX.
"It's a modest wage increase that keeps us up with inflation," said Ray Raschilla, the unit chairman of the union's Local 2155-7. "We had a lot of issues that needed to be addressed quickly, and to be honest it would have been too expensive to hit every area."
Wage increases are being held down, especially in manufacturing, by a persistent fear among workers about losing their jobs despite the strong economy, said Calvin A. Campbell Jr., chairman and chief executive of Goodman Equipment, a maker of mining machinery in Bedford Park, Ill. Unemployment may be low but the pace of layoffs in many industries is high, he said.
"Obviously sometimes you have to find someone with a particular talent, and you may see some wage pressure there," said Mr. Campbell, who is chairman of the National Association of Manufacturers. "But that's in the minority. Growth is slowing and a lot of companies will be cutting back or not expanding. Fewer workers will have a tendency or desire to jump jobs."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Investors Show More Interest In REIT Stocks

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

 BODY:
Until now, Warren E. Buffett's best-known real estate gamble was on a bank.
In 1990, his Berkshire Hathaway bought a big stake in Wells Fargo amid a California real estate slump. The bank did not break out of the real estate quagmire for two years, and Mr. Buffett later acknowledged that he had not foreseen the severity of the problem even though his investment ultimately paid off handsomely. 
 Now, the Omaha billionaire is betting on real estate again. And investors are left to wonder if he has correctly spotted the bottom -- this time in real estate stocks -- or if he is early again.
Mr. Buffett has spent more than $50 million, much of it in personal funds, on shares of four REIT's, with three purchases disclosed this month. REIT's, the publicly traded companies that own shopping centers, apartment complexes, office buildings and other properties, have been in the doldrums even as rents and real estate values strengthen across much of the United States.
But they are coming to life. News of Mr. Buffett's purchases, and a broad rebound in cyclical stocks that tend to soar with the economy, has pushed REIT indexes about 10 percent higher in the last month, the first good news for real estate shareholders since the sector peaked in 1997.
Despite the sudden shift, real estate stocks look cheap by some measures. For example, the stocks in the Standard & Poor's big company index are trading at about 34 times their earnings. For the last dozen years or so, that multiple has been about 1.5 times the average REIT's funds from operations, an industry measure similar to cash flow. The stock multiple is now more than three times the real estate average.
Investors pulled money out of real estate mutual funds every week for four months, but reversed course in the week ended April 21, pouring about $80 million into these funds, according to AMG Data Services, an Arcata, Calif., mutual fund researcher.
Part of the attraction is the relatively high yields -- on average, at least two percentage points more than on Treasury notes. Wall Street analysts anticipate double-digit profit growth at many real estate trusts this year. This means yields will remain strong, since REIT's pay out 95 percent of their taxable income to shareholders every year to avoid taxes.
REIT's could still get hurt if the economy stumbles. But few analysts expect problems anytime soon. Corporate earnings continue to be surprisingly strong, and many economists have pronounced the fallout from the financial crises in Asia, Russia and Brazil to have passed. Meanwhile, commodity prices have stabilized -- a bullish sign for real estate and other assets that perform well with higher inflation.
The current environment is similar to that at the bottoms of the last six REIT cycles, says Bob Steers, co-manager of the Cohen & Steers Realty Shares fund. Over the last three decades, he says, the average bear market for real estate stocks lasted 14 months and share prices declined by about one-quarter. Before the April rally, the stocks had been in a slump for a little longer and had declined a bit more.
"When the group is ready to move, it's ready to move because it has been oversold," Mr. Steers said..
Among the big real estate funds without high minimum investment requirements, top performers for the three years ended in March include Longleaf Partners Realty, with a 10.7 percent annualized return; Cohen & Steers Realty Shares, 9.3 percent; Fidelity Real Estate Investment Portfolio, 8.4 percent, and CGM Realty, 8.3 percent. All figures are from Morningstar Inc., the fund tracking company in Chicago.
Even after the recent rally, analysts say shares in REIT's are mostly trading for less than the total that their properties would sell for piecemeal. As a result, some real estate trusts are diverting cash that would normally be used to buy properties to buy back their stock. A few have even sold assets and used the proceeds for stock buybacks. Archstone Communities, a REIT in Englewood, Colo., which owns apartment buildings, sold property and repurchased $84.4 million in stock in February and March.
Since the beginning of last year, REIT's have announced that they will buy back $2.9 billion of their stock, compared with just $861 million in announced buybacks during the previous eight years combined, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data in Newark. CRA Real Estate Securities, a money manager in Radnor, Pa., counts 36 REIT's that have announced buybacks since last summer, and those have so far repurchased, on average, about 44 percent of the shares authorized.
Some managers are doing more than partial buybacks. An investor group led by the company's chairman recently won a battle to acquire Berkshire Realty outright for $12.25 a share, or a 26 percent premium to the stock's price before the buyout offer. And a group including the chief executive of Sunstone Hotel Investors, a hotel operator based in San Clemente, Calif., has offered to acquire the company for $9.50 to $10 a share, about 35 percent more than what the stock sold for earlier this year.
Meanwhile, Mr. Buffett recently disclosed that he had increased his stake in MGI Properties, a Boston real estate trust, to 10.3 percent, as the company nears liquidation. MGI's management decided last year that it should sell everything and distribute the cash to shareholders because of its low stock market valuation. The sale is now expected to generate $29 to $30 a share, almost one-third more than MGI shares fetched last summer, when the plan was disclosed. Shares closed yesterday unchanged at $27.5625.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Nasdaq Slump Casts a Pall Over the Broader Market

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Nasdaq stocks slumped for the third consecutive session yesterday as investors took profits in high-technology shares, casting a further pall over the market in general.
While some money was redeployed into issues sensitive to the business cycle, helping push the Dow Jones industrial average up 32.93 points, or three-tenths of a percent, to 10,878.38, its fifth record in seven trading sessions, traders and analysts seemed increasingly cautious. 
 "If technology continues to erode, I don't think there's much to bail the market out," said John R. Peluso, head of listed equity trading at Lehman Brothers.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 21.93 points, or nine-tenths of a percent, to 2,528.44. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 8.08 points, or six-tenths of a percent, to 1,342.83.
Contributing to the sober mood was the fact that stocks responded scarcely at all to a Government report that employers have been exceptionally successful in holding down wage and benefit increases, a development that also bodes well for the Federal Reserve's efforts to keep inflation at bay.
Interest rates retreated along a wide front but the stock market seemed oblivious. "You had an incredibly bullish employment cost index which in most other times would have shot the market up a couple hundred points," said Thomas M. Galvin, chief strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
Moreover, Mr. Galvin found that a favorite short-term indicator showed the market to be "overbought" because the percentage of New York Stock Exchange issues trading above their 10-week moving average climbed above 70 percent at this week's calculation. Last week it was 64 percent.
"Stocks to me are beginning to look tired," he said, predicting prices will stay in a tight range for the next six to eight weeks until the trend of second-quarter corporate profits becomes clearer.
Even so, financial stocks rallied. J. P. Morgan rose 2 3/16 , to 138; Citigroup increased 2, to 76 5/16 , and American Express climbed 2 5/16 , to 135 3/8, accounting for the bulk of the Dow's gain. At one stage the blue-chip gauge, which was paced by Exxon's 3-point surge, to 84 1/2, had been up by nearly 83 points.
Some cyclical stocks moved higher, with Alcoa reaching a new high of 65 5/8 before closing up 2 11/16 , to 64 11/16 . But some other stocks sensitive to the business cycle, like International Paper and DuPont, gave back some recent gains amid predictions that the recent popularity of this group would wane. International Paper fell 1 1/8, to 56 1/4; DuPont slid 3/4, to 72 3/4.
"The rotation into cyclicals is going to prove to be short-lived," said Philip J. Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management. He doubted they could sustain earnings growth in a disinflationary climate.
Among high-technology shares, Amazon.com skidded 25 1/4, to 168 1/4, after losing 12 3/8 on Wednesday. The biggest Internet retailer warned of wider losses as it spends heavily on promotion and new services. America Online eased another 1 5/8, to 141 3/8, as investors took profits after its strong profit report.

Treasury Prices Rise
 (By Bloomberg News)
Bond prices rallied after a Government report showed the smallest quarterly rise in labor costs on record, suggesting inflation will not accelerate soon.
The price of the benchmark 30-year bond rose 25/32 , to 96 1/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.52 percent from 5.58 percent. Yields on two-year notes fell to 4.95 percent from 5.01 percent.
Traders bought bonds after a report showed the employment cost index -- considered one of the best measures of wage and benefit costs -- rose four-tenths of a percent in the first quarter, the smallest increase since the Government began tracking the figure in 1982.
The report signaled that economic growth and a tight labor market are not creating a big rise in job costs that could lead to higher prices on goods.
Other investors are loading up on higher-yielding corporate debt as the vigor of the economy brightens the outlook for company profits and credit quality.
The Sprint Corporation led borrowers that sold about $5 billion of debt yesterday. The nation's No. 3 long-distance phone company sold $3.5 billion of bonds, increasing its sale by 17 percent because of strong demand.

HEADLINE: U.S. Approves Deal for Taiwan To Buy Radar to Monitor China

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
The United States has decided to sell an early-warning radar system to Taiwan that will allow it to monitor the launch of Chinese ballistic missiles or manned bombers, Clinton Administration officials said today.
The decision has already drawn protests from Beijing and was opposed by a group of mid-level Administration officials who argued that it would worsen recent tensions between Washington and Beijing. 
 The Administration approved the sale at the recommendation of senior policy makers from the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon, who said that China's deployment of large numbers of short-range missiles along its coastline posed a serious military threat to Taiwan, officials said.
The Defense Department, in a report to Congress earlier this year, said: "Taiwan's most significant vulnerability is its limited capacity to defend against the growing arsenal of Chinese ballistic missiles."
The radar system, which could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars in business to American defense contractors, will give Taiwan several minutes' warning of the launch of ballistic missiles on the mainland.
"I'm pleased that the Administration has finally recognized that it is appropriate to help the Taiwanese protect themselves," said Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, who heads the House International Affairs Committee. "If China is pointing missiles at Taiwan, I would expect Taiwan to try to defend itself."
Earlier this month, Mr. Gilman, a New York Republican, threatened to introduce legislation to permit the sale if the Clinton Administration refused to approve it.
He said in an interview that the Chinese had no reason to be concerned about the sale of the radar "because they're the ones putting the missiles along the coastline in the first place."
The spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, Yu Shuning, said that the embassy had already issued a formal protest to the Clinton Administration over the decision. The deal was first reported earlier this week by news organizations in Taiwan.
"We have made serious representations with the U.S. side," Mr. Yu said. "We say that any arms sales to Taiwan by any country in the world constitutes an infringement on Chinese sovereignty, an interference in our internal affairs."
Beijing considers Taiwan a breakaway province and fears that early warning systems could become part of an anti-missile defense system proposed by Washington that could shelter Taiwan.
Administration officials said opposition to the sale of the radar was voiced by mid-level officers at the White House and State Department who said that it would needlessly provoke China at a time when tensions are already high over trade disagreements as well as allegations of Chinese nuclear espionage in the United States.
But they were overruled. A senior Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that top policy makers at the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon all agreed that the sale should be approved.
"I think there was a fairly good meeting of the minds on this," the official said. "We have told the Taiwanese that we will meet their legitimate defensive needs. And a passive early-warning system is clearly a legitimate defensive need."
Administration officials said there was still no agreement with Taiwan over exactly what type of radar system would be approved, which companies would build it, and how much it would cost.
"This was an agreement in principle," the senior official said. "There wasn't a decision on a specific system." The contractors thought likely to be asked to bid on the contract include Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Thomson-CSF of France.
Taiwan's Government said in a report in February that it had determined through intelligence sources that China had deployed more than 100 ballistic missiles that could be fired across the Taiwan Strait at the island. The Taiwanese have cited the intelligence in arguing the need for development of a missile-defense system.
The agreement on the radar system was reached during talks with senior Taiwan military officers who were in Washington this week on an annual arms-buying tour.
Under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which was passed by Congress after the United States broke off formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan and established ties to Beijing, the United States agreed to provide the island with the weapons to defend itself from attack by Beijing.
The Taiwan Government had no comment today on the radar sale. A spokesman for the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in Washington, which serves as a de facto embassy for Taiwan here, said that the Clinton Administration had requested that it not issue any statement on the agreement.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Spies and Character

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
How come they can do it right here in America and how come our Government does not take action when the crimes are discovered?
The woman next to me at dinner was asking the question all Americans should ask about China's continuous and successful nuclear espionage against the U.S. -- how come? 
 So far only one or two people have been named as suspected spies, who got hold of thousands of pages of secret American information on nuclear weapons -- one of the great espionage coups of our time.
But it is almost comical -- any belief that one or two men could find out exactly where the information was, what data to search for and in what priority, how to extract it from lab computers without getting caught, and the names and access codes of the companies in America that are fronts for the Chinese Government and Chinese Army.
Historians will be writing books about Beijing's counterparts to the Soviet spy rings in America, and the Cambridge treason crowd in Britain.
The Clinton Administration, which for years ignored early tips on the espionage, now stalls on releasing information gathered by a committee headed by Representative Christopher Cox of California. But I expect pretty soon the investigation teams of The Times and other papers will break the story of the spy rings plural and their contacts plural. Read the excellent article in the May issue of The American Spectator by Kenneth R. Timmerman, one of the experts read by other experts.
But still -- how come these made-in-China spies? The answers are essential not only to understanding the espionage case but the character -- the precise word -- of President Clinton's problems about other critical realities, from Lewinsky to Kosovo.
For almost all its time in office the Administration has preached and practiced a policy toward the Chinese Government that he had denounced before he was elected the first time but soon adopted, widened and made more dangerous to American interests and ideals.
The policy is that the only way to get China to behave itself, and not do nasty things like engaging in nuclear espionage and torturing political and religious prisoners, is to build up U.S.-China trade. Like his American business mentors and our foreign allies, the President calls it the policy of engagement.
It is, it is -- engagement with China's Communist Politburo, not with the Chinese people.
The Administration uses an old trick to fight American people and organizations who still want what he supported before assorted C.E.O.'s and political donors got to him -- the use of economic leverage to squeeze human rights concessions out of the Politburo. Mr. Clinton falsely accuses them of the fatal weakness of his own policy -- playing only one note on his saxophone.
When the Chinese take the trade money and tell the world to get lost about human rights, or go in for nuclear espionage in America, the President has a choice. He can remain a prisoner of Beijing by insisting he is right. Or, he can break out of his cage by admitting error and returning to the mixture of realism and idealism he had promised Americans, to get the votes of those who cared.
But somehow I doubt he will ever do that. I think he really believes that evasion, falsehood, stonewalling, listening to the music of the cash register and not of the soul, stalling -- about Monica or about espionage -- are the instruments of government and the path of self-preservation. I suppose they are, for him.
They worked to save him from impeachment. They were useful in helping Americans forget the promise he once spoke into my own little ears -- not to send troops to Bosnia.
They are not quite working to save him from world realization that neither he nor the other NATO brains ever thought that Slobodan Milosevic would be so crass as to use NATO bombing as the right moment to drive out the Albanians, turning the war into a disaster for Albanians, NATO, Americans and Serbs who positioned themselves under the bombs.
He will not change his character, nor the fact that character of a President determines character of Presidential policy. He has not yet said that espionage by his Chinese captors is good for America. But he has a year and a half of Presidential time left to figure how to break the news.

HEADLINE: N.J. Prosecutor Is Accused Of 'Profligate' Overspending

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, April 29

 BODY:
Since taking office a year ago, the Essex County Prosecutor, Patricia A. Hurt, has increased staff salaries by more than $500,000 a year and purchased a huge $248,541 customized mobile command post, and is now asking the county for more money to cover extra expenses, top county officials said this week.
James W. Treffinger, the Essex County Executive, termed the spending "wasteful and profligate" and said that Ms. Hurt's office had already exceeded its current $23.4 million annual budget. 
 The charges of excessive spending come on the heels of widespread criticism of the way in which Ms. Hurt's office handled the investigation into the shooting of an Orange, N.J., policewoman on April 8. The Prosecutor's office arrested three men during the course of the investigation, including one who was held for six days and then cleared of charges and another who died in custody.
Mr. Treffinger, a Republican who once appointed Ms. Hurt as his top deputy, said of the money request that "there should be an investigation of such wasteful spending."
"Her contention is that it is needed to fight crime," he said, "but as many instances of profligate spending demonstrate, the money has been misused."
Purchase requisitions and other analyses over the last year reveal that Ms. Hurt has overspent her budget with the increase in staff salaries and the purchase of the command post: a recreational vehicle fitted out with radio equipment, fax machines, television, microwave oven and coffee maker. No other prosecutor's office in the state has such a vehicle, law enforcement officials said.
In addition, the invoices show that Ms. Hurt ordered new office appointments when she took over in January 1998, including a $120 leather wastebasket, a $496 leather blotter, and a $1,958.45 refrigerator with a cherry finish in Victorian style. In a building that has central air conditioning, she also ordered an $800 air conditioner on wheels.
Purchase orders obtained by The New York Times from county officials indicate also that in ordering her official vehicle, a Chevrolet Tahoe, she requested options that raised the cost nearly $7,000 over the base $26,500 price recommended in state contracts with vehicle vendors.
The office then caused an additonal $1,340 to be spent to remove some of the options initially requested. There was no indication on the purchase orders as to why the optional equipment was removed.
In addition, according to personnel records, Ms. Hurt hired Vincent C. Corrado, a longtime county employee without a law degree, as a $90,000-a-year chief of staff, a position not found in any other prosecutor's offices in the state, Mr. Treffinger said.
Repeated attempts to interview Ms. Hurt about the spending were unsuccessful. Her spokesman, Ray Weiss, told The Times that she would not grant an interview unless she received questions in writing, in advance.
Ms. Hurt has been in an extended budget battle with Mr. Treffinger and the Essex County Board of Freeholders since a short time after taking office early last year. At that time, she asked for additional money and received $1.4 million more than the initial allocation for the office. In her budget request for next year, Mr. Treffinger said, Ms. Hurt sought $4 million more than her current budget. Mr. Treffinger has refused the additional money and instead is directing her to stay within the $22 million budget that was in force the year before she took over.
"Last year I had several conversations with her to urge her to institute efficiencies and economies, and she took great offense to my suggestions," said Mr. Treffinger.
On three occasions, he said, the prosecutor sought the Attorney General's permission to institute a lawsuit to wring more money from the county budget, which was $506 million for the 1998-99 fiscal year, which ends in June.
Under New Jersey state law and court precedent, prosecutors are allowed to bring such lawsuits on the theory that their executive branch and law enforcement operations cannot be arbitrarily limited by county legislative bodies or county executives. But on all of those occasions, Ms. Hurt's requests to go into court were denied, said Mr. Treffinger, who added that he learned of the outcome from Ms. Hurt and others. The Attorney General's office was unable to confirm this allegation today.
The charges of excessive spending marked the sharpest political rift so far between Mr. Treffinger and Ms. Hurt, whom he had recommended to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman for the Essex County Prosecutor's post. By most accounts the relationship has been fraying for several months, not only over budgetary issues but also over the growing sense of disquiet about Ms. Hurt's management of the state's busiest prosecutor's office.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: CONGRESS;
House G.O.P. Adds Billions for Military In Balkans Package

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
House Republicans moved today to add billions in military spending to the package the Administration had requested for NATO's air war, one day after denying the President political support to fight the war.
The Speaker, J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, said "the Congress is deeply divided" over the fighting in the Balkans, a rare understatement during the skirmishing and sniping that erupted in Congress today over the political and economic costs of the attacks. 
 Tonight the House Appropriations Committee approved nearly $13 billion in emergency spending, $7 billion more than the White House sought to pay for military and relief costs in the Balkans. The committee chairman said the extra money was intended to address longstanding military needs and to "let the troops know we really support them."
The measure was labeled as "relating to the conflict in Kosovo." But President Clinton's budget director said it included billions for projects with "no relation to Kosovo."
Republicans pushing for the added spending, some of whom now speak of the conflict as "Clinton's war," said they saw no contradiction in voting to reject a measure supporting the fighting while voting for money to finance it.
They called the extra billions a small down payment toward beefing up the post-cold-war Pentagon. Some angrily accused Mr. Clinton and the Democrats of bleeding the American arsenal and leading the nation into a military morass. "These are the same chicken hawks who vote against defense all the time," Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, said in an interview. "Not only is their President getting us in a mess, but he's undermining our military."
Democrats bitterly accused Republicans of sabotaging foreign policy after Wednesday night's unexpected 213-to-213 House vote defeating a nonbinding resolution to express support for the bombing campaign. Democratic leaders, who had attached great symbolic importance to the measure, said the vote could encourage President Slobodan Milosevic to think the United States and its allies were weakening.
In a show of unity today, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen and Gen. Hugh H. Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared at the regular Pentagon briefing to criticize the House vote and emphasize NATO "solidarity."
"I think a vote signaling less support on the air campaign is counterproductive," Mr. Cohen said. "But we will continue to wage this effort and we will continue to take this case to the American people, and we will continue to go after Milosevic until such time as we achieve our goals."
The minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, said the vote marked "a low moment in American foreign policy" and "a betrayal of everything America stands for." To follow that vote with a move to add billions to military spending was hypocrisy, he said.
"It is mind-boggling that some of the same members that voted against the operation will today vote to double the spending," he said.
In the House Appropriations Committee, Republicans and a handful of Democrats who usually support increases in military spending approved a $12.9 billion emergency bill. It more than doubled the $5.1 billion Mr. Clinton sought to pay for military operations in the Balkans through Sept. 30. His request also included money to pay for the patrolling and bombing of Iraq.
In an interview Jack Lew, Mr. Clinton's budget director, said House Republicans were "going too far."
"They're exaggerating the costs of the Kosovo operation and they're funding things that meet no one's definition of an emergency," he said.
The House spending bill added nearly half a billion dollars in bombs and missiles the Pentagon did not request. It would also finance more than $1 billion in military construction projects, mostly in Europe, and $1.8 billion in pay increases for military personnel.
The law says emergency spending must be restricted to "unanticipated" and "immediate" needs. The chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Representative C. W. Bill Young of Florida, said the bill met pressing military demands, would cover hidden costs of the Kosovo conflict and would show that Congress "stands behind our troops."
"The Administration's record in anticipating the costs of military deployments is pretty sad," he said. "We were supposed to be in the Balkans for a year, at a cost of $1.5 billion. Five years later, it's $9 billion."
The bill could be voted on by the full House next week, he said. A Senate vote would come the following week.
If such a bill arrives on the President's desk, he does not have to take it or leave it, Mr. Young said. He can decide that any given item within the bill is not an emergency and withhold his approval for that project. The money would go unspent.
"It all depends on what your definition of 'emergency' is," Mr. Young said. "That's a phrase that should be familiar to the White House."
The Senate is also struggling over two bills that would finance the conflict and urge the President to achieve victory over Yugoslavia.
The Senate Appropriations Committee has drafted a $12 billion spending bill for the war. But at least six senators, all fiscal conservatives, say they are loath to vote for a bill far in excess of the President's request, especially since the money would come from excess Social Security revenues, which they have sworn to protect.
And the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today canceled a meeting to consider a resolution offered by a bipartisan group led by John R. McCain, an Arizona Republican, and Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Delaware Democrat, that would authorize the President to use "all necessary means" to win the war -- an authority Mr. Clinton has not sought.
Mr. McCain, a presidential candidate, is invoking a provision of the 1973 War Powers act that could guarantee a vote on the Senate floor next week. But the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, is seeking to delay that vote, his aides said. He is also exploring alternatives, like the measure passed by the House on Wednesday, blocking the President from undertaking a ground war without a go-ahead from Congress.
Nancy Ives, an aide to Senator McCain, said he would wait for two weeks, as long as he is guaranteed a vote on the use of force in the war.

Bombing Unites Serb Army As It Debilitates Economy
The NATO bombing that was intended to cripple and demoralize Slobodan Milosevic's military machine has instead invigorated the Yugoslav Army and has helped him heal his long-poisoned relationship with the officer corps, according to American and NATO officials. But the raids are destroying the country's civilian industrial capacity and public works, including its highway, rail and communications networks. A1 

House Republicans moved to add billions in military spending to the bill for NATO's air war, the day after denying President Clinton the political support to fight it. A1
 
NATO expressed regret that a missile had strayed into the outskirts of Bulgaria's capital, Sofia; no one was reported killed. The Bulgarian Parliament is preparing to vote on whether to give permission to NATO to fly over the country for operations against Yugoslavia. A12
 
A Russian-led peace initiative for Kosovo appeared to make little headway, with Moscow and the West divided over the composition of any international force in Kosovo. A12
 
Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said the Pentagon was providing 10 additional B-52 bombers to NATO forces that would be used for the first time to drop conventional bombs on Serbian military targets, as well as to fire guided missiles. A12
 
The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson and a group of American religious leaders arrived in Belgrade. A14
 
U.S. to Sell Radar to Taiwan
The United States has decided to sell an early-warning radar system to Taiwan that would let it monitor the launching of Chinese ballistic missiles or manned bombers. A1
 
Nuclear Espionage Case
A scientist suspected of spying for China tried to hide evidence that he transferred nuclear secrets out of a computer system two days after he failed an F.B.I. polygraph examination in February, officials said. A6
 
Computer Virus Author Named
The author of the Chernobyl virus that caused hundreds of thousands of computer meltdowns around the world was identified as Chen Ing-hau, a Taiwanese computer engineering student. A10
 
Sharon Indictment Reported
Israeli radio and television reported that the police had recommended that Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon be indicted on charges of fraud, bribery and witness-tampering. A16
 
No Declaration of Statehood
Palestinian leaders decided against declaring statehood on Tuesday, defusing a volatile situation by retreating from a pledge that the Israelis saw as a threat. A17
 
Speaking Out in Turkey
Turkey's highest-ranking judge has surprised the country by sharply condemning restrictions on freedom of speech. A5

Mars Magnetism Suggests A Geology Like Earth's
An ancient magnetic pattern in the surface of Mars appears to show that the planet in an early epoch churned with internal heat and other powerful forces, remarkably like the geology of Earth today, scientists said. The finding added to a body of evidence suggesting that Mars and Earth started out much alike, then evolved into very different worlds. A1
 
Parasites, Not Pollution
At least some of the frog deformities that symbolize fears of an ever more poisoned environment are caused not by toxic substances but by parasitic worms, scientists said. A22
 
Home Test for Liver Virus
The F.D.A. has approved the first device for home testing for the dangerous liver virus hepatitis C, which affects about 4 million Americans. A24
 
'Dolphin-Safe' Rule Changed
The Commerce Department is broadening the definition of "dolphin-safe" tuna to include fish caught by a method banned in 1990. The decision drew outrage from many environmental groups. A18
 
Link to School Gun Explored
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold got the high-powered, semiautomatic pistol used in the Columbine High School massacre with the help of a fellow pizza parlor employee, law enforcement officials in Littleton, Colo., said. The worker, who officials believe acted as an intermediary, has not yet been charged. The Denver Post said the owner of the gun said a former employee had sold it for him at a gun show. A26
 
The idea that juveniles and adult criminals buy their weapons from legitimate sources is a finding developed only in the past three years and contradicts what was the widely accepted view, that they steal their guns. A26
 
The last of the victims' funerals was held, for Isaiah Shoels, a 4-foot, 11-inch football player and the only black victim. A26
 
A 14-year-old boy was charged with murder in Canada, a pipe bomb was found in an Oklahoma school, five Brooklyn youths were charged with conspiracy, a New Jersey school district ordered closings because of E-mail threats, and districts across the nation were on heightened alert. Nine days after the Littleton shootings, there were new reports of threats, of schools evacuated, of police officers patrolling hallways, of young people being arrested or suspended on suspicion of plotting to blow up their schools or to kill or maim classmate they considered enemies. But actual violence and real bombs have been rare, law-enforcement officials and educators say, and what has been stalking the schools is an inordinate fear of death. A1
 
The Courting of a Candidate
Kweisi Mfume, left, the former Democratic Congressman and now head of the N.A.A.C.P., is under growing pressure to run for mayor of Baltimore in November and succeed Kurt L. Schmoke. A18

Subway Suspect's Statements
A homeless man accused of pushing a man into the path of a subway train has a history of mental illness and told detectives that he spent the day roaming the streets, convinced that people were trying to kill him, a police official said. The victim was in critical but stable condition. B1

HEADLINE: A Learning Experience For a Prominent Visitor

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
Cheyenne Phillips, a kindergartner at Public School 107 in Flushing, Queens, rushed through her lunch yesterday, chewing almost nonstop, in anticipation of a matinee performance of "Peter Pan." She had never been to a Broadway show before. "But I saw a commercial for it on TV," she quickly offered.
Her benefactor was a man in a gray suit, Michael Goldstein, who paid for tickets for the school's disabled children as well as for her mobile prone stander -- a contraption with big wheels that allows her to move around while standing upright. Cheyenne cannot walk or stand because of spina bifida. 
 While it is primarily a neighborhood school, about 140 of its 1,100 children come from throughout Queens and have physical or learning disabilities. Mr. Goldstein, the chairman of Toys "R" Us, hooked up with P.S. 107 three years ago when he was asked to serve as Principal for a Day, in a program that links celebrities, politicians and business leaders with public schools across the city to promote public education.
Yesterday, 1,050 "principals," ranging from the actors Frances McDormand and Billy Baldwin to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton, spent the day in one of 880 New York City schools.
Officials at Public Education Needs Civic Involvement in Learning, or Pencil, the organization that has run Principal for a Day since 1994, said that many of the people who have acted as principals have developed ongoing relationships with their schools. Some, like Mr. Goldstein, have written checks. Others, like Norma Kamali, the designer, and Mickey Drexler, the chief executive officer of the Gap, have created student internships.
Many do nothing more than return for commencement at the end of the year. And there is an occasional gaffe, like the time Donald J. Trump offered to buy students free Nike sneakers, prompting one to ask why he was giving shoes when he could afford scholarships.
"While we encourage people to give, we certainly don't expect anything," said Lisa Belzberg, president of Pencil, who estimated that principals for a day have donated tens of millions of dollars. "Our notion is that the system is enhanced by contact with the private sector and vice versa. And if all it means is you look at a kid on the street differently the next day, then we've done our job."
If that is the case, she can consider Mr. Goldstein a huge success.
Mr. Goldstein is a product of the New York public schools himself: he is a graduate of Jamaica High School, and his two daughters, now adults, attended public schools in Queens and in Rye in Westchester County. One is now a guidance counselor in the New York City school system.
He has flipped from being a careful skeptic three years ago to a believer in the system. "I expected the worst," he said. "I thought there would be chaos and teachers who were working but not giving their all, and instead I saw just the opposite."
So in addition to helping develop the school's program for disabled children, Mr. Goldstein proselytizes his corporate buddies on the need to contribute to public schools. "It'll take money to get the class sizes down," he said, "and with the economy doing so well, this is the time to do it."
Mr. Goldstein has donated about $35,000 -- a combination of his own money and funds from the Toys "R" Us foundation, the Children's Benefit Fund -- toward equipment and programs for the disabled children at P.S. 107.
The children in Gale Criss's fourth-grade class bounced with energy yesterday when he walked into the room and started to talk toys. Dozens of hands shot up when he asked about favorite toys. "Ooh, Pokemon!" "Star Wars!" "Nintendo!" Mr. Goldstein listened attentively as the children heatedly debated the merits of Nintendo 64 versus Sony's Playstation.
He smiled sheepishly when some children asked for an autograph as he headed out the door. "They don't need my autograph," he said. "I just enjoy being with them."
And he's not ashamed to take careful note of the children's opinions on toys. "We spend millions on market research," he said. "But they're the ones who really know."

HEADLINE: Repsol Pursues Buyout of Argentine Oil Concern

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
In a deal that would create the world's eighth-largest oil company, Repsol S.A., Spain's largest oil company, said yesterday that it was offering $13.4 billion in cash to buy the 85 percent of YPF, the Argentine oil company, it does not already own.
Repsol, which paid $2 billion in January for 15 percent of YPF, said it would pay $44.78 a share in cash for the rest of YPF, a price that Repsol said was a 25.4 percent premium over yesterday's closing price for YPF shares on the Buenos Aires stock exchange. 
 Whether that price will be high enough for the bid to succeed was questioned by several oil analysts yesterday afternoon as rumors about the deal, which had been circulating for weeks, drew attention on Wall Street a few hours ahead of the announcement by Repsol. The rising price of oil -- $18.53 a barrel yesterday in New York, up from $11.78 just 10 weeks ago -- should make YPF shares rise in value, these analysts said.
The combined company would have half the gasoline-station market in Argentina and would be a major force in Peru, Ecuador and Brazil, Alfonso Cortina, Repsol's chief executive, said last night in a telephone call from his office in Madrid.
"We are going to create an integrated, world-class oil company," Mr. Cortina said, with enough cash flow that the company will be able to pay back the added debt it will take on to make the purchase by the end of 2000.
Mr. Cortina said that "we can commit to our shareholders to increase our earnings per share roughly 20 percent from 1998 to 2002" and that return on assets should rise from 11 percent now to 15 percent by 2002.
The new company will be highly leveraged at first, with 30 percent equity and 70 percent debt, most of it an unsecured bridge loan at floating interest rates that makes the company vulnerable to a sudden upturn in interest rates or a sharp drop in the price of oil. By the end of 2000, however, the company's debt should be between 48 percent and 50 percent of the combined company's capital structure, Mr. Cortina said. To pare down debt, he said, about $2.5 billion worth of YPF assets will be sold and a new issue of stock, intended to raise $4 billion to $6 billion, is being arranged with Goldman, Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Salomon Smith Barney as the lead underwriters.
YPF, whose formal name is Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales, was founded in 1922 as the first state-owned oil company outside the Soviet Union. For seven decades it was known as the only oil company in the world that lost money as Argentine dictators drained it of both products and cash to subsidize other state-owned enterprises and to prop up unrelated YPF businesses, from hospitals to movie theaters.
YPF was privatized between 1990 and 1993. Its payroll of 50,000 workers was cut to 10,000, and unprofitable operations were sold. YPF is already the largest private oil company in Latin America and the largest private company of any kind in Argentina.
Mr. Cortina acknowledged that there was strong opposition in the management of YPF to Repsol taking charge, but he said he was confident that he could win over the key personnel.

Unions to Protest Cuts, Vouchers and Workfare

 BODY:
New York City union leaders announced yesterday that they would hold a rally on May 12 to protest the budget policies of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki.
At a news conference on the City Hall steps, the leaders said the rally would protest Mr. Giuliani's workfare program and his plan to use vouchers to send students to private schools, as well as Mr. Pataki's plans to reduce spending on education and health care. They said the rally, to be held outside City Hall during the evening rush, would attract tens of thousands of union members, including hundreds bused in from upstate. 
 "It is time for Mayor Giuliani to stop slashing the budget and reinvest city surpluses in services and programs that will benefit both our economy and working families," said Brian M. McLaughlin, president of the New York City Central Labor Council.
Dennis Rivera, president of 1199, the National Health and Human Services Employees Union, said, "We will be marching to say no to Giuliani and Pataki's attempt to cut funding for schools, health care and jobs."

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE MILITARY;
Bombing Unites Serb Army As It Debilitates Economy -- Yugoslav Rift Heals, NATO Admits

BYLINE: By BLAINE HARDEN and STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
The NATO bombing that was intended to cripple and demoralize Slobodan Milosevic's military machine has instead invigorated the Yugoslav Army and has helped him heal his long-poisoned relationship with the officers corps, American and NATO officials say.
The senior military and intelligence officials said that more than five weeks of bombing had rallied the Yugoslav Army to the defense of their country, sharply increased the willingness of recruits to serve in the military and given senior army officers a mission that they finally feel is legitimate. 
 The relationship between Mr. Milosevic and the senior officers had been soured by 10 years of distrust and purges, delayed paychecks and prosecutions for treason. The bombing has provided those officers and the Serb leader with a common enemy, NATO.
"The 'rally round the flag' effect in Serbia has been profound," said a Government official who has been studying the Balkans for a decade and attributes the change in army morale to the NATO bombing. "It is not Slobo's war. It is the army defending the country."
Despite public assertions that the bombing is going well, intelligence reports provide a far less sanguine assessment. Longtime observers of Yugoslavia in the American Government said in a series of interviews that the Yugoslav Army in Kosovo had escaped crippling materiel damage and significant casualties by dispersing its units well before bombs began to demolish their bases, barracks and fuel depots.
The NATO campaign has also had the unwanted consequence of helping to restore the Yugoslav Army to the respected position that it enjoyed before the violent collapse of the Yugoslav federation began in 1991. Then the army was the primary glue holding Tito's multinational union together. As such, it was systematically weakened and humiliated by Mr. Milosevic to suit his nationalist ends -- until NATO's bombing changed his defense needs.
The campaign has had only "a marginal effect" in diminishing the capacity of Yugoslav contingents to force ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo or carry out attacks against insurgents from the Kosovo Liberation Army, one official said.
The Supreme NATO Commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, insisted in Brussels this week that the bombing had hobbled Yugoslav air defenses and was wearing away the resources of Mr. Milosevic's armed forces. But General Clark also acknowledged that despite the bombing, "you might actually find out that he's strengthened his forces in there."
American officials in Washington went considerably farther this week. They characterized as "greatly exaggerated" claims by Western leaders and NATO commanders that the bombing had damaged Yugoslav Army morale and hampered the ability to conscript troops.
In Serbia, the army's image seems to have soared, most noticeably in Belgrade. Many capital residents had lost respect for the military because of its failures in unpopular ethnic conflicts in Croatia and Bosnia. But the army is now regarded as the defender of the nation.
"Yugoslav males did not want to get sucked into the fights in Croatia or Bosnia," said an American military official who has long experience in the region. "But indications are that young men are responding to the draft now and in significantly higher numbers than in the past. After five weeks of bombing in Kosovo, they are saying to themselves, 'Gosh, we are still standing.' It is easy to march to the drum if you don't think you are going to get killed."
NATO and Pentagon commanders maintain that the air war is slowly but steadily taking apart the Yugoslav military. They say the Air Force has been disabled and essentially grounded, especially after strikes overnight against aircraft found at an airfield in Montenegro. They concede that the Yugoslav Army is holding up relatively well, but pledge that the intensifying campaign will grind away its forces and morale.
"If they're not feeling it yet to the full extent, they will in time," a senior American military officer said. "These are hearty people. They're used to a certain amount of suffering. You're not going to crush their morale in 30 days. They're going to have feel some real pain before they collapse."
A factor in the army's success is that its commanders knew that they would have to absorb punishment and, the experts said, they prepared well for it.
When the bombardment began on March 24, the Yugoslav Army had built up its forces in and around Kosovo. It relied on a large number of reservists and conscripts to fill out a force of 40,000, including 24,000 army troops and 16,000 military police officers.
The initial barrages focused almost exclusively on air defenses. By the time that NATO turned to army targets, including barracks, staging areas and headquarters, the those complexes had been emptied.
NATO and the Pentagon, one officer said, now believe that five weeks of bombing have caused casualties that number only "in the hundreds."
By the time General Clark asked for and received approval to intensify the strikes at the end of last month, the army and police units had routed the Albanians from most Kosovo villages and towns.
Then they hunkered down. Some have dug into defensive positions along the Kosovo borders with Albania and Macedonia. But most have dispersed, moving in relatively small units that are much harder for NATO's high-flying planes to strike.
"They're hiding their vehicles whenever they can, staying under cover, staying relatively immobile -- No. 1 to cover themselves from air strikes and, No. 2, to conserve fuel," a senior military official said.
Last week, the Pentagon estimated that NATO attacks had destroyed 10 to 20 percent of the 300 tanks that the Yugoslav Army has in Kosovo. To put it another way, that leaves 80 to 90 percent intact, by the Pentagon's count.
Although officials say the attacks have limited Yugoslavia's ability to mount effective military operations, the army does not have to mount offenses, at this point, having completed its campaign in Kosovo.
It simply has to hold on to the defensive positions that it has on the ground, which it could do indefinitely, as long as the army's soldiers remain motivated, despite the destruction of fixed targets like headquarters and barracks, officials said.
"It will be a while before you have any wear and tear on the foot soldier," a senior military officer said. "It's hard to do that with air power alone. That's the lesson of Vietnam. We pounded Vietnam and we never did stop the supplies along the Ho Chi Minh trail."
The Yugoslav armed forces, although badly overmatched, have effectively used churches, schools and hospitals to shield troops and equipment against strikes by pilots who are under orders to avoid killing civilians.
"They've taken their strengths and applied them against our weaknesses," a former Western military attache to Belgrade said. "They know our loathing to lose pilots, and they've used their air defenses in a way that exploits that."
Intelligence reports indicate that the army is still able to dispatch fuel to its forces, although there are widespread shortages and rationing for civilians. Although the railway and bridge destruction has made transporting fuel much more difficult, two senior defense officials said the army was still shipping gasoline in small convoys of six-axle trucks, bypassing destroyed routes or building makeshift river crossings.
The ability to improvise and endure underscores how the war has revitalized the army officer corps.
Many officers have long grumbled about and, in some cases, flatly opposed the wars that Mr. Milosevic prosecuted in Croatia and in Bosnia. In the course of those conflicts in the early 90's, he shifted resources from the army, which has historically seen its mission as one of protecting the nation from outside aggression, to the more loyal and more pliable Serbian police.
Police officers are now significantly better paid and have better housing than army officers. The changes caused enormous morale problems among an officer corps that plucked its recruits from villages, trained them in guerrilla warfare in special schools and largely insulated them from the country's chronic economic problems.
Mr. Milosevic also purged scores of senior army officers to find generals who were willing to command troops that work with the police in savage attacks on civilians. Midlevel army officers have long questioned the professionalism of the loyalists, while quietly voicing doubts to Western military officers about the future of the army.
But American Government experts on the region said this week that the bombing of Yugoslavia had silenced the grumbling and erased the doubts, at least for now, while handing the army a mission that officers perceive as legal and just.
"Either by dumb luck or a stroke of genius, Milosevic has given the army a direction," said the American military official who spent time in the region. "Militaries respond well to crises. When you talk to senior Yugoslav Army officers, they always speak of the Constitution. They will talk about defending their borders against external threats and defending the country against internal enemies. It is not much of a stretch for the army to take the situation on the ground in Kosovo and feel they are doing the right thing."
Partly as a result of that, the army appears to have moved to the dominant command position in the war.
"The NATO campaign has put the Yugoslav Army in first place in the institutional command for the first time this decade," said James Gow, a specialist on the Yugoslav Army who teaches war studies at Kings College in London.
Military analysts, in and out of the United States Government, voice no doubts that a large NATO ground force could make short work of the out-of-date tanks and artillery pieces that would be the pillars of the Yugoslav Army defense.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page subheading on April 30 about the impact of NATO's bombing campaign on Yugoslav forces misstated the alliance's position. While some NATO officials said the bombing had helped President Slobodan Milosevic heal his long-poisoned relationship with the officer corps, that was not NATO's formal position and NATO did not "admit" that the bombing had healed the rift.
