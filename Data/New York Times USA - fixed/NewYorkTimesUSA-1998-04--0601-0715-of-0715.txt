HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Weary Hands At the Throttle

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: LIVONIA, La.

 BODY:
FOR the Union Pacific Railroad workers crowded between shifts into a motel break room here, beetles crunching under their work boots, nights and weekends never arrive. And almost everyone has stories about their schedules.
Consider the conductor who departed Houston at 8:40 P.M. on a recent Thursday. So many other trains were trying to use the same rails that his 12-hour shift, the federally allowed maximum, brought him only 80 miles, just a third of the way to Livonia, a bayou town a couple of parishes west of Baton Rouge. 
 With no choice but to halt, the conductor was stranded more than three hours until a van came to his rescue. It took nearly five hours more to reach the motel here.
Dispatched back to Houston late on Saturday morning, he arrived shortly before midnight. After a few waking hours with his wife, he was back on duty just before noon on Sunday. This time he made it closer to the Livonia rail yard, but not close enough. Stranded again, a van driver dumped him at the motel at 2:15 A.M. Monday.
Even in normal times, to work on the railroad is to enter a world apart. Its schedules, culture and grimy, clangorous locales, where a slip or stumble can end a career or a life, make conductors and engineers a hidden brotherhood. It is an existence that outsiders, especially families, often cannot understand.
But at the Union Pacific -- the line established by Congress and Abraham Lincoln to span the continent -- these are not normal times. A 1996 merger with Southern Pacific to form the nation's largest railroad caused what regulators call an unprecedented breakdown in rail traffic through the heart of America that has lasted more than 10 months.
In recent weeks, Union Pacific made enough progress in clearing out its Houston rail yards that schedules for many of this area's crews improved from impossible to merely exhausting. But then clogged traffic at the Laredo, Tex., gateway to Mexico backed up trains all the way to Kansas, forcing an embargo on many shipments and extra-long days for other crews.
Now that trains are rolling more smoothly through Laredo -- the embargo ended on Tuesday -- Gridlock Central has moved again. Today it's in the railroad's busiest region, around North Platte, Neb., where coal trains bound for steel mills, chemical plants and power stations are jamming the tracks. Maintenance improvements are under way, but a needed set of extra rails is not even scheduled to be completed until next year.
Economists say the losses for the nation total billions of dollars, and some customers, like Dow Chemical, have sued the railroad. Richard K. Davidson, Union Pacific's chairman and chief executive, had predicted prompt recoveries so often that he no longer dares to set any date.
But for Union Pacific workers, the costs are immediate and personal. Wives and children become strangers. During brief visits home, no plans can be firm. And Federal investigators, in findings that the railroad disputes, list mismanagement and worker fatigue among the prime causes of crashes that killed nine workers last year.
Seeing how the merger went so wrong takes no M.B.A., no fancy title, only the recent experience of trying to run a Union Pacific train. Engineers and conductors say they watched the railroad's managers try to squeeze the deal for every possible economy and efficiency. But when a brisk economy kept freight traffic rising, there were far too few supervisors, locomotives or crews.
"There are too few of everybody for what they're trying to do," said an engineer at the Oak Tree Inn, the motel here. "They're trying to put 10 pounds of taters into a five-pound sack."
THE company acknowledges as much. "I am acutely embarrassed, and our company is embarrassed, at the time it has taken to recover from our congestion crisis," Mr. Davidson told the Surface Transportation Board, a regulatory agency, earlier this month. "Decades of prior experience told us that our projections were correct. But reality has been telling us something else."
Mr. Davidson took a two-thirds pay cut last year, to $961,000, as profits dropped 41 percent.
Like other railroad executives, he resists most demands from rail customers, unions and members of Congress for renewed Government oversight. Since the railroads were deregulated almost two decades ago, critics say they have won unquestioning approval for mergers that have reduced competition and increased costs.
"The figures show that 90 percent of the shippers in the United States are now captive," said Charles R. Matthews, chairman of the Texas Railroad Commission. "That's why we're pushing the Surface Transportation Board for some policies that will encourage competition."
Union Pacific has responded to complaints over safety and service by agreeing to recruit thousands of new workers, though veterans say the inexperience of the new hires will present new risks. The railroad has also begun allowing workers to take a full 24 hours of rest after at least seven consecutive days of 12-hour-plus shifts. (Though Federal rules limit them to 12 hours operating a train, they are paid "limbo time" for any extra hours they are stuck away from home or from a motel.) Another breakthrough: a company test, in the St. Louis area, of whether letting workers nap on idle trains might help them avoid nodding off when they are moving.
For Union Pacific, to bend at all is unusual. With systems modeled on the military, the company has seemingly endless rule books, infraction codes and penalties, governing everything from the appropriate choreography for jumping down from a train to how closely workers can approach a running or stopped engine before inserting their earplugs. "Insubordination," or refusing a direct order, is grounds for dismissal.
In Livonia, a glorified rail crossing with two traffic lights, workers must sign out from the motel so dispatchers can always reach them. Their listed destinations are seldom farther than the 24-hour diner that shares the parking lot -- or its only competition, which operates from a kitchen at the gas station next door.
Yet Patrick Murphy, a conductor for a year and a half, swears by the need for rules. As the saying among his comrades goes, they are written in blood. He told of a fellow conductor who stepped off a moving train with the wrong foot first and paid for it with both legs.
"If you have an accident, it isn't a little accident," said Mr. Murphy, 28, a Houston resident who served seven years in the Navy before joining the Union Pacific.
Those rules make the rails a demanding mistress. Mr. Murphy explains that when his pager buzzes, he has 10 minutes to check in or face discipline. Whether at a restaurant, the movies or wherever, he said, "you've got to throw your date to the side and make that phone call." Once he explains that he is due at work at, say, 1 A.M., his dates are often ready to throw him to the side.
For all these rigors, conductors and engineers get two rewards. First is membership in a fraternity of those who can guide mighty chains of steel a mile or two long. "Like my dad says, 'The railroad is not a job; it's a way of life,' " said Cory Gravouia, a conductor and the son of a railroad engineer, as he finished a Sunday shift at the Livonia rail yard.
Second is pay that is about as good as blue-collar gets: usually $55,000 to $90,000 a year, including overtime, but $70,000 to more than $100,000 last year with all the extended shifts.
"Compared to jobs outside, the pay here is astronomical," said Terry Van Epps, an engineer, as he signed out -- or tied up, as railroaders say -- by computer at the Livonia rail yard office. With "limbo time," Mr. Van Epps's 12 3/4-hour shift earned him $338.90. And he rarely takes a day off.
For all the bread they put on the table, conductors and engineers are rarely there to break it, even in better times. "I lost my first wife because of the railroad," said an engineer with 27 years' service. He stepped behind the counter at the Livonia diner to pour his own coffee. "This is my home away from home," he explained. It was past 11 on a Sunday night, but with no days off this year, he often lost track.
"We see more of them than their wives," said a waitress, sliding in to one of the diner's booths for a break. The engineer poured her a cup, too. He told how he raised his daughter, 6 years old when her parents split, by hiring a niece who was just graduating from high school.
"I stayed divorced for 10 years," he continued. "I remarried, but it ain't working out either. She just doesn't understand."
Last year, workers in the Houston region, which stretches into much of Arkansas and Louisiana, reached their limits. They won their union's backing for a regional walkout, but a court ruled that safety and fatigue were not issues over which they could strike. In the railroad tradition of wearing company caps, they made up caps of their own with the red, white and blue Union Pacific crest -- and this motto: "Hello Houston. We Have a Problem."
If railroad workers only recently began to feel like the endangered crew of Apollo 13, their ranks had long been notorious for featherbedding. Well into the 1980's, freight trains had five men on board. Besides the engineer, at the controls, and the conductor, a co-pilot who manages the train and the paperwork, there were brakemen and switchmen. Women were, and still are, rare.
Union Pacific led the way in using technology to direct and monitor trains, lessening the need for large crews and eliminating cabooses. By the early 1990's, labor pacts had reduced the crews on long-distance trains to just two. Nationally, railroad employment fell to 256,000 by 1996 from more than twice that in 1980, as freight increased by nearly half.
Still, wimps need not apply. From Mr. Davidson, a 6-foot-4 former brakeman, on down, railroad workers are sized like their trains. When a train breaks in two -- it happens once or twice a day on the system -- the conductor must be ready to lug an 80-pound joint, called a knuckle, perhaps a mile or more.
Besides muscle, the work takes attentiveness and skill. Though long hauls across the open West can turn monotonous, engineers and conductors on other routes are busy every minute. Unlike jets, trains have no auto-pilot.
On a recent run through the humid dark from Lake Charles, La., to Houston, Alfred Deloach, the engineer, kept his thick hands on the throttle, horn or brakes. Mr. Murphy, his conductor, shouted to be heard above the roar of two engines and 6,000 horsepower.
Over a crackling radio, dispatchers relayed the conditions ahead and granted permission to proceed. Computerized track-side monitors beamed in their own cautions in the monotone of synthesized speech. Mr. Deloach, who also lives in Houston, adjusted his speed through curves, grades, bridges and patches where maintenance, delayed because of the congestion, forced him to go as slowly as 10 miles an hour. At his top speed of almost 50 miles an hour, stopping a train with 2 locomotives and 96 cars, weighing a total of more than 6,200 tons, would have taken at least a mile.
UNION PACIFIC doesn't own the Oak Tree Inn, but it might as well. Most nights, it reserves at least 34 rooms for its crews and fills the other eight, too. With its spartan but tidy rooms, the Oak Tree offers some of the company's better lodgings. Elsewhere, Federal investigators found dormitories the railroad owns in dangerous neighborhoods where workers were prey to thieves and vandals. One lodging in Arizona was so infested with insects that several crew members were treated for spider bites.
In talks with the Federal Railroad Administration, which enforces safety codes, Union Pacific has agreed to shut its worst dormitories.
On an inspection tour of Fort Worth and Dallas operations last week in a Chevrolet Suburban rebuilt to ride on tracks, Mr. Davidson recalled that when he began in 1960, the life was even tougher. The railroad provided no lodging, so he stayed at a Y.M.C.A. in Kansas, where weeds poked up through the wooden slats of the shower stall, or a 50-cent-a-night hotel. Other workers simply dug pits, covered them with tarps and crawled in.
Mr. Davidson, now 56, won rapid promotions, finishing a stint as supervisor of the Fort Worth yard in 1971. Last week, he found many older but familiar faces still around, with some younger faces familiar for their resemblance to their fathers.
FOR all the dislocation suffered by his company, tradition remains a common bond. "We've got a piece of track in Omaha, Neb., built in 1902," Mr. Davidson said in the inspection car. "They still call it 'the new cutoff.' "
While acknowledging the need for more modern labor conditions and manageable schedules, Mr. Davidson says none of the employee deaths last year resulted from overwork. In one, he said, an engineer fell asleep despite having had two weeks of vacation, and in another an engineer failed an alcohol test.
But among the crews here in Livonia, exhaustion shows. At dawn one recent Monday, conductors and engineers who had finished long overnight shifts paced the sidewalk beside the motel. They calculated and recalculated the odds of having a room open up sooner than vans could arrive to take them to another motel 45 minutes away.
The drivers of the vans and sport utilities -- carryalls, the vehicles are called -- are themselves so exhausted at times that their passengers choose the most alert among them to take the wheel. After his van driver repeatedly swerved across a yellow line a few weeks ago, an engineer based in Houston said, passengers ordered him to pull over and nap.
Rested or not, engineers and conductors can find themselves on unfamiliar routes without the necessary training. One engineer, waiting outside the Oak Tree Inn for a room after 17 hours of work -- counting 3 hours of waiting for a ride, then a 2 1/2-hour van trip -- told how he was trained on the Beaumont-Houston route by three managers who had never been there.
One was from Texas, at least; the others were from Wisconsin and Utah. They insistently enforced the rules on proper footwear and the proper timing, loudness and sequence of horn signals. "He didn't know where we were," the engineer said of the manager from Utah. "But he knew how loud to blow the horn."
The engineer, wearing a striped Casey Jones cap, recounted how he complained about the untrained trainers on a new safety hot line to the executive offices.
"Did you bring it up with your supervisor?" he was asked.
"I don't know who my supervisor is anymore," he answered. "I don't even have a phone number."
"Did you bring it up in a safety meeting?" he was asked.
"I haven't had a safety meeting since 1994," he said.
The woman who took his call promised to investigate and call back. She never did, the engineer said. Mr. Davidson said he had heard of no such lapses regarding safety complaints, which he said were followed up with local managers.
His employees, however, are fighting back with humor that, as in the old Soviet Union and now Russia, contrasts with cheery pronouncements from above. They speak of guiding trains by the calendar, not the clock. And they joke that the Ringling Brothers circus wanted to buy the company -- "not for the railroad; they wanted the clowns running it."
To fix what went wrong, many workers have the same answer as their customers. "I got a solution to this merger," said one engineer, waiting on the motel sidewalk for a room or a lift. "Just go back to the way it was."

For the conductors and engineers of the Union Pacific, schedules have varied so wildly amid the railroad's recent disarray that no week is truly typical. Patrick Murphy, right, a conductor, said one week last winter was better than others: he never had to spend an entire shift sitting on a stalled train. Chart lists Murphy's work schedule during the week. (Photograph of Patrick Murphy by F. Carter Smith for The New York Times)

Crime's Newest Cash of Choice

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
THE potential challenge that Europe's new single currency poses to the dollar's dominance of global trade and bond portfolios has been widely anticipated. Largely overlooked, however, is another threat: The Euro may edge out the dollar as the currency of choice in the world's huge underground economy -- and in the process end a highly profitable American monopoly.
The threat comes from a seemingly innocuous, little-noted decision by the European Monetary Institute to issue the Euro in some very large denominations, including 100, 200 and 500 Euro notes -- equivalent to $110, $220 and $550 bills at the expected rate of exchange. 
 These denominations are intended to mirror those of the German mark and thus make the new currency seem reassuringly familiar to those with doubts about monetary union.
But the big bills, says Kenneth Rogoff, an economist at Princeton University, will also have the presumably unintended consequence of offering Columbian drug lords, New York mafia bosses and Russian gangsters -- as well as garden-variety tax dodgers -- a superior vehicle for doing business and hoarding their ill-gotten gains.
"Giant bills will help the Europeans compete with the United States for these 'customers,' " says Mr. Rogoff. "We have these crummy $100 bills and they're going to have a $500 bill. You'll be able to smuggle a million in or out of the country in a purse instead of a suitcase."
Economists once believed that just 10 percent of all currency in circulation was tied up in the underground economy. Now it turns out that 80 percent is closer to the mark. Most of it is in $100 bills, which are the largest available and now account for well over half the value of the nation's paper money.
American banks and businesses hold very little cash. American households are also loath to keep much of it lying around. Yet according to the Federal Reserve there is enough currency floating around to make it appear that every American family of four has $6,000 or so in cash stashed under the mattress, including three dozen $100 bills. And despite the ubiquitousness of credit cards, A.T.M.'s and electronic transfers, the sea of cash has been growing much faster than the nation's gross national product.
As the issuer of dollars, America has been making out like a proverbial bandit. Having customers who want to hold your currency is like being able to get an interest-free loan. Economists call this seigniorage, a medieval French term related to droit du seigneur, or lord's rights; in this case it refers to the right to coin money. With $400 billion of its currency in circulation, the United States Government is earning $28 billion a year, or the amount the Government would have to pay if all that currency had to be replaced with Treasury bonds paying 7 percent interest.
Criminals prefer cash for the obvious reasons: it is anonymous, portable and easy to hide. For the same reasons, they prefer bigger bills to smaller ones. Until now, they have had an overwhelming penchant for dollars because there are so many of them, they are convertible anywhere and they are, relatively speaking, inflation-proof. But faced with the choice of an even better product, the Euro, criminals may well switch. And without the seigniorage from the underground economy, the United States would see a dramatic decline in revenue.
But perhaps the underground economy is one market the United States would do well to cede to a foreign rival.

Hey! Computers Go Faster Than the Courts.

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
EVEN the Justice Department acknowledges that its current antitrust case against the Microsoft Corporation may be outdated.
In a hearing before a Federal appeals court in Washington last week, Judge Patricia M. Wald asked whether the case was not about to be overrun by time and Microsoft's new products -- or, as she put it, "lost in a time warp." 
 A. Douglas Melamed, the principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Justice Department's antitrust division, candidly replied, "We don't know."
The exchange neatly captured the daunting challenge for antitrust policy in the digital age. Business tactics that seemed questionable, even incriminating, yesterday can be rendered irrelevant tomorrow by the rapid pace of technological change.
That certainly seems to be the lesson being learned in the Government's marathon pursuit of Microsoft. In the current case, the Justice Department sued the company last October for allegedly violating its consent decree with the Government by forcing personal computer makers to load its Internet browsing program as a condition of licensing Microsoft's industry-standard Windows operating system.
Internet software and commerce, in truth, were not the focus of the consent decree, which was signed by Microsoft and the Justice Department in 1994 and approved by a Federal court in 1995. The pact was mainly intended to keep the door open for rivals in the market for personal computer operating systems, or the software that serves as a computer's central nervous system.
 
Too Late
By the time the consent decree had been negotiated, however, the competition in the operating system market was effectively over: today Windows runs on roughly 95 percent of new PC's.
Robert E. Hall, a Stanford economist who advised the Justice Department on the consent decree, believes the curbs on Microsoft's marketing practices were good policy, but simply too late. "To really have fostered and protected competition in operating system market," he said, "it should have been signed in 1985 instead of 1994."
The current team at the Justice Department's antitrust division, led by Assistant Attorney General Joel I. Klein, inherited the consent decree. They understand the necessity of fleet-footed enforcement in high-technology markets.
In a policy speech last month, Daniel L. Rubinfeld, chief economist of the antitrust division, observed that once the Government decides to take action it is "important to move early and quickly."
In Washington and throughout the computer industry, attention is now focused on what action, if any, the Justice Department will take before Microsoft's next-generation operating system, Windows 98, is released to personal computer makers on May 15 and goes on sale in retail stores in June.
Windows 98 seamlessly meshes Internet browsing with the operating system. So the consent decree case now seems a "tempest in a teapot" as the Government scrutinizes a wider set of issues, said Carl Shapiro, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley and a Justice Department official.
This time, the Department is not worried about how Microsoft has obtained its dominant position in the operating system market. Its main concern is whether the company is using its control of the computer desktop to give it an unfair advantage in the nascent but fast-growing markets for Internet software and on-line commerce.
If the Justice Department decides to move, it could try to prohibit certain Microsoft business practices through a new consent decree or a broader antitrust case under the Sherman Act of 1890, which makes it illegal for a monopolist to use its market power to protect and expand its monopoly.
Looking toward a new antitrust case, the Government has been conducting an accelerated investigation since the start of the year.
In the last three weeks, the Government has issued new rounds of civil subpoenas to personal computer makers and taken new depositions from Microsoft. They are closely examining Microsoft's licensing contracts and its joint marketing agreements with PC makers, software makers and companies that run Internet Web sites for entertainment, news, travel services and on-line shopping.
Antitrust may be a turn-of-the-century doctrine, but the Government has dealt with issues remarkably similar to the ones posed by Microsoft in the not-too-distant past.
Take the claim that because Microsoft controls the first screen that people see when they turn on their computers, its Windows operating system is an "essential facility" for any company trying to do on-line commerce.
Owning that gateway to the Internet becomes intriguing to antitrust officials if Microsoft uses it to give an edge to its own Internet services.
Microsoft, for example, has given a favored place on the desktop to its World Wide Web travel service, Expedia -- an opportunity that the rival Travelocity service, run by the Sabre Group, says it was denied.
Sabre has first-hand experience with such matters, since 15 years ago it was in Microsoft's shoes.
 
Flight Simulator
Sabre is the computerized reservation system started by American Airlines. In the early 1980's, Sabre came under fire from rival airlines and Washington just as Microsoft is today, in a policy debate over computer screens and who determines the prime slots on that vital piece of information-age real estate.
Sabre put its computer terminals on the desks of thousands of travel agents and displayed its flights at the top of those screens -- a huge advantage because 90 percent of all bookings were made from the first screen.
American's rivals took their complaints to Washington. The Justice Department investigated. Congress held hearings. Eventually, the Civil Aeronautics Board issued rules saying flights on the reservations systems had to be listed by impartial criteria like time of departure or ticket price.
"We were certainly singing a different tune back then," said Bruce Charendoff, executive director of government affairs for Sabre. "The common issue in both cases is market power. As history has shown, if you have it, you use it -- unless you're restrained."

For Tracks, the Glue Factory

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
NEXT Saturday, the annual hoopla surrounding the Kentucky Derby will briefly elevate horse racing to the major television networks and the front pages of newspapers.
Then, just as quickly as the thoroughbreds bolt around the storied track at Churchill Downs, racing will sink back out of sight. For all of its glamour and pageantry, the singularity of the Run for the Roses underscores a stark reality: Horse racing is dying in America. 
 There are any number of reasons for racing's downward spiral. Infighting kept the racing industry from exploiting television with the deftness that rescued once moribund sports like basketball. There are also far more alternatives for a nation hooked on public spectacle and the pleasures of vice than there were when the first Kentucky Derby was held in 1875.
But the main reason horse racing may be a goner is that it can no longer compete with casinos and lotteries for the hearts and wallets of a new generation of gamblers.
Racing requires serious gamblers to weigh factors like the record and appearance of horses, the ability and expertise of jockeys and trainers, the condition of the track, the length of a race and the odds on each horse. Races are stretched out over a day or an evening, and thus lack the instant gratification and numbing simplicity that have made slot machines and scratch-off lottery tickets the darlings of modern commercial gambling. Wagering on the ponies is a relatively cerebral, slow-moving activity in a gambling era that now demands speed, ease and constant repetition.
"With the broadening of the gambling market, there has been an increase in the popularity of games that don't involve skill," said William Eadington, a professor at the University of Nevada in Reno and one of the country's leading authorities on gambling. "What does that say about how people like to gamble now? It says they like the adrenaline and they don't like the work."
Through the years, gambling has kept horse racing afloat as a broadly popular spectator sport. And betting losses have provided most of the revenue. Without gambling, interest wanes, tracks fail, and the network of horse farms and stables that feeds horses to the tracks has fewer places to parade the animals.
Go to Aqueduct in New York or Pimlico, the Baltimore track where the Preakness is run each May, for a glimpse of horse racing's future. Both of those tracks are seedy, faded relics that house row upon row of empty seats, frequented by handfuls of old-timers and dependent on the income earned from closed-circuit simulcasting of races to other locations. Arlington Park, one of the last major tracks near Chicago, was recently shuttered despite a $200 million facelift over the last decade and big purses intended to lure better horses. Dick Duchossois, the park's owner, cited competition from riverboat casinos now plying the waters around Illinois as the reason for his track's demise.
While glamour tracks like Saratoga, Del Mar and Churchill Downs may always retain niches in the gambling industry, overall track attendance is well below half of what it was 30 years ago. Some of the decline can be attributed to the growth of off-track betting and simulcasting, but profits there don't offset the losses at the track.
The biggest reason for the decline of horse racing is demographics. The core group of gamblers still following horse racing is aging rapidly and is not being replaced. Most gamblers under 50 see racing as a fossil best suited to the tastes of wizened geezers.
 
Chump Change
The money wagered on horse racing is chump change compared to the lucre that casinos and lotteries bring in. Between 1982 and 1996, the latest year for which figures are available, the "handle," or total amount gambled legally in America on horse racing, dropped to about $15 billion from $19 billion in 1996 dollars, adjusted for inflation, according to International Gaming & Wagering Business, a trade publication. Meanwhile, the lottery handle jumped to about $43 billion from an inflation-adjusted $6.5 billion over the same period and the casino handle skyrocketed to $501.6 billion from $164.9 billion.
"Casinos are much more convenient to get to now than they were in the 1980's," said Thomas Aronson, a former racing consultant who is now the vice-president of Television Games Network, a start-up company based in Broomfield, Colo. "Everyone has a casino within an hour's drive from their home."
Mr. Aronson said his company plans to counter the casino boom by beaming horse racing and betting into homes across the country via a cable television channel. Pending regulatory approval, bettors will be able to use a converter atop their television sets. Winnings and losses will be handled through prepaid accounts. The company said it has been successfully experimenting with the system in Louisville since 1995 and will roll it out nationally this fall.
Others in the horse racing industry have adopted an "if-you-can't-beat-'em-join-'em" approach. A few tracks, including Prairie Meadows in Altoona, Iowa, and Delaware Park, in Stanton, Del., have revived their fortunes by introducing slot machines.
Prairie Meadows, which opened in 1988 and filed for bankruptcy three years later, was barely breaking even when it emerged from bankruptcy in 1993. In 1995, it won the right to offer slot machines and has been raking in money ever since.
 
Searching for Slots
Last year, bettors lost about $177 million there. Only $50 million of that was on horses. Most of it was lost in slot machines, and many who bet on the horse races came to the track searching for slots.
"There's no way we would be where we are today without slot machines," said Tom Timmons, Prairie Meadows' chief operating officer. "But we didn't forget about horse racing. We're very proud of our horse racing."
But analysts like Mr. Eadington, of the University of Nevada, believe it will just be a matter of time before race tracks like Prairie Meadows expand their slot operations at the expense of racing because the profits are too great to ignore.
Even Churchill Downs has considered the introduction of video gambling machines at the venerable track. The action, prompted by the pending appearance of a riverboat casino across the Ohio River from Louisville, is just another reminder of how horse racing is being eclipsed in a gambling world devoted to sating bettors' need for speed.

Chart: "Losing Out to Casinos"
With the rise in alternative venues for gambling since the early 1980's, the handle, or money spent on wagering on horse racing, has dropped. Meanwhile, the amount spent on lotteries and in casinos has risen. Here are the totals spent on the three main forms of gambling in 1982 and 1996, in billions of 1996 dollars.
 
HORSE RACING: $19.0 billion (1982), $15.0 billion (1996)
LOTTERIES: $6.5 billion (1982), $43.0 billion (1996)
CASINOS: $164.9 billion (1982), $501.6 billion (1996)

DEALS
Consolidation Continues, As Do Consumer Worries
The Bank of New York joined the merger trend with an unsolicited $23.7 billion takeover offer for the Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh. Mellon, however, didn't want to play, and sued to stop the attempt. Still, the industry's consolidation fever is making citizens' advocates and some lawmakers nervous; they predict that the behemoth mergers will eventually mean higher checking-account and A.T.M. costs for many customers, especially those with low and moderate incomes. And they point to Federal Reserve studies indicating that when newly merged banks consolidate operations, the branch offices they close tend to be concentrated more heavily in poorer neighborhoods. . . . Airlines also got into the consolidation act, with American Airlines and US Airways announcing a marketing alliance. Delta and United were planning a similar deal, but suspended talks after pilots voiced concern over what the arrangement would mean for jobs.
 
INSURANCE
Managed Care's Higher Cost
For the first time since 1992, many employers are facing double-digit increases in the cost of health insurance next year, the highest inflation rate since the majority of employees moved into managed care. In early negotiations with employers about next year's rates, many insurers are seeking increases for 1999 that are far above this year's, when most premiums rose in single digits after four years of stability. Critics of managed care say the magnitude of the increases undercuts a basic appeal of that system: savings from lower costs.
 
VIAGRA
Impotence and Writer's Cramp
In only its second week on the market, Viagra, Pfizer's impotence drug, accounted for 79.2 percent of the new prescriptions written for the condition, causing the market shares of its competitors to plunge, according to I.M.S. America, a health care information company. With 36,263 new prescriptions for Viagra written in the week that ended on April 10, the introduction was one of the best ever for a drug. Some analysts estimated that prescriptions written last week might have totaled 40,000 a day.
 
WINDOWS
The Crash of 98
William H. Gates, the Microsoft chairman, was trying to put Windows 98 through its paces at the Spring Comdex computer show in Chicago last week when things sort of fell apart. First, he couldn't get his microphone to work. Then, gasp, Microsoft's latest operating system crashed. "I guess we still have some bugs to work out," Mr. Gates observed. "That must be why we're not shipping Windows 98 yet." Undaunted, Microsoft later reported earnings that surpassed analysts' expectations.
 
JAPAN
We Export, Therefore We Are
While Japan's slumping stock market and banking industry tell a story of a nation in crisis, many citizens paint a different picture. "People complain about the bad economy," says Mitsuo Okura, who lives in a small town 200 miles southwest of Tokyo. "But when I look around the house, I've got everything I want. I've got three cars, and most families around here have two or three as well. I've got a couple of televisions, and so do most people. I've got a washing machine, a refrigerator, and so do all my neighbors." All that despite the fact that his auto parts business is failling. In part, Mr. Okura can thank Japan's trade surplus for his good fortune; it jumped almost 57 percent in March from the period a year earlier. Another perspective: Japan had more than 17,000 business bankruptcy filings in 1997, but the United States had more than 54,000.
 
JOBS
Americans Hire Foreigners . . .
As the information technology industry lobbies Congress to let more highly skilled foreign workers enter the country, new immigration figures indicate that the companies applying for the most visas are using them for the kind of jobs that critics say many Americans could easily be trained to perform. The designation H1-B is used for work visas intended for hard-to-fill jobs. But the company that imported the most foreign labor under the program last year was Mastech Systems of Pittsburgh; it received visas for 1,733 employees -- or about 80 percent of its domestic work force -- to bring in software programmers with only bachelor's degrees. "This is not brain surgery," Representative Ron Klink, a Pennsylvania Democrat, said of the jobs being filled by foreign workers at companies like Mastech. "These jobs do require some skill and intellect. But American workers can be trained to take these jobs." By the way, United States jobless claims rose in mid-April.
 
MORE JOBS
. . . Foreigners Hire Americans
Foreign companies are creating jobs in the United States five times faster than American-owned companies, according to a study by a trade group. The Organization for International Investment, a Washington trade association for 60 foreign companies with American operations, found the largest concentration of such jobs in California, though Nevada was the leading state in job growth from these investments. The number of Americans working for subsidiaries of foreign corporations increased from 2.03 million in 1980 to 4.9 million in 1995, the latest year for which statistics are available, the trade association said.
 
EARTH DAY
Apathy Doesn't Pay
Though President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore took note of Earth Day by doing some repair work on the Appalachian Trail on Wednesday, they seem to be in the minority these days. "There's been a precipitous decline in the demand for environmental improvement," according to Grant Ferrier, publisher of The Environmental Business Journal in San Diego. "Environment is not in the top five public priority issues. From 1970 to about 1990, usually, environmental issues would come in the top three." Companies that help businesses comply with environmental regulations have felt the effects of the trend: Of 3,305 environmental service companies operating across the nation in 1994, one-fourth were out of business two years later, according to a survey by Environmental Information Ltd. of Minneapolis, which compiles a directory of such firms. The reasons included increased competition, cuts in government programs, fewer new regulations and a relaxation in the enforcement of rules already on the books.

HEADLINE: Alexander Papamarkou, 68, An International Financier

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

 BODY:
Alexander Papamarkou, a philanthropist and international investment banker whose clients included royalty, industrialists and major institutions, died Thursday at St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital in New York. He was 68 and lived in Manhattan.
The cause of death was a heart attack, his family said. 
 Mr. Papamarkou founded the Papamarkou & Company investment firm in New York. He began his career on Wall Street in 1961 as a broker at Oppenheimer & Company and had also been a vice president of E. F. Hutton before establishing his own firm.
Last month, he established a research chair in honor of his father, the Plutarchos Papamarkou Chair of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases at Rockefeller University. Last year, he financed the Harissios Papamarkou Chair in Education at the Library of Congress in honor of his grandfather, a prominent Greek educator. He also financed both the Central Park Conservancy and an endowment at the New York Philharmonic in memory of his mother.
Born in Athens in 1930, Mr. Papamarkou was the son of a physician who was a research scientist and minister of public health. Mr. Papamarkou traveled extensively and was fluent in Greek, German, English and French. His professional and charitable activities reflected his interest in international affairs.
Early in his career, Mr. Papamarkou served in the Greek Government for two years as director of the Ministry of Industry, until 1957.
More recently he was involved with the United Nations and the Onassis Foundation, for which he served on the international prizes jury.
Mr. Papamarkou graduated with honors from Athens College in 1948 and came to the United States that year to attend the Maxwell School of Public Affairs at Syracuse University, where he graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor's degree in public affairs. He received a master's degree from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University. He also studied at the London School of Economics.
Mr. Papamarkou promoted the study of Hellenism through gifts to universities and seminaries. He held the rank of Archon Megas Hieromnion of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, the Greek Orthodox Church's highest distinction for a layman, and had served as a member of the Archdiocesan Council Executive Committee. In addition to the Library of Congress and Rockefeller University, he contributed his time and money to the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, New York University, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Lincoln Center and the Cultural Commission of the City of New York.
As a result of his work, he was honored by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and the Orthodox Patriarchates of Jerusalem and Russia. He was made a Knight Commander, Order of Isabel La Catolica, Spain. Mr. Papamarkou was also a former trustee and treasurer of the Prince of Wales's charities in the United States.
He is survived by his sister, Lisa Papamarkou Jewell of New York.

HEADLINE: Junta Shows New Name Of Brutality To Burmese

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: YANGON, Myanmar

 BODY:
Slorc is extinct, but its most celebrated opponent, the Nobel laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, has yet to see any difference.
Last December, the military junta that had governed Myanmar since 1988 redesignated itself the State Peace and Development Council. In doing so, it shed its old identity as the State Law and Order Restoration Council, better known by the acronym Slorc. 
 Any hopes that the name change presaged a more tolerant regime have been stifled by the junta's unrelenting efforts to isolate Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for advocating peaceful democratic change in the country that she and almost everyone else still call Burma.
While she was under house arrest, her National League for Democracy won the parliamentary elections in 1990 by a landslide. The military refused to step aside and has since undermined the opposition through arrest and imprisonment.
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi was spared harsher treatment, associates say, because many Burmese revere her late father, Aung San, who led the country's struggle for independence from the British in the 1940's. But since her house arrest was lifted in July 1995, the junta has kept her cordoned off from popular support as well as from her family.
It has been more than two years since she saw her husband, Michael Aris, a British Buddhist scholar at Oxford University. The military will not grant him a visa. Her son Alexander has visited once since then, and her other son, Kim, twice, but they were turned down last Christmas.
Her telephone is cut off. Friends say she supports herself by writing articles for a Japanese newspaper and gets donations of rice, cooking oil and other staples from supporters. Last March, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who is 52, injured her neck and back falling down the stairs of her house. Friends say she has recovered.
Three American journalists who tried to see her earlier this month were blocked at a police checkpoint outside her home. In written replies to questions sent later through intermediaries, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi said the road to her home had been sealed off for more than 15 months.
"Technically, I am not under house arrest because I can go out and some visitors can come in to see me," she wrote. "But as you can see for yourselves, the authorities do not hesitate to keep out visitors whom they do not wish me to meet.
"The authorities have also on several occasions prevented me from going to places they do not wish me to visit."
The military Government has also intimidated more supporters in recent weeks. In March, U Soe Myint, a fellow member of the league's executive committee, was taken away for interrogation, and eventually released. About 40 student leaders were sent to prison for up to 20 years for allegedly plotting a bombing. Other students and Buddhist monks were arrested for distributing leaflets that advocated democracy. Universities have been closed since December 1996 to prevent protests.
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi called the latest arrests part of the consistently repressive climate. "Such things no longer surprise me," she wrote. "Only those who want to believe that there has been 'progress' in Burma would be surprised."
The crackdowns come as Asia's financial problems spill into Myanmar. Widespread human rights abuses by the military led the United States to impose sanctions on Myanmar last year, but Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi said that the junta's economic ineptitude had wreaked greater damage.
"The whole economy was grossly mismanaged, even before the Asian financial crisis," she wrote. "The crisis simply meant that things got from very, very bad to disconcertingly worse."
In Yangon, formerly called Rangoon, the military has erected billboards exhorting Burmese to "oppose those relying on external elements, acting as stooges, holding negative views" -- accusations leveled at Ms. Aung San Su Kyi and her fellow democrats.
The Government was alarmed when representatives of Myanmar's ethnic minorities succeeded in visiting her on Feb. 12. The controlled press accused the democratic movement of trying to sow unrest among the minority groups, which have fragile truces with the Government after years of armed insurgency.
A senior member of the National League for Democracy, who asked not to be identified for fear of arrest, said the league counted nearly two million members before the military's violent 1988 coup. With 2,000 members still in prison, he said, "we cannot say exactly how many have been left."
As for democracy's prospects under the State Peace and Development Council, he said, "There's no change at all, only much worse."

HEADLINE: Fears of Deadly Organism Cast Shadow on Chesapeake

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: SHELLTOWN, Md., April 22

 BODY:
Shortly after sunup today, Doug Hall and his helper, Jim Arnold, were busy loading 120 crab pots onto Mr. Hall's boat to be dropped into the Pocomoke River, something they will do routinely now through late fall.
Crabbing is mostly grunt work, setting traps, tending to a balky engine, slicing up dead fish for bait. Mr. Hall, 46, is the third generation of his family to work the waters of Maryland's lower Eastern Shore, and he loves it. "My grandmother, she was known as Crabbin' Annie," he said proudly. "She took me out on a boat for the first time when I was 4." 
 But for all their enjoyment in plying the tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and Virginia this spring, crabbers like Mr. Hall and thousands of other watermen, as well as farmers and business owners, say they are laboring under a cloud even on the sunniest of days.
Last summer, several bay tributaries, including the one here at the mouth of the Pocomoke, suffered the latest outbreaks of a toxic microbe, Pfiesteria piscicida. Known for only a decade as a deadly organism, it was blamed for killing thousands of fish, sickening scores of people exposed to affected waters and chilling the regional economy.
In response, Maryland and Virginia closed rivers where Pfiesteria outbreaks were reported. Within days, small hotels and restaurants that depend on summer tourism had emptied, and seafood sales fell by as much as 40 percent -- even though crabs were unaffected and nearly all the dead fish were menhaden, a species not sold for human consumption.
The rivers were eventually reopened for fishing and recreation. But with another summer approaching and the anxiety level rising again among watermen, seafood sellers and business owners, the lingering effects of Pfiesteria have also taken on a political dimension. This month in Maryland, lawmakers passed legislation that pins much of the blame for the outbreaks on the region's $1.5 billion chicken industry, the largest employer on the lower Delaware-Maryland-Virginia peninsula.
Based on a belief that waters with excessive amounts of nutrients help breed Pfiesteria in its toxic form, the measure sets strict regulations for the use of chicken manure, tons of which is spread as fertilizer on crop farms for its high content of the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorous. Scientists say the nutrients wash into bay tributaries after heavy rains.
The new law will require chicken farmers to phase in lower nutrient levels in chicken waste by 2005 or face an annual fine of $2,000, a change that farmers predict will sharply alter the region's economic landscape. They claim that those who raise chickens will be forced to spend more money a year on poultry feed made with enzymes that break down the nutrients and that those who raise crops will have to spend extra on commercial fertilizers.
In addition, chicken farmers, who make about 10 cents for every bird sold, say they do not expect the companies they sell to, like Perdue and Tyson Foods, to absorb any of the added costs.
"It's an overreaction that could put the poultry industry here out of business," said Alan Butler, a fourth-generation farmer who raises almost 750,000 chickens a year, as well as cantaloupes, watermelon, tomatoes and peppers. "Eventually we won't be able to compete, and I'm afraid of that."
Karen Truitt, who raises about 120,000 chickens annually and spreads their manure on three acres of corn, said defiantly: "I need a nutrient management plan for three acres? I'm not going to do it. They can fine me."
Mr. Butler and other chicken farmers argue that Maryland was too quick to legislate, contending that state lawmakers were overly concerned about assuaging fears of people in the Baltimore and Washington metropolitan areas who spend millions of recreational dollars each summer in towns along the Chesapeake and the Atlantic Ocean.
"This part of Maryland is treated like a stepchild," said another chicken farmer, Tom Pinto. "The beach is a playground for the state, and there is a feeling with some lawmakers that they have to keep it a playground rather than have nasty chickens polluting the bay."
Gov. Parris N. Glendening has asserted that that is not the rationale for the legislation. Testifying recently before the Senate Agriculture Committee, Mr. Glendening said voluntary soil programs in the state had not worked, insisting, "A mandatory program with a firm implementation date is the only approach that will insure success."
Virginia lawmakers considered a measure similar to Maryland's this year. But with a Federal study examining the relationship between nutrient runoffs and human health still under way, they let it die.
Even with the new regulations in Maryland, chicken farmers contend -- and state health officials agree -- that scientists have not concluded beyond doubt that the manure is causing the Pfiesteria outbreaks. Some scientists even say the added nutrients have nothing to do with toxic Pfiesteria. They argue that the outbreaks are actually caused by excessive amounts of copper derivatives found in the fungicides that farmers spray on their crops.
Dr. Ritchie C. Shoemaker, a family practitioner in Pocomoke City, said that last year he treated more than 60 patients with symptoms of Pfiesteria, including skin lesions, severe headaches, diarrhea and memory loss. After conducting his own research, Dr. Shoemaker said he became convinced that copper was the cause.
For Maryland lawmakers, though, the possibility that chicken manure played a central role was "the much more plausible hypothesis," said Don Boesch, president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. "And policy makers took the science that was available to them to do what they could."
In support of Virginia's willingness to wait, Dr. Randolph L. Gordon, the state Commissioner of Health, said that whatever is causing the outbreaks, "it all needs to be studied further."
But with continuing uncertainty, many peninsula residents remain jittery about the months ahead. Diane Disharoon, owner of Bailey's Cafe in Snow Hill, Md., more than 20 miles away from the nearest reports of Pfiesteria, said the outbreak caused her business to drop by a third last summer. Barry R. Laws, who owns a canoe and kayak rental shop around the corner, said he bought fewer boats to rent this summer and hired fewer people -- all in anticipation of another outbreak's cutting into his business.
"So far this year we've been busy," Mr. Laws said. "So I'm cautiously optimistic, I guess."
For Mr. Hall and many other watermen, it almost does not matter anymore what causes the Pfiesteria outbreaks. More problematic, they said, is the perception that all local species, including seafood sold to markets and restaurants, are tainted. So far, scientists have found little evidence that anything but menhaden have been affected. But that hardly settled nerves last summer.
"With Pfiesteria, once it raises up, it strikes fear in the public to eat seafood," Mr. Hall said, casting off with another load of crab pots.
"That cuts down the market, and we won't get a fair price. Now it's the poor old chicken farmers taking all the heat, but it's our livelihoods, too. We're all suffering with this."

HEADLINE: Tobacco Town Changing Image As Reports on Smoking Darken

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.

 BODY:
Seven years ago, George Howard's telephone began to ring repeatedly with anonymous, belligerent calls. Wherever he went in Winston-Salem -- to church, to the supermarket -- the snide comments seemed to follow.
It was not that Dr. Howard, an epidemiologist at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine, had been charged with child molestation, or that he was trying to bring a toxic waste dump to town. Rather, he had just published research concluding that cigarette smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke could hasten hardening of the arteries. He had done so while living and working in the hometown of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, a city that clings defiantly to its bumper-sticker creed: "Thank you for smoking." 
 "There was a lot of pressure," Dr. Howard said, "a lot of negative feedback, a lot of harassment. People called me and fussed at me, said I was not loyal and this, that and the other. I was a little bit worried. I wasn't moving my family out of the house or anything, but it made me think."
Earlier this year, Dr. Howard published another study, this one concluding that 30,000 to 60,000 deaths a year nationwide can be attributed to secondhand smoke. This time, his phone has been silent. Of the comments he has heard from acquaintances at church and the supermarket, 98 percent, he estimates, have been supportive.
"I think," he said, "that there's been a dramatic change in this city."
Just as there has been a profound shift in the politics of tobacco in Washington, so has there been a marked change in the civic culture of Winston-Salem, a city identified more than any other with the American tobacco industry.
Not so long ago, smoking conveyed sophistication, even glamour, and Winston-Salem's sense of itself benefited from its association with tobacco. The towns that consolidated into Winston-Salem in 1913 were, after all, the namesakes of two of America's most popular brands of cigarettes.
Now that tobacco is under relentless attack as a health hazard, with Reynolds at the center of accusations about youth marketing, nicotine manipulation and the suppression of unfavorable research, the city feels understandably defensive. Residents cannot help being resentful, said Representative Richard M. Burr, a Republican from Winston-Salem, when anti-smoking advocates tell Congress that "tobacco's no different than drugs and that the people that grow it or sell it or manufacture it are like pushers."
Perhaps most demoralizing is the sense that outsiders, for nearly a decade, have controlled the fate of a proudly homegrown industry. First it was the corporate raiders from New York who bought Reynolds in 1989. Now it is the anti-smoking politicians from Washington and faraway state capitals.
"When you're sitting in Winston-Salem, N. C., where all of R. J. Reynolds's domestic production is based, it's like holding the end of a rope with the rest of the country pulling on it," said Bryce A. Stuart, who has been city manager here since 1980.
Martha Wood, who served two terms as Mayor before losing re-election last year, said she detected a subterranean anxiety that had become numbing in its constancy.
"The circumstances have just beaten people down, and they feel there's nothing they can do about it," Ms. Wood said. "You just take your lumps and move on."
Despite the shift in public attitudes toward the tobacco industry, most residents of Winston-Salem continue to view Reynolds as an utterly benevolent force, both to its highly paid workers and to its neighbors.
Nearly all of the dozens of people interviewed here in the last two weeks, smokers and nonsmokers alike, remain intensely loyal to the industry and to the company. All said they were proud that Steven F. Goldstone, the chairman of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation, the parent company of Reynolds Tobacco, had recently pulled out of a $368.5 billion settlement with state attorneys general after Congress and the White House sought to raise the price tag.
But over the last decade, a confluence of changes, some corporate and some cultural, has transformed this city from a bottle-fed company town into a far hungrier place. Strapped by debt, controlled by strangers and battered by both political and market forces, Reynolds is no longer the dominant force it once was in the city's economic, governmental and cultural life. Economic diversification has been forced upon a town that never previously saw the need.
"We had been like a baby in the womb," Ms. Wood said. "Reynolds had really nurtured this city. And over the years, the parent had provided."
It is hard to overstate the historical bond between the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and the city of Winston-Salem.
The statue outside City Hall is not of a Confederate soldier or a 19th-century mayor, but of Richard Joshua Reynolds, the son of a Virginia chewing tobacco magnate, riding into town on horseback in 1874. All across the city, streets, schools, hospital wings and museums are named for members of the Reynolds family and executives of the company.
In the 1950's, Wake Forest was moved to Winston-Salem from the Raleigh area with money from the company and the Reynolds family. Even a downtown pawn shop is named Camel.
The city and its institutions simply do not view tobacco through the same prism as the rest of the country.
Smoking is still permitted in groceries. The corridors of the county courthouse are fogged with the smoke of jittery defendants. Though the medical school at Wake Forest prohibits smoking, it accepts research grants from tobacco companies.
"Basically, people here feel like it's a legal product and the product is being threatened by a government that wants to regulate behavior," said Gayle N. Anderson, president of the Chamber of Commerce. "There's not a high tolerance for that around here."
But Winston-Salem also has come to accept a new economic reality.
The transition began with the 1985 merger of Reynolds with Nabisco, which was followed shortly by the decision of the new chief executive, F. Ross Johnson of Nabisco, to move the corporate headquarters to Atlanta.
Then in 1989 came the leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco in a bidding war started by Mr. Johnson and ultimately won by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company. Though the deal enriched shareholders, it left the company saddled with $25 billion in debt. The headquarters were moved to New York City.
The sense of loss, longtime Winston-Salem residents say, was devastating. And as the city struggled to recover, like a soldier dazed by an exploding mortar, its anxiety was only compounded by job losses at other local companies and by the surging political assault on the tobacco industry.
In the last decade, the Reynolds work force, including its field sales team, has declined to 8,800 from 14,400, a company spokesman says. The tobacco company has been supplanted as Winston-Salem's largest employer by the Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center, where Dr. Howard and others conduct their research on the dangers of smoking.
The symbols of change are evident all across this Piedmont city of about 154,000 people.
Some of the tobacco company's abandoned factories downtown have been bought by developers and converted into a corporate and academic campus for biomedical research. In January, Reynolds ended its 80-year tradition of offering tours of its cigarette factories, citing declining interest. A few restaurants and coffee shops, perish the thought, have even designated no-smoking sections.
Reynolds's influence on local government and politics has also diminished. While the company's property tax payment totaled about $7 million a decade ago, or 18 percent of Winston-Salem's tax base, it is now barely half that amount.
Reynolds, the country's second-largest tobacco company, remains the largest contributor to the Chamber of Commerce and the Arts Council. But the debt-laden company's charitable giving, once the mother's milk of local civic and cultural groups, is less than half of what it was 10 years ago, said Donald G. Haver, Reynolds's vice president for community affairs.
Neither of the last two Mayors won a first term with the support of Reynolds and the rest of the downtown business elite. A lawyer here said he was stunned recently when an operative for a statewide candidate actually suggested that his campaign was considering rejecting contributions from tobacco companies.
Unable to rely on tobacco, Chamber of Commerce officials have adopted a more aggressive approach toward corporate recruitment. They now promote Winston-Salem as a city of medicine, higher education and banking (with the country's 17th largest bank, Wachovia Corporation, and the 32d largest, BB&T Corporation, based here).
Local officials cheered two weeks ago when Federal Express announced that the Piedmont Triad International Airport, between Winston-Salem and Greensboro, had won a hard-fought competition for a $300 million sorting hub.
And in an effort to raise civic morale, stoke growth and stem the flight of young adults, the city is trying to recruit major league baseball. A referendum will be held on May 5 in Forsyth County (Winston-Salem) and Guilford County (Greensboro) to determine whether residents will pay a 1 percent tax on prepared foods to build a $210 million stadium in nearby Kernersville. The goal is to lure either the Minnesota Twins or an expansion team.
The baseball referendum, like a public works bond issue that failed decisively last year, has exposed tensions here over the desired rate of growth.
Many in town long for the days when the stable presence of Reynolds and a few other large employers made aggressive growth less necessary. But with the uncertainty of tobacco's future, local leaders are concerned that Forsyth County's population growth of 7.5 percent in the 1990's and its job growth of 6.2 percent have trailed those of North Carolina's other urban areas and of the state as a whole.
Particularly worrisome are projections that the county's population of 18- to 34-year-olds will decline by 5 percent between 1996 and 2001. Those are exactly the workers who once would have stayed in town to seek jobs at Reynolds, where the average annual salary for nonexecutives is $45,000.
The workers who remain at Reynolds acknowledge their nervousness about the future.
"The future looks pretty bleak for us," said Perry W. Craver, a 38-year-old packaging worker who has never worked anywhere but Reynolds. "I wouldn't blame Reynolds a bit if they packed up and went overseas."
Mr. Craver said he gave credence to the reports that Reynolds executives once devised strategies to market cigarettes to teen-agers, but was convinced the company had abandoned those practices. And he was thrilled to see Mr. Goldstone walk away from the tobacco settlement, saying he was tired of the company's being pushed around by the government.
"Look, this is a great place to work," Mr. Craver said. "They treat you good, take care of you. And these days, it's a big family. Everyone else is against you, so you have to pull together."

HEADLINE: European Auto Divisions Calling for Improved Fuel Economy

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 25

 BODY:
The European operations of Ford and General Motors are supporting a plan by European auto makers to raise the average fuel economy of cars sold in Europe by nearly 20 percent, to 39 miles per gallon, even as the North American operations of both auto makers resist pressures to improve the far worse fuel economy of family vehicles here.
The split within the world's two largest auto makers reflects two factors: gasoline taxes and global warming. Fuel economy is more important to car buyers overseas because gasoline in most industrialized nations can cost four times as much as in the United States because of higher taxes. Pressure from environmental regulators to reduce the consumption of gasoline and slow emissions of gases that contribute to global warming is also greater across the Atlantic than in the United States. 
 The European Automobile Manufacturers Association, which includes Ford of Europe and G.M.'s European subsidiaries, has offered to raise the average fuel economy of new cars sold in Europe to the equivalent of 39 miles per gallon of gasoline within 10 years, from 33 miles per gallon now.
The details of the offer -- including whether the standard should apply to Europe's small but growing fleet of minivans and sport utility vehicles -- are being worked out by the auto makers with European Union officials, who have expressed an interest in even higher fuel-economy standards.
"If we were not acting, probably we would be confronted with regulatory measures that may be worse for us," said Camille Blum, the secretary general of the European auto makers' trade group.
Auto makers hope to meet the tough rules by using more lightweight but costly materials like aluminum, and by building smaller cars.
By contrast, American regulations require each manufacturer to produce cars with an average fuel economy of 27.5 miles per gallon. The requirement for light trucks, a category including pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and minivans, is 20.7 miles per gallon. The overall fuel economy of new vehicles in the United States has actually been falling as light truck sales rise while car sales dwindle.
Some lawmakers and environmentalists are beginning to look at events in Europe and ask why fuel economy is so much lower in this country.
"If they're prepared to do the voluntary standards in Europe, what will they be willing to do in the United States?" asked Senator Richard H. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada.
So far, auto makers are reluctant to do anything different in the United States. Detroit's Big Three -- the Ford Motor Company, the General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation -- make virtually all of their profits on the biggest sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, which have the worst fuel economy of all.
The three companies have lobbied strenuously and successfully against any increase in either the car or light truck gas mileage standards in the United States. The auto makers, meanwhile, are conducting research into electric vehicles and other technologies that may someday produce dramatic gains in fuel economy but will probably provide little if any benefit in the next few years.
Auto executives argue that as long as gasoline sells for $1 a gallon in the United States, few buyers will demand more fuel-efficient cars. Sales of small cars, which are the most fuel efficient, dropped 8 percent in the United States last year from 1995, to 3.4 million, even as sales of full-sized sport utility vehicles and pickups rose 17 percent, to 2.4 million.

HEADLINE: Israel Turns 50

 BODY:
Fifty years ago, in the shadow of the Holocaust, a small, determined band of Jews realized a dream that had spanned 19 centuries of exile and harrowing hardship for the Jewish people. They founded the country of Israel, beginning a remarkable epic of nation-building and survival that is one of the stirring sagas of the 20th century. As the 50th anniversary approaches this week, the world marvels at the faith and fortitude that have not only sustained Israel through five turbulent decades but brought it within reach of a new era of peace and prosperity. With wise leadership in Israel, and continued American support, Israel can reach that promised land.
Few new nations have endured so much turmoil in their early years. Israel's founding brought the first of four wars in which outnumbered Israeli forces defeated or held at bay the armies of Arab neighbors intent on extinguishing the Jewish state. Israel in those embattled decades became synonymous with military strength and agility and the daring leadership of generals like Moshe Dayan and Yitzhak Rabin. The Six-Day War in 1967, when Israel swiftly crushed the military forces of Syria, Egypt and Jordan, and the commando raid at Entebbe in 1976 that rescued hijacked hostages are still studied at military academies today. 
 Israel's understandable preoccupation with security also brought mistakes and excesses. The 1982 invasion and occupation of Lebanon produced the slaughter of Palestinian refugees by Israel's Christian Lebanese allies, a massacre nearby Israeli forces did nothing to stop. Israel's treatment of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank has often been harsh.
Despite war, and a scarcity of water and other resources, Israel built an economy that rivals Western Europe in per-capita wealth and technical sophistication. Tel Aviv became a hub of modern architecture and commerce. Successive waves of immigration multiplied Israel's Jewish population almost eightfold to five million, second only to that of the United States.
In a politically barren region where many countries are ruled by despots and autocrats, Israel created a vibrant democracy in which rival parties and political leaders competed openly for power but never lost sight of their common goals. Israel had the good fortune to produce strong, visionary leaders like David Ben-Gurion, Golda Meir, Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Rabin.
But Israel's defiant idealism and unity of purpose have recently yielded to a painful if unavoidable period of introspection and uncertainty. Heroic wars of national survival have given way to frustrating and divisive peace negotiations with the Palestinians and a wave of terrorist attacks in Israel. Israel, in essence, is grappling in new and more nuanced ways with the issue that more than any other has defined its life, how best to assure its security, even its survival.
Few nations since the end of the Second World War have faced the lethal, unremitting threat that has stalked Israel since its birth. Even today, with a patina of peace in the Middle East, Israel must maintain the military might to defend itself and to prevail against an array of Arab enemies. But now, for the first time, Israel can also secure its survival through peace. Finding the right balance between strength and diplomacy is the greatest challenge that Israel confronts.
For a country that has fought so hard just to stay alive, the idea of peace may seem a mirage. But the end of the cold war, the opening of markets and new technologies and a thirst for peace among both Israelis and Palestinians present an opportunity for negotiated stability that Israel should seize. It is the gateway to a time of tranquillity that all Israelis seek.
As Israel marks this anniversary, it is also struggling to decide what kind of state and society it wishes to be. The founding years when sandal-clad settlers pouring off steamships turned the deserts green and invested all their energy and idealism in their kibbutzim are now a romantic but fading memory. Waves of immigration have transformed and shaken Israeli society. Tensions between Orthodox and secular Jews have increased, hundreds of thousands of Russian immigrants are demanding a place in Israel, and the political divisions that flow from these demographic trends have eroded the common purpose that long unified the country.
One hallmark of Israel has always been that secular and religious communities could live and work together toward the goal of building a Jewish state. That required the mingling of profoundly different peoples and beliefs in ways that promoted the country's welfare without homogenizing the culture. Today that social contract is fraying.
No return is possible to a simpler time. Israel must learn to manage its diversity and to draw strength from it. Those so passionately opposed to their neighbors, for religious, political or ethnic reasons, need to recognize that unbridgeable divisions ultimately produce political paralysis, a condition that Israel cannot afford.
Reaching a state of equilibrium is essential not only for Israelis. Israel is more than a country. It is an idea that inspires millions of Jews around the world. From the ruins of Europe and the gas chambers of the Holocaust, from America, Russia and dozens of other lands, an indefatigable people created a new country sustained by an ancient faith. A half-century later, there is much to celebrate.

Urban Geometry Along the East River's Edge

BYLINE: By VERLYN KLINKENBORG 

 BODY:
Last week I took a taxi from La Guardia across the Triborough Bridge and down the F.D.R. to midtown Manhattan. It was a warm evening, just at sunset, and the air smelled like summer for the first time this year. I found myself watching the trees in bloom along the highway and beyond them the dark backdrop of the city. It occurred to me how much the eye loves order and how well this city satisfies that love, especially from its edges. Row after row of bricks, column after column of windows, a platoon of buildings on every block and the blocks themselves receding into the distance -- all that tessellation! Then I looked at the East River, where the grid falls away. Two tugboats were passing under the Queensboro Bridge, one of them pushing a barge.
The setting reminded me of a book I've been reading, called "Seeing Like a State," by James Scott, a professor of political science and anthropology at Yale. Mr. Scott's subject is every state's effort to make the society it governs legible, and thus readily susceptible to taxation and control. His purpose is to explain the failure of industrial agriculture and of high-modernist cities like Brasilia and Chandigarh, India, whose apostle was Le Corbusier. 
 Mr. Scott compares natural forests to the "scientific" but ecologically disastrous forests developed in Prussia and Saxony in the late 18th century -- orderly rows of a single tree species. He compares the non-geometric street plan in medieval Bruges, impenetrable to strangers, to the "transparency" of New York's grid of numbered streets and avenues. He traces the emergence of last names, which appeared sometimes gradually and sometimes by fiat, but always to serve the state's interest in identifying uniquely each individual in its domain.
Mr. Scott's point is that even in a brutally abstract city like Brasilia or a brutally abstract agriculture like the Soviet collectives, a knowledge that is local, practical, cunning and experimental survives. The authority of state planners is countermanded -- even at high risk -- by local experience. Tanzanian farmers turn from United Nations-endorsed monocropping back to a native and more sustainable agriculture. Construction workers in Brasilia erect and live in unplanned neighborhoods that are comparatively illegible to the state.
New York has its high-modernist moments, of course, its "skyscraper machines," as Le Corbusier put it, who also said of Manhattan, "The streets are at right angles to each other and the mind is liberated." This was never a planned city, in the sense that Brasilia was, but the geometric authority of the street grid and of the buildings that rise above it (and of the state that lies behind it) is incontestable. Except that we do contest it all the time.
Into the logical order of New York, the superior order of private experience always creeps. Watching the joggers and pedestrians along the edge of the F.D.R., I realized that every sharp edge in this city, every right angle, has been rounded off, metaphorically speaking, by the personal pathways we make among the buildings. Some paths are spontaneous -- cutting across a lane of stalled traffic, for instance -- but some acquire the economy of habit. My own trail to work takes me purposely past one remarkable conifer near Madison Avenue and along the gravel walks in Bryant Park, where deadheaded tulips are legion. We can live with the order this city imposes not only because the eye loves its visual qualities but because experience tells us that the grid is not absolute. If you go east or west far enough you come to the river, where the tugboats leave their turbulent wake.

HEADLINE: Through Trade and Aid, Iraqi Official Says, Embargo Is Eroding

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 25

 BODY:
With sanctions against Iraq likely to be extended next week for another six months, Iraq's Foreign Minister said today that the embargo imposed in 1990 is eroding and with it Baghdad's isolation. He predicted that this process would accelerate.
"This is happening whether the Americans like it or not," the official, Mohammed Said al-Sahaf, said in an interview. He said cross-border trade by both Iraqis and outsiders as well as the arrival of donated supplies have increased substantially in recent months. 
 Iraq is barred from selling oil, except in limited quantities to buy civilian goods like medicine and food, so the volume of trade is not huge, diplomats in Baghdad say.
But Mr. Sahaf said he views increased trade and donations, including from Americans, as evidence of a general distaste for indefinite sanctions because of their effect on the Iraqi people. He reiterated Baghdad's demand that all sanctions be lifted immediately, though he did not repeat direct threats against the United States made in recent days by other Iraqi leaders.
The Foreign Minister also renewed Iraq's criticism of the United Nations Special Commission, which is charged with dismantling Iraq's prohibited weapons and production facilities, and of its executive chairman, Richard Butler. He accused the commission, known as Unscom, of withholding information gathered on recent inspections of eight Iraqi presidential properties.
"They took samples in the presidential sites," he said. "They took air samples, earth samples, dust samples and so on, in order to be tested in the Unscom laboratory in Baghdad. But when they presented their report, they didn't include what are the results of the tests." Iraq argues that no weapons were ever hidden on the properties.
Unscom officials declined to comment.
Mr. Sahaf said the United States was largely responsible for blocking any change in policy toward Iraq in the Security Council, and he added that Secretary General Kofi Annan and his Secretariat staff were much more "neutral" and easier to work with.
"We know very well that the majority on the Security Council wishes to be fair with Iraq," he said, in an interview at the New York residence of Iraq's United Nations representative, Nizar Hamdoon. "There are only two countries -- the United States and the United Kingdom -- for their own policies. They stand against the majority."
Today in Baghdad, an official newspaper said Iraq would break out of sanctions by the end of the year if the Security Council did not lift them. "We are a sovereign nation, and we have to regain our rights," Mr. Sahaf said.
"Trade has already started," he said, skirting the question of whether the commodities being exchanged directly violate Security Council controls.
"Nobody can isolate Iraq," he said. "It is a foolish policy. And the most foolish policy is the so-called dual containment," a reference to the Clinton Administration's policy of attempting to isolate both Iraq and Iran.
Mr. Sahaf said one development of special importance to Iraq was the thawing of relations with other Arab nations, and to some extent Iran, with which it fought an eight-year war in the 1980's. He said nearly every Middle Eastern country had joined in the movement to deliver help to the Iraqis for both humanitarian reasons and as a demonstration of opposition to American policy.

HEADLINE: Our Towns;
No Rush Here To Help Lure The Yankees

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: FORT LEE, N.J.

 BODY:
IT'S rush hour in this on-off ramp of a town, and it is vicious.
The cars barreling off Interstate 95 just before the entrance to the George Washington Bridge are cutting each other off in a mad scramble for first place at the exit ramp stoplight. The light turns red, the cars keep going. Some head to the Palisades Interstate Parkway, others to the signs for "N.J. Highways," but everyone zips past the pedestrian, a middle-aged man, caught on the yellow lines. One block later, approaching the roads to Routes 80 and 95, a white Nissan rear-ends a black sport utility vehicle. Cars behind them pass in a huff, with angry jerks of the wheel. 
 Still, besides the relentless traffic, this town on the western ramp of one of the busiest bridges in the world, funnel to seven major highways, is rather subdued. The 6 o'clock chimes ringing through loudspeakers over the Fort Lee Methodist Church sound muffled, almost depressed, and several shops are shuttered for the night. Those that are open, like the Zion Kosher Deli, are catering to a handful of locals. The rush-hour cars, as always, are just passing through.
It has been like this since the bridge opened in 1931, and Fort Lee is beyond tired of it. Is it any wonder the town is leading the "Yankees Stay Home" movement? Already, 100 million cars cross the bridge every year, 136,000 cars each way each weekday, and a great deal of them try a short cut to the tolls through Main Street. And rush hour doesn't come just twice a day, five days a week. It comes every time the Giants play in the Meadowlands, every time construction cobbles a lane on the bridge, every time a holiday prompts the world to go see Mother.
So no sooner had a chunk of Yankee Stadium crashed down and the Mayor of New York started griping about the sky falling and the Yankees moving across the Hudson if a new stadium wasn't built, than Tom Meyers, a Fort Lee Councilman, started drafting a resolution:
Whereas, the Borough of Fort Lee urges the New Jersey State Legislature and Governor Christine Todd Whitman to refuse to entertain any overtures by the New York Yankees' organization to build a baseball stadium in New Jersey. . . .
The resolution passed Thursday, 6 to 0.
"We'd like to help the Yankees stay in the Bronx," said Mr. Meyers, a third-generation Fort Lee resident who grew up dodging cars. He remembers when the 2.5-square-mile borough still looked like a sweet little suburb with a big bridge attached, before the high rises turned Fort Lee into a crash pad for harried commuters.
He also remembers what the opening of Giants Stadium, in the Meadowlands, did for Fort Lee. It brought more cars. The borough, with 35,000 residents, has a police force of between 90 and 100, much larger than police departments in towns of similar size that don't have a hundred million traffic headaches. "We really can't afford any more cars," Mr. Meyers said.
The Fort Lee Borough Council plans to send its No Yankees resolution to Trenton, muster support from other municipalities, and see what happens.
But whatever Trenton says, the Yankees Stay Home movement seems to be catching on. Along Main Street here, residents and business owners interviewed all agreed that the Yankees belong in the Bronx, not in Manhattan, and definitely not in the Garden State. And it isn't just because of the traffic issue, which is huge just about everywhere in this most densely populated state in the nation. Or the fact that the economic boon stadiums are supposed to create doesn't seem to have hit home.
This is also a matter of pride. When the Giants crossed the river, the team was loath to call itself the New Jersey Giants. It's the New York Giants.
"The New Jersey Yankees doesn't sound the same," said Barry Peck, a transplanted Bronxite heading off a bus from Manhattan.
Besides, he added, New Jerseyans aren't stupid. "Steinbrenner is just using New Jersey as an excuse to try to get a better stadium in Manhattan," he said. "So, please, let's just blow the whistle on that right now."

HEADLINE: Military Group Finds Doors Closed for a Fair in Europe

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: VIENNA, April 25

 BODY:
As if caught in a time warp from the Vietnam War era, a private, military-oriented American organization is having trouble finding a home for its European fair.
First, peace campaigners forced the fair out of Brussels, where it had been held for the last 18 years. Then the group found it was not welcome in The Hague. 
 So the organization, the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association, decided to gather in Brno, in the southeastern corner of the Czech Republic.
But even that plan may be in danger. The organization is being pursued by Reginald Moreels, director of the development assistance office in the Belgian Foreign Ministry. In a letter to the Czech President, Vaclav Havel, he wrote:
"You are known as an ethical person concerned about human rights issues and the well-being of the world population. Therefore, I dare ask you to use all of your influence to avoid the fair to take place in your country."
Mr. Havel, who has been hospitalized for two weeks, will respond when his health permits, a spokesman said.
The protests have stunned the American organization. "It amazes me," Maurice Padden, the association's vice president, said in a telephone interview from its headquarters in Fairfax, Va. "It reminds me of when I got back from Vietnam."
"We don't display weapons," said Mr. Padden, a retired Air Force general. "We don't sell anything at these fairs."
The group, founded in 1946, has 36,000 members, both individuals and companies.
It holds exhibitions and conferences around the world so that military officers, leaders of industry and the merely curious can view and discuss the latest developments in military communications, electronics and intelligence systems.
Mr. Padden said Dr. Moreels was politically motivated and acting on behalf of "pacifists."
Dr. Moreels, a founder of Doctors Without Borders-Belgium, the medical relief group, does not deny this.
"I have supported the various actions against this arms fair organized by the Belgian peace movement," he wrote the Dutch Minister of Development Cooperation, Jan Pronk, pleading that the the fair not be held in the Netherlands.
"The negative influence of the weapons trade in unstable and economically less developed regions is very clear," wrote Dr. Moreels, a surgeon who has worked with the civilian victims of war in many places, including Cambodia, Somalia and Yemen.
"Weapons that are easy to use and, thanks to technology, user-friendly weapons, reinforce the violence, in which more and more children are victims," he added.
The Hague municipality decided to cancel the fair, fearing demonstrators.
Whatever happens in Brno, Dr. Moreels is planning another conference for this fall, in the same building that the association would have used for its fair.
It will gather advocates of curbing the trade in small arms and light weapons like assault rifles and grenade launchers, which are the major causes of casualties in today's wars.
"We threw them out and put something in place that goes in the other direction," said Wouter Vermeulen, an assistant to Dr. Moreels.

Group Plans to Fight Global Warming Treaty
Opponents of a treaty to fight global warming have proposed to spend millions of dollars to convince the public that the environmental accord is based on shaky science. Opposition to the climate treaty is a daunting public relations task; the treaty's advocates, including the Clinton Administration, present the science on global warming as essentially settled and unchallengeable. 1
 
Hillary Clinton Testifies

The Gotti Tapes
Movie-like dialogue is typical of the remarks captured on 7,000 surveillance tapes that are the heart of the racketeering case against John A.Gotti, sometimes called Junior, that prosecutors are preparing to bring to trial here. They say the son of the dapper Mafia leader who is in prison for life is the new Gambino boss. From what is known about the tapes, it is clear they include enough expletives, veiled threats and sarcasm to seem like a mob-movie parody. On the tapes, people actually use names like Tommy Sneakers. 34

HEADLINE: 11 NATIONS TAKING NEXT PIVOTAL STEP TOWARD THE EURO

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, April 25

 BODY:
Nearly 50 years after European leaders dreamed of uniting their nations to prevent another world war, 11 countries led by Germany and France are soon to surrender a central pillar of national sovereignty: control over their currencies.
Despite some remaining feuding and recrimination, leaders from all but 4 of the 15 nations in the European Union are expected to approve final plans next weekend for the introduction of a single European currency on Jan. 1. 
 Financial institutions and a few big companies will shift in 1999 to euro-based electronic transactions, although the actual bills and coins will not be in general use until 2002.
But in a real sense, the new order begins in Brussels next week, because European leaders are expected to spell out the exchange rates at which their individual currencies will be locked together. As a practical matter, their countries will immediately subordinate individual monetary policies in favor of a common European policy.
Most economists say the euro's long-term prospects are better than they dared imagine a few years ago. Inflation is low. Growth is accelerating across the Continent. And a world barometer for financial credibility, the currency markets, increasingly behave as if the euro were already a fact of life.
"The euro will be to the dollar what Airbus is to Boeing," said Norbert Walter, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Research. "We have better airplanes as a result of competition between Airbus and Boeing, and the euro will give us better reserve currencies."
Never before has a group of countries tried to introduce a common currency on such a scale without also forming a political union. Nor have political leaders worked together for so long to overcome historical divisions born of language barriers, cultural differences and war.
Yet with less than a week before European leaders reach their point of no return, the two most important nations are squabbling like jealous siblings. France and Germany are still fighting over who will run the new European central bank as well as about basic economic principles.
"There is still a difference in philosophy in France about the role of an independent central bank and about whether the central bank should look only at the question of price stability," said Otto Lambsdorff, a former German Economics Minister.
Huge gaps separate rich but sluggish economies like Germany's from poorer but booming countries like Spain and Ireland. Italy and Belgium continue to carry twice as much accumulated debt as most others and are obligated to make deep cuts in spending for years to come.
If the euro maintains credibility, it could transform Europe into one of the world's biggest and most efficient marketplaces. A failure would be an economic and political disaster.
For all the uncertainty about the new euro market, one thing seems clear: it will be huge. The cohesive Europe will have an economy almost as big as the United States' with combined annual output of $6.28 trillion, versus $8.1 trillion. It will be the world's biggest single exporter and importer. And it will be the center of a $2 trillion bond market, virtually equal to the market for United States Treasury securities.
And currency traders, who a year ago expressed their fears about the euro by fleeing from German marks to dollars, have remained calm as the final decisions have been made.
"We are convinced that the euro will seriously threaten the dollar as the world's reserve currency," said Avinash Persaud, a foreign exchange analyst at J. P. Morgan in London. "This process will be far quicker than many imagine, and it will be under way in a matter of months, not years."
Financial analysts predict that a unified European bond market will benefit from economies of scale and become a much stronger competitor to United States Treasury bonds, notes and bills.
"It will be a major market, and it will appear on the first day of business in January," said Graham Bishop, an adviser to Salomon Smith Barney in London. Indeed, governments and financial institutions are already preparing the structure for bond trading in euros.
Robert Portes, a professor at the London School of Economics, estimates that the rise of the euro could cost the American economy about $40 billion in benefits that derive from the dollar's role as world currency.
Most ordinary Americans are not likely to notice those effects, however. Compared with the normal and sometimes violent swings in exchange rates, which will still be a fact of life, the pressures created by the euro would be barely discernible. "The Deutsche mark is already a reserve currency, and every country in the world already uses it as a surrogate for Europe," said Stephen Bell, a senior economist with Deutsche Bank in London.
An unanswered question is whether the member nations can adhere to a one-size-fits-all monetary policy beyond the first few years. It is no accident that the euro is wildly popular in Spain and Italy, and grumpily opposed by more than 60 percent of all voters in Germany.
Thanks largely to the euro, long-term interest rates in Spain and Italy have plunged from more than 13 percent in 1991 to less than 6 percent today. Though part of the credit belongs to the central banks of the two countries, which imposed years of strict monetary policy to wring out inflation, the forthcoming reality of the euro played a major role.
Under the European currency union, interest rates in different countries must converge because the risk of the underlying currency would be no different in Spain or France or Germany.
Low rates have helped ignite an economic boom in Spain and Portugal and are expected to do it for Italy as well. Spain's economy is expected to grow as much as 3.7 percent this year, compared with about 2.5 percent in Germany. Spain has added 65,000 jobs in the last year, while Germany has lost 400,000. Such disparities present difficult problems.
Cesar Molinas, an economist in Madrid with Merrill Lynch, warned in a recent report that the euro could in fact create a boom-bust cycle in both Spain and Portugal. Under such a script, rising prices would make Spain's products uncompetitive and force an economic downturn.
At present, countries can protect their international competitiveness by devaluing their currencies to offset inflation. But that would be impossible under the single policy of a European central bank.
Italy faces hard problems, too. Like Spain and Portugal, it has received a windfall in the form of lower interest rates. But Italy also has one of the highest levels of Government debt in Europe, and under the Maastricht treaty of 1991 it must reduce that sharply. Prime Minister Romano Prodi will have to cut Government spending enough to start generating annual budget surpluses. But Mr. Prodi came close to losing control of his Parliament once last year, when he faced rebellion over proposed budget cuts.
The practical task of adapting to a single currency will be anything but cheap or simple. Daimler-Benz AG., the manufacturer of Mercedes-Benz cars and trucks, is spending $120 million to convert entirely to euro accounting by Jan. 1.
Company executives hope to save $60 million a year on currency transactions and on instruments to protect themselves from changes in exchange rates. Smaller companies, though, have barely begun to think about the conversion and are loath to face the added cost.
The euro is also expected to increase competitive pressure on companies in high-cost countries because they will no longer be able to conceal cross-border price differences easily. "I call it the Motel 6 effect," Mr. Bell of Deutsche Bank said. Just as it is hard to charge widely differing prices in the United States, it will be hard for companies to sell products across Europe with sharply different price tags. "It's likely to cost many companies a lot of money," Mr. Bell added.
"The French!" snapped Klaus Engelen, international correspondent at Handelsblatt, Germany's leading business newspaper. "Their strategy is one of containment -- they want to contain Germany."
Few Germans speak out as angrily as Mr. Engelen, but many share his fears. Less than a week before the Brussels meeting, France and Germany are battling over rival candidates to run the central bank. The French insist that the job should go to Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the Bank of France. The Germans, and most other governments, have long supported Wim Duisenberg, former head of the Dutch central bank.
The fight has little to do with personalities, since both candidates have locked their own monetary policies with those of the German central bank. But it has everything to do with a deep reservoir of suspicion that has bedeviled the euro project since it was envisioned.
German leaders insist that the European central bank should be independent of political pressure and focus exclusively on fighting inflation. French political leaders have argued that the bank should have some accountability to political leaders and place at least some priority on job creation. And they want a Frenchman simply because he is French.
"If the first act of European construction is a co-opting by central bankers, that means the single currency will start with a kind of coup d'etat," remarked Jacques Attali, a former adviser to the late French President, Francois Mitterrand.
Mr. Lambsdorff, who opposes concessions to the French, said: "I see a political threat from political intervention that would damage the independence of the central bank. The risk is that the countries with strong economies will be expected to transfer resources to those with weak economies."
Despite the months-long feuding and several failed attempts at compromise, financial analysts say the credibility of the future euro remains surprisingly strong. That is because the basic laws governing the European central bank and its priorities represent overwhelmingly German views. Even if Mr. Trichet is chosen to run the new bank, he has a record as a dogged ally of Bundesbank policies.
"The idea that the euro will be a weak currency is rubbish," Professor Portes said. "The central bank governors of Spain, Portugal, France and Italy are the toughest hawks in Europe. To get the idea that that they will suddenly turn into monetary lax-ists when they move to Frankfurt is bizarre."

HEADLINE: New Wave of Building for Shore Resort Near Seattle

BYLINE: By HARRIET KING 

DATELINE: OCEAN SHORES, Wash.

 BODY:
A NEW spurt of development is under way on this windswept six-mile peninsula a three-hour drive southwest of Seattle, whose beaches now draw 3.5 million visitors a year.
Since 1995, four new lodgings with 310 rooms have opened in this city with a permanent population of only 3,500. Now, with a $40 million infrastructure project due to get under way this year, construction of housing is expected to pick up steam. 
 The infrastructure funds will pay for a new sewage treatment plant, upgrades of the existing plant, extension of sewer lines to all existing lots and improvements to water and storm drainage systems.
At its current pace, officials say, there will be perhaps 120 housing starts this year, up from 104 in 1997 and 87 in 1995.
"The city has had more new housing starts than in all of Grays Harbor county combined in the last 12 years," said Ron Thomasson, past president of the Ocean Shores Development Association, adding that he projected 800 housing starts in the next five years.
Since 1992, shortly after the timber industry here went into a tailspin, the civic group has been a leader in promoting the investment of nearly $100 million in residential, hotel and commercial space.
Perched on the Pacific, the city is a major focus for construction on the coast, much of which is covered by national parks and rain forests, state parks and tribal land.
Despite the large number of visitors and the construction, there is often an air of tranquillity. Along the ocean, only sand dunes stand between homes and the surf. When the tide is out, the beach is pavement hard and motorists on what is officially known as Beach Highway pass strollers, whale watchers and horseback riders.
The peninsula had once been a cattle ranch. In 1960, developers bought the property and built roads, an airport, marina and an 18-hole P.G.A. golf course and platted 12,000 residential lots, on average 60- by 150 feet. They were sold for an average of $500.
Lots with views were plentiful along the ocean, the Grays Harbor jetty and bay, the golf course, and 23 interconnected freshwater canals and two lakes. About one third of the lots now have dwellings and the sewer extension will be to the remaining 8,000 lots without service. "For Sale" signs hammered into sand dune-covered lots indicate that parcels with 60 feet of oceanfront are available at about $70,000. New and remodeled primary and vacation homes cost from $75,000 to $350,000.
Larry Locke, owner of Locke Construction, a leading builder in Ocean Shores, said a waterfront home with as much as 3,000 square feet could be built for $350,000, including the lot. For a comparable waterfront home in Seattle, he added, "you're talking a million bucks."
When Mr. Locke moved his family and business to Ocean Shores 19 years ago, "things were bleak," he said. "The city was just getting off the ground," he recalled.
Ocean Shores was incorporated as a city by its 1,000 residents in 1970 after the original developer of the peninsula, MacPherson Realtors, who built the airport, marina and golf course, among other things, went bankrupt. A business district was forming then on two streets running parallel to the ocean, with a few motels perched near the surf. In 1983, a 23-unit time-share lodging called Windjammer Resort rose adjacent to the golf course. Housing, however, was still scarce.
BUT in the last five years, Ocean Shores has started to boom as a trendy place for vacation and permanent homes, especially as the economy improved and employment grew in the Seattle metropolitan area at Microsoft and Boeing.
Since 1992, more than 100 businesses have opened in construction, tourism and retailing, bringing the total number to over 500. Some residents work in nearby towns such as Aberdeen, the county seat. About half the people living here are retirees.
A couple of weeks ago Mr. Locke, who builds more than two dozen custom homes a year, finished a two-story oceanfront home with 1,600 square feet, three bedrooms and garage that he has sold for $185,000, including lot.
A number of unbuilt lots still remain on the golf course, where this spring he finished a 1,000-square-foot home on the fairway costing about $78,000, not including the $25,000 price of the lot.
A few blocks away in the sandy interior, 60- by 150-foot lots are priced as low as $7,000.
Many without sewer connections are currently used for recreational vehicle camping. "I have four houses on hold that we have to wait to build until the sewer comes in next year," said Mr. Locke.
The county seat, Aberdeen, is 20 miles away on Grays Harbor. But Tom Casey, a Grays Harbor County Commissioner, says "the executives the county recruits don't want to buy homes in Aberdeen, they want to commute from Ocean Shores over a nightmarish road."
When the Ocean Shores Development Association began a campaign in 1992 to lure new businesses to the city its initial thrust was hotels, says Mr. Thomasson, who manages the local cable-TV company and is a former economic development director for the city.
Existing motels and hotels were jammed in the summer and turning people away, he said, and lodging was heavily booked as well on winter weekends by those who wanted to see storms with 25 foot high waves rolling in from the ocean.
THE civic group first brought in the Best Western Lighthouse Suites with 76 rooms, followed by a 113-room Shilo Inn and a Holiday Inn Express with 72 rooms, with construction costs totaling well over $20-million. A $1 million, 46-room Days Inn motel opened last year, and Mr. Locke was the contractor.
The association now wants to bring in light industry and computer software companies. Commercial property is priced between $120 and $130 per square foot.
Residential values in Ocean Shores have been rising as its popularity spreads. Bonnie Reeves, who manages the Lighthouse Suites hotel, and her husband, William, bought a home here in 1975 when he retired from the Port of Tacoma "because we wanted peace and quiet and tranquillity." The assessed value has now gone up 300 percent.
"We just wanted a little home on the golf course," she said. "We never dreamed the place would grow."
Pat Kuntz, a sales agent at Windermere Real Estate, said the Oregon Coast was "saturated, so people are settling here."
"We are full-service, with events, conventions and we have supermarkets, pharmacies, a fire department and a police force," she said.
Last February, the Quinault Indian Nation broke ground just outside the city limits for a major casino that could cost more than $35 million and employ 300 people. And Quinault Land & Timber Company, another tribal business group, is looking for developers to build a resort costing in excess of $100 million on a 27-acre waterfront site on the southern end of Ocean Shores.
Recalling the problems of the original developers of Ocean Shores, Charles Donohoe, manager of the Windjammer Resort, said that they "were 20 years ahead of their time."

CORRECTION-DATE: May 3, 1998, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about development in Ocean Shores, Wash., misidentified a developer of the area that went bankrupt. That developer was Wendel West & Associates, which had purchased the property from the original developer, MacPherson Realtors. The article also misidentified the seat of Grays Harbor County. It is Montesano, not Aberdeen.

HEADLINE: Office Growth Finding Its Way To Rockland

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
MERCEDES-BENZ created something of a stir last fall when it announced it would move its North American corporate headquarters from Montvale, N.J., to a new 400,000-square-foot building on 91 acres of rolling, wooded land in Pearl River, N.Y., just four miles north.
Officials of Rockland County were also cheered that the development of Class A commercial office space, which has thrived to the south in New Jersey and to the east in Westchester and Fairfield Counties, was finally beginning to find its way there. According to the real estate company Cushman & Wakefield, about 100,000 square feet of Class A space was available in the county in the first quarter of 1998 compared to 250,000 square feet a year earlier, producing a 5.9 percent vacancy rate. 
 The car company would join other corporations, such as Fujitsu Network Communications and The Dress Barn, which have opened up operations in Rockland, and Novartis Pharmaceuticals and American Home Products, which have recently expanded existing operations. Another newcomer is the Palisades Center, a nearly 2-million-square-foot shopping center in the process of opening.
Although Mercedes-Benz purchased the land for the new building in December, it has since backed away from its plans to build the 400,000-square-foot building, saying that costs were proving higher than expected. Real estate sources said the company had told New York officials it was at least $25 million over its planned budget of $50 million.
A company spokesman said a decision was expected within 90 days whether to go ahead with a scaled-down project in Pearl River, stay in Montvale or do something else.
"The thought was that it is better to face the problems now, rather than wait until we were six months into construction," said Steven Rossi, general manager for corporate communications for Mercedes-Benz. "We would still love to make it work."
Development and government officials in Rockland say they still hope that Mercedes-Benz will make the Pearl River project work. But they say the decision by such a high-profile company to locate there, even if the actual project is foiled by budget issues, shows that the county has arrived as a corporate headquarters.
"There are several large-space users looking in Rockland County right now," said James B. Tully, a vice president of the CB Commercial real estate services company and head of its Northern New Jersey office. "Mercedes-Benz really kicked things into gear. It went through a lengthy selection process before deciding on that location. It is internal problems that are holding things up."
Jeffrey Babikian, a managing director of the Insignia/ESG brokerage company who specializes in New Jersey and Rockland, agreed that the Mercedes-Benz announcement, regardless of the eventual outcome, had people looking north of the New Jersey border. "The state line was some kind of a Chinese wall, but now that people are looking at Rockland County, they can see that there are no negatives to being there," he said. He added that several companies, which he declined to identify, were considering putting up headquarters in Rockland, but that the area was still not ready for speculative construction.
C. Scott Vanderhoef, the county executive, said much of the commercial activity recently involved filling vacant space, but said some specialty projects are in the pipeline. Last week, Database American Company, a business information firm, announced that it would lease a 200,000-square-foot building to be constructed on 26 acres of land in Montebello, starting in October 1999.
Both geography and history have contributed to the lack of commercial development in Rockland County as compared with other New York suburban areas.
It was largely a farming community until the Tappan Zee Bridge was opened in 1955; a mental hospital, the Rockland Psychiatric Center, was the largest single employer. After the bridge opened, the county became known as a haven for people willing to exchange a fairly punishing commute for housing that cost considerably less than what was available in closer-in or more accessible suburbs.
COMMERCIAL development was largely limited to light industrial and distribution operations and strip shopping centers. An attempt at Class A office development was undertaken in the 1970's by the Uris Organization, in hopes of luring the New York Stock Exchange from the then-beleaguered city. Blue Hill Plaza, the Uris development, is a 1.1 million-square-foot, two-building development near the Mercedes-Benz land in Pearl River. To appeal to the exchange, one building was built low and wide to accommodate a trading floor, while the other is high-rise and was intended for back-office operations of the member brokerage firms.
The stock exchange, of course, is still at Broad and Wall Streets, and Blue Hill Plaza remained thinly occupied for years, despite the modern office space and ample amenities that include a fitness center.
"This property had a long and troubled history," said Kenneth M. Krasnow, director of business development in the New York area for Cushman & Wakefield. It went through several owners, including Olympia & York, the American arm of the Canadian company that went bankrupt in 1992.
The development was subsequently purchased by Robert Martin, a Westchester builder and investor, and is currently owned by the Mack-Cali real estate investment trust, as a result of Mack-Cali's acquisition of Robert Martin. The property now has a vacancy rate in the single digits, brokers report, and is filled with tenants such as Bell Atlantic and Fujitsu Network Communications, a developer of fiber-optic telecommunications equipment.
High-tech companies like Fujitsu, and pharmaceutical companies like Novartis and American Home Products, are exactly the type of operations the county needs, said Richard M. Struck, director of business expansion for Orange & Rockland Utilities, the area's provider of electric power and gas.
"Obviously, we benefit from increased electrical and gas sales when new companies move to the county," he said. He said economic development in Rockland had been upbeat for the last few years and that 1998 appeared on track as well. According to the company, its economic development activities last year helped induce three companies to relocate to Rockland and two others to expand, adding over 200 jobs.
TO help lure new industry, the utility offers a 10 percent discount on power and gas to qualified companies. This is in addition to the incentives available from towns, the county and state.
These incentives can add up. Mercedes-Benz could collect as much as $9.4 million if it moves its 750 employees to Pearl River and hires 400 more, as had been planned. What makes the company so attractive to local officials is that the new location is so close to the old one, so that employees are not expected to move and no children will be added to a crowded school system.
In addition to Fujitsu, which invested $122 million to equip its 35,000-square-foot research and development center, which opened last year, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation invested $165 million to expand its manufacturing operations at the old Ciba Pharmaceutical plant complex in Suffern.
Ciba, which was absorbed into Novartis with the merger of its parent Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz, has been manufacturing drugs at that location for 33 years. With the expansion, employment is expected to increase from 600 to 750 people.
Another relatively recent arrival is the headquarters of the 690-store Dress Barn clothing chain, which moved to Rockland from Stamford, Conn., in 1994. The company employs about 300 people in a 500,000-square-foot complex once occupied by AT&T in Suffern.
Rockland economic development officials say that as the smallest county in the state outside of New York City it tends to be overlooked.
"To the people upstate, we are part of the New York metropolitan area," said Holly Freedman, president of the Rockland Economic Development Corporation. "But in the city, they think we are upstate and too far away." In fact, the center of Rockland county is less than 25 miles from midtown Manhattan.
Some strip shopping centers and the 120-store, 900,000-square-foot Nanuet Mall remain but the retail focus of Rockland County has clearly shifted to Palisades Center, a mammoth shopping center just off the New York State Thruway two miles west of "the Tee Zee," which is how the Tappan Zee Bridge is referred to locally.
Situated on 170 acres, the center has close to 2 million square feet of store space and may expand to 3 million. Designed to be "all things to all people," according to one broker, the center has 118 stores in operation, ranging from Victoria's Secret to the J.C. Penney Home Store to Sunglass Hut.
There are 63 more in various stages of completion, with most due to open soon, including Home Depot, Target, Banana Republic and Barnes & Noble.
The center follows the current retail credo of mixing food and entertainment with shopping to attract families and keep them there as long as possible to boost sales. The entertainment at Palisades Center includes a 21-screen Loews Theater with a separate, large-screen Imax theater due to open at the end of July. A large indoor Ferris wheel operates at the end of one of the large food courts with multiple vendors; an ice rink is on the top floor of the four-level mall.
IN keeping with its scale, the mall has an industrial feel. The common areas have floors of sealed concrete and structural steel beams, with air ducts and electrical conduits in plain sight. There are no restrictions on Sunday shopping in Rockland County, so the mall will have an advantage on its competitors in Bergen County, which must close on Sundays.
Development of the mall has been highly contentious locally, and the recent opening came after well over a decade of wrangling. Most of the argument was over whether the new mall would generate unacceptable amounts of traffic on local roads and lure shoppers away from local stores. Many of those in opposition recalled how the opening of Nanuet Mall over 20 years ago hurt family stores in downtown Nyack.
The dispute appears to have generated strong feelings on both sides: the townspeople and local businesses who fear added traffic and competition, and the builder, Robert J. Congel of the Pyramid Companies, who ultimately got most of what he wanted.
Mr. Congel, who is based in Syracuse, announced recently that he was putting his privately-owned group of companies up for sale for estate planning purposes. On the block are 29 existing or approved malls throughout the Northeast with 28 million square feet of leasable space and the potential for adding 17 million more. Conspicuously not for sale: Palisades Center.
With its location in Clarkstown on the Thruway and state routes 303 and 59, Palisades Center is not hard to get to at most times. But transportation is an issue that comes up in most conversations about Rockland County.
INDEED, some real estate executives say the recent completion of Interstate 287 from New Jersey to the Thruway is a big part of the current interest in Rockland County locations. The highway provides a direct route between fast-growing areas like Morris County, in New Jersey, and Westchester and Connecticut.
"The completion of 287 combined with the decline in good sites in Westchester and New Jersey are the reason why multinationals are starting to look at Rockland," said Leonard T. Miller Jr., a director of Cushman & Wakefield in its New Jersey office.
Mercedes-Benz chose the Pearl River site because of its proximity to the existing headquarters; no one would have to relocate. But for Rockland commuters who work in Manhattan, commuting can be a daily struggle, marked by twice-a-day jams on the Tappan Zee Bridge as well as the entrances to the city.
Two New Jersey Transit rail lines, the Bergen and Pascack Valley, extend into parts of the county, but they go only as far as Hoboken. From there, passengers must switch to the PATH trains to get into Manhattan and seek other forms of transportation if they work a long distance north from the PATH terminus at 34th Street.
Proposals to ease the commuters' plight reveal a split, with development-minded officials and executives of the county's inland areas on one side of the issue, and residents of gentrified communities such as Nyack and Piermont along the banks of the Hudson River, who want to keep a less hurried way of life, on the other.
One proposal on the table is to run high-speed ferries from a dock in Nyack to Manhattan. Another is to operate water taxis across the river to Metro North train stations in Westchester. (There already is bus service across the bridge as well as buses that go through New Jersey to the city, but both have to contend with traffic.)
In Nyack, a village of Victorian homes and dozens of antiques shops, many residents fear that construction of a parking structure near the waterfront, as proposed by the Thruway Authority, would clog the narrow streets and drive away customers attracted by Nyack's quaint charms and river views.
Nevertheless, Mr. Vanderhoef, the county executive, said that some way had to be found to ease traffic congestion. "It is critically important to keep people off the Tappan Zee Bridge," he said. "We are very anxious to find new ways to move people, and a ferry from Rockland to Manhattan has great merit."
He said it was ironic that some residents of Piermont, just south of Nyack, are opposed to development, because for many years Piermont was a blue-collar factory town dominated by the Continental Can company. "The arty people don't want more tourism because of the parking, but the shop owners like it," he said.
A better solution for commuters, he said, would be to revive the passenger line along the west shore of the Hudson, which is now operated as a freight line by Conrail. "It was a one-seat ride that ran from West Kingston into the city," Mr. Vanderhoef said. "I remember my father taking it." But the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, he said, had been reluctant to undertake the project, arguing that it would be expensive and serve relatively few people compared to the lines on the eastern side of the river.
EVEN if Mercedes-Benz does not move to Rockland, the effort to attract the automaker will be a benefit, said Thom Kleiner, supervisor of the town of Orangetown, which includes Pearl River.
"We gained a lot of experience with three levels of government, town, county and state working with an international company," Mr. Kleiner said. He said the experience would be useful in seeking to attract companies that do not want to have to deal with different levels of government working at odds with each other.
Although Rockland switched to a county executive system in the 1980's, some of its governmental structure dates from the pre-Revolutionary era. There are no cities in the county. Instead there are five towns, Clarkstown, Haverstraw, Orangetown, Ramapo and Stony Point, with 19 villages within those towns. (There is even an Orangeburg within Orangetown.)
One of the biggest development opportunities in the county is the old mental hospital, much of which is a scenic but depressing vista of abandoned buildings with barred windows. The state has signaled its plan to sell 400 of the 600 acres, part of which fronts on Lake Tappan.
Mr. Kleiner said the town was interested in acquiring some of the land for use as a park and possibly a recreation center. "This land will not be developed for the highest economic return," he said. "That may be a close second, but it is important to retain part of it as a passive park."
One reason the town would welcome Mercedes-Benz as a neighbor, he said, was the company's demonstrated esthetic sense. "We know they won't chop down all the trees," he said.
Mr. Vanderhoef said that residential development in the county needed to be controlled to avoid overloading the school system. He said the county was working on its first comprehensive development plan in 25 years.
"This county has a history of growth with little planning," he said. "We have a solid infrastructure and a well-educated work force. Now we are going to see better planning."

HEADLINE: For Better or Worse, Israel Is 'Special' in U.S. Eyes

SERIES: ISRAEL AT 50: American Voices

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG with MARJORIE CONNELLY

 BODY:
Its image has been tarnished, its need for billions in aid questioned in Congress. But to most Americans, Israel remains a worthy recipient of support, and to almost half it is a "special place," rather than just another country, the latest nationwide New York Times poll shows.
American attitudes toward Israel have dipped and risen over its 50 years with the roll of events, but never by much. This month, 57 percent of 1,395 people polled across the country said they had a generally favorable opinion of Israel. 
 And for the first time in the 20 years that various pollsters have asked Americans which side in the Mideast conflict they favored, a strong majority, 58 percent, said they sympathized with Israel over the Palestinians -- although a plurality have always done so.
Moreover, despite Israel's modern face and the censure brought by its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, 49 percent still saw it as a "special place," while 27 percent said they did not and 18 percent said they had once but no longer did.
Joe Smith, 66, a retired telephone company service manager in Memphis, Tenn., is a Protestant. As he put it after the poll: "I'm not a person who believes Israel is O.K. no matter what they do. I just think we're obligated to support Israel with money or troops because of who they are. It's the Holy Land. It's the place that our Christianity is based on."
Among the 232 American Jews polled, support and concern for Israel approached double that of the general population on some issues. But Jews were also were likelier to favor a Palestinian homeland, apparently because they have delved more deeply into the issue, and fewer are still undecided on it.
Only 16 percent of respondents knew that Israel is the largest recipient of United States aid. It receives about $3 billion in economic and military assistance a year. But after hearing as part of another question that Israel was first on the aid list, 58 percent still favored maintaining the current level of support.
"They are a fairly small state," said Diana Appel, 37, a Clinton, Iowa, nurse who is a Protestant, "and they always seem to be under duress from the fact that everyone else wants their land."
Such widespread support indicates that political backing of Israel comes from much more than the influence of American Jews, Jewish advocates say -- even if the poll did find that 19 percent say Jewish Americans have too much influence on American foreign policy, and 30 percent say Israel has too much.
The telephone poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points; it was conducted from April 15 to 20.
"The support in Congress is not simply the result of an effective lobby but is much more deeply rooted in public attitudes," said Rabbi Ismar Schorsch, chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America.
But some also pointed out that public opinion is itself a product of diligent opinion-forming efforts.
"There are an awful lot of people eager to insure that the relations between America and Israel remain a very strong one," said Jonathan Sarna, professor of American Jewish History at Brandeis University. "So in a sense, the poll is a tribute to the efforts of a lot of folks." He said such groups ranged from Jews to evangelical Christians.
When the topic of war arises, however, the broad support for Israel betrays a certain shallowness. If Israel seemed in danger of being defeated by Arab armies, only 22 percent would favor sending troops; 24 percent would favor sending arms and equipment only, and 44 percent would want to stay out of the conflict. In one of the starkest contrasts between Jews and the population at large, only 7 percent of Jews advocated not sending troops.
Support for Israel reached a low in 1989 during the heat of the intifada, the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories. Then, only 45 percent of respondents viewed Israel favorably. Backing hit a high of 79 percent when Israel was the target of Iraqi missiles during the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
While support for Israel has swelled recently, it has remained consistently low for the Palestinians. Asked whether they sided more with Israel or the Palestinians, 58 percent chose Israel, up from 48 percent in 1997, while 13 percent in both years said they sided with the Palestinians.
In a somewhat surprising contrast, Jewish Americans backed the idea of a Palestinian homeland more heavily than non-Jews did. Part of that gap may stem from greater knowledge of the subject: asked whether they favored the idea of a homeland, 34 percent of the general public, as compared with 13 percent of Jews, said they did not know.
"The general American public has not had to think the issue through," said Arthur Hertzberg, a visiting professor at New York University. "The Jews have had to." Mr. Hertzberg is author of the forthcoming "Jews: The Essence and Character of a People" (Harper/Collins).
"Across the board of the Jewish world now," he said, "you have an almost even division between those who, having thought it through, think it's better to have a Palestinian state with safeguards and hopefully end the problem, and those who say, 'You can't trust those guys.' "
The poll found signs of frustration over the slow pace of the peace effort in the Middle East: only one-quarter of respondents said Benjamin Netan yahu had mostly kept Israel's peace agreements with the Palestinians; similarly, one-quarter of respondents said Yasir Arafat had kept the Palestinian side of the bargain.
In general, the sampled American Jews supported Israel at a rate about 20 percentage points above that of the general population. American Jews came close to unanimity on such questions as Israel's importance to the interests of the United States and its reliability as an ally.
Israeli Jews overwhelmingly return the affection they receive from America. A recent poll run in Israel by Public Opinion Research of Israel for the United States Information Agency shows that 87 percent of Israeli Jews describe United States-Israeli relations as good.
And relations with American Jewry remain healthy as well, despite bitter disputes recently over the power of the Orthodox rabbinate in Israel and its refusal to accept as equals rabbis of the Reform and Conservative movements, which predominate in the United States.
A poll last month for The Los Angeles Times and the daily Yedioth Aharonoth found that 79 percent of Israelis think American Jewish views should be taken into account in Israel's policies.
The disputes have taken a toll, however. The Los Angeles Times poll found that 43 percent of Israelis thought their relations with American Jews had deteriorated.
When the New York Times poll explored why Americans at large support Israel, it found a combination of religion, history and contemporary politics. Seventy-six percent said they believed the United States has a vital interest in Israel, while only 15 percent said it does not. A majority said they did not think Israel exaggerated the military threat from the Arab countries.
Sixty-four percent agreed with the following statement: "Because of what happened to the Jews during World War II, Israelis are right to defend their homeland at any cost." Older people were more likely to agree than younger -- 76 percent of those over 64, compared with 66 percent of those 30 and under.
"I see the Jewish society as a whole as people who have overcome huge obstacles," said Sharon Barnes, 30, a Grand Rapids, Mich., saleswoman who is Protestant. "I don't think you can put into words what they went through during the war."
Israel, she said, "is a special place as a homeland for the Jewish people as well as the birthplace of Jesus Christ."
For all their emphasis on the past, however, it is more recent times that Americans think of first. Asked what the word Israel brought to mind, 26 percent -- the largest group -- said war. The next largest, 13 percent, mentioned the Holy Land. American Jews were most likely to describe Israel first as the Jewish homeland and then in the context of war.
Arthur S. Berger, spokesman for the American Jewish Committee, said, "Americans are aware that here is a country in many respects like the United States, also based on democratic principles, and it still doesn't have peace."
In some ways, said Mr. Hertzberg, the N.Y.U. professor, the relationship between Israel and the United States is "a marriage 50 years later."
"And in a marriage 50 years later," he added, "there are no longer violent transports of emotion, but you have a history together and you will continue.
"A long marriage works when all the things that got you married have receded into the background, and what keeps you going is a sense of shared history, knowledge of each other's foibles, of shared or unshared annoyance. It's what Henry Higgins says to Eliza: 'I've grown accustomed to your face.' "
 
The Series So Far
These articles focus on facets of Israel as it nears the anniversary of its independence, observed this year on April 30. The series, which began on April 6, has examined the country's social diversity; the controversy surrounding a history television series; the transformation of the economy, and the Palestinians.

How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted April 15 through 20 with 1,395 adults throughout the United States.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age and education. In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
To obtain sufficient numbers of Jewish Americans for analysis, callbacks were placed to every household in which a respondent had identified his or her religious preference as Jewish in Times/CBS Polls conducted during the past two years. Additional calls were also placed using random numbers within the same telephone exchanges as those respondents. The total number of interviews completed with Jewish Americans was 232. These respondents were then weighted down to the usual proportion of Jewish Americans in the poll.
For subgroups of the population the potential sampling error is larger. For example, for Jewish respondents taken as a group it is plus or minus seven percentage points. In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in question wording or the order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.

 A History of Berlin.

 BERLIN AND ITS CULTURE
 A Historical Portrait.

 For dramatic effect, a city's history is sometimes called a biography, but cities are living organisms only by courtesy. The individuals, social and professional groups and institutions that make them up are not easily treated as one. Generalizations may reveal truths beyond the specific fact, but in the process the fact itself may become blurred. Some writers try to neutralize the drawbacks of generalizing by personifying the city around a central trait: New York is brash, Paris is romantic, Berlin is -- or was -- militaristic. Like national character, however, the personality of a city is a doubtful explanatory device. If the trait has any substance, it needs to be explained.
Cities not only are amorphous, they may also experience extreme discontinuities in their history. Much of Berlin was destroyed in World War II, after which it was divided for decades. At times during these years it seemed that whatever unity the place possessed consisted of little more than its name.
Still, in one form or another Berlin has existed at least since the 13th century -- a further challenge to its interpreters. Not everyone can feel the same interest in such diverse topics as medieval trade policies and the municipal budget for the arts in the 1920's or 80's.
To mention one last problem: The question of what and what not to include, common to all historical writing, may be particularly troublesome in accounts of cities that are capitals of their countries. Because events elsewhere constantly affect this aspect of the city, historians may be tempted to make excursions into national history rather than remain focused on the subject.
In "Faust's Metropolis" Alexandra Richie surmounts some of these obstacles and stumbles over others. She has written a very long, pear-shaped book. About 165 pages of text and notes deal with the first 600 years of Berlin. Slightly more than 200 pages cover the next 70 years or so, and nearly 700 pages, almost two-thirds of the book, the years from the Weimar Republic to reunification. This allotment may reflect the interests of the author, who knows a great deal about Berlin's recent past. But it is more difficult to write a good concise account of hundreds of years than an expansive study of a much briefer period, and with a few exceptions -- for example, a fine discussion of the deplorable working-class housing built in Berlin from the 1850's on -- the first third of her book is not very good history.
For one thing, it is out of balance. The horrors of the Thirty Years' War are treated at length and somewhat repetitively, but an event of great significance in Berlin's history, the acquisition by the Hohenzollern dynasty of the Duchy of Prussia at the beginning of the war, goes unmentioned. Several paragraphs are devoted to a confusing discussion of the Prussian or German Army -- it is not made clear which -- under Emperor William II, but nothing is said about the Berlin garrison at the time, its strength, its impact on the population and the economy, its political functions, its links with the police. The interpretations of some of the Hohenzollern rulers border on caricature. Generalizations and stereotypes abound.
An example is the book's treatment of Berlin under the empire. It is shaped by two ideas: The Hohenzollern system was authoritarian, militaristic and class-ridden; and the Berlin middle classes were raw upstarts, boastful, arrogant to outsiders and subservient to authority. These traits were certainly present and probably grew stronger in the years before 1914. But they coexisted with other, healthier forces, not only among the general public -- a large part of which, whether socialist, liberal or conservative, wanted neither war abroad nor ideological strife at home -- but also in the city administration, the press and the Prussian bureaucracy, which often, if not often enough, kept even the Kaiser in check. It was these elements that gave the city much of its energy, creativity and economic and cultural sophistication. It is no criticism of the city to say that this was often the work of newcomers, who were attracted by opportunities in Berlin, as elsewhere people sought careers in London or Paris, and very likely a systematic comparison with other capitals is needed to gain a balanced picture of Berlin's strengths and defects. Setting Berlin next to London would, for instance, show that although William II blustered against the modern stage while his nephew King Edward VII maintained a discreet silence, Berliners could see modern plays that the Lord Chamberlain kept from Londoners. That the aggressive nationalism and racism infecting parts of German society grew to terrible proportions during and after World War I, and ended by destroying much of Europe, does not eliminate the positive aspects of Berlin before 1914, which any account of the city's past should analyze and place in context.
Factual errors are to be expected in a work of this size and sweep. But their number in the early chapters seems rather large. Especially in a book that levels much criticism at the privileges of the nobility under the empire, Gen. Erich von Ludendorff and Gen. Wilhelm von Groner should not be called nobles, nor was Ludendorff a field marshal. Ernst Arndt was not Brentano's co-editor of the collection of folk songs "Des Knaben Wunderhorn." Justus Moser was not a conservative critic of late-l9th-century Berlin; he died in 1794. Ernst Barlach and Max Klinger, both major figures in modern German art, did not serve "at the front" in World War I. Adolf von Menzel's painting "Traveling Through the Countryside" (1892) is not "one of the first pictures to depict rail travel," but his "Berlin-Potsdam Railway" (1847) is. And so forth. Historical writing is a dialogue between large themes and the details that constitute and illustrate them, and here the dialogue too often breaks down.
With the end of World War I, the book takes a decided turn for the better. The author has a good sense of the social, political and cultural forces at work in Berlin in the 1920's and under Hitler, and her perspective deepens.
She continues to take a critical view of her subject, not only of the Berliners' attitudes and politics, but also of the legends that have developed around these years. The cultural efflorescence of the 1920's was certainly remarkable; but, as she points out, much of it had its roots in the empire, and it affected only a small part of Berlin: "Even when avant-garde culture was at its height the majority of Berliners were ignorant of it, even frightened by it." Richie is equally critical of the ideological naivete of many of the artists and intellectuals of the time, and even more so of the Communists and their destructive politics. That in November 1932, in the last free elections held before the Nazis took power, only 30 percent of the Berlin electorate voted for Hitler she rightly considers less significant than the fact that with the Communist and right-wing nationalist vote, 70 percent of the voters supported enemies of the republic -- not a firm basis for opposition to the Nazis, either in 1933 or later, when the nature of the Third Reich should have been apparent to all.
The Nazi years and their pathetic climax, the Battle of Berlin, are not so much analyzed as dramatically described. It seems excessive to condemn President Franklin D. Roosevelt's order to halt American forces on the Elbe as "criminally stupid." But the account of the Russian occupation and the beginning of the cold war is good, as are the chapters on the divided city. Here the author is at her best, perhaps because she has lived in both East and West Berlin, and her treatment of the politics and ways of life on the two sides of the wall is sharpened by personal experience. Characteristic are shrewd discussions of the physical and psychological isolation of West Berlin, for decades a pampered outpost of the Western alliance, and of the encompassing corruption in the East, which pushed millions of East Germans into yet another morass of lies, denunciations and persecution, and created one more difficult past for Berliners to overcome.
In Richie's account of Berlin over the centuries, culture is one strand among many. For Ronald Taylor in "Berlin and Its Culture," the city's "cultural spirit" and activity since the Middle Ages form the principal theme. Taylor takes a rather narrow view of his subject. He largely ignores popular culture and even his view of high culture is somewhat restricted. He says almost nothing, for instance, about the historians of the University of Berlin in the 19th and early 20th century, whose writings strongly influenced German thought and art and were themselves works of high literary quality, companions to novels and drama on the bookshelves of the educated public. His book does include a brief discussion of the Berlin film industry; but it centers on the same few works -- from "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" to "Metropolis" and "The Blue Angel" -- that appear in every history of the period, while the far larger output of popular love stories and comedies, with their important social and political implications, goes unnoticed. Essentially "Berlin and Its Culture" is limited to the art, architecture, literature and music for upper-class patrons and a middle-class audience.
The result is neither a comprehensive guide nor an analytic interpretation, but has features of both. Some subjects are treated at length; others, often of comparable importance, are summarized or barely mentioned. When the author allows himself space to discuss a particular artist or stylistic development he can be informative and interesting. The 100 pages on the culture of Berlin since 1945 are especially good. Short essays on major figures are scattered through the text; usually they present a brief general account and a more detailed discussion of one or two major achievements. This works well enough, especially with novelists and dramatists.
But often Taylor proceeds differently. His approach then resembles that of a tour guide through the museum of the city's culture, who identifies an object, perhaps briefly characterizes it, and moves to the next. If nothing else, the reader is given an overview; but extreme brevity leads to ambiguity, and even inaccuracies. Much ground is covered with little more than lists of names, the curse of the textbook, and it is almost axiomatic that these lists contain mistakes.
It is the strength of "Berlin and Its Culture" that it brings together many subjects that are usually discussed separately; its weakness that despite good sections it isn't more consistent and it remains a chronicle rather than a comprehensive interpretation. Certainly Taylor has not been able to identify the "cultural spirit" that he mentions at the beginning of his work.
But most likely that spirit varied from one to the other of the city's many lives. The sparse, cool, ironic, critical sense that marked some of Berlin's greatest cultural achievements in the 19th century surely was replaced by very different traits before World War I, and by others again during the Third Reich, with only a trace of former styles touching a few receptive minds in later years. Today, as the city is in a slow transition to become the capital of Germany once again, a still different cultural spirit will emerge, together with new social and political attitudes. How Berliners deal with the city's fragmented past, especially how they come to terms with the behavior and experiences of the immediately preceding generations, will help shape these attitudes. Alexandra Richie's and Ronald Taylor's books, though they do not succeed in everything they set out to do, at least indicate, each in its own way, the riches, disasters and challenges that are part of Berlin's past.

HEADLINE: The World: Democracy's Desert;
A Rising Tide of Freedom Bypasses the Arab World

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
PRESIDENT CLINTON was at it again in Latin America last weekend, congratulating democratically elected leaders of countries that not long ago were better known for their dictators. Barely weeks before his visit to Chile, the President was delivering the same encouraging pat on the back to Africans. In June in China, he will no doubt be touting the virtues of democracy again, hoping Beijing will soon match its economic liberalization with more of the political kind.
Just as well that the President isn't planning a trip to the Arab world any time soon. 
 Here is perhaps the one region where the end of the cold war has brought the least progress toward democracy, and very little hope for it. Even the United States, which raises the question of democracy with great frequency elsewhere, has shied away from that in the Arab world. Its policy has remained fixated on supporting Israel, protecting access to oil and averting war.
But this is an age when Latin American dictators have seemingly vanished overnight, when democracy has buried Communism in Russia and Eastern Europe, when democracy movements sprout in Africa and Asia even where the cause can seem most hopeless -- witness China -- and when even the non-Arab Middle Eastern lands of Iran and Turkey have been fighting political battles through the medium of elections, however imperfect by Western standards.
Today, by contrast, a great many Arabs remain the subjects of kings and sheiks whose rule, even when enlightened, is always personal. And in recent decades, many others have fallen under tyrants: Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya, Hafez al-Assad of Syria, Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
Even Egypt, where political and intellectual life once flourished, has been technically under martial law for half a century. And despite the democratic longings of intellectuals in the region, the great political drama being played out across the Arab world has been something else: the battle between advocates of Islamic rule and secular rule.
Why, then, has democracy -- or at least popular pressure for it -- not surged across the Arab world, where one-fifth of the world's people live, in the last decade of the 20th century?
Experts hunting for an explanation look variously into history, religion, social patterns, desert expanses, a weakness for strongmen as leaders, and an obsession with opposing Zionism (now recharged by a dying Israeli-Palestinian peace process).
With a few notable exceptions, these experts explain, the Arab people have no history of democracy. Yes, they have had brushes with Western empires -- notably the British and French -- that left democratic institutions in their wake in other places like India, Africa and the West Indies. But for many Arabs the most sustained contact with foreign rule was the Turkish Ottoman Empire, which was emphatically not remembered for building democracy.
Fouad Ajami, a leading interpreter of the Arab world, offers an additional explanation: Rather than following political philosophies, Arabs have been more often been seduced into glorious romances and reckless flings with fantasies of a greater Arab civilization. These fantasies, he says, never could deliver on what they promised.
Mr. Ajami says Arab nationalists like Nasser at first appealed to their masses with a promise to "solve the question of the place of the Arabs in the modern world." The promise was doomed to be broken, but that was not clear in the 1960's, 1970's and 1980's, when when a number of undemocratic Arab countries got rich on oil, and the workers and middle classes alike set aside dreams of reform. Then Muslim militants came along, playing on equally large-scale themes of a resurgent Arab people uniting and purifying themselves.
Edward Said, a Columbia University scholar and author who has devoted much of his career to studying the interplay between the Arabs and the West, argues that many young Arabs no longer believe in these absolutist, overarching dreams of a grandeur that replaces political life. They look to India, he said, where a fierce nationalism aroused by the independence movement adapted itself to democratic politics.
Independence came to the Arabs in different garb. "From the day the Arabs walked their way out of the wreckage of the Ottoman Empire in the immediate aftermath of the First World War, the question that has engaged the minds of the very best and most politically conscious Arabs was nationalism," said Mr. Ajami, now director of Middle East studies at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies. "Where nationalism is the main issue, the demand for democracy always takes second place."
Mr. Said acknowledges that the world the Arabs created is now marked by censorship and self-censorship, intellectual alienation or exile and political silence. In the case of Iraq, there is state terror and total repression. And everywhere the lure of nationalism still has some life. Intellectuals from Beirut to Cairo to Rabat have applauded Saddam Hussein's vitriolic rejection of Israel and defiance of the United States. "Except for Lebanon and to a certain degree Egypt, institutionalized democracy in the way most people understand the term doesn't really exist in the Arab world," Mr. Said said.
Still, he says, "there is a fairly vigorous contest in most Arab countries between the authority on one hand and on the other intellectual, artistic, grassroots opposition, which is very vociferous in demanding democracy. That's been ignored."
Morocco's new Prime Minister, Abdulrahman al-Youssifi, a Socialist, was a vice president of the leading Arab human rights organization, and his appointment by King Hassan II draws attention to the ambivalence of Arab monarchies, which have been a source of both progress and regression. In Jordan, King Hussein has opened up considerable democratic space, and political parties flourish . But Mr. Ajami cautions that "this is democracy from above, democracy by grant and it can be taken back."
 
Islam's Mixed Influence
Islam has been another source of mixed influence. It is at heart egalitarian, with a commitment d to public welfare. But it preaches a unity of religion and state that can be interpreted to stifle secularism and free choice while hobbling the law, education, and women and family life.
Islam does not preclude democracy, as Malaysia and Bangladesh demonstrate. Turkey and to a still-uncertain extent Iran also have functioning electoral systems, if restricted political choice. But more often the recent impact of Islam has been a chilling one; openings to democracy are seized by militant Islamists who, critics say, offer the prospect of "one man, one vote, one time."
Mr. Ajami points to Algeria, where the specter of an Islamic electoral victory led the Government to cancel an opening to democracy. That experience, and the brutal war that followed, have made moderates timid everywhere.
"You must have the self-confidence to have democratic politics," Mr. Ajami said. "If what happened in Algeria is used as a model, there will never be democratic elections." He and others think Egypt, with its democratic tradition dulled by the Nasser, Sadat and Mubarak years, could still lead the way by restoring full democracy. If that happened, he said, "the political landscape of the Arabs would immediately change."
 
Tribal Splits
But the middle class has to do more than vote, said Phebe Marr, author of a history of Iraq. "You have to start with opening society and building attitudes of tolerance. You have to build institutions: women's organizations, a more open press." A society that doesn't debate issues will, when presented with political opportunity, often split along ethnic or tribal lines, she said.
The Arab world is quite susceptible, said Joseph Chamie, head of the Population Division at the United Nations and the son of Lebanese immigrants. "They are not one people," he said, "Their history was basically tribal, with people isolated by great distances and environment."
A number of experts and Arab-Americans interviewed think the United States has not done enough to foster democracy among Arabs, and they focus on America's unquestioning support for some of the region's least democratic, most conservative regimes, like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Mr. Said said Americans haven't noticed enough that in the Arab world today "people are trying constantly to test and push the limits of what is allowed by the regime, by the religious authorities."
"There's a very strong discussion within the Islamic world on the question of what is modernity," he said. "The old rhetoric is discredited; there is a new language now." He said television, foreign publications and the Internet are steadily eroding old isolations. Mr. Ajami says he would like to be optimistic too, but has been wrong before in prophesying the birth of a new order. "As the Arabs knock at the gate of the 21st century, can they bid farewell to the cluster of ideas that nationalism, the struggle against the West, the alibi of the struggle against Israel such prime importance in their lives?" he asked. "Can they hold their rulers accountable? Can they reclaim their politics?"
In other words, can they reform their political life without the detour, the excuse of nationalism? "It's up to them."

HEADLINE: Rewarding the Best, Forgetting the Rest

BYLINE: By Nicholas Lemann; Nicholas Lemann, the national correspondent of The Atlantic Monthly, is the author of a forthcoming book on meritocracy in the United States.

 BODY:
A few weeks ago, the Educational Testing Service threw itself a 50th anniversary party in Trenton. Searchlights played against the sky, Tom Brokaw and Secretary of Education Richard Riley gave speeches, and Vice President Al Gore and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey offered their videotaped congratulations. E.T.S.'s 93-year-old founding president, Henry Chauncey, stood up and took a bow.
The founding of E.T.S., the organization that administers the S.A.T. and many other standardized tests, is a symbol for something broader: the development, in the middle decades of the 20th century, of a national personnel system. 
 Before World War II, it was almost impossible for schools or employers to perform straight-up comparisons of people from all over the country; people got ahead through informal networks and apprenticeship systems. The reason that top colleges began using the S.A.T., for example, was that they were simply unable to evaluate potential students who were not boarding school graduates.
Today, there is no official Government office that sets the rules for everyone's career, but in field after field -- law and medicine, academe, finance, consulting, government -- there is a codified, rational system of evaluation and advancement that has grown up in the past 50 years. It usually begins with tests and degrees, and then moves on to some system of formal review by colleagues. We can nationally rank 4-year-olds through a test called the E.R.B. and full professors through peer review panels.
These rankings bring with them opportunities and rewards -- or not, depending on where a person ranks. The system doesn't have an official name, but it's often referred to as "the meritocracy."
The meritocracy is a little like the parable of the blind men and the elephant: you're always highly aware of the piece of it that affects you personally, but it's difficult to perceive the whole thing at once.
We are obsessed with testing and ranking in our own lives as well as our children's. We avidly follow the public dramas the system produces. Robert Barro, a star economics professor at Harvard, couldn't decide whether to jump to Columbia, which had offered him a $300,000 salary, a subsidized apartment and a $55,000 sinecure for his wife. The City of New Orleans gave a 50 percent pay increase to its police chief, Richard Pennington, to keep him from taking a job in Washington. The University of California at Berkeley was forced to abolish affirmative action, and therefore accepted a freshman class with substantially reduced numbers of African-Americans, Hispanics and American Indians.
All these are meritocracy stories: the road to economist, police chief and many other high posts begins with standardized tests, and it was the enforced and increased reliance on S.A.T. scores that produced those Berkeley admissions results.
But our understanding of the purpose of the meritocratic system is badly warped. It wasn't meant to be a way of distributing money and prestige. It was meant to be a way of making the whole society strong and coherent. Michael Young, the British sociologist who invented the word "meritocracy" in 1958, cobbled it together from a Latin prefix, meaning worth, and a Greek suffix, meaning rule. The American meritocracy today is all prefix and no suffix. We're totally focused on the question of who possesses merit and don't pay nearly enough attention to the overall good.
When the system was set up, in the late 1940's, the idea was to generate a new kind of leadership for the country. We had just won World War II thanks in part to the expertise of European emigre scientists. The cold war was looming. Our economy had already become industrial and was quickly becoming technological. The size and scope of Government had grown rapidly.
We seemed to need a small group of highly trained technocrat-statesmen who would make sure we won our competition with the Soviets on the research front, who could run the large, complex organizations on which our society increasingly depended, and who could devise ways to make the promise of democracy and opportunity come true for all Americans.
The founders of the American meritocracy -- the most prominent of whom was James Bryant Conant, the president of Harvard -- wanted to expand educational opportunity, but in a way that paid close attention to the rank-ordering of students and that carefully selected and nurtured a small group at the top. (Conant was the leading opponent of the G.I. Bill, because every veteran with a high school degree qualified.) Federal financing of high-end university research, introduced at the same time by the same people, would empower the very brightest to guard the strength of the nation.
The members of the new meritocratic elite were supposed to be selfless and public spirited, philosopher kings who would rise from obscurity, serve and then step aside and give someone else a turn. Conant called this type "the American radical": hater of social stratification, champion of public rather than private education, staunch opponent of inherited privilege.
"He springs from the American soil," Conant wrote in 1943, "firm in the belief that every man is as good as his neighbor, if not better, and is entitled to a real chance for a decent living."
The founders of the American meritocracy wildly underestimated how important competitive, market behavior would become in their new system. In the 1940's, bidding wars over talent went on in the United States, but they were confined to the movie industry, professional sports and to some extent business (though much less so than now).
The university, in particular, was assumed to be morally purer than the larger world. As a 1935 report from the Carnegie Foundation put it, "The democracy of merit on the campus, though far from perfect, is finer than that of the street."
But it turned out that various natural, if not elevated, human impulses -- greed, self-aggrandizement, preoccupation with rank and prestige, the desire to obtain special advantage and to pass it on to one's children -- could flourish just as easily within the bounds of a meritocracy as outside of them.
When the elite universities went from being bastions of scholarship that stood apart from the commercial world to being the channel to most good jobs, their atmosphere changed. When the new apparatus of testing and research grants made possible a star system that generated money, students and admiration from colleagues and the public, the energy of people in universities would be directed at getting those rewards, rather than to unpaid public service.
Because the American meritocracy was set up privately, without public debate, the public never really bought into the idea of being led by the new, highly educated elite. The country has become more populist than James Bryant Conant and his colleagues ever imagined, and this has meant that the new elite is less revered and less influential than it was meant to be.
As a result, its ambitions have become more private and careerist. There is no countervailing force to an overwhelming preoccupation with selection and ranking; what began as a means to a broader end has become an end in itself.
 Hence the current American meritocracy: a system that is good at selecting and compensating superstars, that generates never-ending conflict over how rewards are distributed, but that has lost its public and moral dimension. The questions we ask about the meritocracy -- mostly variants on "Who gets the goods?" -- are far too narrow. Does the elite serve the public, as well as itself? Do most Americans get, through the education system or otherwise, the skills they need to lead a good, decent life? Meritocracy should be a system of governance, not a contest over spoils.

HEADLINE: BACKTALK -- THE BAT, THE BALL, THE BRONX;
Help Out the Little Guy, New York: Set a Standard

BYLINE: By JAY WEINER; Jay Weiner covers stadium and arena issues for The Minnesota Star Tribune.

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS

 BODY:
It does my small-town heart good to watch from afar the percolating stadium debate in your big city. New Yorkers often think that the world revolves around them. But, the professional sports world actually deals its ugliest -- and most expensive -- hand most starkly in the middle-size cities of this country.
For example, we here in Minnesota have lived in the belly of the pro sports beast the past five years and might be able to teach you a thing or two about what to watch for. 
 Since 1993, one National Hockey League team moved out of this cradle of pucks and rinks because its owner was, ostensibly, unhappy with his arena. Soon after, the owners of the National Basketball Association team, who privately built their arena, nearly went belly up on their mortgage, and threatened to move the team. The city of Minneapolis came to the rescue and bought the arena.
Both the Major League Baseball Twins and the National Football League Vikings have sought new stadiums. The Twins have one foot out the door, heading, perhaps, for North Carolina. The Vikings are, at least, on the verge of seeking a $125 million renovation of a 15-year-old stadium that most Minnesotans find perfectly O.K. Just last month, an N.H.L. expansion team got a $130 million state and city subsidy to begin play in the year 2000 in a new arena.
We have seen and heard it all.
It may seem today that your stadium wars began with the dramatic plunge of a Yankee Stadium girder. But all stadium fights are rooted in the out-of-control economics of pro sports and in the deep-seated feeling, among some community leaders, that sports create a certain civic spirituality that can't be provided by other art forms.
The economics demand that the teams get as much revenue as possible to pay for an enterprise that can't control itself. Thus, any tax -- however creative -- that your mayor may recommend will simply be a pass-through to owners and players who need to feed an insatiable appetite.
At the same time, you will hear -- and there will be some truth to it -- that few things bring a city together as easily as a World Series or Super Bowl championship.
That's why in cities the size of Minneapolis and St. Paul, pro sports are often referred to as important "amenities," those social accouterments that make us distinctive from Omaha and Des Moines. In New York, that seems to be a tougher argument to make -- you have more culture in five city blocks than we have in two cities -- but, undoubtedly, you will become familiar with the refrain that the Yankees and the Mets are critical to the community fabric.
That is a judgment you must weigh against the costs of a facility -- $1 billion for a new Yankees stadium seems a little high to this fiscally responsible Minnesotan -- and against the real economic impact of a pair of public works projects.
Pardon the mention of that 14-letter phrase "economic impact." But you are already being bombarded with studies showing that a new Yankee Stadium in Manhattan will produce hundreds of millions of dollars that wouldn't otherwise be there but for the ball park. And experts from universities will call all the studies by the accounting firms "hogwash" and worse.
Forget economic impact studies and and their critics; they are like psychologists taking sides at a murder trial. Instead, go with your hearts and common-sense heads while answering some basic questions:
Should owners and players get the benefits of tax subsidies? Will New York be a better place for it, and worse without it? Can you justify using a tax for stadiums as schools crumble and hospitals lay off workers? Is baseball a sport worth investing in at the turn of the 21st century?
Beyond those fundamental questions, there are other lessons to be learned from the stadium battles here in the hinterlands.
If you decide to pay for it -- or if the political leaders simply force it upon you -- at the very least, make sure the stadium deal has some soul. Smaller cities have learned harsh lessons about the "public-private partnership" that is paraded out before us during a stadium's birth. In most cases, the public provides the dough, the private captures the insuring revenues. And the partnership? It withers away.
That's why it's imperative that the long-term operations of stadiums should, at least, take the public into account. How? A few suggestions:
*The Yankees and the Mets must open their books to the community so that people know what their tax dollars are going to. To their credit, the Twins and Vikings agreed to rigorous audits by the stadium authority in the process of justifying public financing. If a team won't reveal its financial situation, then it can't expect to get the cash.
*Both the Yankees' and Mets' stadiums must be open for use by New York's public schools and any local Little League or youth baseball programs. Indeed, a percentage of concession sales, suite rentals and parking should be dedicated to improving the city's school sports programs.
*If the city's residents support the Yankees and Mets with high attendance, then the taxpayers should be compensated. Some leases around the nation kick back tax dollars to communities. If either the Yankees or the Mets draws three million fans, they should return some revenues to the city.
*The players -- who will benefit tremendously from the revenues of a new stadium -- must guarantee their community service. Detailed in the lease with the city, specific terms must be established that require players to conduct clinics, visit schools and community centers and behave within the laws of New York City. Generally speaking, each player should be required to participate in one community event a month. If players don't fulfill that obligation, the teams should be penalized by the city.
*The teams must guarantee that a large percentage of the seats in the stadium will be affordable. A formula should be devised to insure that a high percentage of tickets in the new stadiums will always be as cheap as, say, a movie ticket.
*Arts organizations -- which would salivate over the sort of subsidy the baseball teams might get -- should leverage the stadium debate to their advantage. Don't the arts provide even more cultural identity to New York than baseball? The team must come to the table with arts organizations and design ways that the new stadium -- as early as its construction phase -- can benefit painters, dancers, actors and musicians.
Ground zero of the stadium debate has been in communities such as Milwaukee, Seattle, Pittsburgh and Minneapolis, not so much in the larger markets of New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. But I suspect and hope that the struggle over your new ball parks, and the political clout of New York, will elevate the consciousness of leagues and Congress to reform the infrastructure of professional sports.
Perhaps your outrage over public financing -- or your creativity in achieving it thoughtfully -- will change things nationally in ways that we little people out here can't. You've got a big job before you. Make us Minnesotans proud of you.

Nays and Ayes for Capitalism as Purveyor of Culture

BYLINE: By Edward Rothstein 

 BODY:
"Two Cheers for Capitalism," was the way Irving Kristol once heralded his measured acclaim for the marketplace and its freedoms. But when it comes to culture and the arts, the growing tendency is to give capitalism no more than one cheer. And that is of the Bronx variety.
The indictment is considerable. Look at what the forces of the marketplace have wrought, say capitalism's critics: In writing, style is often dumbed down; mass taste is pandered to. In the world of art music, avatars of sophisticated styles go on the dole, while second-rate pop music sells out stadiums. 
 Every major cultural institution, from the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the New York Public Library to Lincoln Center would collapse immediately if it were at the mercy of market forces. That is, in fact, pretty much what happened when Communism fell and state-supported cultural institutions became subject to the whims of the marketplace.
Now, a handful of entertainment conglomerates have become the main suppliers of cultural products, and even popular arts, it is argued, have suffered under their watch, with films dominated by spectacle and special effects, and television talk shows by Springerism.
There is even an intellectual foundation for the dismay. The condemnation of capitalism's effect on culture was pioneered in mid-century Germany by the Frankfurt School of Marxist thinkers, who tended to see capitalism's pleasures as a mass drug, distracting the populace from more important matters.
And the sociologist Daniel Bell suggested in "The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism" that capitalism and culture are almost doomed to lock horns. Capitalism requires a rational political order and a certain amount of discipline and restraint to plan for the future and ply its current wares. But a capitalist culture like the one that has developed in recent decades doesn't value the kind of patience and asceticism that sociologists like Max Weber associated with the origins of capitalism. Instead, capitalist culture values self-gratification and novelty. The result, Mr. Bell suggests, is a nihilistic culture commonly known as post-modern.
But is there any chance of at least one halfhearted cheer? One way to feel more sanguine about capitalism's influence is to be more welcoming of the variety the marketplace produces: virtue in the midst of plenty. This is an approach taken in a new book, "In Praise of Commercial Culture" (Harvard University Press), by Tyler Cowen, an economist. He argues that capitalism and commerce, far from corrupting the arts, help them develop. Mr. Cowen calls himself a cultural optimist and says we are living in a fabulously creative and fertile epoch.
Indeed, he thinks some of the misunderstandings about capitalism's negative impact come from cultural pessimists who see value mainly in the elite styles of the past and not in the plenty of today. He loves all varieties of sights and sounds, praising the marketplace for providing access to the music of the Pygmies of Central Africa as well as the compositions of Pierre Boulez.
Well-developed markets, he argues, support diversity, encourage experimentation, allow for high and low culture to interact. In fact, he suggests, the differences between popular entertainments and high artistic achievement are mainly matters of economics. High-cost artistic forms like film must find the largest audience. And low-cost forms like poetry can afford to seek more gourmet tastes. Capital-intensive arts are often popular; labor-intensive arts tend to be elite.
For a critic like myself who is both a cultural pessimist and a lover of sights and sounds, this is a bit too sweeping, making art seem like just another medium of exchange in which fame and money trade hands. Yes, art has flourished during periods of great economic growth, whether in Renaissance Florence or in 19th-century England. Surely capitalism does spur artistic innovation. But something other than capitalism is involved. And something other than economics determines art's importance.
Handel wrote music for a paying audience. That doesn't mean, as the conductor Roger Norrington once suggested, that today he would be writing ad jingles. The marketplace has always been a part of artistic creation: Rembrandt's studio manufactured works in the master's style; Dickens wrote novels for popular serialization; Brahms made an exceptionally comfortable living from publishers who sold his scores to avid amateurs. But that doesn't mean that the modern-day counterparts of Rembrandt, Dickens and Brahms are Andy Warhol, Judith Krantz and Andrew Lloyd Webber.
Something different has taken place in recent decades. The complaints may be similar, but the results are not. There is plenty of good work to be found, but the greatest seems so much less substantial and certainly much more marginal than the greatest of past eras. In music, for instance, I may admire Elliott Carter's string quartets, but they will never become as important to our society or art as Beethoven's were to his; we are likely to treat them as favorite products of a small subculture, cohabiting with competing claims on our attention.
This may have something to do with the ways in which, as Mr. Bell suggested, capitalism and culture interact. Capitalism, after all, is not a utopian enterprise; it was not established to promote a particular view of human nature and its possibilities. It is, instead, a reflection of the fact that human nature is desirous, that it yearns for things, places, people, possibilities. Capitalism is a matter of trade: it allows some satisfaction of one's desire if one helps satisfy someone else's. Build a better mousetrap, and someday you can vacation in Tahiti.
But the cultural marketplace at one time had a different texture. What creates culture is not just the satisfaction of desire, but the actual creation of values that shape desire. That value has to come from outside the marketplace and, when it does, it creates a context for the market, adding worth to some achievements, denying it to others. Constraints on desire were once commonly proffered by religion, artistic traditions or the disciplines of a craft. Art flourishes because of capitalism, but it has also flourished because of capitalism's limits, its restraints.
It may be that one problem today is that this notion of constraint is thought of solely in legal and political terms, rather than being understood as one of the primary roles of culture itself. Right now we are often not just multiculturists, but aculturists, not acknowledging any over-arching series of beliefs, values or practices. So the failures of capitalism may well be due to the failures of contemporary culture rather than the other way around. Capitalism gives us the art we desire; but only culture -- culture in its broadest sense -- can help provide the art we deserve.

A shift so fundamental that not even Microsoft may know how to respond.

BYLINE: By Denise Caruso 

 BODY:
THE Microsoft Corporation has a longstanding reputation in the personal computer industry as a schoolyard bully. But recent public scrutiny has propelled the company's swaggering reputation into the mainstream. And predicting the software giant's eventual demise has expanded into something of a national parlor game.
Even the venerable Silicon Valley research institute, SRI International, which rarely chimes in on the ideological events of the day, is now "pondering the unthinkable," as it says in its speculative report "After Microsoft" (http://future.sri.com/bip/AM.html). 
 The SRI report, actually a faux newsletter article written by the senior consultant Robert Jacobson from the vantage point of the year 2003, describes a software industry in which Microsoft has "devolved" into five separate Baby Softs.
Although the current antitrust investigations do figure in Mr. Jacobson's chronicle of the company's fictional collapse, it also cites other, equally prominent factors: failure of key products to perform as promised; cross-industry competition from large publishers and media companies; unwise investments in risky new industries, and "a decline in Bill Gates's focus and ability to micromanage the company."
But whether Microsoft stands or falls, an additional and larger force will be buffeting the company, a force already making an impact not only on Microsoft but almost every other large corporation.
That force is technology itself.
Consider how the increasing power of technology has contributed to the vast chaos of mergers, acquisitions and strategy shifts in today's business world. Even as giant conglomerates are forming -- as in financial services, where the current fad is toward mammoth providers of "one stop shopping" -- PC's and the global Internet are creating an increasingly favorable economic climate for smaller, more nimble companies, niche markets and customized products and services.
Corporations serving mass markets, always at the mercy of their snail-paced bureaucracies and substantial overhead, are square in the path of this inexorable march.
For example, desktop publishing, a stunning success for the PC industry in the 1980's, turned the once-monolithic publishing industry upside down, with new magazines, alternative newspapers and small book houses set up by writers and editors who could never afford access to old-line commercial printing presses. A decade later, not only are PC's serving as printing presses but the World Wide Web is providing global distribution for desktop publications.
Ditto alternative music and independent film: any of the countless bands or independent studios that have mixed (and sometimes even mastered) their own CD's, or edited film or videos on a desktop computer, can testify that the cost of production has plummeted. Using the Internet these artists can market their work -- and eventually distribute it -- outside the conventional clogged and costly sales channels.
And recall that last year a long-distance telephone service reseller named Tel-Save offered America Online's customers what was then the lowest rate in the industry, 9 cents a minute, largely because the on-line service eliminated the need for direct marketing, advertising or billing. A year later, Tel-Save has half a million customers through America Online.
Information technology, in short, is creating a shift so fundamental that not even a PC pioneer like Microsoft may know how to respond. The company is so huge, and to date has proved so unwilling to relinquish any control of its markets, that the SRI report suggests the software giant may collapse under its own weight.
Mr. Jacobson contends that Microsoft customers are already tiring of bloated software that seems designed to take up the largest possible amount of space on a hard drive, to require the largest possible amount of computer memory and to contain every conceivable feature for the largest possible market of users. (Early indications are that Microsoft's imminent Windows 98 does not reverse the bloatware trend.)
Just as in other industries transformed by technology, software buyers are no longer bound to accept what Microsoft chooses for them.
Instead, customers may begin reaping benefits from the growing popularity of the "open source code" and component software movements, which encourage programmers and the most motivated users to customize the inner workings of operating systems and application programs. Even consumers who today prefer Microsoft's choices might eventually be swayed by the benefits brought by these movements.
Such trends, though, are antithetical to today's Microsoft, whose success is based on controlling its Windows operating system and mass-market sales of general purpose -- not customized -- software.
Thus, the emergent leaders may turn out to be niche producers who can quickly form and reform their businesses to respond to individual customers -- a trend already in play on the Web, where software designers create "plug in" modules that provide various types of functions upon request.
This clash between mass and niche market seems so primal that the only analogy with sufficient drama is of dying dinosaurs and the darting little mammals that survived them.
So far, only one dinosaur -- the former AT&T Corporation, which itself was once the target of the Justice Department's antitrust squad -- saw and embraced mammalian fleet-of-foot tactics as a survival strategy. Having undergone a court-supervised divestiture in 1984, the corporation decided a decade later that it was still too big and could succeed only by voluntarily dismantling itself into three separate companies. So far, all three are not simply surviving, but growing and thriving.
Does AT&T provide a model that unwieldy corporations everywhere should emulate? It is far too early to say. And it is highly unlikely that technology will decimate all large companies in its path, not by the year 2003, anyway. But certainly something is afoot -- something much more fundamental than Microsoft's recent mediagenic missteps.

HEADLINE: U.S. Theme Can Make a Film a Tough Sell Abroad

BYLINE: By LINDA LEE 

 BODY:
John Travolta made the cover of Time magazine around the world a month ago, timed to the release of his movie "Primary Colors" in the United States. But as international distributors are discovering, a hot star like Mr. Travolta may not be enough to draw audiences abroad.
"Travolta is not a star to attract fans to the theaters by himself," said Makoto Sekimoto, managing director of the marketing department of Toho-Towa/Marubeni, a Japanese media company. 
 Herbert Kloiber, the owner of Tele-Munchen, a German television and movie company, was more negative. "He may be pretty much a liability here," Mr. Kloiber said. "He's a loud proponent of Scientology, and Germans are not too keen on that."
In France, Mr. Travolta is not a sure thing either, based on the box office there for his recent movies. " 'Michael' and 'Phenomenon' were not good results," said Philippe Hellmann, president of UGCph, a French film distribution and exhibition company. " 'Mad City,' no. 'Face Off' was the only one that did well."
It might sound as if these movie executives were sniping at someone else's decision to distribute "Primary Colors" abroad. But "Primary Colors" is their movie, bought through a partnership called Mutual Film International.
Ninety-five percent of the world's population lives outside the United States, a fact that has not escaped movie distributors, who are eager to market American films like "Titanic" and the coming "Godzilla" from Punta Arenas, Chile, to Novosibirsk, Russia. But economies of scale do not always apply in dealing with hundreds of different markets with different cultures and tastes.
Add in the vagaries of national economic fortunes and currency exchange rates and the result is a business as risky as producing the movie itself. This is a lesson that companies like Carolco have learned the hard way, leading to failure.
It is especially risky with a film like "Primary Colors" that looked impressive, got strong reviews and then sank domestically. The $65 million movie, in which Mr. Travolta plays a clone of President Clinton, has taken in only around $36 million in the United States -- and selling it elsewhere will be a challenge.
Yet executives involved in the international movie market believe that American films that strive to do something more than star Schwarzenegger, Willis or Stallone and blow things up can sell well overseas.
"The market has transcended the days of car chases and explosions," said Jim Gianopulos, president of 20th Century Fox International. "Clearly, those films still have a great appeal, and an 'Independence Day' will do enormous business internationally. But 'The Full Monty,' an emotionally driven human story, can appeal to audiences all over the world." Fox, Warner Brothers and Disney are considered the leaders in distributing films internationally.
"The Full Monty," which is distributed by Fox and was produced by its Fox Searchlight division, has pulled in $46 million at box offices in the United States and $195 million in the rest of the world. Meanwhile, "Titanic," distributed internationally by Fox, topped $1 billion abroad over the weekend, compared with more than $560 million in the United States. "Titanic" has made more than $100 million in four countries -- Britain, Germany, France and Japan. Notably, companies from those four countries are partners in Mutual Film International, which is based in Los Angeles.
"On big movies, in key territories, the split can go to 60-40 or 65-35," Mr. Kloiber of Tele-Munchen said, with the higher numbers reflecting the international box office and the lower numbers the American take.
It is in search of these kinds of successes that Mutual, headed in the United States by Gary Levinsohn and Mark Gordon, has pooled money from its French, German and Japanese partners, as well as BBC Television of Britain, to buy American films. "It's basically a consortium of end users," Mr. Levinsohn said.
Those end users -- representing distributors, exhibitors, videotape companies, television and cable networks, satellite companies and others -- provide money to Mutual, which then buys international rights. "The studio is looking to spread their risk," Mr. Levinsohn said. "Ultimately we're managing money, managing risk. And we're giving distributors access to films that otherwise they don't get access to."
Mutual buys American movies for a figure that can reach 60 percent of the total budget. "Primary Colors" was bought last year for around $35 million in a package of five films from Universal. In return Mutual's partners get international rights to distribute the films, sell them to cable and broadcast and put them out on video. (Japan counts for 25 percent of the international video market by itself.)
Mutual has succeeded with "The Jackal," an action film that has made $83 million abroad (and is still to open in Japan) versus $55 million in the United States.
"I would love all my films to get these numbers," Mr. Hellmann said.
"Primary Colors" is expected to get a boost from opening the Cannes International Film Festival on May 13. But the movie -- which opens in France on the same day and in Britain, German and Japan in the fall -- presents a particular challenge because it is about American politics and closely parallels scandals concerning President Clinton.
"In Japan, Clinton is not a star at all," Mr. Sekimoto of Toho-Towa said. He said that his company would probably have the most difficulty of the four partners in getting an audience for "Primary Colors."
In Britain, BBC Television is concerned with the eventual television audience for "Primary Colors," since the film will be distributed there by another company. "People here are extremely interested in President Clinton as a world leader," said Alan Howden, controller for program acquisition for BBC Television. But, he allowed, "it would have been better if the new scandal hadn't happened -- it's a bit of a marketing problem."
Unsurprisingly, Paula Jones and company are petite pommes for the French. "A sex scandal, it doesn't mean the same thing in France and the U.S.," Mr. Hellmann of UGCph said. "Our last president had three different families, and no one cared about that."
But there is still a chance for the film in Europe, where the director, Mike Nichols, has a sterling reputation. In Germany, hopes for the film are high because elections are scheduled this fall. Tele-Munchen believes they will stir interest in "Primary Colors," which it will call "Mit Aller Macht" ("With All the Power").
Mr. Levinsohn said the film "will ultimately occupy a place that will exceed the commercial esteem that it has managed to garner so far." Translation: He believes people will eventually think of "Primary Colors" as an important film, and his international rights go on forever.
If all else fails, the partners may do as the French plan to do: ignore the politics, play down Mr. Travolta, minimize the roman a clef aspect of the scandal and sell "Primary Colors" as a human film. "We think that the best argument is that this is a good film, full of humor," Mr. Hellmann said. "And the people are like you. Not on the top of the mountain. They are people like you."

Some international distributors say the movie may not draw large audiences abroad because of the subject, American politics, and because Mr. Travolta is not considered a top box-office attraction overseas.

Chart: "Sharing the Overseas Risks and Rewards of U.S. Films"
Hoping to share the potential overseas profits from American films, three foreign media companies and one foreign television network have pooled money in Mutual Film International. Mutual's partners will distribute films like "Primary Colors" in France, Germany and Japan, while the BBC will broadcast the films in the United Kingdom. The Mutual partners will jointly distribute the films in other countries. Distribution of films in the United States and English-speaking Canada are usually done by the movie studios or their subsidiaries. (Sources: Universal Pictures; Columbia Pictures; M.G.M.; Variety)

Forecast for Windows 98: Slow Start, Steady Growth
Government officials are racing to determine what antitrust action, if any, they should take against Microsoft before it ships Windows 98 to PC makers in May. But while the personal computer industry has been gearing up for Windows 98 for far longer than the antitrust authorities, the software's early impact in the marketplace is expected to be slight, compared with that of Windows 95. 
 Still, even with a sluggish start -- initial sales projected at less than half those of Windows 95 -- Windows 98 seems likely to set the next industry standard. Page D6.

HEADLINE: How a Tax Law Helps Insure a Scarcity of Programmers

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
The Senate holds hearings this week on complaints of taxpayer abuse by the Internal Revenue Service, but the agenda does not include the role of Congress itself in creating taxpayer woes, particularly for tens of thousands of computer programmers.
But just ask Midge Johnson, a would-be programming entrepreneur, about a long-standing tax law that is pointed specifically at software professionals and prevents many of them from setting up freelance businesses. Lately, the I.R.S. has been aggressively enforcing that law -- even as computer programmers are in such short supply that the Clinton Administration is pouring millions of dollars into Federal initiatives to train more of them. 
 It appears to be public policy in conflict with itself and it is making work life difficult for a category of citizens crucial to the digital economy.
"Why does Congress say that I can't go out and pursue the American dream and give my kids and grandkids things I couldn't have?" asked Mrs. Johnson, who did not find out about the law until two years ago, after quitting her job with the consulting firm of Booz Allen & Hamilton in hopes of starting her own software programming business. "And why," she asked, "is the I.R.S. so busy enforcing this law that keeps me from being an independent contractor?"
Mrs. Johnson, of Lanham, Md., knows that programmers are in such short supply that they can earn up to several hundred dollars an hour writing code for hire, and many in Congress want to let tens of thousands of foreign programmers migrate to the United States. She calculated that if she were in business for herself she could double her income.
Everywhere Mrs. Johnson went in the suburbs of the nation's capital, she said, she was offered work fixing and customizing software -- but only if she would close her business and become an employee.
"They were afraid to do business with my company," Mrs. Johnson said. Two months ago, her bank account empty and creditors at the door, Mrs. Johnson gave up and took a job as a programmer, paying $69,000.
Mrs. Johnson and thousands of other computer programmers who want to work for themselves instead of being employees have run afoul of a 1986 law in which Congress decreed that most individual programmers cannot be entrepreneurs.
The law generally excludes programmers from statutes giving employers some flexibility to use independent contractors. Critics say that the I.R.S. has recently stepped up its enforcement of the law in a way that effectively kills start-up programming businesses if their only employee is the founder.
The law, which was introduced by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, was estimated to raise $60 million over five years, a figure based on a belief by a staff member of the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation that employees cheat less on their taxes than independent contractors do. That was enough money to pay for a tax break, approved with Mr. Moynihan's support, that was sought by I.B.M. for its overseas operations. Under the Gramm-Rudman deficit control act of the previous year, Congress was required to pay for any tax cuts with comparable revenue increases or spending cuts.
A year after the law regarding contractors was enacted, the Senator tried to repeal it, but his bill died. In 1994, Senator William V. Roth, Republican of Delaware, the sponsor of this week's hearings, wrote Mr. Moynihan saying the programmers should get relief. More than 60 other senators have written similar letters since 1994, but they have not voted to change the law.
Ginny Flynn, a spokeswoman for Mr. Roth, said that while the Senator believed that the law was unfair, he was not currently moving to change it because "despite the fact the programmers are treated differently from other people, this opens a Pandora's box of other independent contractor issues."
Programmers and their lawyers say that as a result of inaction by Congress, many corporations have revised their policies to explicitly forbid the hiring of programmers who are independent contractors.
In response, some people, like Mrs. Johnson, incorporated. They reasoned that if they were employees of their own corporations they would be treated by the I.R.S. the way that many doctors and others are and could expand their enterprises.
But internal I.R.S. documents show that in Alaska, California, Ohio, Minnesota, New York and New Jersey, I.R.S. auditors as recently as last year hunted for corporations created by computer programmers. They found scores of such companies and then disallowed them for tax purposes. The papers show that they were disallowed because they were less than a year old and had only one employee, the programmer who created the corporation.
Across the country, officials of high-technology temporary-help companies said the I.R.S. audit tactic had caused many corporations to refuse to hire programmers unless they become employees, like Mrs. Johnson, or were employees of such temporary-help agencies.
Mary E. Oppenheimer, an I.R.S. assistant chief counsel, said there was no national directive for auditors to hunt for incorporated programmers. However, she noted, Congress has directed the I.R.S. to look at the economic substance of tax matters, not just their legal form.
In an earlier interview, Tom Burger, the director of employment taxes for the I.R.S., said one of the agency's difficulties "is that, and I need to pick my words carefully, Congress passes laws, often without asking us about them, and then tells us to enforce them."
The immediate effect of these audits is to force individual programmers like Mrs. Johnson to abandon their dreams of getting rich off their high-technology skills. But the broader impact is that small businesses started by one entrepreneur do not have a chance to grow into mighty enterprises that can create jobs and generate more taxes. "Who do you know who would hire someone who will bring with them trouble from the I.R.S.?" asked Harvey J. Shulman, the Washington lawyer for the National Association of Computer Consultant Businesses, who made the audit documents available.
Mr. Shulman has challenged 52 such audits. "I prevailed in 50 cases and partially in another, but at a cost to clients of $50,000 or more, and that is just ridiculous," he said.
The association's 400 members, who had more than $5 billion of revenues last year, are mostly high-technology temporary-help agencies that hire programmers as employees and send them to companies on short-term assignments. They want the same flexibility to use contractors and individuals who have incorporated as other businesses do.
Don McLaurin, president of the Computer Consulting Group in Columbia, S.C., which hires programmers as employees and farms them out to companies for short-term projects, said the law and its enforcement "are having a devastating impact on the computer industry."
He said his business and his clients would benefit if he could use some independent contractors and some incorporated programmers.
"This is Catch-22," he said. "If you are not legitimate because you start out as a one-person corporation and you haven't been in business for a year, then how do you ever start your business? It is nonsensical."
Ed Myers, president of a company in El Segundo, Calif., that provides programmers to corporations, said that when his company was audited he and Mr. Shulman were able to defend the status of all but 3 of 50 workers as independent contractors.
"The auditor then said I had to give him two more people and I said, 'what do you mean?' and he said he had to have five people he could reclassify as employees because that was what his boss demanded and that if I would give him two more names he would close the audit.
"My first reaction was 'hell no,' because they are not truly employees," Mr. Myers said. "But my second reaction was that it makes no economic sense for me to fight this because it would cost another $50,000 or more, so I gave him two names."
The two programmers, he said, no longer speak to him.
Mr. Shulman said the association "is not asking for a special privilege in repealing this law; we are just asking that programmers and other technical-services workers be treated the same as every other worker in America instead of being singled out for discriminatory treatment."
Donna Steele Flynn, a former member of the House Ways and Means Committee staff who is now a tax specialist with Ernst & Young, said, "The only reason this hasn't gotten fixed is because the official Joint Tax Committee estimate in the past was that repeal of Section 1706 would cost a billion dollars in tax revenue over five years.
"There is a political will on both sides of the aisle, but in terms of importance and number of people, a billion dollars is a lot of money for a relatively small number of people."
However, Ms. Flynn added, the official estimate seems wildly inflated. She noted that when legislation was considered last year that would allow employers broad discretion over whether to treat workers in any industry as employees or independent contractors, the tax revenue loss for the entire economy was estimated at the same $1 billion over five years.
The I.R.S. estimates that it collects 99.5 percent of taxes due from employees, but far less from those who work as independent contractors.
"Whether people cheat is a separate issue," Mr. Shulman said. He pointed to a Treasury Department study that found that programmers were more compliant taxpayers than other independent contractors.
"The I.R.S. wants people to be employees because it is easier to collect revenue, but the revenue they are collecting from employees is less than the revenue they would collect from independent contractors -- even if they cheat a little -- because they can make so much more," he said. "Basically the I.R.S. is saying it would rather collect less revenue with less cheating than collect more revenue with more cheating. Does that make economic sense?"

HEADLINE: Congress Squeezes Public Housing

 BODY:
Congress, which has largely stopped building public housing for the poor, now threatens to turn over the available stock to less-needy families. Bills passed by the House and Senate would redirect Federally subsidized units to non-poor, even middle-class families. Some re-targeting is justified, but the Senate bill goes too far and the House version is worse. Representative Rick Lazio of New York and Senator Connie Mack of Florida, the sponsors, are negotiating a compromise. But it is up to Senator Alfonse D'Amato, chairman of the committee that oversees housing, to stand up for the many poor New Yorkers who need help.
The bill's main objective is to attract working families to communities that have become socially and economically unstable because they are dominated by families in which neither parent has a job. Three important Federal programs would be affected, none for the better. 
 The first is traditional public housing, which provides shelter for about one million families in subsidized units owned by local public housing authorities. Diluting concentrations of unemployed families in order to create stability makes sense. But that can be done without turning away poor families because the vast majority of them include at least one working parent. Yet the Senate bill would arbitrarily reduce by 20 percent, and the House by about 30 percent, the number of newly available public-housing units reserved for the poor.
The cuts make even less sense for the program under which about 1.5 million families use vouchers to rent private units of their choice. Tenants who use vouchers spread themselves throughout the rental market and are not dangerously concentrated in any single building. Yet the Senate bill would reduce the number of vouchers for the poor by about 30 percent, the House by almost 60 percent.
Under the third big Federal housing program, about 1.5 million families live in "project based" rental units set aside in specific buildings. Here there are destabilizing concentrations of the non-working poor, yet the House bill badly overreacts by eliminating any requirement that these units be made available to poor families. Families making as much as $35,000, nearly three times the poverty line, would qualify for this housing.
Both bills would needlessly shrink the available subsidized housing stock for the very poor, but the House version is unacceptably harsh. Mr. D'Amato is perfectly positioned to insist that the conference bill take no step worse than the Senate's.

HEADLINE: Polish Aid Fund Turns Profit, Posing a Problem

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WARSAW, April 24

 BODY:
When the United States sent a special package of money to stimulate the Polish economy in the aftermath of Communism, everyone in Washington thought that it was a nice gesture to brave people. Like most foreign aid, the money was something that they thought they would never see again.
But now Washington is faced with a new species that it does not know how to handle, a successful aid program that can pay back its money to the United States Treasury. 
 Should be simple. Instead, as the debate on NATO expansion resumes on Monday in the Senate, the Clinton Administration and champions of Poland are having a testy fight about what to do with the proceeds of the sale of the $240 million in investments made here by the Polish American Enterprise Fund.
Last week the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, and one of his predecessors, Zbigniew Brzezinski, squared off in a meeting, with Mr. Brzezinski's insisting that all the proceeds should stay in Poland.
Mr. Brzezinski, who was born in Poland and portrays himself as the country's No. 1 defender in Washington, said in an interview that a plan by the United States Treasury and the Agency for International Development to return half the fund's money to Washington would rob Poland of money that had been given as a grant. He accused the Administration of making "a bureaucratic grab" of $120 million that would become lost in the Treasury bucket.
What to do about a particular foreign aid program in one country does not often engender much emotion, certainly not over a comparatively small amount of money. And such matters rarely involve the national security adviser.
But the fund has been an odd breed that mixed private expertise and public capital. And because it has worked in stimulating the business in Poland, where the economy is roaring at 6 percent annual growth, Administration officials would like to showcase it as a model for the future.
That is more easily done, the officials argue, if Congress and the voters can be shown that Government money invested abroad can be returned home after the job has been done.
The quarrel is heightened, officials said, because the country in question is Poland. Many in the Administration say they feel that Poland is just about to receive the biggest gift of all -- membership in NATO -- and that the demand that all the money from the fund stay in Poland reeks of greed.
Last week, the critics added, Poland received an additional bonus from the United States, $210 million from the Polish Bank Privatization Fund, which was established to spur the privatization of banks.
The Polish Government wants to keep the money in Poland, but has been relatively quiet on the issue, allowing Polish-Americans to fight on its behalf.
After the meeting between Mr. Berger and Mr. Brzezinski an Administration official said, "We have not changed our position."
The official said Poland would benefit because half the proceeds from the fund would stay in Poland to endow a foundation to further higher education in economics and privatization.
"We believe that some of the earnings should be returned to the Treasury," the official said. "That way we can show the money wasn't kissed off, and we can build support for aid in risky areas. We can demonstrate how risk can be turned into profit with limited cost to the taxpayer."
Starting in the high-risk business environment in 1990, the Polish American Enterprise Fund was established with $240 million from Washington and told to make investments that would foster a private sector. It was given a high-powered board, headed by John P. Birkelund, chairman of SBC Warburg Dillon Read & Company, a unit of Swiss Bank, and including John F. Smith Jr., chairman of General Motors, as well as Mr. Brzezinski and Lane Kirkland, a former head of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
The board chose Barbara Lundberg, a venture capitalist with experience in California and New York, to run the fund in Poland. The Administration credits much of the success of the fund to Ms. Lundberg, 45, who got off to a fast start in Poland and developed a canny sense for investments in terra incognita.
In its annual report last November, the fund said it had invested in ventures ranging from a major printing plant in Cracow to a furniture manufacturer to one of Poland's most fashion-conscious women's retailers.
But the report also noted that given the amount of private capital now available for investment in Poland, there was no longer need for the fund to tie up United States Government money. "It is clear that this market has become increasingly able to function without development assistance," the report said.
So the fund planned to liquidate its investment portfolio. Administration officials said the fund had found potential buyers for the assets. Roughly $260 million was expected to come from the sale of the investments, which would be completed at the optimum business moment for each investment.
Each side in the argument over what to do with the proceeds of the sale are also conscious of one other factor. The Polish American Enterprise Fund has been virtually the only star performer among the 11 enterprise funds set up by United States Government in the former Soviet bloc.
As some had feared, with the unusual melding of business and government in foreign places, some funds, like the one in the former Czechoslovakia, were undermined by the corrupt management of American directors left to their own devices in Eastern Europe. Other funds found it difficult to find sound investments in the post-Communist turmoil and sat on the money appropriated from Congress.
In its first years of operation, the Polish American Enterprise Fund was the most substantial foreign investor in Poland. Now that the time has come to wind up Washington's involvement, an Administration official argued that there was no better way to flaunt success than to demonstrate that Poland was no longer just a consumer of aid, but could also send something back to the benefactor.
"That would redound to Poland's credit by showing she was already acting as an ally," the official said. "What better vindication would there be of the NATO decision?"

HEADLINE: Labor Rolls On in Las Vegas, Where Hotel Union Is a National Model

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev.

 BODY:
At first glance, Lynne Myrden, a great-grandmother with a silver bouffant who works as a restaurant hostess, hardly seems a labor firebrand.
But Mrs. Myrden recalls with pride the five times she has been arrested in union sit-ins, first in 1984 and most recently last year. In 1994, she was arrested with 500 other unionists in an effort to pressure the 5,000-room MGM Grand, the world's largest hotel, to recognize a union. 
 "After 500 were arrested," Mrs. Myrden said with a smile, "the cops told 300, 400 more people who were sitting in, 'We're sorry we can't arrest you, too. The jail is full.' "
Mrs. Myrden's militancy helps explain why many of labor's biggest recent successes have come in this boomtown -- and why this city has become a model for union organizers nationwide. Workers in the hotel employees' union -- bartenders, cooks, cocktail waitresses, maids and great-grandmothers like Mrs. Myrden -- have plunged into union activity with an abandon rarely seen since labor's heyday in the 1930's.
Many Las Vegas workers do not hesitate to join sit-ins at hotels during organizing battles, and many spend an evening each week making house calls to urge workers at new hotels to support unionization.
And in a move showing that solidarity is not dead, at least not in Las Vegas, members of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union here voted overwhelmingly to raise their dues by 40 percent to help pay for strike benefits during the six-year walkout at the Frontier Hotel and Casino.
Thanks largely to its members' involvement, the hotel employees' local in Las Vegas has made remarkable headway when union membership nationwide has been sliding. The local's membership has soared to 40,000 from 18,000 in the late 1980's, including a jump of 9,000 over the last two years. The union has also been helped by the city's booming economy, with hotel and gambling employment having grown to 170,000 from 100,000 in the late 1980's.
Because of agreements with hotel chains that have pledged not to resist unionization efforts, union officials are confident that the local will add 10,000 members next year, when three more giant hotel casinos open. But officials also fear a colossal battle when the 6,000-room Venetian opens. It will supplant the MGM Grand as the world's largest hotel and its owner has vowed to fight organizing efforts.
With all the success, it is little wonder that John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., calls Las Vegas "the hottest union city in America." Like a gambler betting on a horse that has won repeatedly, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is betting heavily on the Las Vegas hotel workers, pouring in money and manpower to extend the local's skein of victories and trying to showcase it to other unions.
Eager to extend the hotel workers' success to other industries, the A.F.L.-C.I.O is backing an effort to unionize tens of thousands of Las Vegas construction workers. It is helping finance a program in which 15 building-trades unions, which have often been at one another's throats in competing for members, have joined to organize. The carpenters union here has increased its membership to 5,500 from 3,500 in late 1996.
For the hotel workers, militancy has had big payoffs. Members of the housekeeping staff at unionized Las Vegas hotels earn about $400 a week, almost double what maids earn at nonunion hotels in Los Angeles.
"Las Vegas is the only place in the U.S. where a hotel maid can afford to buy a house," said Hattie Carty, a widowed mother of 10 who rose from maid to president of the hotel employees local.
Mrs. Myrden boasted that her union's health plan was so good that when her husband, who has since died, had open heart surgery in January she paid nothing of the $80,000 in doctors' bills and just $250 of the $600,000 in hospital bills.
Las Vegas has become a model for the labor movement and not just because of rank-and-file involvement. The hotel employees' local spends 42 percent of its budget on recruiting new workers, far more than the 3 percent average at the nation's 30,000 other union locals. The hotel local has 21 full-time organizers, while most union locals have none.
"It's certainly the fastest growing private-sector local in terms of numbers," said Richard Bensinger, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s director of organizing. "They embody the path to a resurgence of growth in the labor movement."
The hotel workers attribute their organizing success in part to their tenacity in strikes. During the 76-month Frontier strike, not one of the 550 strikers crossed the picket line. Leaders say their success in that prolonged strike, which was settled in January when the Frontier was sold to a pro-union owner, has demonstrated to other hotels that if they want to battle the union, the union will hold on until it wins.
The Las Vegas hotel employees are the leading practitioners of a strategy that A.F.L.-C.I.O. leaders are urging other unions to embrace. The strategy calls for unions to shun traditional representation elections in which workers, usually after a bare-fisted public-relations battle with management, vote on whether to unionize. Labor leaders complain that those elections are unfair because management often dismisses outspoken union supporters and has free rein to talk to employees at the workplace, from which union organizers are usually barred.
The Las Vegas local seeks instead to pressure employers, first into agreeing not to fight organizing drives and second into granting union recognition as soon as 51 percent of the employees sign cards saying they favor joining a union. In labor shorthand, this is called employer neutrality and card-check recognition.
"The representation election process doesn't work and gives employers unfair opportunities to pressure workers," said John Wilhelm, the secretary-treasurer of the national hotel workers' union and architect of its Las Vegas successes. "It's as if you have a Presidential election where the opposition candidate can only campaign from outside the country. The incumbent can pipe positions in to every home and make every voter listen as long as he wants, with no response from the opposition candidate."
But many employers oppose card-check recognition. They assert that the union is denying workers their right to vote and often strong-arms them into signing the cards.
"It would be disrespectful to your employees to deny them their right to an election," said Michael Weinstein, president of the Ark Restaurant Corporation.
His company, which runs the restaurants in the hugely successful New York, New York Hotel-Casino, is fighting the union over its demand for recognition based on card signings. The union has enlisted a coalition of Las Vegas clergymen to its cause -- they held a recent candlelight vigil outside the hotel to denounce Ark for dismissing several union supporters and for offering wages that are lower and a health plan that is less desirable than those at unionized hotels.
Mr. Weinstein denies dismissing workers because they favored the union.
A case study of the hotel union's success came in its unionizing 3,100 workers at MGM Grand. When the local sought to organize there, the management insisted on an election and refused card-check recognition.
To pressure MGM, the union engaged in civil disobedience in front of the hotel and published a report predicting that the hotel's profits would be well below what the company forecast. That report was widely viewed as driving up MGM's borrowing costs to finish building the hotel.
The union lobbied heavily in Detroit, Chicago and Windsor Locks, Ontario, to oppose MGM's efforts to win the right to open casinos in those cities. When the union's pressure campaign began weighing on MGM's management and its bottom line, the company jettisoned its anti-union president and hired a replacement who quickly agreed to recognize the union based on a card check.
Last December, the MGM workers obtained a contract that will make the hotel the first in Las Vegas to provide its own day-care center for union members.
Mr. Wilhelm said the union wanted not just to combat management but to cooperate with it. To persuade companies to recognize the union, it has often dangled some big carrots. For instance, it has set up a training center for hotel and restaurant workers and agreed to greatly reduce the number of job classifications, giving hotels more flexibility to manage and move workers around.
What could well be the local's biggest and fiercest organizing battle looms next year with the opening of the $2 billion Venetian.
"I won't be intimidated," said Sheldon Adelson, the Venetian's owner. "There is no low point to which they will not stoop to put pressure on management. The only way they can get in is to pressure employees to cave in."
Union officials fear that if they fail to unionize even one giant new hotel casino, that will encourage competitors to try to shed their unions and cut wages and benefits.
"Our members are very worried about the growth of nonunion hotels," Mr. Wilhelm said. "They understand that their standard of living rises or falls with the success of their union."

Russia Reportedly Offers India Help on Missiles
Russian scientists have been helping India for the past three years to build a sea-launched ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, Clinton Administration officials say. The work seems to violate Russia's 1993 agreement with the United States to stop helping any country develop missile technology, and demonstrates Russia's inability to control exports of missile technology, suggesting a wider pattern of proliferation, officials say.

Mafia 'Commission' Fades
For 60 years, the heads of New York's five Mafia families, calling themselves the Commission, met periodically to resolve internal disputes and to coordinate major criminal ventures. Now, Federal and state law enforcement officials say, the underworld organization created by by the legendary mob boss Charles (Lucky) Luciano in the 1930's is out of business. The investigators say they believe that the commission has not met in almost two years, mainly because of disarray within three of the region's mob families. The demise of the commission is seen as another sign of the Mafia's continuing decline. B1

HEADLINE: PATAKI USES VETO TO CUT 1,000 ITEMS FROM 1998 BUDGET

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 26

 BODY:
In his first use of the power to veto individual items in the state budget, Gov. George E. Pataki made a broad assault today on the budget drafted by the Legislature, cutting $760 million in spending this year and more than $800 million in borrowing for future programs.
Mr. Pataki, who is running for re-election, eliminated one of the Legislature's most cherished initiatives, $500 million in school construction and repair money, a top priority for both Sheldon Silver, the Democratic Assembly Speaker, and Rudy Crew, the New York City Schools Chancellor, whose system is troubled by overcrowding and crumbling buildings. He also vetoed more than $100 million in education spending, most of it earmarked for New York City, for teacher training and to enhance teachers' salaries. 
 The so-called line-item vetoes apparently conclude the budget-making process, since it appears unlikely that the Legislature will be able to summon the two-thirds vote in both houses needed to override a veto.
But after saying for weeks that the Senate would not even try to override, the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a close ally of the Governor, took a different position today, saying the Senate would review the vetoes "and we will make our judgments accordingly."
In all, the Governor said he had vetoed more than 1,000 separate spending items, in a sweeping reassertion of his authority over the budget after the Assembly and Senate, for the first time in history, drafted a budget through conference committees without the Governor present.
Calling the legislative budget "an election-year spending binge," Mr. Pataki reduced its size to $71.4 billion, which still represents a 6.9 percent increase from last year, the largest rise in a decade.
The scope of the vetoes left legislators of both parties stunned and angry. Only a few weeks ago, many had predicted that Mr. Pataki would let most of the budget stand because he would not want to alienate voters in an election year. Instead, he appears to have chosen to demonstrate his fiscal conservatism.
Mr. Pataki said he understood that many of his vetoes would be politically unpopular. "Obviously, in an election year, I would have liked to have not vetoed these," he said at a news conference this afternoon.
But aides to the Governor say he understands just as clearly that he needs to enhance his credentials as a tough conservative to have a chance at becoming his party's nominee for President or Vice President in 2000. They say they have little concern about his prospects this year, with Mr. Pataki leading all his challengers in the polls by a wide margin, and in fund-raising by $10 million.
The Governor's actions are certain to worsen his already rocky relations with the Legislature, potentially making it harder for him to win passage of other initiatives, like charter schools and tougher criminal penalties for juveniles. "I think that certainly the relationship is going to be tense," Mr. Bruno said.
Mr. Silver said the vetoes "display an astonishing arrogance of power," and called Mr. Pataki "a captive of the radical right."
Mr. Silver would not discuss the $500 million in school construction money specifically, but several of his Democratic colleagues said they expected the Speaker to file a lawsuit challenging the way the veto was carried out.
The Governor cut $36 million the Legislature had added for the State University and City University, including money to hire hundreds of professors and finance a $65-a-student textbook credit. He vetoed $45 million in environmental programs, including money to clean up hazardous waste sites and to create a state map showing cancer rates.
There were vetoes in mental health spending, vetoes in programs for people with H.I.V., even a veto of money to hire 100 new correction officers, a position that Mr. Pataki has traditionally been kind to.
He eliminated hundreds of items, worth a total of $158 million, in the long list of pet local projects that legislators had inserted into the budget, including $7 million to increase purses at the Saratoga race track, a favorite project of Mr. Bruno, whose district includes Saratoga.
But Mr. Pataki did not veto any of the $743 million a year in tax cuts that the Legislature passed.
The Governor's vetoes were especially striking because he began the year by proposing a 7.6 percent election-year spending increase, to $71.9 billion in the fiscal year that began April 1. That plan drew harsh criticism from conservatives, independent fiscal monitors and some of the Democrats running against him, and led Mr. Pataki to reduce the size of his own proposal even before it reached the Legislature. With his vetoes, he insured that the budget put into law would be smaller than his original plan, something that had not happened since Nelson A. Rockefeller was Governor.
Today, Mr. Pataki portrayed himself as holding the line against a profligate Legislature. "We have got to have budgets that are soundly balanced and that meet the needs of the future," he said.
The Legislature's public budget wrangling this year gave the Governor less influence over the details of the plan than in years past, when he, Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno negotiated a deal in secret. But it also freed him to veto whatever he wanted, a luxury he did not have when the budgets passed by the Legislature were the result of compromises he had helped draft.
Mr. Pataki's predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo, used the line-item veto sparingly in his 12 years in office. No governor's veto of any kind has been overridden by the Legislature since 1981, when Hugh L. Carey held the office.
Mr. Bruno said the vetoes were embarrassing, and potentially politically damaging, to legislators who had claimed credit for spending items and who are also running for re-election this year. "Here, in many instances, we've announced things and now those announcements are not valid," he said.
Even if Mr. Bruno allowed a motion to override the vetoes to come to a vote, several Republican Senators said today that the motion could not get the necessary two-thirds vote. And in the Assembly, the Democrats are three short of a two-thirds majority, and the Republican minority is expected to be in lockstep with the Governor.
Despite the vetoes, the budget grew at a faster clip this year than at any time since before the 1990-91 recession. It increases aid to school districts by $850 million, to almost $12 billion.
But Mr. Pataki appears to have succeeded in eliminating a handful of school programs that have long been among his favorite targets. The largest, called teacher support aid, provides $77 million a year so that urban school districts, which pay smaller wages than suburban systems and have a hard time hiring enough teachers, can increase teachers' salaries. More than 80 percent of that money goes to New York City.
Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, called the cuts "inexcusable," and said, "As far as we're concerned, the fight for these programs will now intensify."
Mr. Silver's proposal to add $500 million in construction money came after voters rejected a $2.4 billion bond act for school building and repair last November. The Governor said he vetoed the measure because the voters had spoken on the subject, because the budget already included enough money for school building, and because most of the money would have had to be borrowed.

Garment Union Battles Its Own Workers

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
As recently as five years ago, the sprawling Brooklyn plant operated by Mademoiselle Knitwear Inc. was a showcase -- clean, air-conditioned, with a cafeteria for workers and a day-care center for their children.
Nearly 780 people tended the computer-guided knitting machines and the sewing and pressing stations, turning out sweaters for the prestigious Liz Claiborne label. Union leaders cited the plant as proof of what management and labor could achieve together. And the workers, mostly Chinese and Hispanic immigrants, rejoiced to be out of sweatshops where weeks elapsed without a promised paycheck. 
 Now, the rainbow piles of Liz Claiborne sweaters are gone -- most are being made in cheaper nonunion factories abroad. A few orders from other labels barely keep 175 workers busy, and Mademoiselle is in bankruptcy.
Mademoiselle is hardly unique in the struggling domestic garment industry, where the number of union jobs fell by 54 percent between 1989 and 1996. But its workers are fighting back. They have sued not only Claiborne, one of the nation's largest clothing manufacturers, but their union, saying that it stopped fighting on their behalf in return for a multimillion-dollar payment.
The suit amounts to the first serious legal challenge to a decades-old system approved by Congress that allows unions to penalize garment makers for shipping jobs abroad. But instead of protecting jobs, critics contend, the system is accelerating their loss, providing a way for garment makers to cut labor costs without risking strikes while putting money into union pockets even as membership dues dwindle.
If successful, the workers' case could change the dynamics of labor relations throughout the garment business, forcing the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees (Unite), the successor to the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, to take a harder line.
But the highly complicated, years-long fight could also have broad implications for other industries, where unions are struggling to get a foothold.
"It just reinforces the negative public image that is one of the biggest obstacles to labor's efforts to unionize white-collar fields like technology and health care," said Charles B. Craver, the author of "Can Unions Survive?" and a law professor at George Washington University.
The workers at Mademoiselle contend that Unite, the key union in the industry, betrayed them last year by accepting a $750,000 settlement of a promising $30 million arbitration claim that it had filed against Claiborne, which now orders most of its sweaters from Britain, Australia and the Far East. The settlement came to just less than $2,900 for each eligible worker. In return, the workers contend, Claiborne signed an agreement that gave the union $13 million up front, with $7.5 million more likely to be paid over the next three years.
Both Unite and Claiborne insist that the payment to the union was both legal and routine, representing money that Claiborne owed for violating a contractual promise to order only from unionized factories. That promise, and the damages paid, covered all orders that Claiborne placed in nonunion shops, not just those withdrawn from Mademoiselle. In the industry, such payments are called "liquidated damages," and they are negotiated during contract talks with manufacturers every three years.
As for the arbitration settlement, the union said that it had done the best it could for the Mademoiselle workers. And both the union and Claiborne insist that there was no quid pro quo -- the settlement for the workers and the payment to the union, they say, were unrelated matters that were negotiated separately.
 
'Union-Imposed Tariff'
Industry Payments Called a Conflict
The use of liquidated damages dates back to the 1950's. At that time, a new Federal law forbade unions to require employers to do business only with other unionized companies. But Congress exempted the garment industry from the rule, concluding that organizing efforts would be impossible otherwise because designers often farm out their work to small, scattered subcontractors.
Thus, Unite legally can, and does, demand in its collective bargaining agreements that designers use only unionized subcontractors like Mademoiselle. Claiborne and other manufacturers that violate the agreement are liable to the union for liquidated damages based on the volume of nonunion work. Several labor economists described the payments as "a union-imposed tariff" aimed at discouraging garment industry imports.
But Unite's practice of accepting such payments -- rather than fighting imports through arbitration or on the picket line -- has helped fatten industry profits and lower management risks, critics say. Using cheap factories abroad can save manufacturers far more than they pay in damages, and the payments spare them the possibility of costly labor battles at home.
Unite says collecting such damages is essential to its mission. The practice has generated millions in annual revenue that Unite, which represents 300,000 workers, uses to pay for its organizing efforts, administrative overhead, retraining programs and political lobbying. Between 1994 and 1996, the union collected $25.3 million in liquidated damages, about half of that from Claiborne. One union official said such payments had typically averaged about $10 million a year, or 15 percent to 20 percent of Unite's annual budget, which is also supported by "significant investment income."
"Liquidated damages are used to defend fair labor standards in the industry," said Brent Garren, the union's associate general counsel. "That is the only way to counter the harm created by sending work to nonunion shops."
Howard I. Rhine, the lawyer for the workers, disagreed. Hundreds of jobs were lost at Mademoiselle, Mr. Rhine said. "Even if they say that the money was used for the greater good, that's not a defense for the way our clients were treated," he added. He hopes to have the workers' lawsuit approved as a class action on behalf of all the current and former Mademoiselle workers who were affected by the loss of Claiborne work. The suit seeks to have the $20.5 million in liquidated damages, or the estimated $30 million value of the lost Claiborne work, put in a trust fund for the benefit of the displaced Mademoiselle workers. The case is pending in Federal District Court in Manhattan.
In essence, the suit says that the damages system creates a conflict of interest for the union because it generates money for Unite even though its members' jobs may have vanished.
The workers are not alone in scrutinizing the dispute. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are checking whether any violations of Federal law arose during this tangled battle. And a House panel is concerned that liquidated damages may allow the union "to gather great profits for itself while providing little or no service to its members," said Representative Pete Hoekstra, Republican of Michigan, who is head of the oversight panel of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.
 
Trading Accusations
Claiborne Files A Trademark Suit
As the anger escalates, so have the stakes. Claiborne, for one, has much to lose. Despite its heavy reliance on imports, the company says it strives for fair labor practices -- indeed, Roberta S. Karp, its general counsel and a key player in this fight, is co-chairman of the industry council set up by President Clinton to improve foreign sweatshops used by American designers.
But Claiborne faces some stinging accusations relating to its conduct at various stages of the Mademoiselle dispute. In court documents, Mademoiselle contends that Claiborne executives testified falsely in union arbitration hearings. It also charges that the clothing giant wrongly accused Mademoiselle of trademark infringement and then conspired with union leaders to scuttle an adverse arbitration ruling. Claiborne's goal was to get out of its expensive, union-enforced manufacturing deal with Mademoiselle, Mademoiselle's lawyers say.
Ms. Karp denied those allegations. Any inconsistencies in Claiborne testimony or documentary evidence were minor and inadvertent, she said, and the payment to the union was entirely unrelated to the arbitration settlement.
The trademark infringement case, which could destroy Mademoiselle and render the workers' fight futile, is "very strong," she said. That case involves allegations that Mademoiselle sold excess Claiborne goods without permission.
But she acknowledged that Claiborne offered in September 1996 to withdraw the trademark case if Mademoiselle would simply let Claiborne out of its production commitment and promise not to sue for malicious prosecution. Harley Lewin, a company lawyer, also confirmed that Claiborne made another settlement offer in late 1997, one that involved a cash payment by Claiborne. Mademoiselle insists that it fully complied with Claiborne's resale policies. The case is awaiting a decision from Federal District Judge Robert Sweet, who is hearing the matter without a jury.
Shraga E. Newhouse, Mademoiselle's combative president, says the accusation was fabricated by Claiborne to shed its obligations to Mademoiselle and its employees. He further contends that Unite, once his ally, has sold out for money that by rights should go to his employees.
For his part, Mr. Garren, the union's associate general counsel, says that Mr. Newhouse "is a scoundrel and that's why we're in a fight with him." But the fight has already drawn the attention of garment makers on the West Coast, who are likely to use it against Unite in its dogged effort to unionize workers there.
Ultimately, the people with the most at stake are the Mademoiselle workers, who have defied their union to file a lawsuit that raises some untested theories of labor law.
Chun Hua Mui, a native of China who was hired at Mademoiselle in 1986, was outraged that the union made the workers promise not to sue Unite before they could share in the $750,000 severance fund. Mr. Garren, the union's lawyer, said the demand was routine. Ms. Mui and about four dozen others refused and were denied their share.
The settlement covered any current or former union members affected by the loss of work. But Mr. Rhine, the workers' lawyer, said that the union had set eligibility standards that limited payment to just 260 employees, most of whom are still on Mademoiselle's payroll.
Josefa Gantes, a dignified middle-aged woman born in Spain, paused over her sewing machine to explain why she has joined this fight. "This time it was us," Mrs. Gantes said softly. "But next time, it may be someone else."
 
Roots of Dispute
Factory Expands, But Alliance Sours
The roots of the dispute go back to 1992, when Mademoiselle was operating in bankruptcy because of cost overruns on its new factory in Brooklyn's Bushwick section. That year, Mr. Newhouse said, Claiborne said it would order sweaters from him if he would invest in the improved machines and larger work force that Claiborne required and if his workers would join Unite's Local 155.
In sworn testimony, Mr. Newhouse and a union official both said the designer had promised a separate Unite local, 23-25, which represented Claiborne's union workers, that it would order 1.4 million sweaters a year from Mademoiselle for at least three years. Local 23-25 was involved because its contract gave it the right to negotiate with Claiborne, even on issues affecting other Unite locals. Ms. Karp denied that Claiborne had made such a promise to its local.
In any case, Mademoiselle expanded its operation, its workers became union members and, for a shiny moment, the experiment seemed to be working.
But by 1995, the relationship was at an impasse. Claiborne was not providing the steady flow of orders needed to meet Mademoiselle's expanded overhead, Mr. Newhouse said. Mademoiselle was not meeting its delivery deadlines, Ms. Karp countered. And Mr. Newhouse was refusing to sign a new three-year contract with Local 155 unless he had some firm commitment of future work from Claiborne, Mr. Garren said.
The deadlock was resolved in August 1995 when Claiborne bowed to the union and promised Local 23-25 that it would order 600,000 sweaters a year from Mademoiselle over the next two years, if Mademoiselle performed "at satisfactory levels of quality and timeliness." In turn, Mr. Newhouse signed a new agreement with Local 155.
But when Claiborne once again complained that Mademoiselle's late deliveries justified canceling the new arrangement, Local 23-25 took Claiborne to arbitration in December 1995, telling the arbitrator that it was acting on behalf of its sister local at Mademoiselle. In May 1996, the arbitrator ruled that Claiborne's delivery deadlines were unreasonable and that Mademoiselle's performance was more than satisfactory. Claiborne was told to meet its 1995 commitment by renewing its orders.
By then, Claiborne had sued Mademoiselle for trademark infringement, which Mr. Newhouse said forced Mademoiselle into bankruptcy again in late March 1996. But Unite still backed the knitting factory. It filed a second arbitration case against Claiborne in September 1996, contending the company had not complied with the earlier arbitration order and demanding an estimated $30 million in actual damages.
In the spring of 1997, while that second arbitration was under way, Local 23-25 was negotiating a new three-year contract with Claiborne.
People familiar with the negotiations from both sides of the table agree that Claiborne was determined to resist Unite's demand that it deal only with union shops. Without such a condition in its contract with the manufacturer, the union would have been unable to demand liquidated damages from Claiborne in the future. Given Claiborne's size and influence, that could have undermined the payment system in the rest of the industry. Claiborne had clearly been squeezing the union on the issue in prior years. In negotiations in 1990, the company agreed to pay the union 70 percent of the amount it demanded in damages; by 1993, that figure had fallen to less than 36 percent.
 
Preserving Payments
Claiborne Reaches Deal With Union
In the first half of May 1997, two things happened: Local 23-25 agreed to drop the arbitration case on behalf of the Mademoiselle workers and to nullify the previous arbitration victory in exchange for Claiborne's agreement to finance the $750,000 severance fund; and Claiborne and Local 23-25 reached a new three-year collective bargaining agreement that awarded the union $13 million in liquidated damages for nonunion work done in the previous three years, 21 percent of what the union had demanded.
More important than the money, Claiborne also agreed to continue to pay liquidated damages if it violated the union-only rule in the next three years, thus preserving the payment system. Still, the cost was high for the union: Unite agreed to limit those future claims to $2.5 million a year regardless of how much nonunion work Claiborne ordered.
Mr. Garren, Unite's lawyer, called the arbitration settlement "a major, major victory" for the workers and "entirely reasonable in light of the strength and weaknesses" of the case and the deep animosity between Claiborne and Mr. Newhouse.
The lawyers for the Mademoiselle workers think otherwise. Mademoiselle's remaining workers "now face the loss of their jobs by reason of Unite's acceptance of what can only be described as a $20.5 million payoff," they contend in their complaint.
Meanwhile, Mademoiselle is awaiting the trademark infringement decision and promising its creditors in bankruptcy court that it will soon sue Claiborne and Unite for damages. And Unite is accusing Mademoiselle of numerous unfair labor practices before the National Labor Relations Board, which ruled last week that the complaints had enough merit to go forward.
Scholars of labor history can only shake their heads over the shattered relationship that held such hope six years ago.
"The enemies of organized labor are going to seize on this," said Daniel E. Diamond, a labor economist at New York University. "And that is so unfair, because it actually shows the tragic side of what's happening to workers in the United States."

HEADLINE: Home Resales Jumped 2.5% in March

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
Home resales in the United States boomed to a new record in March, unexpectedly jumping 2.5 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.89 million units.
The level breaks the record of a rate of 4.77 million units, set just the month before, the National Association of Realtors said today. The rates are the highest since the group began compiling the data in 1968. 
 Based on the first three months of the year, the group's president, R. Layne Morrill, predicted sales for all of 1998 would set a record. "Sales were at extraordinary levels in February and the momentum continued," he said. "This brings us into uncharted territory."
Driving sales were low mortgage rates, which makes home buying more affordable, and healthy income gains fueled by the lowest unemployment since the early 1970's.
By region last month, sales rose 7.4 percent in the Northeast, 5.1 percent in the Midwest and 1.6 percent in the South. They slipped 1 percent in the West.
Nationally, the median price for an existing home, meaning half sold for more and half for less, was $127,000 in March, up 5.8 percent from a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Nguyen Van Linh, Vietnam's Ex-Party Chief, Dies at 82

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

 BODY:
Nguyen Van Linh, the former Vietcong guerrilla who directed the 1968 Tet offensive and then revitalized Vietnam's economy as the nation's Communist Party leader, died yesterday at a hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, the Foreign Ministry announced. He was 82.
The ministry said Mr. Linh, who had been ailing for several years, had died of liver cancer. 
 The Vietnamese Government announced two days of mourning, with flags at half-staff throughout the nation and all entertainment programming halted on state television. A funeral was scheduled for tomorrow in Ho Chi Minh City, the former South Vietnamese capital that many of its residents still call Saigon.
For most Vietnamese, Mr. Linh will be remembered principally as the Communist Party general secretary who loosened the Government's stranglehold on the economy.
With his appointment to the post in 1986, Mr. Linh, a pragmatist with political roots in southern Vietnam, pushed a program of "doi moi," or economic renovation, that introduced elements of a free market to Vietnam after almost four decades of disastrous state planning.
But to historians of the Vietnam War and of the American Presidency, Mr. Linh is more likely to be recalled as a central architect of the events of Jan. 31, 1968, when small units of Vietnamese Communist commandos struck Saigon before dawn and laid siege to the American Embassy there.
Even though it collapsed within days, the Tet offensive -- the assault began on the second day of Tet, the Vietnamese Lunar New Year -- was the beginning of the end of South Vietnam and of American involvement in the war.
The television images of the chaos in the streets of the South Vietnamese capital were relayed back to the United States and prompted expressions of outrage not just among antiwar activists, but also among Americans who had previously been undecided about the conduct of the war. Two months later, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he would not seek re-election.
"The result of that offensive was that it shook the White House," Mr. Linh said years later. "The Vietnamese troops launched an attack right against the den of the Americans and the puppet army. From that fact, the United States realized it could not win the war in Vietnam and that it would not be beneficial economically or politically to prolong that war."
Nguyen Van Linh was born Nguyen Van Cuc -- like many of Vietnam's early revolutionaries, he took a nom de guerre -- on July 1, 1915, in Hai Hung province, near Hanoi.
Official biographies say he began agitating against French colonial rule at the age of 14, when he joined the Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League, a precursor of the Indochinese Communist Party.
He was arrested in 1930 for distributing anti-French pamphlets and was imprisoned until 1936. On his release, he resumed his political activities, helping to organize Communist Party cells across Vietnam. He was jailed again from 1941 to 1945.
After Vietnam's proclamation of independence in 1945, Mr. Linh moved up through the ranks of the Communist Party and by 1960 was selected to serve on the party's Central Committee. He was named secretary of the region that covered what was then South Vietnam, a post in which he oversaw the Communist insurgency against the American-backed Government in Saigon.
After the Saigon Government fell in 1975 and Vietnam was reunified under the Communists, Mr. Linh was named party chief in Saigon, renamed Ho Chi Minh City, and promoted to the party's Politburo.
He ran into trouble with the ideological old guard because he resisted demands by his colleagues in Hanoi for a complete transformation of the capitalist south. "We want to reach socialism, but we want to go by airplane, not by bicycle," he was fond of saying.
From 1978 to 1981, he was considered a rising star in the party, but those who knew him well say Mr. Linh had a series of heated arguments with Le Duan, who succeeded Ho Chi Minh as party leader in 1969. And in 1982, Mr. Linh disappeared from the Politburo.
Friends of Mr. Linh say he resigned after another furious argument with the party chief over the transformation of the south to Communism and Mr. Linh's desire to preserve the force of private capital.
But with the Vietnamese economy showing signs of collapse by the mid-1980's, the need for more liberal, pragmatic economic policies became clear to all but the most doctrinaire members of the party. Mr. Linh was reinstated in the Politburo in 1985 and was named general secretary of the party the next year.
He quickly set to work, apologizing in a series of speeches for the errors of an ideology-driven economic policy that had marred Vietnam's recovery from nearly a half-century of warfare. He permitted private enterprise and market prices, and farm collectives were largely dismantled. There was an explosion of private shops, restaurants and home building.
Even as he yielded the Communist Party's power in the marketplace, Mr. Linh refused to give up the party's authority in the political sphere and attacked "pseudo-democrats" who called for a multiparty system in Vietnam.
"It is not objectively necessary to establish a political mechanism of pluralism and multiparty government," he said. "Socialism is the only right decision."
He eased Vietnam's international isolation with a more conciliatory foreign policy and sought to improve relations with both the United States and China.
In 1989, he ordered the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia; Vietnam had invaded Cambodia a decade earlier and overthrew the murderous regime of Pol Pot, who also died this month, and his Khmer Rouge followers. The troop withdrawal helped Vietnam regain acceptance in the West and hastened the end of American-led embargo on aid and investment in Vietnam.
Mr. Linh stepped down as party leader in 1991, complaining of poor health, and retired to Ho Chi Minh City.
He lived to regret the effects of many of the economic policies he championed. He startled the audience at a party congress two years ago when he gave a speech accusing foreign investors of seeking to exploit Vietnam and topple socialism.
In letters to newspapers last year, he criticized what he saw as a growing gap between the rich and the poor and a rise of vice connected to the free market. In a newspaper article in a party newspaper in July, he criticized American companies, saying they were dumping consumer goods in Vietnam rather than assisting the country through investment and technology.
"The question is not to beg to the foreign capitalists but to manage and work out policies which are more beneficial to the domestic economy," he said. "I hope that in the future, Vietnam will look for every measure to make our international relations equal."

Honda Chief to Step Down; Few Changes Are Expected

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

 BODY:
Nobuhiko Kawamoto, the engineer who has led Honda to record profits and market shares in the United States and Japan over the last eight years, announced yesterday his retirement as president and chief executive.
Hiroyuki Yoshino, one of the Honda Motor Company's two executive vice presidents and the president of Honda's research and vehicle development division, was chosen to succeed Mr. Kawamoto. 
 Industry executives and analysts predicted that Mr. Yoshino's succes sion to the top job would result in few if any changes because he has been close to Mr. Kawamoto, succeeding him as president of the research division. Both men joined Honda's research division in April 1963, and have spent most of their careers in that division and in Honda's small but prestigious racing division.
Mr. Kawamoto, who is 62 years old, made his reputation within Honda in 1974 by working on the team that designed the first engine by any auto maker that met Federal clean air regulations in the United States without needing a catalytic converter. Mr. Yoshino was the first engineer Honda sent to the United States in the late 1960's to study the need for cleaner-burning engines, and also worked on the new engine in 1974 and other, more recent low-pollution engines. More recently, Mr. Kawamoto has infuriated Detroit auto executives by outspokenly contending that global warming is a serious problem that the auto industry should address.
The choice of Mr. Yoshino nonetheless surprised some auto industry officials because he is 58 years old. Honda has traditionally chosen presidents who are young by Japanese standards, typically in their late 40's or early 50's; indeed, the company has a mandatory retirement age of 60 for all but its highest executives. Mr. Kawamoto's predecessor, Tadashi Kume, retired at 58 in June 1990.
Mr. Kawamoto will remain at Honda as an adviser, but will not become the chairman. At many Japanese companies, retiring chief executives become chairmen. But the post of chairman at Honda is largely ceremonial, and all four chairmen over the years have been former executive vice presidents who were passed over for the job of president.
While the appointment of Mr. Yoshino remains subject to approval by Honda's shareholders in late June, that is largely a formality in Japan.
Seven years of economic weakness in Japan have created serious problems for the auto industry there, but Honda has weathered them better than its rivals. Profits have more than tripled during Mr. Kawamoto's tenure, to $1.78 billion in the fiscal year that ended on March 31, 1997. Results for the year that ended last month are not officially available, but Honda has said it will be another record year.
Mr. Kawamoto made two big decisions that have produced bonanzas for Honda in Japan and the United States, but at a critical time in Europe he made a choice that may haunt the company for many years.
When the Japanese economy began to weaken in the early 1990's, many auto makers, including a big rival of Honda's, Mitsubishi Motors, began slowing investment in new models. But Mr. Kawamoto actually increased Honda's spending on research and vehicle development, and produced such highly popular models as the CR-V sport utility vehicle and the new Accord, both of which went on sale last year. Honda's sales have been rising in Japan even as the overall market there shrinks, while its market share has soared.
"Honda redoubled its investments, and take a look at where it is today -- it has romped all over Mitsubishi Motors and its other Japanese competitors," said Jay N. Woodworth, a consultant in Summit, N.J., who specializes in Asian auto makers.
At the same time, Mr. Kawamoto invested heavily to expand Honda's manufacturing capability in the United States. This insulated the company from the effects of a strong yen in the mid-1990's, which made it expensive to ship cars from Japan.
But Mr. Kawamoto also decided against buying Rover Group in Britain. Honda actually owned a 20 percent stake in Rover, but decided not to bid for the entire company when British Aerospace P.L.C. sold its 80 percent stake in 1994. Bayerische Motoren Werke A.G. of Germany bought Rover, eventually including Honda's stake, for a price that seemed cheap at the time and looks like an even better deal for BMW now that the sport utility vehicle craze has made Land Rovers popular. Rover also sells small cars in Europe, a market where Honda has been weak.
Following a company motto that "Small is smart," Honda has also been slow to respond to the demand for large sport utility vehicles in the United States. Honda, which sells a small sport utility called the Passport, is at least a year away from introducing its first large model.
Mr. Kawamoto has been an iconoclast at a company that has at times seemed to pride itself on audacity, a rare quality in corporate Japan. Japanese business leaders rank Honda alongside the Sony Corporation as a Japanese company in name but a Western company in spirit, a combination that generates pride and criticism at the same time.
Honda's decision to study whether to re-enter the high-stakes, strutting world of Formula One racing this year was considered vintage Kawamoto and greeted by some commentators as unnecessarily flashy and expensive. The company withdrew from competition in 1992 when its financial condition deteriorated.
"Upon close examination, the external environment is no more accommodating now than it was when the company left the circuit," the Nikkei Weekly scolded in March. "And if Honda doesn't get some tangible results for its time and money, fiscal results will suffer again."

HEADLINE: Shortsighted Medicare Oversight

 BODY:
The Health Care Financing Administration spends about $2 billion a year overseeing the $230 billion Medicare program, or only about 1 percent of revenues. By contrast, private insurers spend more than 10 percent on administration. Yet even while denying the agency the money it needs to do its job, Congress piles on new responsibilities.
For this year, the agency will make do. But if it is to root out endemic fraud and waste, let alone begin to better monitor the quality of health care provided to its 40 million beneficiaries, it will need more money. 
 Government studies document that Medicare is riddled with waste, fraud and inappropriate care, probably in excess of $20 billion a year. Yet Congress has let the agency's administrative budget slip by more than 10 percent, after inflation, over the past four years even as the number of enrollees and medical claims have soared. Congress has also told the health-care agency to expand the list of managed-care alternatives available to enrollees, a complicated task even with adequate resources.
For this year, the agency will cut back money for some of the insurance companies it pays to process claims by doctors and hospitals. That will force the companies to delay payments and offer less good administrative service to providers with minimal impact on beneficiaries.
But the agency makes a compelling case that, starting next year, it needs to impose $165 million in new "user fees" on the doctors and hospitals whose bills it processes. So far, Congress has refused -- an irresponsible response. These fees will amount to perhaps $200 for physicians.
The agency boasts that its tiny administrative budget is a triumph. In fact, the low cost reflects administrative failure. The agency does not, despite strong efforts, root out enough fraud and waste or monitor the quality of care. It spends so little money because it provides so little oversight -- a failure that it could try to reverse if Congress approves the administration's budget proposal.

HEADLINE: Corporate Push To Save Break On Foreign Tax

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
American multinational corporations are lobbying fiercely to preserve a loophole inadvertently created two years ago by the Clinton Administration that allows them to avoid paying foreign governments billions of dollars a year in taxes.
And their campaign is bearing fruit. Yesterday, all of the Republicans and most of the Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, which sets tax policy, signed a letter urging the Treasury Department to withdraw regulations it issued in January aimed at closing the loophole. 
 "We strongly urge you to withdraw Notice 98-11 and the related regulations," the letter said, referring to the formal title of the new regulations. It added that Congress, not the Treasury Department, should decide the matter.
The lobbying campaign, which has so far drawn little public notice, centers on tax-simplification measures the Administration announced in 1996 that in essence allow corporations with operations overseas to move profits from one country to another without subjecting them to American taxes. Now, the companies have figured out how to use that flexibility to avoid foreign taxes. Before the 1996 measures, an American multinational that moved passive income -- interest, dividends, rents or royalties -- had to pay corporate income taxes to the United States.
Corporations quickly seized on the tax-simplification effort by creating subsidiaries technically known as disregarded entities but popularly known as tax-nothings.
In one common form of tax-nothing, an American company with a subsidiary that makes a product in, say, Germany will create a shell company in a tax-friendly country like the Netherlands. The German operation will borrow its capital from the Dutch company, paying so much interest that it makes no profits and, thus, avoids German income tax. The shell company in the Netherlands, meantime, pays only a nominal Dutch tax.
Treasury officials say they quickly became concerned about the implications of the loophole. Their primary fear was that American industry would shift more operations overseas to take advantage of the loophole, but they also worried that foreign governments that lost revenue as a result of such maneuvers would retaliate against the United States.
So in January, they issued their regulations aimed at stopping what the Government considers an abuse.
Since then representatives of dozens of big corporations -- including Coca-Cola, DuPont, Hallmark Cards, International Business Machines and Philip Morris -- have been quietly, but intensely, lobbying Congress to block the Treasury directives.
The companies say that multinational companies based outside the United States routinely use such loopholes and that it is unfair to deny them to American companies. They also say the Treasury lacks authority to issue the regulations because the measures concern policy matters only Congress can decide.
Nobody is estimating exactly how much tax money has escaped foreign tax collectors as a result of the loophole. Both Coke and DuPont, which the Treasury Department says are exploiting it, paid more foreign taxes last year than in 1996.
But, specialists say, foreign governments have already lost billions of dollars in revenues that they would otherwise have collected. And Michael McIntyre, a professor of tax law at Wayne State University in Detroit, warned of dire consequences if the loophole was not scotched.
"If this scheme works, it could convert the entire foreign world into one big tax haven," Mr. McIntyre said. "The giant sucking sound we'd hear would be American jobs and investment rushing out of the country in search of tax-free profits."
Joseph S. Tann, an international tax lawyer for Ameritech, the Chicago-based telephone company that owns part of the Danish telephone network, said fears that American companies would move their money -- and many jobs -- overseas as a result of the loophole were overblown. Other factors -- like the availability of skilled labor and the freedom to move profits in and out of a country -- are just as important to corporate planners, he said.
A senior Treasury official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the loophole could deprive foreign governments of "potentially tens of billions of dollars." And the issue, important as it is, is symptomatic of a wider problem, this official said.
The dispute involves one of the most complex and fuzzy areas in international taxation -- efforts by companies to avoid being taxed repeatedly by different countries. And as the globalization of the world economy proceeds apace, and as ever-larger companies created by the latest wave of mega-mergers in the United States and elsewhere expand their global reach, governments throughout the world will need to coordinate their tax policies more closely to make sure corporations do not hide their profits from the tax man, the Treasury official said.
The lobbying effort is being led by Kenneth Kies, a Price Waterhouse tax specialist who was chief of staff on Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation until early this year and is a confidant of its Republican leaders, Representative Bill Archer of Texas and Senator William V. Roth of Delaware.
Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, has written a separate letter to Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin in support of the companies.
All three lawmakers, in letters or through spokesmen, said that the Treasury Department lacked authority to issue the latest regulations. Mr. Rubin, in a letter to Mr. Archer, promised to tread lightly, but did not withdraw the new regulations.
When the tax-simplification rules were issued in 1996, the Treasury Department said it would hunt for abuses and would issue regulations to thwart any that it found.
A leading lobbyist trying to block the newest regulations, Mark Weinberger of the Washington Counsel law firm, acknowledged in an interview that "in theory companies could sharply reduce or eliminate their" global income tax burden through the use of tax-nothings. But, he added, "in the real world that is not how it works."
Besides, Mr. Weinberger said, "If the Germans lose tax revenue because of this, they're smart enough to figure out on their own what to do about it without help from the U.S. Treasury Department."
Treasury officials say that while audits have yet to begin, they know from other records that tax-nothings are widely used; Mr. Weinberger agreed.
Despite this, Mr. Weinberger and other lobbyists are emphasizing to members of Congress that the Treasury has yet to come up with a specific case of tax-nothings being abused and is instead relying only on hypothetical cases to support the latest regulations.
The Treasury Department could not have any specific cases yet because audits of 1997 corporate tax returns, the first in which tax-nothings could be used, have not begun. Don Roberts, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service, said that the first 1997 corporate tax returns were not due until March 15 and that audits of them had not started.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
30-Year Treasury Is Off Sharply As Fears Re-emerge About Rates

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond reached its highest level in nearly two months yesterday after a report that Federal Reserve officials were pondering an increase in interest rates. As investors sought to price in the risk of such a move, bond prices, which move opposite to yields, fell sharply.
The 30-year bond dropped 1 14/32, to a price of 101 2/32, with the yield rising to 6.05 percent, from 5.94 percent on Friday and the highest level since 6.07 percent on March 3. 
 While the economy has shown glimpses of rapid growth the last few months, inflation has remained benign, allowing the central bank to keep interest rates steady for more than a year. But the Fed's determination to keep monetary policy unchanged may be wavering as the Asian financial crisis fails to slow the United States economy as much as had been expected.
According to an article yesterday in The Wall Street Journal, the Federal Open Market Committee, at its meeting on March 31, indicated that the next move in interest rates would be upward, though not necessarily at the panel's next meeting on May 19.
Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Inc., said he was surprised that the Fed had shifted its bias in favor of monetary tightening. He said that economic data due this week, including the Employment Cost Index and gross domestic product, both to be released on Thursday, would be moderate enough to preclude a Fed tightening.
And Anthony Chan, managing director and chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio, said the shift did not necessarily indicate an imminent increase in rates. He noted that after raising short-term rates in March 1997, the Fed has held rates steady. "In other words, recent history revealed that in the case of changing policy directives, the bark might be louder than the actual bite," he said.
Nonetheless, the price of the long bond suffered as investors sought to at least factor in the possibility that the Fed might move.
And elsewhere in the Treasury market, the weekly auction of new three- and six-month bills was lackluster. The three-month issue came in at an average rate of 4.940 percent, down from 4.985 percent last week. The average rate on the six-month bill was 5.115 percent, up from 5.060 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Bills	Average Price	98.751	97.414	Discounted Rate	4.94%	5.11%	Coupon Yield	5.07%	5.32%	High Price	98.754	97.427	Discounted Rate	4.93%	5.09%	Coupon Yield	5.06%	5.29%	Low Price	98.751	97.412	Discounted Rate	4.94%	5.12%	Coupon Yield	5.07%	5.32%	Accepted at low price	75%	56%	Total applied for	$32,192,281	$31,915,920	Accepted	$9,516,026	$11,044,130	Noncompetitive	$1,308,589	$1,139,032

HEADLINE: Few Follow as Giuliani Leads Way on New Site for Yankees

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Two years after he first unveiled a proposal to build a stadium for the Yankees on the West Side of Manhattan, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani finds himself with few allies in an effort to build an expensive new home for the team at a new location.
Gov. George E. Pataki, who holds effective control over the site where the stadium would be built, above the railroad yards near 11th Avenue and 33d Street, has not endorsed the plan, voicing qualms about the cost of the project and the wisdom of abandoning the team's historic Bronx home. 
 The Manhattan Borough President, C. Virginia Fields, and the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, say the team should remain forever in the Bronx. And while some real estate developers are enthralled with the idea of building a West Side stadium, many business leaders have remained silent on the issue, saying they are concerned about alienating the Mayor, while privately expressing worries about such factors as a stadium's impact on congestion and pollution.
The Yankees' owner, George M. Steinbrenner 3d, has threatened to move his team out of the Bronx when its Yankee Stadium lease expires in 2002, and his threats were given more immediacy by the collapse of a steel expansion joint at the stadium two weeks ago. After that incident, Mayor Giuliani warned about the loss of the Yankees, praised the financial benefits of building a Manhattan stadium and even came up with a plan to finance construction of a replacement ball park, which could cost $850 million to $1.1 billion.
But with Mr. Steinbrenner's deadline looming, the Giuliani administration has done very little to fashion a formal plan for a baseball stadium over the railroad yards, which experts say would take about eight years to build. The architectural and economic consultants who worked for the city said they have been idle for more than a year and had no involvement with the Mayor's recently announced financing plan. And he has not discussed his stadium plans with state officials, who not only have control over the West Side rail yards through the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, but would presumably have to pay a portion of the cost of any stadium.
Charles A. Gargano, the state's Commissioner of Economic Development, said the state has been "in the dark" about the city's plans, and expressed skepticism that the city was laying the necessary groundwork to proceed with a West Side ball park.
"I haven't seen the kind of support you'd need for a new stadium in Manhattan," Mr. Gargano said. "You need to rally business leaders and the community around a stadium proposal, wherever it's going to be. I do know there's a lot of support for the Yankees' staying where they are, for both nostalgic reasons and for financial reasons."
Facing challenges in the past, Mr. Giuliani has overcome many political obstacles by sheer force of personality. But this time, his aides say, he has been hampered by the fact that Mr. Steinbrenner has not stated publicly where he wants to put the ball club when the lease in the Bronx runs out in 2002.
"Day One has not begun yet," said Cristyne F. Lategano, the Mayor's director of communications. "That will happen when a decision is made as to whether the Yankees stay in the Bronx, go to the West Side or to New Jersey, which we would adamantly oppose. Until that happens, you cannot build coalitions."
In recent days, executives who work with Mr. Steinbrenner have stoked the debate, saying that the team owner met last week with Jon Hanson, the former chairman of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, to discuss "a general proposition coming from across the river." An executive connected with the team said news of the meeting "could put pressure on Governor George Pataki and focus attention on the possibility of losing the Yankees."
Nevertheless, the executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, praised Mr. Giuliani's efforts to keep the Yankees in the city.
"The Mayor has started the ball rolling," said the executive. "The whole thing is in play. You may never see a united front, but you may see a more united presentation once George Steinbrenner speaks up."
Bankers, consultants and politicians who are veterans of battles to erect stadiums and sports arenas say that such efforts demand an unstinting advocate from day one and a united front of political leaders, business executives and fans.
"There has to be a grass-roots effort where you have the business community, the political community and fans trying to get to the same end, as opposed to having one of those three groups running out there by themselves in front of the other two," said James E. Nash Jr., senior vice president of the sports finance group at Nations Bank in Charlotte, N.C. "There has to be a leader, but part of the responsibility of a leader is to build well-rounded support."
Marc Ganis, president of Sportscorp Ltd., a sports consulting firm based in Chicago that was involved in construction of the Trans World Dome in St. Louis and the MCI Center in Washington, said the challenges of building in New York could make the construction of a West Side stadium all the more difficult.
"Giuliani's going to need some help, especially when one of the lightning rod issues is the site itself," he said. "New York is known as a hotbed for land use advocates who oppose large-scale projects. I suspect that'll be more of a hot button issue than the financing as time goes on."
While conservatives have questioned the use of public money to finance stadium construction, the more traditionally liberal community leaders in Manhattan have already vowed to fight any plan to erect a stadium over the rail yards because of potential pollution and traffic congestion problems. The local community board is worried about the proximity of a stadium to four new office towers and two hotels that are planned nearby in Times Square, as well as to the commercial development planned for the Hudson River waterfront.
"This has all the trappings of a knock-down, drag-out battle that could continue for years," said Eric A. Goldstein, urban program director for the Natural Resources Defense Council. "The West Side plan raises a host of legitimate environmental questions, including traffic congestion and pedestrian mobility, that need to be answered before decisions are made."
But others see merit in the Mayor's arguments about the benefits of a West Side stadium. Meyer Frucher, a developer and an adviser to former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo who first suggested the West Side site for the Yankees, contends that a stadium there would ignite far more commercial and residential development than would a refurbished stadium in the Bronx.
"A Manhattan stadium provides an economic multiplier," Mr. Frucher said. "Every dollar you invest in the Bronx is a subsidy for George Steinbrenner. Everything you put into Manhattan will have a multitude of uses and will pay for itself."
Many other business executives disagreed privately, but had no desire to contradict the Mayor publicly. Some Broadway theater owners, for instance, say they worry that a West Side stadium would choke the area with cars and buses, dampening theater attendance. But with theater owners currently seeking zoning changes that would allow them to sell development rights over the theaters, they are unwilling to tangle with the Mayor.
"Most business people end up silent," said an executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity, "because of concern about what would happen if they speak out in any reserved, not even contrary, way."
The Mayor has also angered some business leaders over his proposal to finance stadium construction by extending the commercial rent tax, which the administration had planned to phase out.
"I was disappointed by the Mayor's backtracking on the elimination of the tax," said Douglas Durst, a developer and a major landlord in midtown who is also a member of the board of governors of the Real Estate Board. "There must be another way of financing the stadium."
Another potentially daunting obstacle to a West Side stadium is the skepticism of Mr. Vallone and Ms. Fields. "It is incumbent on the Mayor to present a plan, but there is no plan," Ms. Fields said. "It's hard for the public debate to move forward absent a concrete proposal."

HEADLINE: Many See Fed's Hand In Report Of Rate Intent

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
Decisions made during the Federal Reserve's eight-times-a-year policymaking sessions are usually among the few true secrets in Washington, impervious to leak or spin.
That made it all the more extraordinary for investors, economists, Government officials and journalists to read in The Wall Street Journal today that the Federal Reserve had made what could prove to be a critical judgment at its last meeting on March 31: to lean toward raising interest rates. 
 Such a decision by the Fed -- known in the jargon of the trade as adopting a tightening bias -- would normally not have been publicly disclosed until May 21, two days after the next policy meeting. The Fed releases minutes of each meeting two days after the subsequent meeting, a practice adopted several years ago as a compromise between mem bers of Congress who demanded that the Fed open its deliberations to the public and Fed officials who felt that sensitive judgments about markets and the economy could only be made in private.
The consensus among most Fed watchers today was that senior officials of the Federal Reserve -- possibly Alan Greenspan, the chairman -- had decided to signal to the financial markets that a rate increase might be in the cards and had deliberately leaked the information. But trying to divine what happened proved to be as difficult as parsing one of Mr. Greenspan's elliptical statements.
Fed officials declined to make any comment about The Journal's article today or to indicate in any way whether it was correct. The Journal gave no source for its information, yet stated the policy change as fact, with no qualifiers, suggesting its own confidence in what was bound to be market-moving information.
Mr. Greenspan has proved consistent over the years in warning the markets when a change in interest rate policy is in the cards, although the warning has sometimes proved clear only in retrospect. Mr. Greenspan, however, typically sends such signals during speeches or in testimony to Congressional committees. Although he speaks regularly with journalists, he does so only off the record.
In speeches and interviews over the last several weeks, a number of Federal Reserve governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents have said they are concerned that the Asian financial crisis was not slowing the economy as much as expected, implying that the central bank may have to raise rates to slow growth somewhat.
One theory popular today among Fed watchers was that officials at the central bank might have been frustrated that the markets were not getting the message that rates might have to rise and resorted to an attention-grabbing leak to get the message across.

HEADLINE: Surgeon General Warns of Rise in Ethnic Smoking

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
In a report that afforded President Clinton the perfect opportunity to renew his call for comprehensive tobacco legislation, the Surgeon General, Dr. David Satcher, warned today that increases in smoking by minorities, especially minority teen-agers, threaten to reverse significant declines in the incidence of cancer.
The study, the first Surgeon General's report to examine the health risks that tobacco poses to minorities, found that American Indians and Alaska natives were particularly vulnerable. Thirty-nine percent of them smoked, compared with 25 percent of the general United States population. From 1990 to 1995, while lung cancer deaths declined among other minority groups, they rose among American Indians and Alaska natives, the study found. 
 Among teen-agers, cigarette use increased among all racial and ethnic groups in the 1990's. But it was rising most rapidly among blacks, reversing declines in the 1970's and 1980's. If the pattern continues, Dr. Satcher estimated, 1.6 million black children will become regular smokers, and 500,000 will die as a result.
"These increases in tobacco use are a time bomb for our minority populations," the Surgeon General said at a ceremony to present the report, on the South Lawn of the White House. He concluded: "Smoking is the most preventable cause of death in America. So let's get busy and prevent it."
Dr. Satcher then presented the 332-page tome to the President, who wasted no time in denouncing the tobacco industry for advertising to young people. Nearly three dozen children dressed in bright red T-shirts with the logo of the National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids, a Washington advocacy group, lined up behind Mr. Clinton as he spoke.
"These are the replacement smokers of the advertisers' strategy," Mr. Clinton said, "but these are our children, and we can't replace them." Moments later, he added: "They're just kids. We're the grown-ups. If we know what the danger is, and we know what the remedy is, are we going to do what it takes to save their lives and their health and their future, or not?"
Rarely are Surgeon General's reports issued with such pomp and circumstance. But today's, the 24th in a series on tobacco use that began 34 years ago, in addition to being the first issued by Dr. Satcher, came at a time of political uncertainty over the prospects of tobacco legislation.
The Senate Commerce Committee has approved a measure, put forward by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, that requires the tobacco companies to pay $516 billion over 25 years and raises the price of cigarettes by $1.10 a pack by 2003.
Three Senate Republicans were on hand for today's White House ceremony; one of them, Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, shared a spot on the stage with Mr. Clinton, in an effort by the White House to demonstrate, as Mr. Clinton said, that tobacco control "is a medical, not a political issue, and an American, not a partisan issue."
But the issue is very much partisan in the House, where Republican leaders have indicated they will oppose the McCain bill, which is also opposed by the tobacco industry.
The study looked at four major ethnic groups -- black; Hispanic; Native American and Alaska native; and Asian and Pacific Islander -- that together make up a quarter of the United States population.
The study was a review of a vast body of research on smoking and health, based primarily on statistics from 1994 and 1995. It found that no single factor determines patterns of tobacco use among these groups, but rather a complex interaction of factors, including socio-economic status, assimilation, stress, biology, targeted advertising and price, accounts for trends that vary widely from ethnic group to ethnic group.
For instance, the study found that while Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are the least likely of the four ethnic groups to smoke, several local surveys reported very high smoking rates among recent male immigrants from Southeast Asia.
"This new report leaves no doubt that cigarette smoking impairs and kills people of all racial and ethnic backgrounds," Dr. Satcher said. Tobacco, he said, noting that there were 10 million smokers among the ethnic groups studied, is "holding hostage the hopes for a better life."

HEADLINE: Chretien Finds Castro Willing to Deal, but Not on Rights

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: HAVANA, April 27

 BODY:
Prime Minister Jean Chretien set modest goals for his first visit to Cuba this week: further Canada's substantial business interests here and prod Cuba into doing something about human rights.
After meeting for several hours with Fidel Castro today, Mr. Chretien had a committment from Cuba to negotiate a foreign investment protection agreement with Canada. Havana also agreed to pay $10 million to a Canadian insurance company that lost its business in Cuba after the 1959 revolution. 
 But on human rights, Mr. Chretien failed to win any concession.
At one point during his meeting today with Mr. Castro at the Palace of the Revolution, Mr. Chretien said he handed Mr. Castro a list of political prisoners that Canada wants released. The dissidents -- Marta Beatriz Roque, Vladimiro Roca, Felix Bonne and Rene Gomez Manzano -- were detained on July 16, 1997, for the "counterrevolutionary" activity of calling for democratic reforms.
"He defended his legal system," Mr. Chretien said, "but he took the list and said he was to consider it."
Mr. Chretien refused to meet with Elizardo Sanchez, one of Cuba's leading dissidents. But his chief foreign policy adviser and other officials met with Mr. Sanchez and other dissidents for over an hour.
Mr. Chretien's 41-hour visit to Havana, the first by a Canadian Prime Minister since Pierre Elliott Trudeau came to skin dive with Mr. Castro in 1976, comes at a delicate moment. Against the wishes of some Cuban-Americans and hard-line opponents to the Castro Government in the United States, the Clinton Administration has moved to ease the 36-year-old economic embargo against Cuba slightly.
Last month President Clinton agreed to lift bans on direct flights to Cuba and cash remittances that allow families to send dollars to Cuba. The President also said he would make it easier for medicine to be shipped to Cuba.
At the same time, Mr. Castro has been more bellicose than ever in his condemnation of the United States embargo, going so far this week as to use the occasion of Mr. Chretien's visit to compare the embargo to "a new version of the Holocaust," and suggest that United States officials should be tried as war criminals before an international court.
Today the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, called Mr. Castro's comments "ample evidence of what an 'outlier' he is in the world community." He also criticized Canada's position toward Cuba. "We certainly understand their desire to achieve change through engagement," Mr. McCurry said. "We do not believe there is evidence that engagement with Cuba has produced any change."
Until now there had been only muted criticism from Washington about Mr. Chretien's trip, mostly from the Cuban-American Congressmen who fiercely oppose Mr. Castro.
Mr. Chretien called Mr. Clinton two weeks ago to advise him of the trip, and said today that Mr. Clinton had only asked him to bring up the question of Cuba's record on human rights. "The only comment he made to me was 'I hope, Jean, that you will raise human rights,' " Mr. Chretien told reporters. "And it was the first item of the presentation I made this morning."
Canada has never tried to enforce the United States economic embargo against Cuba, much to Washington's displeasure. In January 1997, Canada's Foreign Minister, Lloyd Axworthy, paid a brief visit to Havana. Since then, Cuban officials have visited Ottawa, and earlier this month Canada agreed to take 14 political prisoners exiled by the Castro Government.
Canadian officials say that after the Pope's visit in January, and the Summit of the Americas in Santiago, Chile, this month, it seemed to be the right time for Mr. Chretien to visit.
From the moment Mr. Chretien arrived on Sunday night to dedicate a new airport terminal in Havana that was financed, designed and built by Canadians, it was clear that the Prime Minister's modest goals for the trip would be overshadowed by Mr. Castro's attempts to defy the United States.
While Mr. Chretien gently outlined Canada's desire to see Cuba move more closely into "a more dynamic, more democratic, more prosperous hemisphere," Mr. Castro denounced the United States.
"No state should pretend to have the right to starve another people to death," Mr. Castro said as Mr. Chretien stood stiffly behind him. "That is turning a nation into a ghetto and imposing on it a new version of the Holocaust."

Treasury Yields Surge On Fear of Rising Rates
Investors fearful of a rise in interest rates sold bonds aggressively, pushing up the yield on the 30-year Treasury to 6.05 percent, from 5.94 percent on Friday, and contributing to a selloff in the stock market. It was the highest level in two months.
Bond market strategists attributed the selling to a report that the Federal Reserve was now leaning toward a rise in rates to suppress inflationary pressure. Even so, some said they saw little chance that the Fed would raise rates at the next meeting of its policy-making committee, on May 19. Page D10.

HEADLINE: Jews and Arabs, Painting a Mural Together, Find a Mosaic of Mistrust

SERIES: ISRAEL AT 50: Picturing the Future

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, April 27

 BODY:
It was a noble plan: Three peace-loving artists from conflicting backgrounds -- an Israeli Jew, an Israeli Arab and a Palestinian -- would produce a mural depicting a future without fear, a symbolic guide to trying to live together in this disputed land. But the process proved far more tortured than any of them imagined, a microcosm of mistrust and betrayal that mirrored the hostilities they had set out to overcome.
There was, for example, the devil incident. 
 The Jewish artist, with approval of the others, had painted in an ethereal, angelic figure to represent his people. But after the mural was unveiled, the Palestinian stunned his Jewish colleague by describing the figure to the audience as a devil that only looked like an angel, "like the Israelis themselves."
The Jewish artist felt betrayed. The Palestinian, for his part, was furious at what he saw as an attempt to make the Jews the heroes of the story.
On a personal level, in private, the men forged a bond, made each other laugh and shared a deep mutual respect. And the artists' determination to pursue further work together provides reason for hope. But burdened by history and communal expectations, their mural became a battleground of symbols.
Their troubled collaboration offers a sobering glimpse into why, 50 years after Israel's founding, the sides remain so fiercely mistrustful of one another, as if their behavior had been scripted and they were unable to imagine new lines for themselves.
The idea for the mural originated abroad. Judith Baca, a Mexican-American muralist, approached an Israeli Jewish artist, Adi Yekutieli, with the proposal to take part in "The World Wall: A Vision of the Future Without Fear," an international traveling exhibit of large, portable canvas murals that she had developed.
Mr. Yekutieli, an intense, soft-spoken man of 39 who is active in trying to improve Jewish-Arab relations, comes from Israel's founding aristocracy. His great-uncle was the first child born in Tel Aviv, his father was a close aide to Defense Minister Moshe Dayan, and his brother is a leftist member of the Jerusalem City Council.
Mr. Yekutieli spoke to Ahmed Bweerat, 45, a founder of the Israeli Arab Artists Guild and himself an enthusiast for Jewish-Arab cooperation. He quickly agreed to take part.
Finding a Palestinian was harder.
To Mr. Yekutieli, this element was crucial, since whatever the problems faced by Israel's 1 million Arab citizens like Mr. Bweerat, the tougher conflict is that between Israel and the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip who want an independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital.
And with peace negotiations between Israel and Yasir Arafat's Palestinian Authority stalled, Palestinians have cut off many contacts with Israelis. Several West Bank artists told Mr. Bweerat that they would not take part without the permission of the Palestinian Authority.
Ultimately, Mr. Bweerat came upon Suliman Mansour, 50, founder and director of Al Wasiti, an East Jerusalem art center for Palestinians. A painter who has had long associations with Israelis and Israeli artists, Mr. Mansour is nonetheless seen as a Palestinian patriot for his work before and during the 1987-93 intifada, or uprising. He served as head of the Palestinian Artists League, was on the payroll of the Palestine Liberation Organization and did several short stints in Israeli jails.
With a rumpled yet commanding presence behind a haze of cigarette smoke, Mr. Mansour said he made sure that the project was not Israeli-sponsored but felt no need to ask for official permission.
But Mr. Mansour set several ground rules for their collaboration. He insisted that they communicate in English, not Hebrew -- "the language of the occupier" -- although he speaks both well and Mr. Bweerat's English is limited. Mr. Yekutieli does not speak Arabic. Mr. Mansour also said the work would take place in Jerusalem rather than in the Tel Aviv suburb of Herzliyya, where Mr. Yekutieli runs a school's art department, or Mr. Bweerat's northern village of Arara.
 
Divided Loyalities Of Israeli Arab
The dynamics were complex from the beginning, starting with the question of Mr. Bweerat's loyalties, as an Israeli and an Arab.
As the Palestinian Mr. Mansour put it: "He thought West Bankers were primitive, cheaters, unable to keep their word. It's all stuff he got from the Israelis. But while working, his attitude changed. He saw that he and I like the same things and have much in common."
This is what Israeli hawks say they worry about: Palestinian self-determination in the West Bank and Gaza awakening dormant resentment among Israeli Arabs.
Mr. Bweerat admits to divided loyalties. Until the mid-1960's, he and his village lived under Israeli military rule.
"Every poem, every drawing, every gathering brought soldiers who said we were a security risk," he recalled. "When I was a kid, on Israeli Independence Day they used to force us to raise the Israeli flag and sing this song about the glories of Israel.
"That's over now, and I have good work, a nice car, a big house -- I have freedom of choice, unlike Arabs elsewhere," he said. "But I can never be prime minister or even minister in this country. And our village is not allowed to expand and build. So I'm divided. Throughout the work on the mural, I felt my role was as a go-between, to lower the fires on both sides."
In the mural, in which each artist's group is represented by a separate image, the Israeli Arabs are portrayed by Mr. Bweerat as a split figure sitting on a bridge made up of a combination of the Israeli and Palestinian flags with a black line dividing the two. The bottom of the bridge is broken.
 
Jew Is Accused Of Taking Over
Mr. Bweerat sometimes joined Mr. Mansour against Mr. Yekutieli, whom both Arabs considered somewhat bossy.
Mr. Yekutieli recognized their concern and tried to reassure them. Once he said in exasperation, "I'm allowing you to do whatever you want with the mural."
"You're allowing me?" Mr. Bweerat flashed back. "Permission is something granted to a child or an underling."
Mr. Yekutieli said such moments were sources of enormous frustration for him. All the work of organizing the mural -- getting the financing from the Canada Fund for Dialogue and Development, organizing the trio's trip to Monterey, Calif., for the painting and public presentation of the mural -- fell to him. When he asked the others to get involved, they backed off, saying he dealt with such things best.
"Then they would accuse me of taking over," he said.
He also suffered over the question of what images were supposed to represent, especially the one for Israel. The angel he devised for Israel was one selected by the others; the deal they worked out was that each presented options from which the others chose. But when it was unveiled in April, he found himself listening incredulously as Mr. Mansour told their audience that it was a devil, posing in angel's dress.
"I felt completely deceived," Mr. Yekutieli said. "I kept having to swallow everything, accept whatever they threw at me because I'm the 'occupier.' "
"I'm willing to recognize a Palestinian state," he said, "I'm willing to do all the organizing and fund-raising for us, but I'm not willing to be stepped on."
 
Why He Saw 'An Evil Angel'
Mr. Mansour later explained:
"At first, I didn't give much thought to it. But then I saw that its wings were pointed, its face was blank, and I realized this was an evil angel. I thought it was an image that fit Adi. He's like all Israelis who want to show something that is not there, to give the impression to the world that everything is O.K. Why are we Palestinians complaining about occupation when these artists are working together, everything is fine, there is no problem?
"But there is a problem: For Palestinians, what Israel is doing is bad," he said. "Yet we Palestinians are seen as the bad guys, and they are the good guys, the angels. So this is what it reflects. This thing that looks like an angel is not an angel but evil."
Throughout the project, Mr. Mansour felt the need as a Palestinian to be on guard against Israeli domination.
"I was very aware that Adi thought his cleverness would dominate the whole thing," he said. "He is like all Israelis. He believes he is more clever than me."
Mr. Yekutieli, in fact, has enormous respect for Mr. Mansour, whose defensiveness can be hard to fathom. He was the first Palestinian to earn a degree from an Israeli art institute in the late 1960's. He said he had made Israeli friends, adding, "I accepted Israel and started to see it as a country with real people and a real culture."
Mr. Mansour's Palestinian image in the mural is of a street sweeper.
Explaining why, he said: "If we want a future without fear, we must first deal with the fear, and my fear is for my children, what they can achieve, what kind of life will be open to them. I am afraid they will end up as street sweepers in Tel Aviv."
The chances that such fears will be realized appear low. Mr. Mansour lives in a spacious Jerusalem apartment with his wife, Hanan, a teacher, and four accomplished children. His eldest, a daughter, Sahar, 19, is a medical student at Al Quds University. Yet Mr. Mansour insists that his fears are justified.
"Things here are complex, and it is true that one can feel several things at once which can seem contradictory," he said.
There was another, very telling, dispute over the mural's central image.
It is of a cracked mud figure based on Mr. Mansour's current work, mud sculptures on door-sized pieces of wood. He began such work during the intifada, when an ethic of self-reliance developed among Palestinians who vowed not to buy anything, not even art supplies, from the Israelis.
Mr. Mansour considered the mud symbolic because it came from the disputed land, often gathered from spots where Israeli tractors prepared roads for Jewish settlements. His immobile mud figures, he says, represent the Palestinian people waiting for a touch of life.
 
Trying to Please Only Backfires
Mr. Yekutieli, impressed with the work and wanting to please Mr. Mansour, suggested it as a powerful central figure that could be re-interpreted for the purposes of the mural as a universal image. Mr. Mansour agreed. Yet when it came time to discuss it in public, he referred to it only as a symbol of the Palestinians and their rebellion.
Mr. Bweerat, their Israeli Arab colleague, went further, saying not only that it represented Palestinians but also that "the Jews want to divide Israel, giving the desert to Ishmael and the green part to Isaac," referring to the Arabs and the Jews respectively. He suggested putting a horse inside Mr. Yekutieli's figure, saying: "We were the horse for 50 years, and you rode us. It's your turn."
Mr. Yekutieli felt abused. "I had reached my limit," he said.
When it came time to write about the mural, Mr. Bweerat drafted a statement that said: "Fifty years of armed struggle, no winners, no losers. Fifty years, marking the point of a new beginning is not worth one tear drop of a wounded child."
Mr. Yekutieli felt that this was a direct slap at Israel's existence and refused to sign it. He wrote his own.
Mr. Mansour raised another concern: Why three separate figures for the three groups? If the point of the mural is collaboration, why not create one integrated work just as Jews, Muslims and Christians should live together as equals in one country?
Here another core dispute was exposed. For many Israelis, this would be a recipe for suicide. Without Jewish sovereignty, they feel, they have no security.
"Give me my space, and allow me to be secure in my space," Mr. Yekutieli countered.
Looking back, the artists have concluded that despite the tension, there was still a remarkable peace to the enterprise. They have just secured a Norwegian grant to document the making of the mural and plan to collaborate next on a huge mosaic of children's images to be placed, they hope, on a future Israeli-Palestinian border.
"This was a stage that you have to go through," Mr. Bweerat said, echoing words of the others. "There is hatred and stigma on all sides, but this is the only hope of getting beyond them. It's going to have to happen for everyone here. There is no other choice."
 
The Series So Far
These articles focus on facets of Israel as it nears the anniversary of its independence, observed this year on April 30. The series, which began on April 6, has examined the country's social diversity, the controversy surrounding a history television series, the transformation of the economy, the Palestinians, and American views of Israel.

HEADLINE: Hoffa Gets Clearance to Run, Creating Teamsters Face-Off

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Clearing the way for another struggle for control of the teamsters, a Federal monitor ruled yesterday that James P. Hoffa could remain in the race for the union's presidency, but he also found that Mr. Hoffa had engaged in some improprieties in the 1996 union election.
The decision clarifies the confused picture in this summer's teamster election: it appears now it will be a face-off between Mr. Hoffa, widely considered the front-runner, and Ken Hall, a high-level teamsters official who played a pivotal role in last year's successful strike against the United Parcel Service. 
 Mr. Hall largely has the backing of the forces that long supported the teamsters president Ron Carey, the self-styled reformer under investigation for his role in an embezzlement scheme. The decision by Michael Cherkasky, the Federal election monitor, seems to leave both sides without the ability to run as untainted reform candidates.
Mr. Hall is tarnished because he is considered a protege of the disgraced Mr. Carey, now on leave from the union's presidency, while Mr. Hoffa emerges bruised from yesterday's decision because it fined him, suggested he lied several times and barred a leading aide from participating in the campaign.
Dating back to the 1960's, when Mr. Hoffa's famous father led the teamsters, the Federal Government has struggled to clean up the union, and now the Federal monitor's decision creates a strong chance that Jimmy Hoffa's son will take its reins. The teamsters presidency is important for the labor movement and the nation at large, because the union is one of the nation's biggest, most powerful and most visible and because its 1.4 million members handle goods touching every nook and cranny of the nation's economy.
The Carey forces received another jolt yesterday when a Federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted William Hamilton, the union's former director of government affairs, charging him with helping siphon union money into Mr. Carey's 1996 campaign. Mr. Hamilton's lawyer, Robert Gage, asserted that his client was innocent.
The stage is now set for another campaign in which Mr. Hoffa will pledge to restore the power the union had when his father led it, while Mr. Hall will try to capitalize on Mr. Carey's successes, most notably the U.P.S. strike.
Mr. Cherkasky said Mr. Hoffa was responsible for failing to report almost $44,000 in union campaign contributions accurately and had not testified truthfully about receiving a $1,000 contribution from a former teamsters president, William McCarthy.
Explaining that he was loath to disqualify candidates because it limited union members' right to choose, Mr. Cherkasky said in an interview: "While there were serious violations, they were not sufficient in this context to disqualify Mr. Hoffa. Any disqualification is inherently anti-democratic."
Mr. Cherkasky released his report after another court-appointed monitor had barred Mr. Carey from running again, finding that he had cooperated in an illegal scheme to siphon more than $850,000 in union money into his campaign coffers.
After that scheme was uncovered, Federal monitors ordered a new election and overturned Mr. Carey's narrow 1996 victory over Mr. Hoffa, whose father ran the union from 1959 to 1971.
But Mr. Cherkasky found major violations by several main Hoffa aides and supporters. He barred Mr. Hoffa's chief spokesman, Richard Leebove, from working in this year's teamsters campaign, finding that he vastly underbilled the Hoffa campaign and thereby made $167,675 in improper campaign contributions. Mr. Cherkasky also barred a candidate on Mr. Hoffa's slate, Mary Lou Salmeron, from running again, finding that she had coerced the staff of her union local to make campaign contributions.
His investigation also unearthed evidence that could lead to the expulson of two other prominent Hoffa supporters from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents truck drivers, warehouse workers, flight attendants and other workers.
Mr. Cherkasky fined the Hoffa campaign $30,910 for improperly receiving donated services from his press spokesman and for failing to itemize more than $50,000 in contributions -- out of some $3.6 million collected by Mr. Hoffa and his support groups. Mr. Cherkasky did not penalize Mr. Hoffa for what he described as sometimes inaccurate testimony.
"We certainly feel vindicated," Mr. Hoffa said in a telephone interview. "As we said all along, our campaign was basically run properly. We intend to pay the fines and move on with the campaign."
In the best news for Mr. Hoffa, Mr. Cherkasky cleared him and his camp of the main charge, that it had failed to detail the source of $2 million in campaign contributions. The Hoffa camp insisted that those contributions came in sums of $100 or less and thus did not have to be reported, while his opponents insisted that much of that money came in large contributions, which have to be reported, or came from employers, who are barred from making contributions to union candidates.
In a statement, Mr. Hoffa said, "This investigation found that I am an honest man who ran an honest campaign."
While the Hoffa and Hall camps both insist their candidates are clean, the recent rulings by Federal monitors have left each side accusing the other of being sullied.
Mr. Carey appointed Mr. Hall to be director of the union's 200,000-member small-package division, and in that role Mr. Hall, a 41-year-old West Virginian, was Mr. Carey's right-hand man throughout the strike last August by 185,000 U.P.S. workers.
Mr. Hall called on Mr. Hoffa yesterday to pull out of the race.
"In the interest of restoring integrity to the union, Hoffa should withdraw," Mr. Hall said in a telephone interview. "First of all, among these findings, Hoffa lied to the election officer. Secondly, he accepted $167,000 in illegal contributions."
In the five-month investigation, Mr. Cherkasky, chief operating officer of Kroll Associates, and his staff audited the Hoffa campaign, subpoenaed information from campaign vendors, and interviewed hundreds of witnesses.
Mr. Cherkasky concluded that it was credible for the Hoffa campaign to have raised $2 million in sums of $100 or less after he examined hundreds of check stubs, scrutinized bank accounts and looked into the tens of thousands of Hoffa hats and T-shirts the Hoffa campaign had ordered and then sold to supporters.
"In sum," his report said, "the Election Officer finds credible evidence that at least a substantial majority of the over $2 million in un-itemized contributions made to the Hoffa Slate Campaigns came from lawful sources. While a significant dollar amount of contributions could not be traced and, therefore, could potentially have come from improper sources, there is no evidence of such improper contributions."
Mr. Cherkasky examined accusations that the leaders of a large teamsters local in Michigan gave each of 14 officials a $2,500 raise and a large Christmas bonus that the officials were said to have contributed to the Hoffa campaign. Mr. Cherkasky found that the money did not go to Mr. Hoffa, but instead went to the re-election campaign of Larry Brennan, the local's principal officer.
Mr. Brennan, seen as Mr. Hoffa's chief mentor, has given Mr. Hoffa a job as an administrative assistant at the teamsters' Michigan joint council, which Mr. Brennan heads.
Mr. Cherkasky said the raise, together with turning the money to a top Brennan fund-raiser, Carlo Scalf -- also a major figure in the Hoffa campaign -- was "disturbing." Mr. Cherkasky said he would turn the evidence over to the Independent Review Board, a three-person court-appointed board that oversees the teamsters, to determine whether Mr. Brennan and Mr. Scalf should be expelled.
Several times in his decision, Mr. Cherkasky asserted that Mr. Hoffa was less than candid in his sworn testimony to the Federal election officer. Discussing the failure to report the $1,000 contribution by Mr. McCarthy, the former president, Mr. Cherkasky wrote: "Mr. Hoffa's testimony on the preparation of" his campaign-finance statements, "and the omission of the McCarthy contribution was not complete or accurate."
The report found that the Hoffa campaign had sought to hide that Kevin Currie, the director of its New York operation, was a felon convicted of grand larceny by having the campaign write paychecks in his wife's name. The report found that the Hoffa camp violated campaign expenditure and reporting rules by paying $20,184.75 to Mr. Currie's wife.
In the indictment handed up yesterday, the Federal grand jury accused Mr. Hamilton of six counts: conspiracy, embezzling union funds, mail fraud, wire fraud, perjury in connection with grand jury testimony and making false statements to the election officer. Three Carey campaign aides have already pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges.
The indictment said Mr. Hamilton approved more than $750,000 in payments to Citizen Action and other liberal groups in an effort to get out the vote to help the Democrats recapture Congress in 1996. As part of an embezzlement scheme, the indictment charged, contributors to those liberal groups were then supposed to give money to Mr. Carey's campaign.
The indictment also accused Mr. Hamilton of approving contributions to the Democratic Party as part of an effort to have Democratic donors give to the Carey campaign.
Robert Gage, Mr. Hamilton's lawyer, said, "Bill is innocent of all charges, and we look forward to our day in court."
In the past, Mr. Hamilton has asserted that he did not knowingly do anything illegal and that the contributions advanced the teamsters' goal to help restore Democrats' control of Congress.

HEADLINE: Restrictions on Iraq Will Stay in Force, U.N. Council Rules

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 27

 BODY:
The Security Council decided tonight to extend sanctions against Iraq, ignoring threats from Baghdad that it would disrupt future arms inspections if the sanctions were not lifted.
"The international community is one," Bill Richardson, the United States representative, said tonight. "Sanctions will not be lifted because Iraq has failed to comply." He said that on biological and chemical weapons and missile systems, United Nations weapons inspectors had found that Iraq still had a long way to go in accounting for all of its weapons of mass destruction. 
 But in a gesture to the Iraqis, who have recently allowed greater access to arms inspectors, the Council did not limit future sanctions reviews to six-month intervals but reverted to a system of permitting reviews every 60 days. That was the procedure before Iraq instigated a series of crises last year, bringing President Saddam Hussein to the brink of war with the United States a few months ago.
But diplomats do not expect the next big push for a lifting or easing of the sanctions until October, when the next major report on Iraqi compliance is due from the United Nations Special Commission, which has been in charge of eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and its capacity to make more.
The United States has vowed to veto any lifting of the sanctions, imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, until Baghdad has met a number of requirements. Those include not only verifiable disarmament, but also the return of Kuwaiti prisoners and property seized in the invasion and a general improvement in respecting human rights.
Although there was never a chance that Iraq would be freed from sanctions in this review -- the first since an agreement in February between President Hussein and Secretary General Kofi Annan that defused the most recent crisis -- the atmosphere around today's Security Council meeting was noticeably different from previous sessions on the issue.
Mr. Richardson was somewhat conciliatory in his assessment of Iraq's recent performance.
Facing eroding support for unlimited sanctions, he acknowledged some Iraqi progress in disarmament, including meeting most demands of nuclear inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency. But he continues to object to Russian, Chinese and French calls to "close the file" on nuclear weapons in Iraq and shift from an active "search and destroy" phase of disarmament to long-term monitoring.
Russia has proposed a resolution to make the change, which the United States opposes. Iraq's Foreign Minister said in an interview on Saturday that he expected the Russians and Americans to work out a compromise. Diplomats say it will take the form of a Council statement endorsing the finding that there is no evidence of a nuclear weapons program without formally graduating Iraq from the current level of inspection to a less severe one.
"We in the United States acknowledge progress in areas like access to presidential and sensitive sites," Mr. Richardson said. "There appears to be some progress in the nuclear file, but we believe that it is premature to totally close that file without further steps being taken specifically regarding nuclear enrichment, design and nuclear exports."
Shen Guofeng, China's new deputy representative to the United Nations , argued not only for closing the nuclear weapons file now, but also for moving to end sanctions generally, "because the Iraqi people are suffering a lot." But he acknowledged that Iraq still had requirements to meet.
The Council heard today from Richard Butler, executive chairman of the Special Commission in charge of eliminating Iraq's biological, chemical and missile programs, and Garry Dillon, leader of the International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors. Mr. Butler has found no progress on outstanding issues in the last six months and Mr. Dillon, while more upbeat, said he still had some unanswered questions.
Jayantha Dhanapala, who led diplomatic escorts on a tour of eight Iraqi presidential sites being inspected by the commission, also reported to the Council on the generally smooth initial visits to the properties. But it is unclear what will happen when inspectors want to return for further inspections.
The United States, increasingly isolated among Council members who say eight years of sanctions are enough, gets its strongest support from Britain, whose diplomats caution against shifting the debate from Iraqi compliance to Iraqi suffering.
Sir John Weston, the British representative to the United Nations, said in an interview on Friday that the starting point of the debate was the potential that President Hussein still had to produce biological and chemical weapons and missiles. That situation is spelled out in a series of new reports, including several from independent teams of experts whom Iraq thought would be more willing to accept its contention that it was free of prohibited arms.
"We've had a reality check," Sir John said. "From this, I draw the conclusion that we are facing a policy of lying on an epic scale that recalls only the policies in that respect of earlier dictators in this century. While there will always be, as Lenin put it, useful fools who will rush in to embrace people who pump out this kind of nonsense, I don't think that the U.N.'s general standing in the world is so high right now that it can allow itself to be duped by this kind of thing."
Britain recently organized a conference in London to discuss how civilian goods could be supplied more effectively to Iraqis. Baghdad objected, saying the conference infringed on Iraqi sovereignty.
This weekend, Iraqi newspapers reported that the Government was further cutting rations, citing difficulties with the plan under which limited amounts of oil are sold to pay for essential supplies.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Gifts For Israel

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
On Israel's 50th anniversary, its friends can give the country certain gifts of importance. They can recognize Israel's achievements and take joy from them. And they can accept without denial or flinching the fact that after a half-century Israel's neighbors still want it dead.
 So far, Israel has not received many gifts from my crowd -- journalists. Much of the magazine, newspaper and TV coverage and assessment of Israel -- not all, but too much -- has ranged from delightedly doleful to dolefully despairing.
Israel's economic, societal and scientific successes have been mentioned. But not often is it pointed out that they were attained in the face of decades of hatred and attack from Arab nations and movements. 
 The contrary -- almost always Israel's problems are now being presented as if they are entirely self-inflicted. Arabs are presented as if they are always simply reacting to Israeli refusal to accept their reasonable demands that the Jews just clear out of more territory because it does not really belong to them.
American public support for Israel rises and for Yasir Arafat declines. But U.S. and European journalism is increasingly sympathetic to the Palestinians and unpleasant about Israel.
To each his own vision. To my eyes, and to those of the majority of Americans, Israel is one of history's soaring proclamations of mankind's worth to itself and its Creator.
These days it is not said much anymore, which is a pity, but Israel did indeed begin with nothing much more than sand, hope and belief. And yes, 50 years later it is indeed the Mideast's only democracy, a growing center of science, technology, art, music. Israel is not a dirge -- but a country; how happy the thought.
And I find emotion entirely permissible about Israel's ability to maintain life and progress though its neighbors have imposed an absence of peace for a half-century.
But about dangers to Israeli survival, cool is best. And stepping back coolly we see the realities.
One is that Israel may work out agreement with Palestinians -- if they want it enough to agree to conditions that will give Israel security of borders and the end of terrorism. The agreement would bring respite that could grow into a peace of some years.
But another reality is that agreement on Palestine would not bring permanent peace. Ask ourselves, would Mideast rulers, the worker-merchant "street" and religious and intellectual establishments accept an Israel forever growing in skills and strength -- or in their dreams and desires want Israel extinguished, and work toward the day?
Run them through the mind: Syria, Libya, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the gulf sheikdoms, the Sudan, Algeria, Iraq, Iran.
The hatred against Israel these countries receive, accept and pass on as heritage and religious obligation -- would it vanish with an independent Palestine or would it continue in them, and in Palestine too?
If Iran and Iraq develop chemical, nuclear and biological weapons, will they strike against Israel? Would other Arabs extend sympathy to Israel -- or dance on rooftops and scream their passion to kill Jews? Would the West take the risk of world war to rescue Israel?
We know the answers. Permanent peace in the Mideast will not come until sufficient Arab peoples replace dictatorship -- fundamentalist, religious, military or terrorist -- with democratic religious and political freedoms.
Then perhaps the Muslim governments will end the feuds among themselves that are the central cause of Mideast wars. Then perhaps they will even try to end the hatred of Israeli existence that infests the Mideast with the threat of war against Israel.
Freedom may happen in the Mideast, as in so many other places. But it will come slowly, fitfully.
Meantime, will Israel stand strong at arms, maintaining military power not for victory over another country but for defense?
Will the U.S. remain a friend or become a harassment? Will some foreign and Israeli Jews push their religious and political hostility against Israeli governments so long and hard that they sap Israel's strength, will power and self-belief, as Israel awaits Arab conversion to democracy?
From friends of Israel, cool questions in themselves are gifts to Israel -- and to one another.

HEADLINE: Stocks Tumble On Worries Of Rate Rise

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The stock market dropped sharply across-the-board yesterday, as a sudden fear that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates spread doubt about the durability of Wall Street's strong 1998 rally.
The concern, which led to a rise in interest rates in the bond market, was prompted by an article in The Wall Street Journal that said Fed policy makers were leaning toward raising interest rates. That sent the yield on the 30-year bond, which rises when prices fall, to 6.05 percent. If yields move higher, they could further undermine shares by making stocks look too expensive. 
 Long-term yields, as low as 5.79 percent at the beginning of the month, had been moving higher since then as several governors of the central bank indicated they were worried the economy was not slowing down as expected.
But yesterday's report accelerated that rise. The reported decision -- to change from the Fed's previous position that it should be evenly balanced between the need for a rate cut or a rate increase -- does not necessarily mean the Fed will follow through and tighten monetary policy but makes clear that policy makers still see inflation as the main threat to the long economic expansion. Fed officials declined to comment.
If the shift is true, stock analysts said, it eliminates one of the reasons for this year's stock rally, the possibility that the Fed's next move could be a cut in interest rates.
The stock decline yesterday cut more than 220 points off the Dow Jones industrial average before it recovered late in the day to finish down 146.98, or 1.6 percent, at 8,917.64. It is now down 2.9 percent in the last four sessions.
Other major indexes fell more. The technology-heavy Nasdaq dropped 48.65 points, or 2.6 percent, to 1,820.31. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 21.36, or 1.9 percent, to 1,086.54, while the Russell index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks finished down 11.82 points, or 2.5 percent, at 468.50. All were at record highs less than a week ago.
Drug companies like Merck and Pfizer; banks, including J. P. Morgan and Citicorp, and technology companies from Microsoft to Intel led stocks lower.
The Fed, along with many economists, has expected the economy to slow this year, partly because of the drag from reduced exports to Asia, where many economies are battling to avert serious downturns in the aftermath of the financial instability that rocked the region last year.
But American economic growth in the first quarter exceeded 3 percent by the estimate of many economists. Although there have been tentative signs of some slowing reported since the Fed's last meeting, including a decline in March employment, it remains unclear whether the combination of low unemployment and strong growth will prove to be a recipe for inflation. Still, there are almost no signs of inflation in the economy now.
Some analysts said they could not figure out the reasons for a Fed switch. Maybe it is some kind of signal to the market. But John Lipsky, the chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank, said things really had not changed that much. "To me the operative thing is that if growth doesn't slow down, the Fed will raise interest rates." And, he added, that was true before yesterday.
For investors the question is once again one that has popped up often during this market's record bull run: Is this dip just another opportunity to buy stocks for less, or the beginning a longer-term slump?
Stock analysts and strategists were not ready to answer that question, though it was clear that recent market collapses -- including the Oct. 27 record 554.26-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average -- have been halted by opportunistic investors.
But some analysts did say that at least for the time being there are more negatives weighing on the stock market than there had been earlier as the markets' major indexes surged to record highs and quickly beat growth forecasts for the year.
"At the moment the markets are on hold," said Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney.
Byron R. Wien, the United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said several other factors had contributed to the market selloff, which began last week. He said the breadth of the market's rally -- which carried much more than the blue-chip stocks higher -- was beginning to narrow, with the number of advancing stocks diminishing.
He also said the disappointing efforts to revive the Japanese economy, capped by a new stimulus plan last week, were worrying investors, as reflected in a 2.3 percent drop in the Nikkei 225 stock average yesterday and a further 1.9 percent decline early today. Economic revival in Japan is necessary for helping the rest of Asia recover from a financial crisis that began last summer.
The key to the near-term outlook, Mr. Wien said, will be the course of interest rates. If long-term rates rise toward 6.5 percent, he said, "the market is in trouble."
Investors have been bidding stocks higher for much of this year, pushing the major indexes up 16 percent or more in less than four months.
Abby Joseph Cohen, co-chairwoman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs, says she thinks the market is in a trading range for a while. But, she said, "I don't think it is the start of something worrisome."
"We have had a very dramatic rise in stock prices in a very short period of time," she said. "I think that many investors have been looking around and saying that this doesn't go straight up." They will now wait, she said, to see that the economic fundamentals like low inflation and healthy earnings support a further rally. She thinks they do.
This kind of pause occurred at the beginning of both 1996 and 1997. Last year, the Dow average was up 9.9 percent before tumbling in March and April. It rallied to a new high in August, then stalled again before the October drop. The Dow average has since been moving mostly up.
For the time being, many strategists expect the market to be volatile, as investors scrutinize every new economic statistic to determine whether the Fed really must raise interest rates. Signs of the economy finally slowing down would surely ease concerns, giving the market a boost. But data showing further robust growth would send interest rates higher and stocks lower as investors bet the Fed will have to move. The next meeting of Fed policy makers is not until May 19, a long way off for skittish investors.
The May 8 employment report for April should be the first big test of market jitters.

HEADLINE: Giuliani to Trim Spending By 3 Percent (See Asterisk)

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
Since Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani took office in 1994, the fiscal rites of spring in New York City have focused on arguments over what programs and services to cut from its budget. But this April, a curious and politically sensitive new debate has arisen: How fast is the city's spending growing?
The Mayor said not at all. In January, he said that the city's spending would grow by a mere six-tenths of one percentage point. But after unveiling his executive budget on Friday -- which contained half a billion dollars more in expenditures than it did in January -- Mr. Giuliani said he had actually managed to bring spending down. 
 "The reduction in spending from this year to next year is 3 percent," Mr. Giuliani said on Saturday, suggesting that those who disagreed with him were out "to do a political hit."
But after digesting the innards of the city's $34 billion budget over the weekend, analysts in government, private organizations and on Wall Street said yesterday that the city's spending was going up between 3 percent and 7 percent. But they all agreed that the Mayor was right -- though only technically -- in claiming a 3 percent reduction.
What's going on? The dissonance stems from the city's record $2 billion surplus, which has complicated the way the city closes its books at the end of the fiscal year, on June 30.
And Mr. Giuliani's evident passion about the spending rate reflects the importance he attaches to it, even more so nowadays, as he has taken steps to raise his national profile and to solidify his Republican credentials as a fiscal conservative.
Analysts at Wall Street's two major credit-rating agencies praised Mr. Giuliani's recent stewardship over the city's finances. They said that while city spending in Mr. Giuliani's proposed budget was clearly above the local inflation rate of between 2 percent and 3 percent, it was modest, especially given the spending opportunities provided by the $2 billion surplus.
Moody's Investors Service, which recently raised the city's credit rating, said spending was up between 5 percent and 6 percent. Robert A. Kurtter, a senior vice president, described that as "about average."
Its rival, Standard & Poor's Corporation, had yet to analyze spending in the budget. Todd Whitestone, a managing director, said the Mayor had kept the city's finances on a course that would lead to a credit-rating increase by S. & P.
Of Mr. Giuliani's claim that spending would go down 3 percent, he said, "It's not an accurate picture of what the city is spending year to year."
H. Carl McCall, the State Comptroller, said spending was increasing by 6.5 percent; the city's Independent Budget Office, by 6.2 percent; the Citizens Budget Commission, 7 percent, and the City Council, 3 percent to 6 percent.
So why is the Mayor technically right? Under the generally accepted accounting principles that the city has followed since the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's, the city must spend this year's budget surplus during this fiscal year. But the Mayor wants to use it in the next fiscal year, mostly to pay interest and principal on the city's debt. So the city will prepay these expenses before this fiscal year ends.
And so, while these payments are used for next year's expenses, they are counted as part of this year's spending -- artificially deflating spending for next year. This accounting procedure was never much of an issue because until last year's $1.4 billion surplus, the city had never recorded such a huge surplus, analysts said. But to have an accurate picture of growth, analysts said that the budget surplus should be factored into the next year's spending.
The analysts said such an accurate picture was necessary to understand and deal with future budget problems, which are now masked by the boom on Wall Street.
When Mr. Giuliani presented his preliminary budget in January, he projected that the city would have a $1.2 billion surplus and that spending would rise by six-tenths of a percentage point. By Friday, a continuing bull market had increased the surplus to $2 billion. That further distorted the spending rate, analysts said, and allowed for a technical spending decrease of 3 percent.
The Mayor's budget director, Joseph J. Lhota, said he had followed the same accounting rules used by previous administrations.

HEADLINE: Shortage of Housing for Poor Grows in U.S.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
Despite a robust national economy, a shortage of affordable housing for poor people -- once a problem found only in cities -- is growing in many suburbs around the country, according to a report by the Department of Housing and Urban Development that will be delivered to Congress on Tuesday.
Examining housing needs from 1991 to 1995, the department found that the number of low-income families who live in suburban areas and require housing assistance increased by 9 percent, bringing their total number to 1.8 million, a growth rate slightly higher than that of families living in urban settings, which rose by 8 percent over the same period. 
 Over all, the report found that the nation's economic growth has done little to ease demand for affordable housing no matter where the working poor live. The data suggest that the number of low-rent apartments decreased by 900,000 over the four-year period, while the number of "very low income" families, those with incomes of less than 50 percent of the area median and who pay as much as 50 percent of their income on housing grew by 370,000. That made the nation's total of such families with "worst case" housing needs 5.32 million, about one seventh of the families who rent.
"The days of stereotyping cities as the locus of housing problems, education problems and crime problems are gone," Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo said in an interview. "Maybe that was true of the 1950's and 1960's. It is not true of the 1990's. Urban problems have become suburbanized."
To offset the disparity between supply of affordable units and people who need them, as shown by the report, the Clinton Administration is seeking $1.8 billion for new spending as part of its $25.8 billion housing budget request for the 1999 fiscal year. The additional money would be used for 103,000 rental housing vouchers, half of which would be given to people coming off welfare, and for a variety of housing and economic development programs.
Congress has not appropriated any new money for housing assistance since 1995, and how receptive lawmakers might be to the department's latest request is unclear, especially with both chambers already debating a $200 billion transportation bill.
But Mr. Cuomo said that with many of the largest cities losing population to adjacent suburbs, members of Congress, especially those from suburban districts, might be more sympathic to a budget request that focuses on the growing problems affecting their districts.
In some metropolitan areas, the number of suburban families in worst-case situations has far surpassed those from the adjacent city. By 1995 in Boston, for example, the department found 18,000 families in a worst-case situation, compared with 65,000 similar families in surrounding areas.
Over all, the report found, the largest increases among families in worst-case situations occurred in the Northeast and in the West, regions experiencing the most acute combination of decreasing supply of affordable units and rising demand.
Housing officials say that the rising demand for low-income housing in suburban regions reflects several major trends, including a rate of job growth that is much faster in suburbs than in cities. The problem with many of those jobs, officials say, is that they pay the minimum wage or only slightly higher, levels not high enough to ease the burden of finding affordable housing.

HEADLINE: In the Wings: Euro as Potential Rival to the Dollar

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
For the better part of this century the dollar has reigned supreme in global finance, both a symbol of American economic might and a contributor to it. But a new rival to the dollar could eventually prove more powerful than the German mark or the Japanese yen: a single European currency.
This weekend, the 11 nations of the European Union that have chosen to participate in the first stage of monetary union will take a big step toward making the long-planned single currency a reality: They will lock their exchange rates together in preparation for the program's formal start on Jan. 1. 
 The international influence of their new currency, the euro, will ultimately depend on the economic strength of these European partners -- 11 of the European Union's 15 members. And given the high unemployment rates and other problems now afflicting the Continent -- never mind the uncertainties about the willingness or ability of the individual countries to subordinate their needs for the common good -- the new system's success can by no means be taken for granted.
Despite those doubts, there is a growing consensus on both sides of the Atlantic that monetary union will have substantial ripple effects on the United States. And the euro could bring profound changes to an international financial system in which the dollar has been the anchor since a system of fixed exchange rates collapsed in the early 1970's and the dominant currency since the British pound started to lose influence and strength in the 1930's and 40's.
"Although the political, cultural and economic challenges are formidable," an International Monetary Fund study said, "the euro has the potential to reshape European and international financial markets and to transform" the world monetary system.
For the United States, the benefits of a successful euro could include greater political and economic stability on a continent that has spawned world wars. It could also make Europe an easier, less expensive region for American companies to sell their products and services.
But the United States could lose some of the prestige and diplomatic influence that goes with having a dominant currency. Borrowing costs could rise for the Government and companies. Economic growth could be reduced.
Some prominent economists in the United States, like Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, say the euro's potential impact on American interests is overstated. And no one is predicting that the euro will any time soon displace the dollar as the standard against which other currencies are measured.
But many economists and some American and European officials said the euro, if properly managed, would quickly establish itself as the undisputed No. 2 world currency.
Given that the combined economies of Europe already rival the American economy in size, economists said there was no intrinsic reason why the euro could not one day achieve parity in global status with the dollar.
"We will move from a purely dollar-centered world to a bipolar monetary world," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
"The euro will move up alongside the dollar as the second key currency and will attain market share pretty close to the dollar within three to five years," Mr. Bergsten forecast. "It will shift the whole structure of the international financial system."
The dollar has far greater weight in global finance than is indicated simply by the size of the American economy. The United States accounted for 26.7 percent of world output in 1995 and 18.3 percent of world trade, roughly equivalent on both counts to the combined 15 national economies in the European Union.
But the dollar accounted for 58.9 percent of the foreign-currency holdings of central banks and governments in 1996, according to the International Monetary Fund. The German mark accounted for 13.6 percent and the Japanese yen, 6 percent.
In foreign-exchange markets, the dollar was the currency being bought or sold in 83 percent of transactions in 1995, compared with 37 percent for the mark and 24 percent for the yen, according to the European Union.
European officials, even as they defend their nascent currency's credibility and potential strength, have been careful not to ruffle American feathers.
"I do not expect brutal changes overnight," said Yves-Thibault de Silguy, the union official in charge of the single-currency project.
Hugo Paemen, the European Union's representative in the United States, said it would be naive to think that a successful euro would not have implications for the balance of global financial power. "If you create a single European currency for 300 million people, it is going to be a very important force in the international financial sector," he said.
The Clinton Administration has played down concern about the effect of the euro on the dollar and American interests generally.
"If the euro works for Europeans, it will work for us," said Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. "It will mean a larger, more rapidly growing market for our products and a stronger partner for the U.S. around the world."
The dollar's standing, Mr. Summers said, will continue primarily to reflect the economic performance of the United States.
"As long as we keep our fundamentals strong, the dollar will do fine," he continued. Any shifts in international currency holdings out of the dollar and into the euro "are likely to be gradual and not to pose a threat to our economy," the Treasury official said.
But since the benefits of the dollar's leadership have been considerable, the United States has much at stake as the euro takes its place in the world financial system. The dollar has long been a safe haven for world investors, enabling the United States to attract vast amounts of foreign capital and to finance borrowing needs at lower interest rates than purely domestic demand for dollar assets would have allowed.
Money from abroad, especially from Japan, helped finance the huge Federal budget deficits of the 1980's and early 90's. And financial crises in Asia last summer and fall sent a flood of money into the United States as investors looked for a safe place to park their money, driving down interest rates and helping set off a wave of mortgage refinancings that reduced housing costs for many Americans.
The American trade deficit, though, has kept rising, and the United States thus needs to keep attracting money from abroad to paper over a huge current-account deficit, the broadest gauge of trade. Many economists consider this imbalance the biggest threat to the nation's long-run prosperity.
The dollar's standing in the world has gone hand in hand with the size and sophistication of American financial markets, helping Wall Street retain its role as the center of global finance. International investors buy dollars and dollar-denominated securities in confidence that they can easily sell them. When Japan's central bank needed dollars earlier this month to buy yen in the open market, supporting the yen's exchange value, it was reportedly able to sell $12 billion of Treasury bonds in New York in half an hour without upsetting the market.
The United States also benefits from the desire of foreigners to hold dollars in cash. By some estimates, the majority of American notes are held abroad. In developing countries and in those experiencing high inflation rates -- as well as among drug smugglers and other criminals -- dollars have become the all-but-official currency. Notes circulating abroad are a semipermanent, interest-free loan to the United States -- indeed, if Washington had to instead borrow the equivalent amount of money, say in Treasury bills, the interest payments would run in the billions annually.
Some economists dismiss the idea that the euro will soon be a serious challenger to the dollar because the dollar's status reflects more than half a century of American might.
Even if the euro does come to rival the dollar, they said, it will not necessarily have any substantial impact on the United States, especially since the country is running budget surpluses and does not need as much foreign capital. In an article this month in Fortune magazine, Mr. Krugman of M.I.T. put the potential loss to the American economy at just one-tenth of a percentage point of economic growth.
But another camp of economists thinks that the results will not be so benign for Americans. Richard Portes of the London Business School and Helene Rey of the London School of Economics said in a paper published last week that the United States could lose up to half a percentage point of annual growth from the establishment of a credible euro while the Europeans could gain half a percentage point of growth. The United States grew 3.8 percent last year, while the 11 nations expected to take part in the euro grew 2.4 percent.
Mr. Portes said their analysis assumed that the euro would stimulate the development of Europe's financial markets, creating a bigger and more liquid market for euro-denominated securities and supporting the euro's use in foreign-exchange transactions. One implication, he said, would be a tilt in the geopolitical balance in Europe's favor.
"Ultimately we're going to have to have a more cooperative and less U.S.-led process in things like international financial crises, where clearly the European voice is much less than its weight in the world economy," Mr. Portes said.

An article in Business Day on April 28 about potential effects of the euro, the planned common currency for Europe, misstated a study's estimates of its impact on the economies of the United States and Europe. The study, by Richard Portes of the London Business School and Helene Rey of the London School of Economics, said Europe could gain as much as four-tenths of 1 percent of gross domestic product (not half a percentage point of growth), while the United States could lose as much as a quarter of 1 percent of G.D.P. (not half a percentage point of growth).

HEADLINE: Lulu and Her Friends Are, Therefore They Shop

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Jennifer Steinhauer covers retailing for the Business section of The New York Times.

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, Conn.

 BODY:
LULU LEDERMAN sees the world of style in gradations, small subtle characteristics that distinguish a hip piece of clothing from a truly awful one. "There is good preppy and bad preppy," said Lulu, who is 14, as she made her way through the Buckland Hills Mall here.
"Bad preppy is snobby," she said, explaining that striped shirts, khakis and baseball hats from J. Crew are bad preppy, whereas the catalogue's fitted T-shirts and pastel skirts scored points for good preppy. 
 A pair of white chiffon drawstring pants hanging on a rack in an Express store drew further scrutiny. The style was a hit; the fabric, a miss. "You would look, like, 40 in these," Lulu said.
Her friend, Morgan Sokolow, a 16-year-old, nodded in agreement. "Old Navy did them in T-shirt material," Morgan said. "Those were cool."
Red is good, but it has to be really dark red, otherwise it is just horrible. Butterfly patterns are cool, but little flowers are over. Platform shoes are great, but they have to be the right style, otherwise they could, like, make you throw up or something.
Lulu, Morgan and their friend Sarah Thomas, all students at the Loomis Chaffee prep school nearby who gathered recently for a shopping trip, are what Teen-Age Research Unlimited, a market research firm in Northbrook, Ill., refers to as "influencers," a crucial group of teen-agers that embraces fashion trends early on, spends lots of money on them and takes other teen-agers on board with its utter coolness.
This group is not to be confused with the "edge" group, those youngsters who constantly change their look, consider themselves to be antifashion and drop trends as soon as influencers pick them up. Edge teen-agers are the first to pierce. They are moving targets. Adults with products to sell to them cannot hope to keep up.
The research firm identifies two other groups, the "conformers" and the "passives," who also pick up fashion trends, but much later than their more style-conscious peers.
"Conformers are very insecure," said Michael Wood, the director of syndicated research for Teen-Age Research Unlimited. "They make up the bulk of the teen-age population. They are looking for brands and badges to make them feel better about themselves and to get them to the next level."
The passives are last to the party, the sort of students who might be in the chemistry club and are dying to get this high- school business behind them so that they can move on and rule the world a la Bill Gates. Look for them in track pants next year. "A passive is much less interested in fitting in," Mr. Wood said. "They buy trends mainly because that is what is available."
Then there are the Lulus of the world, the bread and butter of marketers.
"These are the channelers, the first cool kids to try these things," Mr. Wood said. "Socially, they are the cream of the crop. They know their status and revel in it. If you can attract them, you have scored. The biggest kiss of death is for you to be a cool brand in the mind of the conformers and not the influencers."
Selling fashion to teen-agers is no small business affair. Generation Y, as this group is sometimes known, spent roughly $4 billion last year on cosmetics, clothing and other fashion items and is considered the most spend-happy generation of young people to come along -- ever.
Teen-agers are savvy and numerous: there are about 30 million in the United States now, and that number is to hit 35 million in 2010, according to the Census Bureau. They have learned how to spend at the sides of their baby-boomer parents. While they may not know which marketing category they fall into, they are happy to hold court for the market researchers who come calling to interview them and thereby place them in a shopping subgroup. In fact, this reporter found these three girls through Delia's, the catalogue company that sells teen-age clothing.
According to surveys, teen-agers make more household buying decisions than their parents' generation did, mostly because Mom and Dad are working and need shopping help. But this group also spends plenty on itself. For every espresso maker and sport-utility vehicle that their parents buy, teen-agers acquire skateboards, wide-legged jeans and little black handbags.
Just look at the rising earnings and stock prices of companies like Wet Seal-Contempo, the Buckle, Pacific Sunwear of California, all of which sell clothes to teen-agers. Even teen-agers in rural areas of the United States are onto the styles of their urban brethren -- and it is for this generation that Delia's and the catalogue Zoe were created.
Unlike the much smaller contingent before them, Generation X, which came of age during a recession, these teen-agers are far more willing to embrace consumerism as an indoor sport. "The message this group is receiving is that the country is in great shape," Mr. Wood said. "The economy is not an issue for their parents, so therefore it is not an issue for them. They are not being told no as much as Generation X was."
Lulu is the kind of girl grandparents refer to when they say "handful." Short with blond hair and a gait that resembles a dance step, she favors tiny tank tops, velvet jackets and Indian-print shirts.
Her friend Sarah is 16 and a German exchange student. She keeps her words to the point and has recently dumped her preppy look for ankle-length synthetic skirts. Don't be surprised to see her reading dark poetry. Morgan has an athletic build and walks through the mall with long, tan legs spilling out of a turquoise, butterfly-patterned mini-skirt.
Here were Lulu's pronouncements on the Express store: "Look at this line," she said, waving her hand toward denim skirts. "It is, like, younger. But then, like, there is the 50-year-old lady stuff over there," gesturing to tunics. "In fact, I've gotta get out of here; it is really starting to bug me."
Out in the mall, the girls pass the Piercing Pagoda. "I pierced my own bellybutton," Morgan said offhandedly.
Lulu added: "I wanted to do my nose.
I already asked. The answer was no."
A stop at Saint Cinnamon, where cinnamon buns were scarfed. Two teen-age boys passed by, and the girls scrutinized them. The guy in the checkered shirt and shorts was deemed cool, but his friend in black jeans failed. "A guy shouldn't wear colored pants," Lulu explained.
Next visit, Sam Goody. "I like everything from Notorious B.I.G. to the 'Little Mermaid,' " Morgan said, while Lulu perused the Jimi Hendrix section. Another boy walked by, this one in giant jeans and a striped shirt. "I like that look," Lulu said. "But not his hair" -- a bottle-dyed blond. "So really, he's not that hot."
She whipped out her parents' American Airlines Visa card to buy two CD's and said: "My parents won't mind. I'll pay them back."
Off to the Gap. Morgan quickly picked out a pair of boot-cut jeans. "For some reason, I like this shirt," Sarah said, touching a simple button-down cotton number. "This is one of those things you buy and it stays in your closet forever."
Back in the mall corridors, they gave American Eagle a miss. "They're a little too earth-crunchy for me," Lulu said. Abercrombie & Fitch, a considerably more expensive version of American Eagle, fared better, although the girls said it was too pricey and better, really, for boys.
Next stop: Contempo Casuals, an outpost of blaring hip-hop music, polyester dresses and trendy hair accessories. The winsome T-shirts, flowing dresses and butterfly-patterned skirts scored points but not purchases. In fact, the girls prefer to buy clothes from the Zoe catalogue, which they can peruse in their dorm rooms. The quality of Zoe clothes is superior, they said.
Sarah nonetheless bought a little pink knit hat and a small purse with a Chinese pattern on one side and an Indian sari fabric on the other.
Over to Hot Topic, a store that sells music-related merchandise and heavy-metal-style clothing and T-shirts that say things like, "If we are not supposed to eat animals, why are they made of meat?"
"OHMYGOD!" screamed Lulu, grabbing a slippery, bright blue metallic dress to try on. Morgan considered a pink marabou bra. And Sarah contemplated black imitation-leather pants.
Standing by the dressing room were three other girls, conformers, who eyed the three influencers with suspicion and a bit of contempt. The conformers' toes were painted sky blue (that was last spring). They were wearing low-slung jeans and carrying plastic Contempo bags. Lulu, Morgan and Sarah ignored them.
Morgan emerged from a dressing room in a red tube top and the fake-leather pants Sarah had eyed. She seemed completely at ease in her PG-13 outfit and looked both totally beautiful and inappropriately sexy. She chewed on a fingernail, walked back into the dressing room and changed.
Sarah came out next in a little white tank top and a black mini-skirt. She crossed her arms and looked more self-conscious. Lulu passed on a pink halter top.
It wasn't cellulite or wrinkles or upper-arm issues that bedeviled these girls -- these were simply not school clothes. But the thrill was shopping beyond the Gap, at a time when a pink marabou bra is somehow a choice. Only if it is, like, perfect.

Mike Tyson Faces the Music

BYLINE: By Neil Strauss 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
From boxing to wrestling to the record business? Mike Tyson is starting his own music company, Tyson Records. In an interview this week, he said the label was putting together a family of rappers, rhythm-and-blues groups and producers.
So far, Tyson Records seems likely to include Protege, a singing group from Baltimore, and Donnie, a 16-year-old singer formerly signed to LaFace Records, a leading rhythm-and-blues label run by Babyface and L. A. Reid. The rap pioneer Eric B. and the former Jodeci member Devante Swing are to be among the musicians working with these artists. For a cohesive, distinctive sound, Mr. Tyson said, he plans to have the producer and writer Bryce Wilson oversee the label's musical production. 
 "I'm into the music scene so intensely," Mr. Tyson said. "For 20 years, I've known about all these rappers: Grandmaster Flash, Grand Wizard Theodore, people a lot of rappers now aren't even aware of."
"I must have been 10 or 11 when I was put away," he continued, referring to his imprisonment for purse-snatching. "And all we had was music. We battled with people and entertained ourselves."
Speaking of the rap world, he said, "We made the industry, but we have no control over the destiny of the music."
At first, Tyson Records was going to be a completely independent label, Mr. Tyson's associates said. But Mr. Tyson decided it needed the resources of an international major label, and has been having discussions with Sony Records, among other companies. Recently, Mr. Tyson hired as an adviser Irving Azoff, a music executive who has worked with the Eagles, Steely Dan and Brian Wilson, and as his lawyer, John Branca, who has worked with Michael Jackson and the Rolling Stones.
"When you talk about the company, people might think, 'What is Tyson doing?' " said Michael (Blue) Williams, a former member of Queen Laifah's management team who was hired to oversee Tyson Records. "But Tyson knows to go get music people to run his music business, and he has found confident people. He has a real vision on how big he can make Tyson Records. And his excitement transfers over to his whole staff."
Though some record labels said they would be eager to work with Mr. Tyson, others have shied away, because his label has yet to prove itself, they said, not because of Mr. Tyson's controversial reputation. Mr. Tyson, the former heavyweight boxing champion, has made news in recent years for a rape conviction, biting a boxing opponent's ear and high-stakes lawsuits over money.
Mr. Tyson and his associates "made some overtures," said Al Cafaro, the chairman and chief executive officer of A&M Records, which recently made a label deal with Shaquille O'Neal. "But we weren't interested, primarily because we've done a number of label ventures recently. And at some point, you have to pick your shots and realize you can't do deals with everybody, because they take a lot of work. This seemed like another situation of a start-up, albeit with a very powerful personality."
In a month or two, Tyson Records plans to showcase its artists to the rest of the music industry. Arrangements are already being made to lease a casino in Las Vegas, Nev., for the occasion.
"You know how Mike's fights are?" Mr. Williams asked. "He feels like everything needs to be that big. And he believes in showcases. The industry is about hype, and if Mike does nothing else he brings hype."
 
New Age, New Rules
To his fans, the New Age composer Yanni may be a peaceful, beautiful music hero. But to many in the concert business, he is a dangerous villain.
In a an open letter to Yanni placed in concert-industry magazines, Danny Zelisko, the president of the Phoenix promotion company Evening Star, wrote, "The very foundation of this business that was intact when you decided to join it is now being shaken by the likes of you."
Yanni's offense is that on his current tour he did not play by one of the cardinal rules. In most cases, a promoter will work with musicians, helping put on their smaller shows for a financial loss in order to reap the rewards if the act goes on to greater success. But on his current tour, Yanni decided both to book and promote most of his concerts through his own management company, cutting out the middle men and keeping their fees for himself. This has been particularly frustrating in a transitional time for the concert business; so far this year, Yanni's tour has made more money than any other act except the Rolling Stones.
"People said just ignore it," Mr. Zelisko, who had worked with Yanni in the past, said about being slighted by him. "But how do you ignore someone coming to your town and waltzing off with three-quarters of a million? We're not here to be swept under the carpet when it's convenient."
Promoters aren't the only ones in the business that feel this way. "Strictly from a building manager's viewpoint, to hear about what Yanni did was disturbing," said Michael Marion, general manager of the Alltel Arena in Little Rock, Ark. "There's an unspoken rule in this business: If I helped you when you were small, when you get big, you're going to help me. But as a building manager, I would not turn him down because of it. I would be unhappy about it, but I have an obligation to the public to book this building."
By not playing by the rules and getting away with it, Yanni's current tour raises questions about the efficiency of the concert business. His manager, Danny O'Donovan, a former concert promoter, said that booking and promoting a tour this way allowed him to set optimum ticket prices that would reduce scalping, to control Yanni's image, to create special stand-alone local advertisements for the concerts, to avoid the sponsorship tie-ins of some promoters and to reduce many concert costs, from hall rental to insurance to merchandise fees. He noted that Yanni worked with local promoters in a few cities where it was advantageous to do so.
"This is the most efficient way to do a tour of this nature if you have only the artist's interest at heart," Mr. O'Donovan said. "Everything is consistent from city to city, and the artist makes more money in every city."
Bob Grossweiner, an editor at the concert-industry magazine Performance, said that it was unusual for an artist of Yanni's stature to do everything himself, but that economically it made some sense.
"When acts reach the arena level, the manager gets something like 15 percent of everything, a lawyer gets maybe 5, a business manager gets 5, the booking agent gets up to 10 percent of concert profits, and everyone else is nit-picking at what they've got," he said. "So at some point, Danny O'Donovan thought Yanni was a sure sell-out, and he could maximize the profits."
"But it threatens the business," Mr. Grossweiner continued. "Why should a promoter or an agent take a risk on a young act if somewhere down the line the act is going turn its head against everyone? If every act did that, then you'd have no one taking a risk on young talent."

Lame Lame Duck

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
In his latest standup gig, at the Washington correspondents' dinner last weekend, Bill Clinton made fun of the press for its retraction-stained, three-month romp in Monicaland. He can afford to yuk it up more than he even let on. The scandal, not to mention the media's obsession with it, increasingly looks like the best thing that could have happened to him.
The longer the focus remains on such as Paula Jones -- still the belle of the media ball, astonishingly enough, weeks after her 15 minutes of fame were officially terminated in Federal court -- the less we notice the hollowness of Mr. Clinton's second term. The more we marvel at the sheer prowess of the President's 67 percent job approval rating, the less we ask how he might actually be using this sky-high popularity to lead the country to some national end loftier than deflecting an impeachment proceeding. We know what the press has been doing since January, when it dumped the Pope in Cuba to administer Mr. Clinton's last rites. What has Mr. Clinton been up to? 
 Certainly he has sharpened his already superb skills as an entertainer. The man who didn't show up to explain his ineffectual Iraq policy to a disastrous Columbus town hall meeting has been as ubiquitous as the late, great Henny Youngman as an after-dinner speaker at celebrity fetes, from the Gridiron show to the Time magazine gala to the correspondents' dinner. (He doesn't do press conferences, though.) He has been fearlessly courageous in slaying Joe Camel even as he solicits cash at a fund-raiser thrown by a lawyer likely to gorge on fees from tobacco legislation. He has toured Africa, where he delivered a cost-free apology for American inattentiveness to the genocide in Rwanda on his own watch.
But Mr. Clinton's disingenuousness may have reached a new apogee last week in a Presidential action (or, more accurately, non-action) involving domestic disease, if not distant genocide. Like other such Administration non-sexual affairs since January, this one was forgotten by Washington's revelers within hours, as soon as Paula traipsed back on stage.
The story involved the President's literally last-minute decision not to lift the nine-year-old ban on Federal donations to programs, now in more than 20 states, that reduce the spread of AIDS by providing clean needles to drug addicts. Mr. Clinton didn't make this decision on the intellectually honest basis that he disapproved of such programs or deemed them ineffective. Quite the contrary. In announcing the President's decision, his Health Secretary, Donna Shalala, was flanked by top Government scientists endorsing new research indicating that needle exchange does reduce H.I.V. infection, and does so without encouraging drug abuse. "This is another life-saving intervention" was how Ms. Shalala put it -- even as she simultaneously offered nothing but hot air to aid such interventions.
"It is like saying, 'We acknowledge the world is not flat, but we are not going to give Columbus the money for the ships,' " said Daniel Zingale, of AIDS Action. That's a kind analogy. David Satcher, the Surgeon General, says that 40 percent of new AIDS cases -- some 33 a day -- are due to contaminated needles, 75 percent in the case of women and children.
So why did Mr. Clinton at the last minute fail to put money where his Administration's mouth is? He didn't have the stomach for fighting conservative Republicans in Congress who would predictably demagogue needle-exchange programs as a Government endorsement of heroin use. Though Secretary Shalala had been prepared to defend Federal financing of needle exchange against such attacks by arguing that "science, science, science" had driven the Administration to take action -- according to a "talking points" memo uncovered by The Washington Post -- it was politics, politics, politics in the end that persuaded the Administration to do nothing.
Had President Clinton had the courage of his convictions he might well have faced a fight in Congress. Perhaps he would even have lost it. But if a lame-duck President backed by a 67 percent approval rating and a booming economy won't risk a political battle over saving lives at home in an epidemic, what will he spend his political capital on? Nothing, it would seem, except saving himself.

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
For corporate fliers, airlines' alliances may mean more convenience but with higher fares.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
AS United Airlines and Delta Air Lines agonize over how to revive an alliance that was almost announced last week, until the Delta pilots' union demanded a seat on the board, business and leisure travelers are wondering what that alliance and two others that have been proposed will mean to them.
Depending on whom one believes, the answer is likely to be more convenient air travel or higher air fares, or possibly a combination of the two. 
In addition to the move by Delta and United, AMR's American Airlines and US Airways have proposed an alliance, as have Northwest Airlines and Continental Airlines.
Ralph Nader, the consumer advo cate, thinks the alliances are likely to shrink competition in the industry, and thus raise fares. So does the Business Travel Coalition, which recently said that businesses and communities "continue to pay dearly" for the 1987 merger between Northwest Airlines and Republic Airlines.
And yesterday Mark Johnson, president of the National Business Travel Association, reflecting a middle ground, said, "While these mergers may create avenues of seamless travel for consumers and marketing economies of scale for the carriers, we do not anticipate that these alliances will alleviate the high cost of air fares that business travelers experience."
While none of the three pending alliances involves a merger -- although that proposed between Northwest and Continental involves equity -- the American Society of Travel Agents also fears they will mean less competition and therefore higher fares. The society and the Coalition for Travel Industry Parity, consisting of 21 travel industry consortiums, are prime movers behind a Congressional bill that would require the Department of Transportation to scrutinize various airline practices that the society and coalition consider anti-consumer.
"But these alliances are not about fares, they're about convenience," said Kenneth P. Quinn, an aviation lawyer and former chief counsel for the Federal Aviation Administration. "Any airline can get you to a connection, if you don't mind how long you wait in the airport. But partners in an alliance time their flights for the convenience of connecting passengers."
When Air Transport World magazine named Northwest and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines co-winners of its airline of the year award for 1997, it cited the ability of those alliance partners to give travelers seamless connections to 400 destinations in 80 countries, in the process transforming the structure of the industry.
From three weekly trans-Atlantic flights a week in 1991 (between Minneapolis and Amsterdam), the partners now fly 162 weekly trans-Atlantic round trips, and this summer will fly 215. The global Star Alliance -- consisting of United, a unit of UAL; Air Canada; Lufthansa of Germany; Scandinavian Airlines System; Thai Airways, and Varig Brazilian Airlines -- integrates well over 6,000 flights a day to more than 600 cities. The United-Delta and American-US Airways alliances would each involve some 4,000 daily flights to hundreds of cities.
The major appeal of alliances to many passengers is the joining of frequent-flier programs, which allow members who belong to both carriers' programs to combine miles from each program. The alliances also bestow reciprocal access to the carriers' airport clubs here and abroad, and give frequent-flier members access to the alliance partner's destinations. Thus US Airways' frequent-flier members will, if the alliance goes through, have access to dozens of American Airlines cities in Latin America and the Caribbean, while American frequent fliers will be able to fly to dozens of cities along the Eastern Seaboard.
If the United-Delta alliance is approved, United passengers in Chicago could fly nonstop on United to Atlanta. If they then had business in Seattle, they could fly nonstop from Atlanta to Seattle on Delta, while still crediting those 2,181 frequent-flier miles to their United account. Otherwise, to collect those miles on United, they would have to fly to Seattle via a connection in Chicago, Denver or San Francisco.
What is behind the alliances is the airlines' determination to avoid another industry bloodbath, such as the one that saw United States carriers lose $13 billion between 1990 and 1994.
During those bleak years, according to Gary Wilson, the chairman of Northwest Airlines, airlines representing one-third of total United States capacity filed for bankruptcy-law protection and more than 100,000 airline employees lost their jobs. That, Mr. Wilson said, "forced all of us to refocus on the fundamental needs of our customers -- namely, convenience and reliability -- as well as the fundamental needs of the business itself."
Central to that refocus is the business traveler, particularly corporate travelers, who as the global economy becomes increasingly integrated will presumably choose the airlines or airline alliances that best satisfy their globe-trotting ways. Because they fly more often and pay higher fares -- sometimes 10 times as much for a seat identical to that of a leisure traveler sitting alongside -- business travelers account for as much as 60 percent of revenues on some airlines. In return, they expect more convenience and more flights, and alliances are an attempt to satisfy those expectations.
Both Delta management and its pilots realize that the carrier will be at a major disadvantage if the alliance with United falls apart, and either of the other pending alliances goes through. For despite being the nation's third-biggest and biggest airlines, respectively, both carriers have notable gaps in their route structures. Delta, for example, has relatively few routes in Asia, which after its economic woes subside is expected to become a huge market for air travel, while United service is thin between the Northeast and Florida, as well as throughout the Southwestern United States. American is the nation's second-largest carrier.
No doubt in recognition of Delta's vulnerability, Leo Mullin, the carrier's chief executive, told delegates to the International Airline CEO Conference in Orlando, Fla., two days ago that Delta would consider the pilots' demand for a seat on the board. "It doesn't mean yes," he said, then quickly added, "But it doesn't mean no."

HEADLINE: 3M's Earnings Decrease by 2%

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: MAPLEWOOD, Minn., April 28

 BODY:
The Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company said today that its first-quarter earnings had dropped 2 percent because of Asian economic problems and the strong dollar.
The company, which makes Scotch brand tape, scouring pads and industrial and electronics products, said it earned $400 million, or 98 cents a diluted share, in the three months that ended March 31, compared with $410 million, or 97 cents a share, a year earlier. That was a penny a share below Wall Street's expectations, according to a survey of analysts by the First Call Corporation. 
 "Earnings benefited from solid international growth and effective cost controls worldwide, while the strength of the U.S. dollar and the economic slump in Asia had substantial negative effects," said L. D. DeSimone, chairman and chief executive. Changes in currency exchange rates reduced earnings by an estimated 10 cents a share.
First-quarter revenues slipped to $3.7 billion from $3.71 billion a year earlier.
Shares of 3M rose $2.3125 a share, to $92.50, in New York Stock Exchange trading.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place -- A Red Scare in Hong Kong;
China's Prominent Public Stocks Lose Their Luster

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, April 28

 BODY:
China may now be the undisputed ruler of this former British colony. But some of China's most prominent public companies are feeling less welcome here today than they did before last year's handover.
A year ago this month, investors were surging into banks and brokerage firms to snap up shares of mainland Chinese companies newly listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Today, the bosses of some of these companies could not draw a crowd if they stood on street corners and hawked the shares themselves. 
 Red chips, as these stocks are called, have caught the blues.
From Citic Pacific to Beijing Enterprises to Guangdong Investments, Hong Kong companies controlled by China have fallen into disrepute among investors. The Bloomberg index of red-chip stocks has plunged 44.37 percent since last October, when the Hong Kong markets began their downward spiral. That slide is even steeper than the broader Hang Seng index, which dropped 29.87 percent in the same period.
"Investors want to see more focused companies," said John D. Pinkel, the head of China research at Merrill Lynch (Asia Pacific) Ltd. "They don't see why there should be a handful of diversified conglomerates in Hong Kong that are in the brewing business, the tannery business and the cement business."
Mr. Pinkel said the success of China Telecom, a cellular-telephone company that went public last October, suggests a new model for red chips -- one focused on a single business rather than straddled across many industries. Today, the company extended its reach by agreeing to acquire a cellular carrier in Jiangsu Province for $2.9 billion.
In a way, the woes of the traditional red-chip companies simply reflect a more realistic view of the Chinese market. Last spring, in the supercharged atmosphere of Hong Kong's impending return to China, investors here clamored for any company even remotely connected to the mainland. Foreign investors joined the rush, buoyed by the belief that China was on the fast lane to becoming an economic superpower.
Now, though, the handover is old news and China's growth prospects seem shakier than they have for several years. In this more sober environment, investors here and in the United States are starting to put Chinese companies under the same microscope they would use on I.B.M. or General Motors.
"The initial rush to buy red chips was from people who were really buying G.D.P. growth in China," said Joseph Ravitch, a banker who heads the communications and media practice at Goldman, Sachs in Hong Kong. "Now, managers and investors appear to be focusing on real earnings and shareholder value."
By those standards, many of the red chips are a sucker's bet. The typical mainland Chinese company based in Hong Kong is less a corporation than a grab bag of assets. Although some show impressive earnings growth, it is usually because they are continually acquiring new assets -- power plants, breweries, toll-road franchises and the like -- from their corporate parent across the border.
The financial reporting standards used by red chips still fall short of American companies. While most are audited by Big Six accounting firms, their balance sheets are frustratingly opaque. Analysts argue that when the supply of fresh assets dries up, the red chips will look like Chinese versions of the ITT Corporation and other conglomerates that went out of style in the United States in the 1970's.
The rationale for starting red chips is still alluring: Register a company in Hong Kong and use it as a repository for assets owned by the Chinese Government or various Chinese municipalities. Then take the company public and drop broad hints to investors that the company's politically well-connected managers will obtain more valuable assets at bargain prices. With China privatizing tens of thousands of businesses, such companies would seem to be a no-lose proposition.
For China, they were also a sure-fire way to raise capital. At the height of red-chip mania last summer, the total market capitalization of mainland Chinese companies on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange was $60 billion. One of the hottest stock offerings, Beijing Enterprises, went public last May at $12.48 a share (Hong Kong), or $1.61 (United States), and promptly zoomed up to $64.75 a share (Hong Kong), or $8.41. It has since settled at $17.20 a share (Hong Kong), or $2.23.
As with so many other red chips, investors simply began to take a closer look at Beijing Enterprises. The company, which is controlled by the Beijing city government, owns everything from hotels and food companies to the airport highway. But the businesses have little relation to one another and scant prospects for synergy. Moreover, analysts said the Beijing city government was rife with corruption and had mismanaged many of these assets.
"This company is going to disappoint people," said one analyst, who like others, requested anonymity for fear of offending Chinese officials.
Then there is the problem of management. Typically, the parents of these companies -- whether they be the Beijing Government or the State Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications -- chose the top executives of red-chip companies based on personal ties rather than their skills.
Such connections, called "guanxi" in Chinese, are essential in the early stages of a company's life, when it is essentially cherry-picking assets from its parent. But as the supply of fresh assets is exhausted, the company cannot rely solely on connections; it must actually begin to manage its businesses.
Some of the more mature red chips have tried to get around this challenge by buying into companies outside the mainland. But that can be expensive, since the companies borrowed heavily to make acquisitions before the Asian currency collapse and are now paying sky-high interest rates.
Consider Citic Pacific, one of the most established red chips. The company's parent, the China International Trust and Investment Company, was set up by the Beijing Government in the late-1970's with the support of Deng Xiaoping. The parent company, in turn, started Citic Pacific in the 1980's and listed it on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Citic Pacific rolled up seven consecutive years of increased per-share earnings by buying property, Hong Kong car dealerships, and a stake in Cathay Pacific Airlines. But, analysts said, it took on too much debt.
Last month, Citic Pacific reported 1997 earnings that fell well below the expectations of most analysts because of its increased debt payments. Citic's chairman, Larry Yung, said in a news conference that the company would face a "difficult" year in 1998. He declined a request for an interview.
Mr. Yung himself symbolizes the changing world of red chips. When he took the helm of Citic Pacific in 1987, he was the epitome of a well-connected mainland Chinese. His father, Rong Yiren, founded Citic's parent company and left in 1993 to become vice president of China. Mr. Yung became the steward of the Hong Kong Jockey Club.
But Mr. Rong retired from China's vice presidency earlier this year and Mr. Yung suddenly found himself fielding questions about whether Citic would thrive without a father in high places. Moreover, Citic's parent company, which had enjoyed the status of a state ministry ever since its founding, was stripped of that status in a recent Government reorganization. Now, Mr. Yung contends that Citic's success has very little to do with its connections to China.
Several of the red-chip companies are pinning their hopes on the ambitious economic changes being proposed by China's new Prime Minister, Zhu Rongji. Some Chinese officials have indicated that Beijing will spend more than $750 billion over three years on roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects. The red chips, with their vaunted connections, are hoping to garner lucrative contracts to build or manage these projects.
Cosco Pacific, for example, could benefit from increased cargoes flowing between China's ports, according to Kelvin Wong, the deputy managing director. Cosco, which is controlled by China's Ministry of Communications, owns stakes in container ports in Shanghai and three other cities. Mr. Wong recently traveled to the United States with other red-chip executives to sell investors on the idea that a free-spending Beijing will restore the luster of red chips.
But some experts have their doubts. "I would be skeptical of the notion that China will spend lavishly on infrastructure projects, given the fiscal constraints," said Miron Mushkat, an economist at Natcom Asia in Hong Kong.
Beyond Government spending, some experts wonder whether Beijing will rethink the whole concept of red chips. Instead of championing conglomerates as South Korea did with its "chaebols," China may instead encourage the development of many streamlined, single-industry companies -- as Taiwan has done.
"It is essentially a debate between the Taiwan model and the Korean model," said Gary Greenberg, the managing director of Van Eck Global Asset Management in Hong Kong, "And right now, the Taiwan model looks a lot better."
For proof of this, analysts point to the success of China Telecom, which owns the cellular telephone franchises for Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces. The company, which is controlled by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, went public last October in the teeth of the Asian currency crisis. Nevertheless, the stock has risen 20 percent since the beginning of the year, and the company currently has a market value of more than $24 billion.
China Telecom offers nothing but mobile-phone service. But it has more than four million customers and the prospect of millions more. The franchise in Jiangsu, which China Telecom agreed to buy today, will give the company an additional 450,000 subscribers and a potential market of 70 million people. Goldman, Sachs, which raised $4.5 billion in China Telecom's initial public offering, predicts the company will have 10 million subscribers across China by 2001.
At the rate China Telecom is growing, Mr. Pinkel of Merrill Lynch said, it could eventually compete head-to-head on its home turf with major overseas cellular companies, such as the AT&T Corporation or Germany's Deutsche Telekom. That will be critical, since China will have to open up its telecommunications and other domestic markets if it hopes to gain entry into the World Trade Organization.
Mr. Pinkel said at least one red chip was mimicking China Telecom's model of simplicity. Guangdong Investments, a diversified conglomerate controlled by the Guangdong provincial government, recently spun off its brewing and tanning companies. Guangdong Investments still owns transportation assets and is building roads and bridges in its home province.
Few things happen overnight in China, of course, and several analysts said the Government had not decided whether to phase out diversified conglomerates in favor of more focused companies. But investment bankers in Hong Kong said China was considering offering stock in one of its most prominent single-industry companies, the state broadcaster, Chinese Central Television.
Given the success of China Telecom, such an offering would probably take off. And it would lend credence to the argument that red chips need to look more like blue chips if they want to win back investors.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Continuing Fears About Rates Send Treasuries a Bit Lower

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities were slightly lower yesterday, keeping the yield on the 30-year bond at the highest level in nearly two months, as investors remained wary of a possible interest-rate increase by the Federal Reserve.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said "bond market feathers remain ruffled" by reports that the central bank at its March meeting on monetary policy adopted an inclination to make its next move on rates an upward one. 
 The 30-year Treasury bond slipped 8/32, to a price of 100 26/32, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.07 percent, from 6.05 percent on Monday, when bond prices posted their biggest losses in more than a half year.
Yesterday, the Treasury sold $13 billion of new two-year notes, following a heavy flow of new corporate supply last week. Today, it will sell $11 billion of five-year notes, which were yielding 5.766 percent in when-issued trading late yesterday.
The results of the two-year auction were solid, as expected, analysts said, with the notes awarded at a yield of 5.667 percent.
At first glance, two economic reports yesterday may have provided some evidence for those who fear that the Fed will raise rates in an effort to slow the economy and head off inflation.
The Commerce Department said that orders for durable goods rose four-tenths of 1 percent in March. But the rate of increase was lower than in February, and Mr. Fine noted that for the first quarter as a whole, orders were actually lower.
While durable goods orders may not be roaring ahead, the same cannot be said about consumer confidence, which rose in April after dipping a bit in March.
Other data coming this week include the Government's release tomorrow of its estimate of first-quarter growth in gross domestic product, as well as the Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of changes in wages and salaries.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new two-year notes:

HEADLINE: Japan, Sensing a U.S. Slight, Is Soothed a Bit by Albright

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 28

 BODY:
With Tokyo upset that President Clinton will not stop here on his trip to China in June, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright went out of her way today to emphasize firm United States-Japanese ties, toning down American criticism of Japan's economic recovery efforts and praising the Government's for what she called its boldness and courage.
Ms. Albright made a point of visiting Japan herself en route to China, aides said, and is considering a visit here to brief Japanese officials after Mr. Clinton's talks in Beijing, the first visit by an American President to China since the 1989 crackdown in Tiananmen Square. 
 In February 1989, when President Bush went to Beijing, he also visited Tokyo. But the Chinese asked Mr. Clinton to stop only in China, because President Jiang Zemin stopped only in the United States when he went to Washington last October, and Mr. Clinton agreed.
Japanese officials have politely made their unhappiness clear to Washington, and the American Ambassador, Thomas E. Foley, has stressed to Ms. Albright and the White House that Mr. Clinton's pursuit of a new relationship with China should not come at the expense of Japan, America's loyal Asian ally.
American officials have explained that Tokyo also wants better relations with Beijing, and has encouraged Washington to strengthen its own ties with China. They also note that Mr. Clinton has visited Japan twice, in 1993 and 1996.
Still, Ms. Albright's position today was intended to bolster Japanese confidence, and at a news conference and a speech to students at Sophia University, she concentrated on the United States-Japan relationship and its importance for Asian security.
Ms. Albright's praise for Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's $128 billion package of economic stimulation contrasted with Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin's more measured reaction on Friday.
"Generally we see this is as a bold and important step forward by the Government," Ms. Albright said at a joint news conference with Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi.
When it was suggested that her endorsement seemed "lukewarm," Ms. Albright objected, saying: "I in no way hope that my sentences or words were taken to be lukewarm. I used 'positive' and 'important' and 'courageous' and 'bold.' That's about as hot as I can make it."
But off the record, senior American officials express concern about Japan's economy, saying the program of Government spending, tax cuts and incentives is too small, comes too late to reassure the financial markets, and will not provide all the growth the Hashimoto Government estimates.
While Japanese officials say the package should stimulate growth of about 1.9 percent in the gross domestic product this year, American officials say the figure will be closer to 1.2 percent. Without the package, however, they fear Japan will slip into a recession.
Mr. Rubin and other American officials are calling for deeper structural changes, including, as Mr. Rubin said, "measures to strengthen Japan's financial system and open and deregulate its economy, to help establish a basis for long-lasting, domestic, demand-led growth."
Ms. Albright made similar points in private, her aides said.
But she also emphasized that she would meet Mr. Obuchi again next week in London, at a meeting to prepare for a summit meeting of the Group of 7 industrial countries, plus Russia. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hashimoto will meet a week later at the summit meeting, she noted.
On Wednesday, she flies to Beijing to prepare the Clinton visit.
In her speech today, she criticized Chinese rights policies, saying: "We must continue to speak with clarity. For while some Chinese dissidents have been released to exile in recent months, the Chinese Government's repression of dissent and religious freedom has not ceased."
At the same time, she noted that "this year has seen hopeful stirrings of a dialogue among China's students, scholars and officials about the need for political and economic change to go together."

HEADLINE: Rise Seen in Durable Goods And Consumer Confidence

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28

 BODY:
Consumer confidence rose to nearly its highest level in three decades during April, and orders and shipments for durable goods increased in March, according to reports released today.
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index rebounded to 136.7 points in April from 133.8 in March, putting it just below the 137.4 reported for February, which was the highest since October 1968. 
 And the Commerce Department reported that factory orders for durable goods increased in March, led by record demand outside the volatile transportation industry. Total orders rose four-tenths of 1 percent in March, after falling a revised eight-tenths of 1 percent in February, while orders excluding automobiles and airplanes rose nine-tenths of 1 percent last month.
The reports suggested that the economy's growth remains robust -- perhaps so robust that the Federal Reserve will move to head off inflation by raising interest rates.
"The economy is red hot," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. "The U.S. economy is going to cool down, or the Fed is going to have to do it for us."
Based on today's durable goods report, economists at Standard & Poor's MMS in Belmont, Calif., raised their estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product growth to a 3.7 percent annual rate, just below the 3.8 percent growth rate posted for all of last year.
Concern increased this week that Federal Reserve policy makers might raise the overnight bank lending rate because they see few signs of an expected slowdown in growth. At their meeting on March 31 they reportedly adopted an inclination toward increasing the overnight bank lending rate.
The Fed has been counting on growth to slow as Asian demand for American products declines. Though exports have slowed, so far there is little evidence that the broad economy has cooled.
The consumer confidence numbers suggest that the economy could gain strength. A Conference Board index measuring consumer expectations for the next six months rose to 115.5 in April from 107.9 in March.
The durable goods report showed that factory shipments of such goods, those designed to last three or more years, rose 1.4 percent in March after increasing 2.9 percent in February.
Business spending on capital equipment rose 2.5 percent in March, following a 1.8 percent increase in February. Shipments of production machinery rose by more than 30 percent in the first quarter of 1998 -- the largest gain in almost 15 years, according to MMS.
Transportation orders, when adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, fell in March, though unadjusted figures showed growth, suggesting the seasonal figures were skewed. And the Boeing Company, the world's largest aircraft maker, reported a rise in March orders to 48 planes from nine in February.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Labor Leader as a Fiery Country Preacher

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
SOMEONE handed James Butler a megaphone the other day when he was preaching to a rally of freshly laid-off union members, and a few old-timers smiled. He held it up, awkwardly, but it was obvious that a few batteries added nothing to his own extraordinary amplification, and he quickly dropped it.
"My voice is like one of those trumpet voices you hear in the churches in the clay hills of Carolina," he explained later. "You can't get up there with that soft tone. You've got to dramatize to get across. You've got to be a trumpet." 
 For the last few years, Mr. Butler has been pretty much the entire brass section of the municipal labor movement in New York City, using his position as president of Local 420, the hospital workers' union, to blare at the muted strings of the other city unions. He has condemned District Council 37, the umbrella group of municipal unions, for selling out his local at the behest of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, and last week his dire predictions seemed to come true when the Mayor laid off 905 hospital workers, most of whom belonged to Local 420. Another 600 layoffs are scheduled for this summer.
His fury renewed by the Mayor's move, Mr. Butler has rediscovered some of the old fire that has long set him apart from less-colorful labor leaders. He has led daily pickets at Harlem Hospital and at the home of Dr. Luis R. Marcos, president of the city's hospitals agency. And last weekend, standing tentatively with his two artificial knees, he took many of his members to a dawn protest vigil at Gracie Mansion. The rallies are reminiscent of his heyday leading protests in the 1970's against fiscal-crisis layoffs, and he is fully in his element at their helm.
"The Mayor is only thinking about a new Yankee Stadium, or Shea Stadium with an electric roof," he shouts in a blurry Southern accent bred in Tampa, Fla., shaving off the tops of consonants and mashing together vowels. In full cry, "Giuliani" becomes "Jewel-yana," as in "We're going to bring Jewel-yana to his knees," an unlikely vow that nonetheless generates a huge response.
Mr. Butler, 65, seems so comfortable leading the rallies, in fact, that many labor leaders wonder how much he really did to stop the layoffs that produced them. The Giuliani administration put the union on notice in 1995 when it reached agreement with District Council 37 not to lay off any city employees except the hospital workers, because it was hoping to sell several city hospitals. When Stanley Hill, the council's executive director, agreed to exempt the hospital workers from the no-layoff pledge, an enraged Mr. Butler said Mr. Hill had double-crossed his local.
BUT in the intervening three years, Mr. Butler did little to prevent the layoffs or to prepare his workers for them. City officials say they offered to make severance payments to his members if they would resign, or to transfer them to other agencies, but Mr. Butler refused.
"His union is in deep trouble," said Howard Berliner, a professor of health policy at the New School for Social Research. "It's been pretty obvious that Giuliani has wanted to downsize the hospitals, and it seems to me that Butler could have prepared his union for this a little bit better."
Mr. Butler said he rejected severance as bribery, concerned that many of his members -- who work as nurses' aides, housekeepers and kitchen employees -- would reach for the lump-sum payments without realizing they were giving up their jobs. "I was not going to take severance pay," he said. "I told them, you do what you've got to do, and I'll do what I've got to do."
Municipal labor in New York City has been so docile in recent years that Mr. Butler's stubbornness seems almost quaint by comparison, and his methods are inspired more by the civil rights movement than by more modern union efforts to retrain for a changing economy. The son of a high school teacher and a nurse, he grew up in Tampa hoping to become a doctor, but instead rose through the union's ranks after working as a nurse's aide at the old Fordham Hospital, acutely sensitive to life at the bottom of a hospital's ladder. Almost all of Local 420's 11,000 members are black or Hispanic, and his is certainly the only municipal union with its own gospel choir and "Freedom Bus" that travels the country to help out workers in difficulty.
His union's offices are on 125th Street in Harlem rather than at the council's headquarters downtown, and he has set his union apart from the others for his 25 years in office, a policy that has often led to clashes with his superiors. In 1979, Victor Gotbaum, Mr. Hill's predecessor, charged that Mr. Butler had abused his expense account; the charges were withdrawn, but Mr. Gotbaum still says Mr. Butler -- who makes $120,000 a year, five times more than most of his members -- is authoritarian, and questions his ethics.
Mr. Butler says Mr. Gotbaum never liked him because he kept his local independent, and says Mr. Giuliani is out to get him because he supported the Rev. Al Sharpton and then Ruth W. Messinger in last year's election.
"My members are being lynched because Giuliani doesn't like Jim Butler," he said, his eyes drifting downward in contemplation. "But Jim Butler is not a yes-yes man. I'm not going to sit back while my members are at the kitchen table, seeking out help, reading the 27th Psalm."

HEADLINE: 8% Revenue Growth Seen for Chips in '98

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., April 28

 BODY:
The worldwide semiconductor market is experiencing its third consecutive lackluster year, with industry revenue projected to grow 8 percent, to $159 billion, this year, according to Dataquest.
In 1997, revenue rose 3.5 percent, to $147 billion, after declining 6.3 percent the year before. 
 One of the main culprits remains low prices for dynamic random access memory chips, or D-RAM's, according to Joe Grenier, vice president and director of Dataquest's Semiconductor Device programs.
"The Asian financial crisis, low D-RAM pricing and D-RAM overcapacity, and the general overcapacity and pricing pressures that exist in other product segments will hamper semiconductor revenue growth this year, although some product segments will achieve robust double-digit growth rates," he said.
In 1999, however, the worldwide semiconductor industry will return to strong growth, with revenue expected to rise 18 percent from projections for 1998, to more than $188 billion, Dataquest said.

HEADLINE: From Welfare Roll to Child Care Worker

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN 

 BODY:
Many day care centers, especially for-profit chains, are hiring welfare recipients to care for young children.
In a survey of 158 centers in five cities, the Center for the Child Care Work Force, a nonprofit research and advocacy group in Washington, found that 35 percent of the centers employed welfare recipients. 
 But 80 percent of the for-profit chains, the fastest-growing segment of the day care industry, employed welfare recipients as against 40 percent of the independent, nonprofit centers, 30 percent of the church-sponsored centers and 20 percent of the independent, for-profit centers.
"For-profit child care has a history of going after low-wage workers," said Deborah Phillips, an author of the study. "They used to go after grandparents, and now they're going to welfare recipients. They are hired primarily as the lowest-paid assistants at centers with the lowest wages. Absent training and anything like a decent wage, this solution to welfare reform and need for child care is unlikely to provide women a route to self-sufficiency."
The Federal welfare overhaul law requires recipients with young children to find work, and that has increased the demand for both child care services and jobs for many women with little education or job training. Many states have responded to those dual needs by putting those women to work in child care centers, raising concerns both for the women hired and the children they care for.
The centers that pay the lowest wages are the ones most likely to employ welfare recipients. Fewer than half the centers that hire welfare recipients offer on-site training, and only 1 in 5 offers the kind of college-credit training required for the better-paying child care jobs.
"These women are just thrust into classrooms," said Ms. Phillips, who is also director of the National Academy of Science's Board on Children, Youth and Families. "If this was first-grade teachers we were talking about, I don't think we'd consider doing this."
The new study is based on a sample of child care centers in Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, Phoenix and Seattle. In 1988, the center did an in-depth study of staffing and quality at 227 centers in those cities, finding that the best child care was in nonprofit centers, and those with the highest wages, lowest turnover, best training and fewest children assigned to each teacher.
The centers in the new study represent those from the original sample that were still operating and willing to participate in the follow-up. The 70 percent that survived and were included in the new study, the center said, tended to be the better ones.
But even among these centers, wages and turnover remain problems. The average turnover rate was 31 percent, with one-fifth of the centers reported losing half or more of their teaching staff in the past year. Turnover in the for-profit chains was 45 percent, compared with 20 percent in the centers accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children.
Centers that pay higher wages have less turnover. But the average child care worker earns less than a parking lot attendant. Entry-level child care jobs pay $6 an hour, or $10,500 a year, a rate that, adjusted for inflation, has increased just a penny an hour over the last decade, and one that keeps many child care workers below the Federal poverty line, $12,830 for a family of three. Even child care teachers in the highest-paid category -- mostly people with college degrees and early childhood training -- earn $10.85 an hour, or $18,988 a year, less than the $19,656 average salary of working women with a high-school diploma.
The decade between the two studies was a time of increased public funding for low-income families' child care, through the Child Care and Development Block Grant. For-profit chains tripled their revenues from public subsidies over the last decade, the study found, while independent nonprofit centers experienced a 4 percent decrease in revenue from public subsidies.
The center would not say which for-profit chains were included in the study.

French-German Feud Dampens Euro Enthusiasm

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, April 28

 BODY:
With only a few days remaining before European leaders approve the final preparations for a single European currency, the institution that is supposed to be in charge is still waiting for its leader and its marching orders.
Based in a Frankfurt skyscraper called the Euro Tower, the European central bank does not yet officially exist. But it already has a staff of 400 economists and technical experts, who have been diligently laying the groundwork for a pan-European monetary policy. 
 If the currency, the euro, is introduced on schedule next Jan. 1, the bank will become the European equivalent of the Federal Reserve in the United States. It would have supreme authority over the new currency, which means that it would control interest rates and, to a great extent, the growth rates of 11 nations from Spain to Germany.
Right now, though, the future bank remains caught in a crossfire between France and Germany, the two anchor members of the new monetary union. After months of bickering, the two countries are still fighting over rival candidates to lead the bank and over basic questions on how it should be run.
Both matters were supposed to have been settled long ago. Instead, they have festered and now threaten to sour the celebration of hard-won unity in Brussels this weekend.
If European leaders fail to announce a bank president by Saturday, the deadline they set for themselves long ago, they are likely to undermine the new currency's credibility and raise questions about the project's future. Even if they do reach a last-minute deal, which is likely, the underlying tensions are likely to reappear time and again as the bank gets down to business.
"For politicians, this kind of thing can be very, very embarrassing," said Holger Schmieding, an economist who follows euro issues for Merrill Lynch in London.
Behind the scenes, economists, statisticians and computer experts are rushing to set up the structure for the new central bank. They work at a forerunner organization called the European Monetary Institute, and their number has increased over the last year to 400 from about 250 and is expected to reach 500 by January. Yet before it can make act, the central bank can only wait for a president and a council who will make the real decisions.
Created four years ago by the European Union, the institute has hired staff members from central banks around Europe. They have prepared reams of studies on policy questions, supervised the designing of new bills and coins, and overseen the existing system under which European countries coordinate their exchange rates.
Now the pace is accelerating. Under the plans for monetary union, the institute will be legally converted into the new central bank later this year and will set monetary policy for all 11 countries. National currencies will remain in circulation for three more years, and will be entirely replaced by euros in 2002.
The new institution will control the basic money supply. It is also to develop a new system for conducting foreign-exchange operations. And it is to be responsible for setting up a Europe-wide system for payments and settlements between financial institutions.
Finally, it will supervise the production of euro banknotes, which will be printed by mints in each country.
But feuding over the presidency and the bank's priorities has gotten worse as European leaders have gotten closer to the point of no return. Almost every country except France has long assumed that the first bank president would be Willem Duisenberg, known generally as Wim, who was head of the Dutch central bank until last year and is now president of the European Monetary Institute.
But France has insisted that a Frenchman get the top job, as compensation for allowing the central bank to be based in Frankfurt rather than Paris. The French candidate is Jean-Claude Trichet, currently head of the Bank of France.
Both men share the basic economic philosophy of the Bundesbank, and their monetary policies have moved in lockstep with those of Germany. Indeed, Mr. Trichet followed that policy even when it pushed the value of the French franc so high that it crippled exports and increased unemployment.
"In terms of economic ideology, they are almost indistinguishable," said David Miles, professor of economics at the University of London.
Political leaders in both countries are convinced that the issue is important. French officials, arguing that they are entitled to name a bank president, have insisted that the central bank needs to be more accountable politically and that it should place a priority on increasing employment as well as simply preserving price stability.
That is anathema to German leaders, and the Maastricht treaty that established the ground rules for monetary union seems to solidly take the German view. Under the treaty, the new central bank is to be totally independent from political influence and is only allowed to consider the issue of price stability when it charts monetary policy.
German central bank officials gave icy approval last month to the introduction of the euro, but not before firing off a long list of criticisms at countries like Italy and Belgium for failing to push through real fiscal reform.
The choice of a bank president is not the only subject of dispute. European leaders must also name members of the central bank council. Under the law, the council will consist of the central banker from each of the 11 members as well as 6 other people. Depending on which countries receive the seats, the balance of power could tip slightly in favor of Germany or France.
Finally, the countries are sparring over a separate advisory group known as the Euro-X council. This group, conceived at France's insistence, consists of central bankers from each country and is to meet regularly to evaluate the bank's policies.
Financial analysts are watching for signs that the Euro-X council will turn into a standing organization, with a staff that could generate popular and political pressure on the bank.
"My guess is that Duisenberg will be named president, and that it will be for eight years," Mr. Schmieding of Merrill Lynch said. "But the French will have to be given a lot in return."

HEADLINE: Surging Economy Is Lifting Social Security, U.S. Finds

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28

 BODY:
Even before the Clinton Administration and Congress settle on the politically delicate steps needed to insure Social Security's long-term health, the strong economy has bolstered the retirement system's financial condition, the Government reported today.
The Administration said the latest review of Social Security's books showed that higher-than-expected economic growth, low inflation and low unemployment had combined to extend the retirement system's solvency by three years, to 2032, from the date projected last year. 
 President Clinton said the news, while welcome, should not divert the nation from taking whatever steps are necessary to make certain that Social Security can withstand the coming retirement of the 76 million strong baby boom generation.
Today's trustees report does not fundamentally change Social Security's outlook, which is being shaped by the aging of the population more than by short-term economic performance. But it shows how sensitive Social Security is in the long run to unanticipated economic changes, and provides ammunition to both defenders of the current system and advocates of broad changes.
Even with the new projections, Social Security will be able to pay only three-quarters of promised benefits after the system exhausts all its reserves in 2032.
But defenders of the current Social Security system said the news, contained in a report by Social Security's trustees, suggested there should be no rush to adopt any sweeping changes, like the proposals to create private investment accounts as part of Social Security, an idea that has emerged as the main ideological issue in the debate.
John Rother, the legislative director of the American Association of Retired Persons, said the report confirms that Social Security "can be strengthened with relatively modest reforms provided we act prudently within the next few years."
The Government also reported that Medicare, the health care program for the elderly, would remain financially sound until 2008, reflecting changes made to Medicare's hospital insurance program as part of last year's balanced-budget deal.
Before the budget deal, the Government projected that Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund would be depleted in 2001. Today's report was slightly less optimistic about Medicare than studies by Medicare's chief actuary in September and by the Congressional Budget Office in January, both of which said the hospital trust fund would remain healthy until 2010.
Since January, when Mr. Clinton proposed that the nation spend this year debating how best to address Social Security's looming problems, a wide-ranging debate has emerged over whether the system can be shored up through incremental steps like raising the retirement age and limiting cost-of-living increases, or whether Social Security should be transformed to allow individuals to seek higher returns by investing some of their payroll taxes in the stock market.
The report said that the 12.4 percent payroll tax, split between workers and employers, would more than cover benefit payments through 2013, rather than through 2012 as projected in last year's report. Payroll taxes and the interest paid on reserves accumulated in Social Security's trust funds will cover benefits through 2021, today's report said, an improvement of two years from last year's projection.
In the ensuing years, as the ratio of working people to retired people declines, Social Security will eat into its reserves, exhausting them by 2032 under the new projection, rather than in 2029 as predicted last year.
The projections are based on a middle-ground set of economic assumptions that the trustees said provides their best estimates of the program's financial future. A more optimistic set of assumptions showed the program remaining solvent indefinitely, while a more pessimistic scenario showed the trust fund being exhausted by 2022.
To proponents of changing Social Security, the report was more evidence that the current system is unsustainable and that now is the time to shift toward a more market-based system that gives individuals more opportunity to reap higher returns.
The report "confirms that Social Security is in crisis and cannot be sustained in its present form," Daniel J. Mitchell and Gareth G. Davis of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group, said in a statement. "The only solution is to give workers the freedom to set up private accounts."

'Twas a Looker in Its Day And Still Draws the Eye

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
"Look," the building said.
Needlessly. In 1950, there was no way to miss the new office tower at 488 Madison Avenue, across 51st Street from St. Patrick's Cathedral. With two miles of ribbon windows sandwiched between undulating, round-edged layers of glazed white brick, it was a dazzling wedding cake quite unlike anything New York had ever seen. 
 Enormous letters affixed to the summit of the 23-story tower spelled out "Look Building," for the prime tenant, Look magazine, the mass-circulation flagship of Cowles Communications.
The letters are long gone (though they survived longer than the magazine, which folded in 1971), but otherwise 488 Madison Avenue has regained much of its gleam under a three-year exterior renovation by the architectural firm of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates that is nearing completion.
What makes the renovation noteworthy is that a white-brick postwar facade has been rejuvenated instead of being obliterated in the name of modernization, as almost any owner would have done not long ago.
Malcolm Holzman, the partner in charge of the renovation, said the goal was to "keep the building as it is and not make it into something it can never be."
Ned Kaufman, an associate director of the Municipal Art Society and a leading advocate of the preservation of modern architecture, said the renovation would be "a very valuable and important model." The society's headquarters are at 457 Madison Avenue, cater-corner to the building.
"The owners and architect saw past the grime and reached back to the real character of that building," Mr. Kaufman said. "The changes they made were small, but they brought it back to life. It just gives pleasure to everyone who walks past."
What most bedeviled the building were water leaks, particularly around the terraces formed by the many setbacks. About 20 percent of the brickwork had to be replaced. The original slate windowsills, some of which had crumbled, were replaced with aluminum.
In the interest of economy, the original steel window frames were replaced with aluminum. As a distinctive touch, the window mullions are in the form of tapered fins.
The decision to renovate the facade rather than rebuild it appealed to the owners for more than esthetic reasons. "They didn't want to spend a ton of money," Mr. Holzman said. "They wanted something that was adequate, appropriate and looked good."
"Since the building has lasted 50 years," he said, "we decided we could leave most of it, because it might last another 50 years."
The building has been owned since the early 1970's by a partnership of the Feil family and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.
Other properties in the Feil portfolio are 7 Penn Plaza, at Seventh Avenue and 30th Street; 250 Park Avenue South, at 20th Street; the Gramercy Park Building, 257 Park Avenue South, at 21st Street, and the former Roosevelt Building, 841 Broadway, at 13th Street.
The family keeps a low public profile. Jeffrey Feil, president and chief executive of the Feil Organization, deferred to Mr. Holzman for comments on the renovation. He would not disclose the cost of the project.
Perhaps the biggest and best known tenant is the monthly publication Institutional Investor, which is aimed at top executives of banks, brokerage houses, money management firms, insurance companies and other corporations.
Institutional Investor, which was bought last year by Euromoney Publications P.L.C., occupies most of the 12th, 14th, 15th and 16th floors, and has subtenants on half of the 17th floor. Its lease runs through 2002.
Abbeville Press, a book publishing company, occupied two floors, but recently moved downtown to 22 Cortlandt Street.
Publishing companies have always been a part of 488 Madison Avenue, which was developed by Percy and Harold Uris. Look magazine was an original tenant. So, too, was Esquire Inc., which filed suit to prevent the tower from being designated the Look Building. Esquire feared that the public would mistakenly assume that its publications -- Esquire, Coronet and Apparel Arts -- were connected with Look magazine. But the name went up anyway.
Look occupied six floors at 488 Madison Avenue until 1971, when it succumbed to rising postal rates and declining advertising, despite its circulation of 6.5 million. The "Look" sign lasted at least until 1980.
Another renowned tenant was the industrial designer Raymond Loewy. During the time he was at 488 Madison Avenue, from 1951 to 1957, Loewy designed the double-deck Scenicruiser bus for Greyhound. It is not hard to see a link between its streamlined profile and that of the Look Building.
In his exhaustive survey of modern architecture, "New York 1960" (Monacelli Press, 1995), Robert A. M. Stern ranked the Look Building as perhaps the best postwar work by the firm of Emery Roth & Sons.
But with the proliferation of other white-brick towers, followed by glass-walled buildings, 488 Madison Avenue looked less and less pioneering.
In the late 1980's, the storefronts and base of the building were given a uniform treatment of tinted glass and black aluminum panels in a renovation designed by Horowitz Immerman Architects.

HEADLINE: THE NATO DEBATE: THE OVERVIEW;
SENATORS REJECT BID TO LIMIT COSTS OF ENLARGING NATO

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
The Senate today overwhelmingly rejected a measure to limit the cost to American taxpayers of weapons to the three Eastern European countries nominated to join the NATO military alliance.
The vote, 76 to 24, was the first of as many as two dozen amendments the Senate may tack onto the resolution to add Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to the alliance. 
 At issue in the amendment, designed to cap United States costs, was whether the three nations can afford the armed forces required for NATO membership or will end up as wards of the wealthier 16 member nations.
The amendment, proposed by Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, would have restricted the amount of military subsidies the United States provides to the prospective members to 25 percent of total NATO aid to the countries. The aid would be in the form of grants, loan guarantees and surplus arms.
"Can they afford to bear the burden or not?" Mr. Harkin said. "We've been told they can. Now I'm hearing, well, maybe they can't, we'll have to give them subsidies for weapons. If that's the case, do they have the economic strength to join NATO?"
But opponents of the measure said that Mr. Harkin was confusing two separate issues -- NATO expansion and foreign arms sales -- and that the amendment jeopardized Washington's ability to supply arms to allies in times of crisis.
"The United States has not signed up to foot the bill," said Senator Gordon H. Smith, an Oregon Republican. "The amendment attempts to strangle NATO expansion," he added, by placing "unreasonable restrictions on expenditures."
In the second day of lively debate this week, Senators jousted on a range of issues, from NATO's future missions to a proposal that the three former Warsaw Pact nations now up for a key to the NATO club fully open their archives to help account for American servicemen missing from past wars or cold war incidents. Excerpts from the debate, page A12.
The Senate will vote on these issues later in the week.
Expanding NATO requires the approval of two-thirds of the Senate, but amending the resolution needs only a simple majority. Senate critics of expansion, conceding that they face an uphill battle to defeat the resolution, say their strategy now is to win some amendments. A final vote is likely later this week.
Few issues have raised more concern among Senators about enlarging the alliance than the cost.
The issue is confusing because cost estimates are all over the map, from $1.5 billion to $125 billion over a decade or more, depending on the assumptions. But the Pentagon insists that the best 10-year estimate now is $1.5 billion, with Washington's share at $400 million.
"There has been a lot of misinformation about the costs, some of it understandable," Defense Secretary William S. Cohen told reporters on Monday.
Mr. Harkin argued that the Administration and other supporters of NATO expansion were guilty of false advertising when they said enlargement would cost $400 million over a decade.
That figure covers only "common costs" shared among all members, like maintaining NATO's headquarters buildings in Brussels and the alliance's fleet of Awacs radar planes. It does not cover the various subsidies that the United States Government pays for when it sells or transfers weapons to foreign countries. A recent study by the World Policy Institute found that Government subsidies represented $7.8 billion of $12 billion in American arms exports in 1996.
"We're told it's only going to cost $400 million, but this could go up and up and up with subsidies," Senator Harkin said.
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat whose state has several large military contractors, warned that the measure would "hurt American defense workers whose products will not be able to be sold in these three countries."
Mr. Harkin confronted Mr. Lieberman, saying: "This is a whole new venue in this debate about jobs. I thought this was about democracy." Mr. Lieberman quickly retreated.
"No, the overall debate is not about American workers," Mr. Lieberman said. "It's about the principles of freedom."
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Delaware Democrat and leading supporter of NATO expansion, said that competition for arms sales to fellow NATO members already existed and that the Harkins amendment would only hurt American companies.
"If you don't let Lockheed or Martin Marietta sell, with subsidies, to the Greeks or the Spaniards, you're just subsidizing the French," Mr. Biden said. "We'll lose our competitive advantage."
Moreover, Mr. Biden said, Mr. Harkin was confusing NATO expansion and foreign arms sales. "We are taking great big apples and putting them in a basket of small oranges," he said.
Senator John W. Warner, a Virginia Republican who opposes NATO enlargement, disagreed, saying there is an unwritten commitment by NATO members to help newcomers get a leg up.
"While there is nothing fixed in law for increased contributions for these three potential new members, there is a moral obligation," Mr. Warner said.
The scant support for his amendment did not dissuade Mr. Harkin from broaching an even more controversial point: Why have NATO at all?
"If something is born because of the Soviet Union, what are the reasons not only for continuing it, but for expanding it?" Mr. Harkin asked. "There are other means to promote democracy and economic markets."
He continued: "I'm really worried we're buying into a mentality of the cold war, and not looking to the next century. We're not about to see any headlines that say Russian troops are marching toward Poland or the Czech Republic."
"Europe is powerful," Mr. Harkin said. "Europe is wealthy. There's no Soviet Union. There's no threat. Europe has been rebuilt. Let's look ahead."
Throughout the afternoon, however, many Senators marched to the floor to back the treaty's expansion.
"If NATO doesn't enlarge, the Iron Curtain remains permanent, and the unnatural division will live on longer than the Soviet empire did," said Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat, adding that NATO would remain "an alumni club for cold war victors."
"As a Polish-American, I know that the Polish people did not choose to live behind the Iron Curtain," Senator Mikulski said. "These countries are not asking for a handout. They are not asking for our protection. They are asking to be full partners in the new Europe."
Senator Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican who supports expansion, urged caution when examining the concern that NATO's eastward push would antagonize Russia, saying: "Here we are, almost 10 years after the fall of Communism, with the Berlin wall, talking about, 'Well, I don't know, should we do this? We might offend our Russian friends.' "
Mr. Hagel continued: "I don't see an awful lot of sense in this. Yes, it is important to understand the Russians. Yes, it is important to engage the Russians. But we should not allow Russia, or any other nation, to dominate the final analysis and decisions of our nation's security interests."
On Wednesday and Thursday, Senators will debate amendments to require membership in the European Union as a prerequisite for NATO candidacy and to wait at least three years before considering the next round of new members.
For some Senate opponents of expansion, however, admitting the three countries under review will inevitably lead to more, and to a weaker alliance.
"This is just the beginning to more and more countries," said Senator James M. Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican. "After the first three recruits, I don't see where there's an end to it."

HEADLINE: Alternative Public Schools Cost More but Do Better Job, Report Says

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
Seeking to resolve a contentious question surrounding New York City's small, alternative public schools, researchers have found that they spend more per pupil than traditional schools but get better results for their money by graduating more students in four years.
The research report, due for release today, supports the long-held view of critics of the alternative schools that they spend more for each pupil than traditional schools. But the researchers say their more significant finding is that, with higher graduation rates at the smaller schools, the cost per graduate is about the same. 
 The two-year study of 128 city high schools by researchers at New York University found the small schools (those with 600 or fewer students), spent $7,628 a year for each pupil, about $1,410 more than the larger schools (those with 2,000 or more students), based on 1996 budget figures. But they spent only $25 more per graduate.
The results of the study come just a few months after Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew raised questions about the efficacy of smaller schools, particularly their costs. By suggesting an answer -- that small and large schools each spend about $49,500 per graduate over four years -- the N.Y.U. researchers offer at least the possibility that a long-unresolved debate may be substantially quieted.
The small schools themselves had contended all along that they were as cost-effective as the city's older and more traditional large high schools. The larger schools had respectfully disagreed.
The research, until now, had been inconclusive.
While previous studies have shown that struggling learners, particularly those in low-income neighborhoods across the country, benefit from attending schools in smaller settings, the N.Y.U. researchers suggested that creating such schools should now be considered good economics.
"I think this means that the investment is well worth it," said one of the authors of the study, Norm Fruchter, the director of the Institute for Education and Social Policy at N.Y.U., "This is particularly true for poor kids and kids of color who have not done well in their previous education."
The researchers said that there were limits in the conclusions to be drawn from their work. Because the schools examined had to have several years' worth of graduation data, most of the dozens of alternative academies founded since 1993 were excluded. But the researchers said they were confident that the 10 older alternative schools examined -- including the Central Park East Secondary School (329 students) and the Choir Academy (426 students), both in Harlem -- were similar enough to the newer batch of schools to provide relevant data.
And they added that the preliminary graduation data at many of the newer schools, centered on such themes as the city's museums and its infrastructure, are even more impressive than at the schools that were studied in depth.
The results of the study come at a crossroads for the small-school movement in New York City, which has been viewed as a national model and a precursor of the nascent charter-school movement.
Last fall, Dr. Crew described small schools as sexy, but not necessarily the most scalable type of reform, by which, he explained, he meant that they were hard to replicate in a cost-efficient way that got results.
Indeed, a set of rules drafted by a mid-level Board of Education official -- but never endorsed by the Chancellor -- would have, among other things, restricted the size of small schools, raising the minimum enrollments to 400 for elementary schools, 600 for middle schools and 800 for high schools. Those numbers sent shock waves though a movement that believes that schools with as few as 200 students are the perfect foil to the factory-like high schools of old.
Since then, Dr. Crew has gone out of his way to express his support for small schools. And his spokeswoman, Chiara Coletti, said that the N.Y.U. study would only enhance that support.
"Popular wisdom has it that small schools are particularly more expensive than large schools," Ms. Coletti said. "If the popular wisdom proves not to be valid, this is wonderful news for us."
Champions of small schools predicted that the report would go a long way toward cementing the schools' place in the spectrum of educational offerings in the city.
"People are used to thinking about cost per pupil," said Heather Lewis, the executive co-director of the Center for Collaborative Education, a network of 40 alternative schools, none with more than 500 students. "But they don't think about cost per graduate. I'm not saying it's the ultimate measure. But it is another way of looking at what it takes to successfully get kids through school."
The N.Y.U. researchers, who used graduation rates and budget figures tabulated by the Board of Education, made clear that they could not have undertaken such an analysis until recently because it was not until 1996 that the board was able to identify how much of its budget was apportioned on a school-by-school basis.
The researchers calculated annual spending per student to be highest in the smaller schools. That $7,628, based on 1996 budget figures, was an increase of $1,410, or 23 percent, over large schools; $685, or 10 percent, over so-called smaller medium schools (600 to 1,200 students), and $780, or 11.4 percent, over larger medium schools (1,200 to 2,000 students).
But in terms of graduation rates, the smallest schools were found to be superior, with 63.2 percent of students in the class of 1996 graduating in four years, compared with 55.9 percent in large schools, 50.4 in smaller medium schools and 51.2 percent in larger medium schools.
When those figures, and a host of others, were combined, the researchers found the cost per graduate to be $49,554 in the smaller schools, $49,578 in the large schools, $70,133 in the smaller medium schools and $59,384 in the larger medium schools.

HEADLINE: The Economic Bubble Theory

 BODY:
The Dow's flight above the 9,000 mark and sudden 165-point retreat this week has triggered warnings of a "bubble economy" -- the ominous notion that markets have been swelled by speculative excess and the first pinprick in investor confidence will explode them. The repeated reference has been to Japan, whose stock and real estate markets soared to dizzying heights, only to crash and drag its economy down to a crawl for most of the 1990's.
But America today is nothing like Japan eight years ago. Japan's banks were awash with corporate stock and debt secured by bloated real estate prices. Inept regulatory, monetary and fiscal policies strangled its economy. The American economy today is nearly a mirror opposite. Its vital signs, with one possible exception, are healthy. Unemployment is at record-low levels. Inflation, properly measured, is near zero. Private debt and real estate markets are stable. Banks hold substantial reserves. None of this means that the economy cannot slip into recession. But a recession that might start now would reflect the ordinary ups and downs of a complex economy, and not the inevitable implosion following speculative excess. 
 The one possible exception to the ceaselessly good economic news is steadily rising stock prices. A 9,000-point Dow may or may not prove sustainable, and the Dow may or may not fall 20, 200 or 2,000 more points. A 2,000-point drop could prove traumatic for investors and cause many to cut back purchases. But even a drop this large would bring stock prices down to levels that were deemed high as recently as a year ago. When stocks plummeted by the equivalent amount in 1987, the Fed kept the economy growing.
Cassandras point to tight labor markets as another trouble spot for the economy. But Mickey Levy, the chief economist at Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities, points out that low unemployment no longer poses a serious inflation threat. Even if wage rates start rising, the Fed's tight lid on monetary policy can prevent businesses from passing them along in higher prices.
Pollsters point out that employers are fearful that if they raise prices they will lose sales. Workers are fearful that if they ask for higher wages they will lose work. The only fearless ones appear to be the economists, who, try as they might, cannot seem to find a bubble worth worrying about.

HEADLINE: Whitman Calls Giuliani's Warnings on Yankees a Ploy

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey accused Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday of trying to demonize her state as a ploy to build support for his plan to put hundreds of millions of dollars in city money into a new stadium for the New York Yankees.
Mrs. Whitman was responding to comments that the Mayor made a day earlier, suggesting that New Jersey was trying to lure the Yankees across the Hudson River and pledging that he would do the same to New Jersey's professional sports teams. 
 Governor Whitman said at a news conference in Trenton, however, that her state was not negotiating with the Yankees and that she expected the team to remain in the Bronx. She said the Mayor was trying to create a distraction with what she called "Mayor Giuliani's 'Wag the Dog' strategy.' "
"You get a virtual reality war going and nobody watches what's really happening," she said. "It's: 'I've got my own battles here, but I don't want anybody to see it. Let's make New Jersey the enemy.' We're not the enemy. We're not doing anything."
She went on: "The problem he has is with New York. It's with the Bronx."
The Mayor has repeatedly said that he wants to keep the Yankees in the Bronx, yet at the same time he has been aggressively promoting the notion that the financial promise of a new stadium on the West Side of Manhattan might be the only way to keep the Yankees in New York.
By painting New Jersey as the enemy, Mrs. Whitman suggested, Mr. Giuliani is trying to create a controversy to shore up support for his West Side plan.
Even though Mrs. Whitman denied courting the Yankees, Mr. Giuliani issued a statement later in the afternoon saying he had forced her to back down. "It's obvious that our strategy worked," he said. "It seems that the prospect of New Jersey losing professional sports teams has made Governor Whitman back off. She just made our job a lot easier."
The sharp exchanges were unusual for the Mayor and the Governor, both centrist Republicans who have had mostly friendly relations. The most notable exception was Mr. Giuliani's repeated suggestion that spending by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey consistently favored New Jersey.
Howard J. Rubenstein, the spokesman for George M. Steinbrenner 3d, principal owner of the Yankees, said Mrs. Whitman and Mr. Steinbrenner had not discussed a move to New Jersey. But he said Mr. Steinbrenner had not decided among his choices of remaining in the Bronx or moving to Manhattan or New Jersey. "Steinbrenner is considering all three," Mr. Rubenstein said.
Mrs. Whitman acknowledged that her state's Commissioner of Commerce and Economic Development, Gualberto Medina, had left a message with Mr. Steinbrenner's secretary saying, "We're here."
"That's not negotiations," Mrs. Whitman said. "There is nobody in state government who is negotiating with the Yankees. I seriously don't want to see us get in the position of just making it more difficult for New York to keep a team that I think is going to stay there in the Bronx because that's where they've always been." Mrs. Whitman also said she would not rebuff an overture from the Yankees, but insisted that there were "no special deals being cut."
She added: "If there's a private-sector entity or person out there somewhere, I don't control them. Neither does Rudy Giuliani."
But this week, Mr. Giuliani seemed to ignite interstate dispute.
"We would like to acquire some additional sports teams," he said after reading a story to a third-grade class in lower Manhattan. "If they're in New Jersey, they're in New Jersey." And he noted that his proposal for financing new stadiums for the Yankees and the Mets also included money for a soccer field and possibly a football stadium. "Those things are not by any means, as somebody said, pipe dreams," he continued. "Those are realities. We've had meetings about it already."
Mrs. Whitman responded only by saying New Jersey wants to keep its teams. "I think what he ought to do is concentrate on his side of the river and keeping his teams in New York," she said. "We're not trying to take them away. If they want to leave, I can't stop that. But that's not anything that we're involved with."
Also yesterday, the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, released details of his drive to put a referendum on the Nov. 3 ballot that would allow voters to signal their preference between a stadium in the Bronx or Manhattan.
"I cannot see one man -- the Mayor, whoever he is -- imposing his will on the rest of this city," Mr. Vallone, a Democrat from Queens, said in an interview.
Aides to Mr. Vallone said that by July, the City Council plans to vote to amend the City Charter to prevent the Mayor from spending city funds for the purpose of building a Yankees stadium outside the Bronx. If the Council was able to override an expected veto by the Mayor, the issue would go to voters.
Earlier this week, Mr. Giuliani blamed Mr. Vallone and opponents of a West Side stadium for encouraging the Yankees to put out cross-border feelers. "I think if they end up in New Jersey, we'll be able to figure out why," the Mayor said. "I think we'll be able to prevent it, but we haven't gotten a lot of help from a lot of the politicians in this city."
Mr. Giuliani went on to say a referendum would be especially destructive. "If you put a team in a corner, they leave," he said.
The Mayor also signaled that he might lose the argument in the voting booth. "There are certain things that will just be voted against, and maybe momentary feelings have you voting against it," he said. "But then later on, it's in the best interests of the city or the state to move in that direction."

HEADLINE: THE NATO DEBATE;
Words of Warning in the NATO Battle: Senators Tilt at Europe's Future

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Senate debate today and on Monday on a measure to expand NATO to include Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, as provided by The Congressional Record and Senators' offices. The passages on today's debate focus on a proposed amendment, which was defeated, to limit United States spending to expand NATO.
 
FROM TUESDAY'S DEBATE
TOM HARKIN Democrat of Iowa: If this amendment had been in effect 40 years ago, we couldn't have been in Greece. But that was during the cold war. That is when we were facing the Soviet Union. That is when we were facing, if I might say to the Senator from Delaware, facing a Europe that was on its knees, busted, broke, basically decapitated from World War II. There is no way that they could have done it on their own. 
 That is why I say with this whole NATO argument, that it just seems to me we are arguing about a world that existed 50 years ago. The Senator from Delaware in his impassioned pleas is arguing for a situation that no longer exists.
Europe is powerful. Europe is wealthy, and the nations' GNP's are going up. There is no Soviet Union. There is no external threat like Greece was facing. Europe has been rebuilt. The cold war is over. Let's look ahead.
What I am saying is that I don't believe, in the context of a Europe that we see now and in the foreseeable future, that our taxpayers ought to be liable for the national costs any more in excess of what they are liable right now for the common costs.
That is what this amendment says. Very simply, it says very forthrightly, "Any future United States subsidy of the national expenses of Poland, Hungary or the Czech Republic to meet its NATO commitments, including the assistance described in subparagraph (c), may not exceed 25 percent of all assistance provided to that country by all NATO members."
When it comes to tanks, planes or anything else, of course, we can still sell them. They can still buy from us. But our subsidy to this national effort cannot be more than 25 percent of the total amount of all the countries for that national effort. . . .
JOSEPH R. BIDEN Jr. Democrat of Delaware: The Senator from Iowa forthrightly responded, as he always does, that if we wanted to sell Poland, like we sell Greece or Germany or anyone else, a piece of American-made military equipment, as long as we did not subsidize more than 25 percent of what that was, then we could sell it.
I wonder why in God's sake would the French Government agree to come up with money for Poland to allow them to buy an American jet instead of a French jet? Why would they possibly do that? And does this not give a veto, a veto on the part of other NATO nations, over American foreign military sales? Because unless they come up with 75 percent of what any subsidy would be, why would they possibly do that?
Is it not true -- the Senator is on the Armed Services Committee -- is it not true that one of the core debates in NATO beyond burden-sharing has been who gets to sell NATO the equipment, whether they fly Mirages, whether NATO planes are Mirages or whether they are American-made aircraft?
Every other European country in NATO has been saying, "You Americans get too much of an advantage." Every time we talk about burden-sharing, don't they come back and say, "Yes, but you don't get it; you get to make all that money and get all those jobs because you are supplying the equipment that all the NATO uses."
So why in the Lord's name would we give a veto power over the ability of American manufacturers and American employees to keep their jobs to the French and the Germans and the Brits? . . .
GORDON H. SMITH Republican of Oregon: Mr. President, with all due respect to my friend from Iowa, I believe the Harkin amendment attempts to strangle NATO expansion because it cannot prevent this expansion from occurring. This amendment places unreasonable restrictions on expenditures by limiting our assistance to new NATO members to 25 percent of all assistance provided to these countries by current NATO members. . . .
Let me be clear on this point. In signing the protocols of accession with these three countries, the United States has not signed up to foot the bill for their membership in NATO, and Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic understand that it is ultimately their responsibility to make the necessary improvements to their military structures. . . .
I also confess concern about the signal that would be sent if the Senate adopted the Harkin amendment.
Does approval of this amendment mean that the United States would only lead NATO 25 percent of the time, no matter what our security interests may be? Does it mean that the United States is interested in 25 percent of NATO's activities, exercises and planning processes? Does it mean that the United States should participate in only 25 percent of any potential NATO operations despite any potential threat posed to the alliance? . . .
BARBARA A. MIKULSKI Democrat of Maryland: I would like to discuss the benefits of enlargement and weigh them against the costs. The strategic benefits of enlargement are most important. NATO enlargement will create a zone of peace and stability that includes Eastern Europe. It will extend NATO's stabilizing influence to more of Europe and reduce the chances of aggression or conflict in Eastern Europe.
There are also economic benefits. Europe is America's largest trading partner, with $250 billion in two-way trade each year. Our new NATO partners will increase trading opportunities. They are building vibrant, free-market economies. NATO brings stability, and stability brings prosperity. We are creating a prosperity zone across Europe.
In addition, there are benefits for democracy. For example, the young military officers of new NATO members are learning from us what it means to be part of democratic military. It means civilian control of the military. It means a code of conduct. They are also learning English. When they leave the military, they will bring these skills. The training they get from NATO will be a permanent, stabilizing force in their societies.
It is clear that these benefits of NATO enlargement far outweigh the costs. . . .
CHUCK HAGEL Republican of Nebraska: Aside from the obvious defense purpose of the expansion of NATO, there are other issues involved. The obvious defense purpose of expanding NATO is to help assure stability and security in Europe, all of Europe, Mr. President. And there has been some debate on this floor about this issue, this fourth expansion, and, by the way, an unprecedented expansion. We have expanded NATO three other times to include West Germany, Greece, Turkey and the third expansion, to Spain and Portugal. This would be not an unprecedented action we would take to include three new countries. But I find interesting the fact that there has been some reference made to, we would split Europe. And I say, Mr. President, just the opposite, just the opposite. We would in fact do much to unify Europe. And why would that be?
Well, that would be, cause stability, security, economic development, development of democracy, market economies would extend across the continent of Europe, across the continent of Europe. And no longer would there be the Iron Curtain that fell at the end of World War II. NATO expansion would help assure that.
I also find the argument interesting from the perspective of -- I thought when the Berlin wall fell in 1989 that meant something. It was beyond symbolism. It was a witness to history that authoritarian, totalitarian government does not work under any name -- Nazism, Communism -- it doesn't work.
Here we are almost 10 years after the fall of Communism and the Berlin wall talking about -- I don't know -- should we do this? We might offend our Russian friends. Certainly any important decision must factor in every dynamic of debate and every dynamic of national security interests, relationships, future relationships and, in this case, certainly does factor in our relationship with Russia. But, my goodness, why did we fight for 40 years a cold war, and we won it.
Only 10 years later, to some extent to be held hostage to what the Russians want. You see, I don't see an awful lot of sense in that. Yes, it's important to understand the Russians. Yes, it's important to engage the Russians. But not allow Russia or any other nation to dominate the final analysis and decisions of our national security interest nor all of the collective security interests of Europe.
 
FROM MONDAY'S DEBATE
SENATOR ROBERT C. SMITH Republican of New Hampshire: With or without NATO, the United States can come to the defense of any European nation next week, tomorrow, next year or five years from now. Should Europe ever be threatened by Russia, or by anybody else, we can expand NATO. We can do it quickly.
But there is a lot to lose and very little to gain by expanding NATO now. We basically say to Russia: "Don't worry about it. Don't worry about NATO expansion. It is O.K. It is a defensive alliance."
But it does not matter what we say. It matters what the Russians think. They have stated clearly and officially they oppose expansion. It has been said by others on the floor, and I agree that we should not set our foreign policy based on what the Russians say, I will be the first to admit that, but we ought to realize there is a lot going on inside Russia and there is no threat to these nations from Russia.
So tell me what the threat is. Tell me what the urgency is. There is no urgency. There is no threat. It is an emotional feel-good thing to do. They earned it. They are free. Let us put them under the umbrella of NATO and protect them. From what? We are still going to go to their defense if anything threatens them. Every person in the Senate knows it. The most important requirement for the Poles, the Czechs and the Hungarians as far as their security is concerned is that America and Russia remain friends. That is the protection these nations need, that Russia and America become friends and remain friends. . . .
JOHN W. WARNER Republican of Virginia: Mr. President, will the Senator allow me to observe that the American taxpayers, since 1992, have contributed $2.6 billion in the spirit of that friendship to help Russia dismantle its weapons systems? And here this comes along and takes a red-hot poker and jams it right in their ribs. . . .
MR. SMITH It sure does. The Senator knows that. He knows the Senator has worked on this issue tirelessly in the Armed Forces Committee and has visited Russia to see this.
I don't think anybody could deny that in the very near future, Russia is going to be one of the, if not the strongest nations in that region of the world. The question is, whose side is it going to be on? Is it going to be on the Iranians' side? Is it going to be an alliance with the Chinese Communists? Or is it going to be on our side? If it is on our side, why will the Poles care or the Czechs or the Hungarians or anybody else? The point is they wouldn't.
What we ought to be doing again is keeping the window open, using the advantages that we have to draw that out, to draw them this way. Senator Warner has mentioned how they have reached out to do that. We are taking down tremendous numbers of weapons that have been aimed at the United States for decades.
But extending an alliance, which during the cold war the Soviet Union considered hostile, the countries that she doesn't threaten is basically kicking this former giant, like the Senator from Virginia said, poking them in the ribs. . . . That is exactly what we are doing, God knows. I have stood on this floor many times and in the House Chamber before that and extolled the virtues of the United States against the cold war, the Soviet Union, and voted trillions to defeat it.
But let's not walk away from the victory. Let's not walk away from the victory. History shows that it is unwise to treat nations like that, and it is highly dangerous for countries in the middle, because these are the countries that are going to suffer if there is a confrontation that takes place between the United States and Russia again. It is the nations in the middle in Eastern Europe that are going to get the squeeze. That is where it is going to be fought. Those are the people who are going to suffer. . . .

HEADLINE: Reputed Crime Family Head Indicted in Extortion Case

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN WEISER 

 BODY:
In a case that shows the persistence of the Mafia in New York's garment industry, Federal prosecutors announced the indictments of the reputed acting boss of the Lucchese organized crime family and 11 others yesterday in a broad scheme to extort millions of dollars from garment center businesses for the last decade.
Mary Jo White, the United States Attorney in Manhattan, said the Lucchese crime family had "exercised dominant extortionate control over legitimate businesses in the garment center." 
 Six years ago, city prosecutors in Manhattan said they had ended a Mafia-controlled trucking cartel in the garment industry in which the Gambino crime family used threats of violence to force manufacturers to use trucking companies they owned or controlled, in a scheme that added about 7 percent to the price of finished garments.
Reputed senior members of the Gambino and Genovese crime families were also among those charged in the cases announced yesterday. Lewis D. Schiliro, assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and head of its office in New York, said that with the new charges, "we have made great progress stripping the garment center from the mob's portfolio of assets."
The two racketeering and extortion indictments filed by Federal prosecutors charged the reputed acting Lucchese crime boss, Joseph A. DeFede, 64, of Howard Beach, with directing the garment district schemes. At least $30,000 to $40,000 a month, or a total of about $2.5 million, was extorted from garment makers as well as sewing, cutting and dye plants, prosecutors said.
"The means used were allegedly the classic means of organized crime, threats of physical and economic harm," Ms. White said. In return, the businesses were allowed "to do business in the garment center," were given protection and labor peace and, if they were not unionized, were allowed to remain so.
Howard Safir, the New York City Police Commissioner, said the influence of organized crime caused "a significant number" of garment center businesses to leave the city.
"It is estimated that this pervasive pattern of extortion has added hundreds of thousands of dollars each year to the cost of doing business in the garment industry in New York City," he said.
Mr. DeFede was ordered held without bond yesterday pending a hearing on Friday by a magistrate judge in Federal District Court in Manhattan. He said almost nothing in court, except to acknowledge that he understood his rights.
After court, his lawyer, Martin Geduldig, said that his client was innocent, but Mr. Geduldig would say little else about him, except that he worked for a New Jersey company.
The Government also charged that a lawyer in New York helped collect the extortion payments for the Lucchese family. In court, a Federal prosecutor said that the Government had secretly videotaped the lawyer, Irwin Schlacter, 73, of Yonkers, as he met with Lucchese family members in his Manhattan office, counted cash and threatened one trucker.
In explaining to a magistrate why the Government was seeking a $1 million bond for Mr. Schlacter, the prosecutor, Joseph F. Bianco, said Mr. Schlacter had told the trucker that he "would end up" like one Lucchese family member who was killed after he was accused of stealing garment center money.
The magistrate, Andrew J. Peck, eventually set bond at $750,000 after Mr. Schlacter's lawyer, Michael Rosen, said his client was a leading lawyer who had practiced in New York for 44 years and was therefore not a risk. "He's not guilty," Mr. Rosen said.
 Officials said that the Federal investigation of the Mafia's role in the garment district was continuing.
In an unrelated case in Newark, Faith S. Hochberg, the United States Attorney for New Jersey, announced the indictment of Joseph Gatto, a reputed captain in the Genovese crime family, and 13 other people in a loan-sharking and gambling case.
After a bail hearing, Mr. Gatto's lawyer, William J. DeMarco, said: "My client is innocent. He truly is."

HEADLINE: Topless, and Dancing on the Edge;
City's 'Quality of Life' Campaign Takes On a Strip-Club Tradition

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
The doorbell to his cramped office kept buzzing, pulling Milton Anthony away from the vital business at hand. First came the delivery boy, bearing a spaghetti dinner destined to congeal uneaten. Then came Pia, then Eve, then Tiffany, all wanting to know where they would be publicly removing their clothes in the coming week.
Is it the Mermaid on Tuesday day and Billy's Topless on Friday night, or Billy's on Monday night and the Pussycat on Thursday day? Simple questions of scheduling, perhaps, but Milton Anthony needed to concentrate. His livelihood was under siege. "Tiffany, sweetheart," he said to the woman at the door, his ancient face veiled in cigarette smoke. 
 "We're in the middle of a conference."
"But I was told to come between 3 and 6," Tiffany said. Mr. Anthony turned and searched for the time. There, on a wall cluttered with framed photographs of former clients -- Leslie Tulips, Bambi Vawn, Cleopatra -- was a clock saying 5 o'clock. "So," he said, shrugging hunched shoulders buried in a gray sweater. "Come back in an hour."
The clock is ticking for Mr. Anthony and the entire adult-entertainment industry of New York City. He owns the A P Variety Talent Agency, which specializes in "topless go-go dancers" ("serving the industry since 1966," his business card says). He also owns Billy's Topless, a corner bar in Manhattan's Chelsea section where women have been dancing, without tops or neighborhood opposition, since the mid-1970's.
Unfortunately for Mr. Anthony, the appeal of strip-club tradition is lost upon Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Today, lawyers for the adult-entertainment industry are scheduled to appear before a three-judge panel of the Federal appeals court in Manhattan to argue against one of the Mayor's most ambitious initiatives: a zoning law that would prohibit strip clubs and other sex-oriented businesses from operating within 500 feet of residences, schools, day-care centers and places of worship. The administration says the law is an integral element of its effort to improve the quality of life in the city's neighborhoods; the industry says the law violates the constitutional right of free speech.
So far, though, the law has withstood several court tests, and the administration already has in place a plan to unleash squadrons of inspectors, all trained to find violations that would force most sex businesses to shut down. If the city prevails again, the industry would likely place itself at the mercy of the United States Supreme Court.
In the debate over the city's plan, most of the attention has focused on the adult-video and book stores peppered around Times Square, and on expensive establishments that hold themselves out as "gentlemen's clubs." Lost in the commotion are the small neighborhood bars that serve chasers of temptation with their beer. And among those smaller businesses, Mr. Anthony is the grandfatherly anachronism, a 78-year-old curmudgeon who sticks to principles -- such as they are: no breast enhancements, no lap or table dancing, no touching the dancers.
But a victory for the city would deliver a one-two punch to Mr. Anthony. Not only would it limit the number of venues for his dancers, but Billy's would have to shut down, move or put tops on its "topless" dancers. That is because the bar, on the corner of 24th Street and the Avenue of the Americas, is within 500 feet of a few apartment buildings.
Contemplating these options, Mr. Anthony reached for the handwritten notes on C-6-2, C-6-4X and other zoning designations that he keeps in his shirt pocket. He then took out a marked-up copy of a neighborhood map and ran a finger up the avenue. "I imagine we are at risk," he said finally. "I'm not kidding myself."
But Mr. Anthony says he plans to endure. Rather than close down or move away -- which city officials acknowledge is the intention of the law -- he will adjust by having the dancers wear bikinis that comply with the law. "But I don't know how much business we'll lose," he said.
For more than two decades, Billy's Topless has operated out of a four-story building with an appropriate history; it once served as a Gay 90's beer hall for a risque vaudeville house on 23d Street. The years have worn away whatever gaiety the drab building once conveyed. It is adjacent to a hardware store and faces a huge advertisement, several stories high, for a Masonic Hall: "God. Family. Country. Fraternity. Philanthropy. Community Service."
Such concepts are generally left at the door of Billy's. On Monday night, beneath billows of blue smoke, three topless women moved to the medium-paced tempo of a Fleetwood Mac song. No one sat in the 24 chairs arranged around the small stage; the dozen customers sat at the bar, some watching the dancing, others watching a basketball game on television. Now and then a customer would stand up, walk over, and hand a dancer a dollar bill. The night's free buffet, lasagna, sat in a tin above a Sterno can, untouched.
Several employees and two of the dancers described Billy's as more of a neighborhood bar than a strip club, a place where a Mets team photograph seems perfectly at home on the wall. The glitzy clubs in midtown charge exorbitant admission fees and make dancers pay for their stage time; in that environment, breast enhancements are de rigueur.
But his employees say that Mr. Anthony has resisted these trends -- at Billy's, a bottle of beer costs $4 -- and has taken pains to be a good neighbor.
Edward Kirkland, the chairman of the Chelsea preservation and planning committee for Community Board 4, agreed. "It's been there a long time, and, quite frankly, the board has never had any complaints about Billy's or its customers," he said. "It causes no problems, so why do anything about it?"
A dancer named Tara Rodriguez stepped down from the stage to defend Billy's, taking care to wrap herself in a towel. "You know why I work here?" she asked. "I'm married with two kids. There's no touching, there's no hustling, there's no champagne room. It's straight."
But she said she had no illusions about the economic impact that a strip of fabric across her chest will have. "If they see a girl in a bathing suit, they'll think that they could see the same thing at the beach," she said. "And they won't want to hand you money."
Another dancer, whose stage name is Amber, said that she thought the extra clothing would prove to be more challenging, and more erotic. Besides, she said, after a pensive drag on a cigarette, the nakedness is almost beside the point at Billy's. "People come in here for companionship. A lot of the regulars say that they don't even care that we get naked. And Milton? He's like a dad."
Whether Mr. Anthony is a father figure or an exploitative businessman is fodder for debate. One thing is certain: he is among the unlikeliest purveyors of pulchritude.
For most of his life he worked in the garment industry, specializing in costumes for entertainers. But he keeps few remnants of those days in his museum of an office in the Flatiron Building. Not far from the provocative publicity stills of Ginger Gale and Sunshine Day is an autographed photograph of the rubber-faced comedian Bert Lahr in a spaceman outfit ("I made the tights," Mr. Anthony explained). And whenever Mr. Anthony reaches for a new pack of Carlton 100's, he snips the top off with an oversized pair of scissors intended for cutting through bolts of fabric.
In the late 1960's he made a two-piece costume for a go-go dancer, the design of which impressed her agent, a man known as Mambo-Hy. His real name was Hyman Balick, and his birthplace was unexotic Baltimore, but Mambo-Hy's tales of profit seduced Mr. Anthony. Soon they were partners, booking 200 dancers in bars and clubs throughout the city.
He said he remembers almost all of his former clients, including many of those captured in the black-and-white photos on his walls. Some ended up well; others did not. Angelique, who billed herself as the "Femme Fatale," lives in the state of Washington with her mother. But Suzy, who posed with a rose for her photo, suffered severe burns in an accident. "Last I heard she was driving a cab in Staten Island," he said.
Mr. Anthony acknowledged that his mid-career detour unnerved his wife. But after visiting a few clubs and seeing the dancers treat her husband like a surrogate father, he said, Sylvia Anthony accepted the change. Hanging prominently in his office is a portrait of his wife of 52 years; it is four times the size of any publicity still.
Mambo-Hy died, and so did Mr. Anthony's friend Bill Pell, the owner of Billy's. By 1979, the garment worker had inherited both a talent agency and a topless bar.
The industry gradually changed, and strip-club behemoths, like Scores on the East Side, began drawing away his customers. But Mr. Anthony stuck to the old ways. The clubs and bars that he does business with still pay him $5 for every shift that one of his dancers works; the dancers get $50 plus tips.
Using the inventory skills of his previous profession, Mr. Anthony pencils in the names of his clients on a weekly chart that tracks their hours and venues. He also has a file for every woman who has worked for him in the last three decades. The active files that he keeps by his desk carry handwritten notes about work habits and payment; "has green card," reads one. The inactive files stacked in the corner have brief explanations: "Quit dancing." "Do not hire." "Went to Brazil."
But such meticulous paperwork did not prepare Mr. Anthony for a sudden change in zoning.
"I can understand what Giuliani did on 42d Street," he said. "He cleaned up a real lousy area, and he's brought in a hell of a lot of business. But that doesn't mean the whole city has to be shut down. We've been here 28 years -- no trouble."
The clock struck 6. Mr. Anthony set aside questions of the future to contend with the needs of today. The doorbell buzzed, and a woman he had never seen before entered the office. She said her name was Savannah.
"So," he said, reaching for a pencil. "You've danced before?"

HEADLINE: Clinton Raises $1 Million For Democratic Hopefuls

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
President Clinton came to New York last night to raise $1 million for Democratic Senate campaigns across the nation this year, attending a high-priced fund-raiser that saw all three New York Senate candidates gather in the same candle-lit Upper East Side mansion.
The dinner, which cost $10,000 a head, was the only event that Mr. Clinton attended during a quick trip up to New York. 
 About 100 people joined Mr. Clinton at the dinner, at the home of one of the Democratic Party's most active fund-raisers.
The dinner was spread across three rooms in the private mansion, just off Fifth Avenue on 96th Street, and in a effort to guard against the appearance of favoritism, Mr. Clinton ate in a room on the second floor, while the Senate candidates ate downstairs.
In his remarks after the dinner, Mr. Clinton paid quick tribute to the three candidates for their "fidelity to their party," but took pains not to say anything that might be interpreted as suggesting support for one of them. Instead, President Clinton offered a generic argument that Democrats in Congress would assure a continuation of programs he has pushed, and that the money raised last night would at least assure that the Democrats hold on to their 45 seats in the Senate.
"They are making every effort to play it down the middle," said one of the three New York Democrats seeking the nomination, Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn, who ate in the same room (but not at the same table) with one of his rivals, Mark Green, the New York public advocate. The third candidate, Geraldine A. Ferraro, ate in another room across the hall.
Early in the evening, the three Senate candidates circulated among the wealthy crowd, each giving differing accounts of their political strengths -- "Like Rashomon," Mr. Green reported mid-course.
After dinner, guests were crowded into an upstairs drawing room, where Mr. Clinton, speaking in hushed tones and appearing fatigued, spent 10 minutes thanking a crowd so diverse that Ms. Ferraro found herself standing directly behind Donald J. Trump and Martha Stewart a few steps away from Mr. Schumer.
Mr. Clinton made joking, if admiring remarks, about New York as a singular source of his political, and financial, support.
Mr. Clinton said that he had calculated that 25 percent of his plurality in the 1996 Presidential election came out of New York -- and then made reference to one of the side effects of his visits, as evidenced last night by the intersections closed off across the Upper East Side.
"I was just leaning back against the wall thinking about how I might have done if I hadn't blocked traffic for four years," Mr. Clinton said with a chuckle.
With his arrival in New York last night, Mr. Clinton got a glimpse at what Democrats believe will be one of the most contested elections of 1998, given Mr. D'Amato's perceived vulnerability. There are 34 Senate seats up for grabs in 1998, and Democrats are focusing on 15 of them, and on none more than that of Senator D'Amato.
Mr. Clinton makes a practice of staying out of political primaries. Earlier this year, the White House chastised Mr. Schumer for broadcasting a television advertisement that showed Mr. Schumer leaving Air Force One with Mr. Clinton, saying it suggested that Mr. Clinton was supporting the Brooklyn Congressman.
Mr. Clinton's trip was also significant because it marked the first time he had come to New York to raise money since the chairwoman of the State Democratic Party, Judith Hope, had publicly complained in January that Mr. Clinton and national Democrats were siphoning money out of New York with their repeated visits to the state. Ms. Hope said they were taking money away that might otherwise go to New York Democrats seeking to unseat Mr. D'Amato or Gov. George E. Pataki.
Based on those complaints, the national Democratic Party agreed that state parties would get 7.5 percent of the net proceeds from fund-raisers in their states, including, White House officials said, the one last night.
Ms. Hope said she had been privately assured that the figure would be "substantially higher." But Michael Tucker, the communications director of the Democratic Campaign Committee, which collected the checks from last night's event, said, "I think all those decisions will be made later."
The fund-raiser was at the home of J. Shelby Bryan, a communications executive and one of the party's biggest donors. It was so exclusive that the Senate candidates were not permitted to bring their spouses or aides.
As is customary with these events, the dinner was closed except for the portion when Mr. Clinton spoke and a small group of reporters were escorted inside. Mr. Clinton offered up what was for him standard fare for these fund-raisers, warning against Americans being led into complacency because of good economic times. "Good times can be very deceptive," Mr. Clinton said.
"This country has some big, long-term problems," he said, referring to the deficits in Social Security and Medicare. "When things are good, you should bear down on these problems."

Cendant to Leave Stamford

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
The Cendant Corporation, one of the nation's largest franchisers and direct marketers, plans to move its headquarters and 500 jobs from Stamford to Wilton, Conn.
The company will consolidate its four Stamford centers into a 320,000-square-foot complex in Wilton. 
 The move comes nearly a year after the Stamford Planning and Zoning board rejected a zoning change that would have allowed Cendant to build a larger complex on a 28-acre site near a residential area.
City officials said the expansion would have contributed to an already bad traffic situation.
"Obviously they are one of our bigger employers with about 500 to 600 jobs," said Thomas Hamilton, Stamford's chief financial officer, "and it's never good economic news to have employers leave the city."
Chris Jones, a spokesman for Cendant, said Wilton was chosen "because we wanted to be in an area convenient to all of our employees who make Fairfield County their home."
"We can have a beautiful campus and be close for those employees," he said.
Among the well-known brands of Cendant, which also has offices in Parsippany, N.J., are Days Inn, Howard Johnson and Ramada hotels, Century 21, Coldwell Banker and ERA real estate and Avis car rentals.

HEADLINE: Art Sales: Dazzling Brochures, Dim Hopes

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
With the first major fine art auctions of the year scheduled to begin next week at Christie's and Sotheby's in Manhattan, it's not the art people are talking about, but the catalogues. They are being criticized as overdesigned, gimmicky and hard to read; some even have poor color reproductions.
In what promises to be one of the dullest spring seasons in years, it seems that both auction houses are trying to disguise their slim offerings. The brochures, with their glut of gate-fold photographs and fancy typefaces, are "an attempt to make lesser things look more important and more like museum catalogues," said Susan Seidel, a private Manhattan dealer. "But they're totally unreadable." 
 Why, after a record-breaking autumn bolstered by two estate sales -- the modern and contemporary art belonging to the New York collectors Victor and Sally Ganz at Christie's and the Impressionist and modern works from the collection of Evelyn Sharp, the hotelier and philanthropist, at Sotheby's -- have things fallen flat? "The market is nearly always fueled by major estates," said Christopher Burge, chairman of Christie's in America. "But this season, they've been in short supply."
Without the great estates as bait, experts say, collectors are simply not ready to part with their art. "There's an awful lot of money in the world today," said Mr. Burge. "But many collectors are not keen to sell, either because they don't have to, or because they don't think we've hit the top of the market yet."
The biggest problem today, said Franck Giraud, who runs Christie's 19th- and 20th-century sales in New York, is one of supply and demand. "The collectors are out there, but great material is scarce," he said. Still, both auction houses have managed to cobble together sales, each with a few star works, with a total value of more than $350 million.
But to make matters more confusing, Christie's has reclassified its sales and Sotheby's has not. Traditionally, both houses have sold works made before the 1860's in their 19th-century sales. But the most valuable Impressionist paintings, drawings and sculptures, though created in the 19th century, were always grouped with 20th-century works made before 1945 in the sales of important Impressionist and modern art. That meant sales of contemporary art were dominated by American artists since 1945.
But starting next week, the year 1900 will be Christie's dividing line; officials there say it best reflects current buying patterns. On Tuesday night, Christie's will hold an important Impressionist and 19th-century sale featuring works by artists who came to prominence before 1900. Thus the auction will include names like Daumier and Boldini along with Monet and van Gogh. (This will be the only sale of the week scheduled for the evening, when the most important art is sold, upsetting the schedules of the many foreign collectors and dealers who traditionally come to New York to attend both Sotheby's and Christie's Impressionist sales, which were always one day apart. Now, Sotheby's sale is more than a week away from Christie's.)
Christie's 20th-century department will handle artists like Picasso and Matisse as well as Pollock and Rauschenberg, all of whose work reached maturity during the first 70 years of this century. A separate contemporary art department will sell work of artists who have flourished since 1970, and its sale is set for June 3.
Sotheby's, however, has kept to its traditional lineup, with an evening sale of Impressionist and modern art on May 13. Its sale of contemporary art, which encompasses works made since 1945, is on May 14, the same night as the much-publicized final episode of "Seinfeld," something many art experts are already grumbling about.
Much of the Impressionist material in both Sotheby's and Christie's sales comes from Japanese owners. Many of the works were bought by businessmen during the late 1980's boom, at overheated prices, and have been sitting in storage since the market took a nose dive in the early 90's.
The sellers today are mainly creditors. In Sotheby's sale, the most expensive work is Monet's "Grand Canal," a 1908 scene of Venice that is estimated to sell for $8 million to $10 million. The painting is being sold by the Fuji Gallery in Japan; and like many expensive works at both auction houses, it carries a guarantee (an undisclosed sum, generally close to the low estimate, promised to the seller regardless of the sale's outcome). Christie's will offer a fleshy Renoir nude, estimated to bring $3 million to $4 million, that is also from a Japanese consignor.
There are also more works from Europeans this season, art that in the past would have been sold in London. Most European sellers believe New York is where the big money is. Moreover, the high import taxes imposed on paintings that are brought into European Union countries like Britain, along with the flagging economies of countries like France and Italy, have made New York a more desirable place to sell artworks.
Take the star of Christie's 19th-century sale, a van Gogh pen-and-ink drawing, "Boats on the Beach at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer," from 1888. The drawing is being sold by a member of the Peter Nathan family, collectors and dealers who live in Switzerland, and is estimated to bring $5 million to $7 million. Christie's 20th-century sale features a brightly colored Fauve-period Braque, "Olive Tree Near L'Estaque," from 1906, which came from a French collector's home. It is estimated to bring $3.5 million to $4.5 million.
Sotheby's was able to snag one interesting collection, 10 paintings belonging to Rolf and Margit Weinberg, collectors from Zurich. Mr. Weinberg, who owns a clothing store, is retiring and wants to put some cash away for the future. Among the highlights of the $10 million collection is Courbet's "Portrait of Jo, the Beautiful Irishwoman." Painted in 1866, it shows the red-haired Joanna Heffernan, who was Whistler's mistress at the time, looking in a mirror. It is estimated to sell for $2 million to $3 million.
Also from the Weinbergs is a rare Picasso, "Casagemas in His Coffin," a haunting 1901 painting from the artist's Blue Period. It depicts the artist's dead friend Carles Casagemas, who shot himself six months before Picasso painted the work. "Art historically, this is an important painting," said Alexander Apsis, who heads Sotheby's Impressionist and modern art department in New York.
Another star in Sotheby's sale is a Degas, "After the Bath," painted in 1896. It comes from the estate of Wendell Cherry, the founder of Humana, the Louisville-based health care company, who died in 1991 and whose widow has been slowly selling off his art. The painting carries an estimate of $6 million to $8 million. Degas has performed particularly well at auction in the last two years, especially late pictures like this. Christie's also has a late Degas, "Dancers in a Studio," from 1900-1905, which is expected to bring $5 million to $7 million.
Today's taste also gravitates toward early Warhols. Sotheby's contemporary art sale has one of the best: "Orange Marilyn," a 1964 image of Marilyn Monroe based on a still from the movie "Niagara." One of the most important Pop works to come on the market in years, it boasts a provenance as pristine as the painting itself. It comes from the famous Stroher collection, a German trove of 20th-century art that was one of the first in Europe to include American Pop Art. Sotheby's has estimated it to sell for $4 million to $6 million, and experts there said they were hoping it would break the Warhol record of $4 million set when "Shot Red Marilyn" sold at Christie's in 1989.
Another possible record breaker in Sotheby's contemporary sale is Lucian Freud's "Large Interior W11 (After Watteau)," a 1981-83 painting inspired by Watteau's 1712 "Pierrot Content," which is in the Thyssen Collection in Madrid. It shows two of Freud's children and three friends in a rundown London interior. The painting should bring $2.5 million to $3.5 million and is being sold by James Kirkman, who was Freud's dealer from 1872 until 1992.
"These two paintings are world class," said Tobias Meyer, director of Sotheby's contemporary art worldwide. "Which is unusual for a market that just doesn't supply goods like these anymore."

Lover's Leap Mentality Hits Co-ops

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
IN Manhattan, fear and greed are fueling the white-hot real estate market. Deals are falling apart at record levels. Bidding wars occur every day. And even brokers and lawyers are starting to urge caution.
"There's a hysteria that's kind of crept into the real estate community," said Deborah Beck, executive director of the Real Estate Board of New York, a trade group that represents more than 1,000 Manhattan agents. "It's not good for brokers, and it's not good for buyers and sellers." 
 In this incendiary market, deals fall apart twice as often as they did five years ago. These are deals that fail before the contract is signed and way before the buyer gets near a co-op board interview.
According to a study released this week by the Halstead Property Company in Manhattan, broken deals below 14th Street have skyrocketed from 16 percent in the sluggish 1992 market to 32 percent today; uptown, they have gone from 10 percent to 24 percent. Agents blame sellers' reneging on an accepted offer to get more money elsewhere -- and equally buyers' cold feet, often the morning after.
Nick Brown, a Wall Street executive, promised himself he would buy his own apartment by the time he turned 30. Right after he bid $230,000 on a one-bedroom on West 79th Street in January, the Dow dropped 220 points, only to recover quickly. But he was scared. When his agent tried to get him to bid $5,000 more, he backed out. Now, he says, similar apartments are $275,000 -- and he has more or less given up looking.
There seems to be no relief in sight -- at least in Manhattan -- from the glassy condominiums of Battery Park City to the pre-World War II palazzos along Park Avenue and the landmarked brownstones of Harlem. The reasons given for the whopping price increases -- higher even than last year, a very good year -- are many. Playing a big part are Wall Street bonuses to stockbrokers, Dow Jones windfalls to the average investor and the health of the overall American economy.
But in interviews, buyers and sellers also credit the newly desirable reputation of New York City -- seedy is out, safety is in -- for bringing young and old here to experience what they perceive as the new glitter and glow. When they arrive, many find renting an apartment prohibitively expensive: even with rising co-op and condo prices, many still argue it's smarter (and cheaper) to buy than to rent.
Averaged together, sales prices below 96th Street for the first quarter of 1998 are up 20.7 percent over the same period last year, according to a survey to be released next week by the Corcoran Group. The market has risen 5 percent just since January, the company said, indicating that the steady upward trend continues. Other companies that are preparing their own market analyses report similar numbers.
Housing markets are strong throughout the region, brokers and statisticians alike say. "We do not have the Manhattan market madness," said Joseph E. Mottola, chief executive of the Long Island Board of Realtors. "But if you're thinking of taking your sweet time, it means you have no chance of buying a house."
In Brooklyn Heights, Christopher Thomas, who manages William B. May's Brooklyn offices, complained of broken deals and of pressures similar to Manhattan's. He said prices were rising so fast -- perhaps 15 percent over last year -- that he was worried about next year, "unless the stock market continues its epic climb," Mr. Thomas added.
In this accelerating market, significantly more deals in Manhattan are falling apart now than in the late 1980's, the last real estate boom, according to the Halstead company. While Halstead is the only one to have pinpointed the trend, other brokers do not question it.
"Deals fall apart because of cold feet and sticker shock," said Barbara Corcoran, owner of a Manhattan brokerage. "In the heat of passion, people promise anything."
Ms. Corcoran and Ms. Beck of the Real Estate Board attribute the splintering of deals partly to the inexperience of the bidders: many of today's buyers, they said, are first-timers and easily panicked. On the sellers' side, Ms. Corcoran and Ms. Beck blame greed, plain and simple.
Disappointed buyers are found at every level -- although few will talk publicly about their problems. According to Halstead's report, prices for properties that are traditionally the toughest sells -- studios -- rose 34 percent over the last year. Small two bedrooms, another tough sell in the nadir of the market, were up 30 percent. Town house sales, which many thought peaked last year, were up 17 percent.
Even successful bidders complain about spiraling prices and the resulting free-for-all. Gonzalo Pardo de Zela, 39, a lawyer, and his wife, Tatiana Pardo de Zela, 26, first-time buyers, had bid $551,000 in a sealed-bid auction for a two-bedroom downtown condominium with an asking price of $599,000. Then they were told they had lost out . Frantically, they considered bidding on a $750,000 apartment in the same building.
"We were ready to do it even though it was way more than we could afford," he said.
The Pardo de Zelas got lucky. The seller's first choice for the $599,000 apartment reneged -- typical in this market -- and they had another chance. But they also had to agree to $34,000 more than their first bid. The closing is scheduled for this week.
The number of crashing deals has spawned another phenomenon: the rise of the backup offer. Brokers say today they see backup offers in at least 50 percent of all deals.
"A year ago, I wouldn't advise an agent to show an apartment where there was an accepted offer," said Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Real Estate. "Now, the only time I tell them not to show the property is when there are both an accepted offer and at least two backup offers."
In all ranges of the market -- from $125,000 studios to $3 million penthouses -- many sellers, faced with a line of frenzied buyers, choose only those whose offer is not dependent on getting a mortgage. They want buyers who are willing to forfeit their deposit (should a mortgage not come through) to grab the apartment of their dreams.
Until this year, agents agree, the vast majority of bids were contingent on the buyer's getting financing. Neil Bader, chief executive of Skyscraper Mortgage, one of the city's largest mortgage brokers, said that among his upper-end clients, 75 percent now sign contracts without having guaranteed mortgage financing. (He estimated that 40 percent of midrange deals are signed without a mortgage fallback -- the percentage was close to zero only a few years ago.) Many of these bidders eventually obtain a mortgage, but they don't make their offer contingent on it.
Making a bid on an apartment therefore often feels more like being caught in a cross-fire than in a friendly back-and-forth debate over prices. One apartment, at 22 East 88th Street, had 12 bids at the asking price -- in four days.
"In times of rising markets the standards of morality in real estate matters decline," Stephen Raphael, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said sadly. "In a feeding frenzy, it's every man for himself."
Lawrence Sicular, chief statistician at Brown Harris Stevens, a Manhattan real estate organization, said that with the rising prices a lot of buyers are "balancing on the edge, taking a risk."
One couple fought the frenzy and took the risk. Neal and Jodi Elkin, who work at J. P. Morgan & Company, thought they had secured a two-bedroom apartment on 72d Street near West End Avenue for about $450,000.
The seller had even asked them to bring their chocolate Labrador retriever over to meet the neighbors and showed photographs of the dog to the board members, to make sure they didn't object. But "a week and a half later, we still didn't have the contract, and the ad was still in the paper," Ms. Elkin, 32, said.
The Elkins were nervous. Time was running out on their sublet. "Suddenly, he called and said he had an all-cash agreement from somebody else," Mr. Elkin said. (To this day, the Elkins don't believe in what they call the phantom bidders from Los Angeles, who had suposedly not even seen the apartment.)
Mr. Elkin, 33, said he felt violated. "I mean, we had a verbal agreement," he said. "We'd even shaken hands."
Despite their doubts, the Elkins raised their bid by $15,000 and made it noncontingent on getting a mortgage. This time, they went to contract in 24 hours.
So what are buyers and sellers to do in today's overheated market? Mr. Raphael tells buyers to calm down and to prepare a detailed financial statement in advance -- with a hard and fast bidding limit. No agreement is ironclad, he warns, until it is signed by both sides.
Clark P. Halstead, managing partner of Halstead, cautioned that buyers should ask agents to show them figures of recent apartment sales in similar buildings nearby to make sure they are not overpaying.
Nevertheless, "There's this group that feels if they don't move quickly, they'll lose it," Ms. Beck said. Like novice gamblers who put a chip on every number, she said, some of these buyers will run around town placing bids on two, three and four apartments.
Because not all bidders are serious, Ms. Beck says she advises apartment hunters to make a backup offer if they really like an apartment.
"It's like choosing a spouse," she said. "You don't do it because somebody is pressing you to or because you hear somebody else is engaged to the same person."
The market, she said, is "kind of pushing people to act in a way they'll later regret."

HEADLINE: In a Contest of Tech Trivia, the West Beats the East

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: BOSTON, April 29

 BODY:
Much as it hurts anyone who loves the bow-tied, Burberried, cobblestoned Northeast and remembers the former glories of the high-tech corridor on Route 128 around Boston, there are times when one simply has to admit that primacy in the computer industry has long since passed, with the sun, to the West.
It was such a time on Friday night at the Computer Museum's 10th Annual Computer Bowl, when, for the fourth year in a row, a West Coast team of five prominent computer industry figures trounced their East Coast counterparts. Trounced them so decisively and quickly, in fact, that at one point, the score in the college-bowl-like game of technology-related trivia was 180 to 20. The final score was 230 to 70. 
 True, it was only a game, and it really doesn't matter that the West Coast team knew that there are now more than 300 million pages on the World Wide Web and that the East Coast team did not know that Silicon Valley has a street called Floppy Drive.
All that mattered was that the bowl has raised $4.3 million in the last 10 years to support the Computer Museum, a bicoastal nonprofit institution based in Boston and Mountain View, Calif., and that it netted $250,000 tonight.
But nonetheless, you came away with a definite sense that beneath the high-tech, high-finance fun ran powerful undercurrents of that big old river in Egypt.
Denial, that is.
"The conventional wisdom is that the West Coast is supreme, and I just don't feel it," said Paul Egerman, founder of IDX, a health-care software company with headquarters in Burlington, Vt. "We've got a very exciting and diverse software community with probably more small software companies here than in the Bay area.
"The reason you'll never be able to write off the East Coast is this incredible thing: our university system. Our biggest export is Ph.D.'s."
(One could not help but think that maybe they're all being exported to the West Coast.)
Philip Greenspun, an iconoclastic Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer scientist, said, "It was better in the old days when we were exporting VAX's" -- Digital Equipment's flagship minicomputers -- "at a million dollars a pop."
On pure technology, the West may be ahead, allowed Christopher Murray, president of the ABT Corporation, a software company with bicoastal projects. "But making it useful is the East Coast thing."
"Everything that happens on the West Coast, in the end, is providing a foundation," Mr. Murray said. "But without us creating the applications actually used by people to do real work, it has no economic value."
(But one couldn't help but wonder: Aren't the companies making the most popular applications these days, like Adobe, Oracle, Intuit and many game companies, also on the West Coast? Or in Texas?)
Even the West Coast victors condescended to defend the East.
"I figured out the theory of why they don't win," said one contestant, Bill Krause, president of Storm Technology. His theory is that the West Coast contestants, who included Denise Caruso, a contributing columnist for The New York Times, and Marc Andreesen, the 26-year-old golden Netscape boy, live close enough to one another that they could gather for practice sessions.
"We practice, and it makes a difference," Mr. Krause said. Also, the questions were weighted toward Internet business, he added, and that is concentrated on the West Coast.
(But, one couldn't help asking, isn't that the point? Perhaps the more densely packed the high-tech world on the West Coast becomes, the more it seems the place to be, and the more it seems the place to be, the more it actually is the place to be?)
Mr. Krause agreed. "You get a critical mass where it feeds on itself, and people say, 'I've got to be where the action is.' "
Still he and other contestants refused to write off the East Coast. Some argued that it was never clear where the next great idea or company was coming from -- remember when Seattle was known for Boeing? "The East will rise again," Mr. Egerman said.
It has a ways to rise, however, judging by its performance. In the old days, like, say, 1990, the East Coast team could stand against the likes of Bill Gates.
These days, the members of the East Coast team, looking cutely Colonial in tricorner hats and ruffled shirts, kept Mr. Andreesen jumping and fist-pumping in youthful glee at their sadly un-nerdly performance. In the last four years, the West has won 4-0, for a 10-year record of 7-3.
The East Coasters -- who included Seth Godin of Yoyodyne and Walter Mossberg, technology columnist for The Wall Street Journal -- even muffed the question asking which of the following was not a real World Wide Web site: The Cat That Looks Like Hitler, The Official French Fries Page, Driveways of the Rich and Famous or Underwater Baseball.
Mr. Godin hazarded a guess, choosing Driveways. The correct answer was Underwater Baseball.
Well, of course it was, Mr. Greenspun, a Web expert, kibbitzed. "I've been to the driveways site myself. Underwater Baseball makes no sense!"
The East Coasters did better on more true-geek questions, like the one about how much faster a new Motorola cable, providing up to 10 megabits per second to a user on a personal computer, is than a 56K modem. The answer from the multiple-choice menu: 178 times faster -- an answer that depended on a quick bit of simple arithmetic. (Actually, it's 178.57, which would be 179 if rounded up, but who's counting?)
But they often failed on current-events questions like the one asking how much faster Option White, I.B.M.'s new $85 million computer, would be than Deep Blue, the chess-playing computer. (It is 1,000 times as fast.)
One question posed by the contest's host, John Ratzenberger -- a technophile best known for playing Cliff Clavin, the mailman on the television show "Cheers" -- seemed especially designed to rub the East Coasters' faces in their technological inferiority.
It went: "Decision Analyst Inc. recently compared the productivity of the 50 most populous cities in the United States, based on such factors as employment rates, growth rates, use of technology, etc. Which city placed first? Was it Boston, Seattle, Minneapolis/St. Paul or San Jose?"
Unsurprisingly, it was San Jose, in the heart of Silicon Valley. But unmercifully, Mr. Ratzenberger added, "Boston placed 28th."
 
Panelists, Start Your Brains
The following are excerpts from the questions asked at the 1988 Computer Bowl:
 1. In the classic text-adventure computer game Zork, you are occasionally told, "It is pitch black." When that happens, will you be attacked by a troll, fall down a well, be attacked by a dragon or be eaten by a grue?
 2. Today 32-bit processors are common, with 64-bit processors just around the corner. But what was the first home computer with a 16-bit processor? Was it the Amiga 1000, the Apple Lisa, the Atari 520 ST or the Texas Instruments 99/4?
 3. In the 1960's, Bell Labs developed a paper computer. What was that computer called? Was it Brainiac, Cardiac, Similac or the Paper PC?
 4. There is some debate as to whether there are life forms on Mars, but there are now several microprocessors on Mars. How many microprocessors are currently on the surface of Mars? Is it 2, 5, 10 or 100?
 5. Most people have heard of I.B.M.'s chess-playing software called Deep Blue. But there is also a world champion checkers-playing program. What is it called? Is it Chinook, Alberta, Checker King or Jumpmaster?
 6. In a famous sci-fi movie, the following line: "My instructor was Mr. Langley, and he taught me to sing a song. If you'd like to hear it, I can sing it for you." Who spoke that line?
 7. When you start up Windows 95, by default it makes a distinctive musical sound. That short piece of music was created by a well-known musician. Was it David Bowie, Mick Jagger, Brian Eno or Elton John?
 8. Veronica is the name for an Internet search tool. The name Veronica is in fact an acronym. What do the letters in Veronica stand for?
 9. One of the dreaded occurrences in computing is when Windows crashes. When it's Windows NT, what is the popular slang term for what you see on the screen when Windows NT crashes?
 10. If you count the number of information technology jobs in the United States, the following states rank in the top three, in this order: California, New York and Texas. What state ranks fourth?
 
1. Eaten by a grue.
2. The TI 99/4, in 1980.
3. Cardiac.
4. Two: one in the Pathfinder, the other in the Rover.
5. Chinook.
6. The HAL 9000 computer in the movie "2001: A Space Odyssey."
7. Brian Eno.
8. Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Netwide Index to Computerized Archives.
9. The Blue Screen of Death.
10. Illinois.

HEADLINE: Essay;
Alice in Euroland

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
To most Americans, the euro (the common currency to replace the franc, mark, lira, etc.) is a MEGO (My Eyes Glaze Over).
On Saturday 11 nations will celebrate a marriage of money that they hope will make the Continent they call "Euroland" more competitive with North America and Asia. 
 The new lockstep stability, goes the dream of European bureaucrats, will attract investors and tourists. The device they have created to bring about this new efficiency is a central bank that sets interest rates and determines the money supply.
Shouldn't we be pleased to see Europe adopt the American model?
No. Europe is not one country, but individual peoples with different languages, cultures and politics. They wisely cooperate in a common market, but to give up political sovereignty through an economic back door -- that's not what the citizens of those countries are bargaining for.
The first symbolic strain shows in the naming of their top central banker. The Germans, to whom discipline and austerity come first, want a hard-line Dutchman; the French, to whom welfare and employment come first, want one of their own.
They'll compromise this time, but soon the internal contradiction will manifest itself. One nation, doing well, will want tight money; another, bound to its union demands and welfare culture, will want easy money.
Suddenly the loss of national control of national destiny will come clear to those told to suffer in the name of Continental discipline. Result: resentment, ethnic unrest, bankerphobia, riots and worse.
These stresses don't tear apart America because we live in one country and can move around. In the Depression, poor Southerners moved north; as the Industrial Belt rusted, tens of millions moved to the Sun Belt. But are hungry Spaniards going to migrate to Denmark, or desperate Danes to Italy? No; they'll be forced to sit tight and suffer.
Many Britons understand this, which is why Tony Blair's Labor Government says wait and see to the euro. Thanks to Thatcherism, that country is booming, and the new Prime Minister is disinclined to give up sovereignty if it risks recession.
The Conservative Party, or what's left of it after being routed last year, is no longer split between Europhiles and Euroskeptics. Last week in the House of Commons I spoke to William Hague, the 37-year old Yorkshireman elected to resuscitate the Tories, and unlike "cool Britannia" Blair, he doesn't straddle at all:
"We want to be in Europe, not run by Europe," this future prime minister, a slam-bang orator, likes to say. He opposes British entry into a single currency in this Parliament and intends to oppose it in the next election. If Hague should win (and Tory political stock is a good gamble at current lows), that would keep Britain free from domination by bankers in Frankfurt until at least 2006.
Where does the U.S. Government stand? Aside. Clintonites deliver knee-jerk responses favoring European union, as if the common currency were just another step in getting along together -- and not a divisive act inviting political backlash. Nasty nationalists are already on the upswing in both France and Germany; the winds of the euro will fan the flames of populist resentment.
The only U.S. pol to address the sovereignty giveaway (in speeches appreciated only overseas) is Newt Gingrich. He rightly sees economic diktats from Frankfurt creating crises that could lead to political disaster and angry disunion. He suggests that Britain ally itself with Nafta.
The coming rise and fall of the euro is America's business, whether we like it or not, and despite the none-of-your-concern attitude of Eurocrats. The Times of London, in a leader grateful for Gingrich's attention to the coming blunder, writes: "Belated American intervention to rescue Europe from itself has been the story of this century."
Democracies must put the political horse before the economic cart. First the U.S. colonies formed a political union; decades later came national banking, and a century later our Federal Reserve central bank. The Eurocrats are putting the cart first, using a supranational bank to impose political union.
That's why American supporters of an expanding NATO say to our allies: Beware the euro. It's bad for union, dangerous to democracy.

HEADLINE: New Rumblings in Cyprus Raise Specter of War

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: KYRENIA, Cyprus

 BODY:
A television station in the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus scooped the world recently by broadcasting the film "Titanic" to an amazed and delighted audience.
The film is still doing huge business at theaters around the world, including northern Cyprus, and has not been licensed for television broadcast anywhere. Distributors want to sue the station that pirated it but are not sure they can. 
"We're an illegal country," a Turkish Cypriot official said, his voice dripping with sarcasm and resentment. "We should be entitled to a little illegal entertainment."
Ever since Cyprus was divided in 1974 when Turkish troops invaded, the north has been isolated. In a series of overwhelming votes, the United Nations Security Council has reiterated its request that Turkey withdraw its troops and allow reunification. But Turkey refuses, saying it fears that the Greek Cypriot majority will overrun the north and destroy its Turkish character.
Bitter intransigence on both sides has frustrated many would-be mediators over the years, most recently Richard C. Holbrooke, the special Cyprus envoy of President Clinton. He has described the differences between Greek and Turkish Cypriots as much deeper than those that have separated Serbs, Croats and Bosnian Muslims. Mr. Holbrooke's visit here in April, and his planned return on May 2, reflected growing concern that this conflict is entering a dangerous new stage.
On March 31, the European Union opened talks aimed at admitting Cyprus. Turks fear it may admit the Greek-run south alone. That could leave the Turkish north and its allies in Ankara to fend off an enemy backed by all of Europe, a potentially explosive situation.
"The Turks were badly treated by the European Union in December, when 12 countries applied for membership and 11 were told they could apply, with Turkey being left out in the rain," Mr. Holbrooke said in an interview. "One of the 11 was Cyprus. That produced an inevitable Turkish backlash, which has resulted in them telling North Cyprus to cease all cooperation, all search for common ground.
"The only way this can be reversed is if the European Union opens its doors at least a little bit to Turkey and treats it as it should be treated, as a European nation. The Turks, for their part, have to ease up on their negative approach in Cyprus."
Also raising tensions, the Greek Cypriots have announced that they are buying a battery of S-300 antiaircraft missiles from Russia. Turkey, at whose planes they would presumably be aimed, has threatened to bomb them. The Greek Government says it would consider that an act of war.
"If Turkey attacks Cyprus, we shall fight," Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos said on a recent visit to Washington. "Yes, that will mean war between Greece and Turkey."
For millenniums, Cyprus has been a strategic prize guarding access to rich trade routes between Europe and Asia. Greeks have lived here since antiquity.
For nearly a century the island was a British colony. It won independence in 1960 with a Constitution that guaranteed the Turkish minority a strong say in government. The Greek majority later curtailed those rights, starting what Turkish Cypriots say was a violent campaign to intimidate them into fleeing. Many can still remember Greek paramilitary units preventing them from leaving their villages to reach their land, go to beaches or attend school.
In 1974, after a rightist coup here engineered by the military dictatorship then ruling Greece, Turkish Cypriots appealed to Turkey for help. Turkish troops landed, seized the northern one-third of the island and set up a Turkish enclave. The United Nations declared the invasion illegal and refuses to recognize the enclave, which in 1983 declared itself an independent state.
Today the island is home to roughly 200,000 Turkish Cypriots and nearly 600,000 Greek Cypriots. United Nations troops patrol the "green line" that separates them, and the capital, Nicosia, is a divided city.
Nicosia reflects the contrast between the island's sides. The Turkish sector is poor, rundown and frozen in time. On the other side, Greeks run a bustling and successful economy.
Many Turkish Cypriots, however, are convinced that they could not live safely under Greek rule. "We're not doing so badly," said Salahi Dervish, 65, who runs an auto repair shop in Kyrenia. "Of course we don't have much money, but we have enough. More important, we have security."
Greeks assert that Cyprus has always been Hellenic, and that while a Turkish minority can and will be tolerated, Greeks must rule.
For their part, Turks perceive the island as home to two distinct native communities with equal rights and insist on running their own affairs. They say bombings and attacks by Greek gunmen in the 1960's and early 70's prove that they can never trust Greeks to govern them.
"There were thousands of deaths, and the wounds are very deep," said Osman Ertug, a senior Turkish Cypriot diplomat.
Greek Cypriots have little incentive to compromise because they already control two-thirds of the island and are recognized by every country except Turkey as its rightful rulers. They are so much richer than the Turkish Cypriots that they could simply buy out the Turks if the island were unified. Perhaps most important, they have the unconditional backing of Greece.
In the chambers of the European Union, Greece has threatened to block the admission of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and other countries if Cyprus's application is not considered expeditiously.
Turkish Cypriots, on the other hand, are international outcasts, subject to an array of official and unofficial embargoes. Their per capita income is one-third that of Greek Cypriots.
Turkey and northern Cyprus have warned that they will move toward "full integration" if the European Union admits the Greek Cypriot state. But short of complete union, they could hardly come closer than they already are.
The currency of northern Cyprus is the Turkish lira. Its international mail flows through Turkey, and it shares Turkey's telephone code. Turkey maintains 30,000 soldiers here and gives the government about $200 million in aid each year.
Both Cypriot parties live under the wing of their motherlands, and many foreign diplomats are convinced that answers must be sought not only on the island itself, but in Greece and Turkey.
In both countries, however, many people feel a deep emotional connection to their Cypriot kin. For politicians, advocating serious compromise on Cyprus-related issues is tantamount to suicide. As a result, hard-liners and demagogues dominate the debate.
Last month Greek Cypriot leaders offered Turkish Cypriots a place on the team that is negotiating the island's membership in the European Union. Turks refused on the ground that taking part "under the Greek umbrella" would be accepting a subservient position.
This attitude has upset both Europeans and Americans. The United States is pressing the Greek side to cancel deployment of the Russian missiles, and is encouraging the Turkish side to join in negotiating Cyprus's entry into the European Union. It has had no visible success.
"The Turks have everything to lose from boycotting the talks," a senior American policy planner said. "If they could get into the E.U., even as a minority in a Cypriot delegation, they would become the first Islamic voice in the E.U. and also a voice for Turkey. It would be a great step forward, not only for Turkish Cyprus but for Turkey itself."
In interviews, Turkish Cypriots said they were alarmed by developments they interpret as being aimed against them.
"If south Cyprus gets into Europe, that will mean a crack-up is coming," said Mustafa Ozkal, a Nicosia shoemaker. "The people in the south are doing fine economically, and they aren't trying to get in for economic reasons. They want to get in for political reasons. Their plan is to get all of Europe behind them, and then accuse us of occupying European Union territory and crush us."

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Fell in March, As Months-Long Rise Is Ended

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
Sales of new single-family homes fell in March for the first time in four months, a lull for the housing market, which is providing solid support for the economy.
New-home sales fell 5 percent last month to an annual rate of 828,000 units, the Commerce Department said today. In February, sales rose a revised 3 percent, to a 872,000 pace, initially reported as a 4.8 percent rise, to a record 893,000 rate. Before today's report, analysts expected March sales to slip 2.5 percent. 
 Though new-home sales fell in March, warmer than usual weather in January and February helped sales to rise in the first quarter compared with the final three months of 1997. Total sales averaged a 849,000-unit rate in the first quarter, up from an average monthly pace of 828,000 in the fourth quarter. Moreover, the sales rate has exceeded 800,000 for a record seven straight months, Government figures showed.
The housing market's resiliency is one cause of inflation concerns. Strong demand for new homes has allowed builders to raise prices; the average price of a new home climbed to a record $183,500 in March from $179,600 in February, though the median price fell to $153,900 from $155,000.
New-home sales fell in the South for the second consecutive month to an annual rate of 334,000 units, the slowest since October 1996. Sales were also weaker in the West and Midwest but were unchanged in the Northeast. The report also showed the supply of new homes rose to 4.3 months in March from 3.9 months in February.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Allies Put Pressure On Yugoslavia to Negotiate

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: ROME, April 29

 BODY:
Seeking to bring an end to the violence in Kosovo, the United States and five of its allies imposed new economic sanctions on Yugoslavia today. They threatened further action if the Yugoslavs do not agree to hold negotiations with the province's ethnic Albanian separatists.
Calling the current situation in Kosovo "untenable," the so-called contact group, which monitors events in Yugoslavia and the republics that broke away from it, also offered to reward Yugoslavia with membership in international economic organizations if it took steps toward a peaceful settlement with the leadership of the province. 
 Kosovo is in Serbia, the dominant republic in what remains of Yugoslavia.
The contact group's six members -- Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States -- have met several times in an effort to end the violent crackdown by the Serbian police on the Albanian separatists. About 150 people have been killed since Serbian forces began military operations there in February.
The United States and other countries fear that the fighting could soon spread and reignite a war in the Balkans.
The penalty that the group agreed on, freezing Yugoslav assets abroad, is mostly symbolic, since Belgrade has had plenty of warning and time to move any money it had banked abroad. Much of today's meeting focused on ways to coax Belgrade into the talks that it has so far rejected. The group's communique emphasized that the freeze would be lifted if Belgrade agreed to take part in talks.
The United States, which crafted the carrot-and-stick proposal, had threatened to take action on its own if the rest of the group did not go along with its plan.
The American envoy, Robert Gelbard, went to the meeting hoping to persuade the other members to agree to a freeze of assets and a ban on foreign investment in Yugoslavia. But the group did not agree to threaten Belgrade with an immediate ban on foreign investment.
Instead, it agreed to reconvene in Paris in May, giving Yugoslavia a chance to make a positive response before imposing an investment ban.
After the meeting, which was supposed to end at 3 P.M. but dragged on until 9 P.M., the envoys gathered to draft a statement that would take a firm stand on the Kosovo crisis but would smooth over differences over sanctions. As one Italian official who took part in the discussions put it, "We worked very hard to maintain the cohesion of the contact group."
The United States has been lobbying for weeks for harsh economic sanctions as a way to punish the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, for the incursion and to put pressure on him to hold negotiations. Russia, which considers Serbia a Slavic ally, has strongly resisted the American position in the contact group, insisting that only the United Nations can impose sanctions.
The French envoy, Jacques Blot, told reporters that Russia had agreed in general to the plan but expressed reservations about fresh sanctions. France had also been reluctant to impose further sanctions on Belgrade. Italy, which has already invested heavily to help Yugoslavia privatize its telecommunications system, also does not want to see an investment ban go forward.
Last month, the United Nations Security Council imposed some sanctions, including an arms embargo, in an effort to force Mr. Milosevic to return some degree of autonomy to Kosovo. In 1989 Serbia, of which Mr. Milosevic was then President, revoked Kosovo's autonomous status. Mr. Milosevic, who became the Yugoslav President last year, has rejected Kosovo's request for foreign observers at peace talks.
The Albanian Prime Minister, Fatos Nano, asked the contact group to deploy NATO troops in Albania to prevent the conflict in Kosovo from spilling over the border.
"The Serbian police and army are undertaking an intensive military operation in the border area with the republic of Albania at a time when the Albanian population is getting convinced its only possibility is to organize self-defense," Mr. Nano wrote in a letter to the Italian Foreign Minister, Lamberto Dini.
The NATO Secretary General, Javier Solana, ruled out a deployment of NATO forces in Albania during a visit to the capital, Tirana, in March. But a NATO crisis management team traveled to Albania earlier this month to advise the Government.

Some Economic Interplay Comes Nearly Full Circle

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
When it comes to globalization, the 20th century is ending on a note of deja vu: The world's economies are roughly as intertwined today as they were in 1913.
Two world wars and the Depression dismantled the globalization that had been achieved over a 40-year period starting in the 1870's. By 1913, trade and foreign investment, two key measures of global integration, were roughly at the levels that have been reached through a gradual buildup since the late 1950's. 
 The annual rate of increase worldwide for merchandise exports, for example, was 1.7 percent from 1870 to 1913, compared with about 1.3 percent since the 1950's. Foreign direct investment as a percentage of the world's total output reached 9 percent in 1913; in the mid-1990's it was 10.1 percent, up from 4.4 percent in 1960. Other data yield similar results.
There are differences, of course. At the beginning of the century, manufacturing jobs could not be shifted easily to low-wage countries. They were confined to the industrial nations, which traded manufactured goods for raw materials from the underdeveloped world. Today, says Robert Pollin, an economist at the University of California at Riverside, "we are moving in the direction of every country being able to produce everything."
A century ago, colonial empires -- particularly the British Empire -- provided the structure for globalization, and British or German or American companies counted on the military power of their home countries to protect their operations abroad. Today, companies locate almost anywhere. And information technology vastly increases the speed of transactions across borders.
That leaves governments struggling to keep up with the pace of change.
"What you see governments more focused on today is the social safety net," said Daniel Yergin, co-author of "The Commanding Heights," a recent book on the spread of free-market thinking around the globe. "Fixing the safety net to protect people from the downside of a global economy becomes the preserve of the nation-state."

HEADLINE: Creating Professional Bosnian Media

 BODY:
Bosnia's media, especially radio and television, hold a particular place of infamy in that country. Broadcast propaganda helped foment the ethnic hatred that led to war, and today it is impeding peace and reconciliation.
Most Bosnian press and broadcast media are biased and dreary, controlled by whatever political party holds power. But thanks to funding and training from such groups as the Agency for International Development, the BBC, George Soros' Open Society Institute and various European governments, there are now also independent voices. 
 The challenge for Bosnia and for the international community is to help keep these new media active after NATO troops leave, and to improve the state television and radio stations that are the main source of news for Bosnians. Instead of training in English, programs should use experienced journalists who speak the local language and understand local problems. A new French-financed course to be taught by local journalists is promising.
But training alone is not going to solve the problem of the politicians' hold on Bosnia's airwaves. Licenses are dispensed according to political criteria. Especially in the Croatian sector, which is controlled by virulent nationalists, some television and radio stations still incite people to block the return of refugees or call those who work with other ethnic groups "traitors."
Bosnia needs the equivalent of a Federal Communications Commission to allocate licenses -- which are public property -- without regard to politics and impose reasonable regulation of the airwaves. But a new proposal by the Office of the High Representative, the international civilian authority running Bosnia, poses potential dangers. A new temporary media commission will not only give out licenses, it will be able to fine or shut down stations that do not comply with standards the High Representative is drafting.
The commission, like America's system, should be able to cancel or suspend the licenses of stations that broadcast direct incitements to violence if a diligent review process open to all parties establishes a pattern of such abuse. Licensing requirements should include the airing of competing viewpoints. But the commission should not venture further into regulating the content of broadcasting, and should stick to its plan not to regulate the print media. If the commission appears to be imposing Western-backed censorship, it will violate democratic principles, enrage Bosnian citizens and encourage neighboring dictators to strengthen their hold on the media.

HEADLINE: Gregor von Rezzori, 83, Chronicler of a Lost Europe, Dies

BYLINE: By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
Gregor von Rezzori, whose novels and memoirs revealed the tragic sweep of European history through two world wars and beyond, died last Thursday at his home in Donnini, a village near Florence. He was 83 and also had homes in Manhattan and on the island of Rhodes.
The cause was a heart attack, said Elizabeth Sifton, his editor at Farrar, Straus & Giroux. 
 Mr. von Rezzori wrote most of his work in German, though he also produced highly admired prose in English and Italian. In whatever language, he evoked the collapsed polyglot world of the Austro-Hungarian Empire into which he was born. He once described himself as "a living anachronism," and "a man dreaming of a lost homeland."
That homeland, as it emerges from his provocatively titled novel "Memoirs of an Anti-Semite" (published in 1981 in the United States) or from his less fictionalized autobiographical work "The Snows of Yesteryear" (1989) was rooted geographically, culturally and emotionally in Bukovina, a region in central Europe that at the time of Mr. von Rezzori's birth on May 13, 1914, was an outpost of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The empire collapsed with the outbreak of World War I a few months later, and Bukovina would experience the convulsions of history that would remake the face of Europe.
Mr. von Rezzori would watch his homeland fall under the rule of Romania and the Soviet Union; today it is divided between Ukraine and Romania. But it was Bukovina as it was ruled from Vienna that served as the point of departure for Mr. von Rezzori's life and work. His hometown of Czernowitz (now Chernovtsy in Ukraine) had a rich but complicated national and ethnic history, and much of his work depicts the loss of a familiar, if never idealized, order and the onset of chaos.
Whether writing autobiography or fiction, Mr. Von Rezzori kept dissecting himself, mining his experience with an unadorned and unsympathetic memory. The narrator of his "Memoirs of an Anti-Semite," a man also named Gregor, claims at one point that among the skills of survival he possesses is "the artful feat of always holding up a new possibility of himself, a fiction of himself."
The critic Stanley Kauffmann, reviewing the novel in The New York Times Book Review, described "Memoirs" as "a literature in which the author envisions himself as a character in a design arranged from the data of his life as another author might arrange items from fictitious notes."
"Memoirs of an Anti-Semite" was first published in 1979, when the author was 65. It is composed of five connected stories, each dealing in some measure with the protagonist's relationship with Jews and with the expressions of attitudes toward Jews over several decades. Much of the protagonist's life resembles that of the author, who was the son of a snobbish Austro-Hungarian official who was responsible for the maintenance of art in Orthodox churches. Despite their Sicilian forebears, the von Rezzoris spoke German as their first language. As a young man the author could also make his way linguistically among the Romanians, Slovaks, Hungarians, Ukrainians and Yiddish-speaking Jews who lived in his hometown.
In the stories that make up "Memoirs of an Anti-Semite," the fictional Gregor is taught in his upper-class home to have contempt for Jews as aliens, rivals, inferiors. He reveals his disdain for his Jewish classmates but makes exceptions for Jewish women, with whom he has affairs. At one point he finds himself in Vienna on the night of March 11, 1938, and is swept along by Nazi demonstrators celebrating the Anschluss. Later he marries a Jewish woman and becomes the father of a boy, whom he adores. But when the child dies at the age of 5, he confides that he would have been more comfortable had the child been born a girl since the son appeared to be "himself as a Jew."
The work is characterized by a candor and unstinting description of attitudes that the author must have known from both experience and observation. "He is an artist, devilishly honest, stubborn, the creator and the created of an artwork about a survivor," Mr. Kauffmann wrote. "It is through Mr. von Rezzori's art, rather than through any vanity or apology, that we are enlightened."
Mr. von Rezzori focused more closely on his childhood and his family in "The Snows of Yesteryear," a volume of reminiscences. Here the domineering, philandering and anti-Semitic figure is clearly identified as the writer's father, a descendant of impoverished nobles who left Sicily to serve emperors in Vienna. His mother is portrayed as an overprotective woman who believed she had married beneath her station.
Of his parents, Mr. von Rezzori writes: "Their obsessions -- our mother's anxiety-whipped, guilt-ridden sense of duty and our father's blindly passionate escape into his mania for hunting -- were specific responses to circumstances that in no way fitted their upbringing, their existential concepts and expectations, even less their dispositions. We lived in the Bukovina -- more radically than would have been the case elsewhere -- as the flotsam of the European class struggle, which is what the two great wars really were. Our childhood was spent among slightly mad and dislocated personalities in a period that also was mad and dislocated and filled with unrest."
In her review in The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani wrote: "In the story of his own family he finds a parable of Europe's dissolution; in the confusions of his own parents, a mirror of the losses sustained by that vanishing class of the haute bourgeoisie." She added: "The wounds the family sustained were psychic ones: a Chekhovian sense of displacement, the perception that all the old certainties -- of class, religion and society -- had abruptly vanished, a disorienting fear that the world no longer corresponded to expectations."
The book also contains Mr. von Rezzori's impressions of a visit he paid to his hometown 50 years after he left it in what was to be Czernowitz's last year under Communism. Writing in The New York Review of Books, Michael Ignatieff said that Mr. von Rezzori could well be "the last great remembrancer of a region that has vanished from the map and mind of Europe."
Mr. von Rezzori spent much of World War II in Berlin. In "Memoirs of an Anti-Semite" the fictional Gregor confessed that he had been "a hideous fop, cynically watching the world in flames." In 1985, the real Gregor drew on his wartime experiences to write a huge novel called "The Death of My Brother Abel," in which among many threads of narrative he presented the perspective of small aristocrats refusing to see the disappearance of their cultural and physical world.
Elie Wiesel, writing in The Washington Post, said: "If a great novel can be recognized by its obsessions, its characters and above all its tone, then 'The Death of My Brother Abel' is unquestionably great."
These books secured Mr. von Rezzori's international reputation rather late in his life. But altogether he wrote some 20 books, beginning shortly after the war while also working as a radio script writer in Germany. In the earlier works, among them a four-volume "Idiot's Guide to German Society," he skewered German society both during the war and through the postwar period of de-Nazification and economic renewal.
Since the 1960's his reputation in Germany and much of Europe has grown from that of a facile and cynical commentator to one of the most serious writers in the German language. He was acclaimed for carefully following his own precept: "You must never undertake the search for time lost in the spirit of nostalgic tourism."
A handsome man and an engaging conversationalist, he was once described by Francine du Plessix Gray as having "a majestic courtly manner that made him look as if he were perennially hosting a reception in some Middle European palace." In fact, as a personal protest of war and the irrationality of politics, he spent decades as a stateless person until the inconvenience of seeking visas drove him to take up Austrian nationality.
He cherished friendship, maintaining it was the central ingredient to any happiness, "vastly superior to romance, family, children, sexual love." By all accounts he was good at it. One old friend, the film director Louis Malle, cast him as the father of the character played by Brigitte Bardot in his 1965 movie "Viva Maria" as an act of homage but also because he needed a figure who would look impressive on horseback.
While he was making the film, he met, fell in love with and married Beatrice Monti della Corte, an Italian aristocrat who had an art gallery in Milan that was among the first in Europe to seriously promote the work of American artists. Another friend, the writer Bruce Chatwin, wrote about staying in the medieval tower that the von Rezzoris offered to guests at their farmhouse in Tuscany. Michael Ondaatje, the Canadian writer and author of "The English Patient," was another frequent writing guest.
Mr. von Rezzori is survived by his wife. He had two sons by an earlier marriage to a Prussian woman, but details of his survivors were incomplete yesterday. Gregor von Rezzori had a gift for aphorisms and pithy wit, as he revealed in an interview in Britain in which he was invited to give short answers to short questions:
What is your greatest extravagance?
Writing.
What is the trait you most deplore in yourself?
Indifference.
Which talent would you most like to have?
Ice dancing.
What keeps you awake at night?
My past.
What would your motto be?
Avanti!
How would you like to die?
Surprised.

Self-Praise For a Budget Proves Hasty

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

 BODY:
WHEN they rewarded themselves two weeks ago with an impromptu vacation, the members of the New York State Legislature were feeling pretty good about themselves.
After all, they had just passed a budget in what was -- for them -- near-record time: only 13 days late instead of 68 or 104 or, like last year's, 126. And they had reached their agreement through an unprecedented process: holding public negotiating sessions rather than working behind closed doors. 
 Some members went so far as to suggest that the budget signaled a new era in Albany, one in which the Legislature would at last assume a role equal to the Governor's. And while lawmakers were clearly aware that Gov. George E. Pataki could veto sections of the budget, they left town convinced that he wouldn't dare: this was an election year, they told anyone who would listen, and the state had a big surplus.
Then reality intruded.
As the legislators filed back to the Capitol yesterday, it was clearly not the dawn of a new epoch so much as a sorry continuation of the same old story. The bright new budget they were so proud of lay in tatters, and the Governor they claimed to have outfoxed was taunting them.
Not only had he cut more than a billion dollars in spending and borrowing, he had singled out the very projects closest to the hearts of the legislative leaders. And he had done so, lawmakers complained yesterday, knowing that revenues were running even higher than expected.
"This a great process; I love this process," Mr. Pataki gloated at the news conference where he announced his vetoes, and he seemed to mean it.
One naturally wants to understand a miscalculation of this scale. Isn't it only in the comics that a pudgy, bald boy rushes toward a football time and again, hoping vainly that, at last, things will be different? In stories without pictures, let alone in real life, people are supposed to learn from their falls -- to be smarter, tougher or at least less hopeful.
Yet from their comments before and after the Governor's vetoes, it would seem that legislators had no idea they were about to be blindsided again.
"A lot of us felt really happy," Assemblyman Dick Gottfried, Democrat of Manhattan, lamented. "It kind of slapped people in the face who were feeling justifiably pretty good about what they had done."
Legislators even seem to have convinced themselves that their lovely budget was fiscally prudent and that they were spending less than the Governor had originally proposed, a contention disputed by just about every group that could wade its way through the multivolume document.
But the truth is that the lawmakers' warm feelings about their budget follow directly from its generosity. It is a lot easier to negotiate a budget -- and to do so publicly and in a timely fashion -- when everyone who comes to the table is promised exactly what he wants: when new money is set aside for schools and for mental health, for child care and for college students, and when, on top of that, there are promises of hefty tax cuts. When, in other words, the future is imagined as infinitely rosy.
MR. PATAKI jumped to take advantage of the Legislature's misplaced confidence, in part because he had a miscalculation to correct.
Apparently worried that he would be facing a tough Democratic challenger this fall, the Governor, back in January, offered a bloated spending plan of his own, which his old allies attacked with surprising vigor. His budget, they charged, was a betrayal of his principles, a big fat election-year spend-a-thon intended to buy off voters.
Even if none of the spending Mr. Pataki vetoed this week is restored, this year's budget will still be a big fat election-year spend-a-thon. It still promises tax cuts as well as spending increases at well over three times the rate of inflation. No matter how the wrangling over the vetoes and the newfound tax revenues plays out, New York is still headed toward unprecedented budget gaps. By the Governor's own calculation, there will be a gap of at least $4 billion just two years from now.
But thanks to his much-publicized vetoes, who is going to remember that Mr. Pataki took the lead in the spending binge? The Governor has recovered at relatively minimal political cost his reputation as a fiscal conservative -- all thanks to the State Legislature.
No wonder he's gloating.

States Intent on Blocking Microsoft's Windows 98
Attorneys General from 13 states, apparently intent on blocking the imminent release of Microsoft's next version of its dominant Windows operating software, are in the final stages of preparing a joint antitrust action against the company.
While several said they would rather act in conjunction which the United States Department of Justice, which has been conducting its own antitrust investigation, they fear the Federal agency is acting too slowly and that any lawsuit would become vastly more complicated once Windows 98 goes on sale.

Stocks Snap Decline
The stock market ended higher for the first time in more than a week, but gains were trimmed in late trading by computerized selling programs. The Dow Jones industrial average, up as much as 96 points during the day, ended with a gain of 52.56 at 8,951.52. Broader indicators also advanced. D8.
 
Investors put an estimated $21 billion into stock and bond mutual funds in April, about a third less than last month's near record, industry groups reported. D7.
 
Treasuries ended little changed and the 30-year yield remained at 6.07 percent. D8.
 
Viacom Profits and Stock Jump
Viacom reported a surprise first-quarter profit of $1.4 million, helped by strength in its cable channels, a recovery in the Blockbuster video chain and the success of "Titanic," which Viacom's Paramount distributed domestically. Investors had expected a loss, and Viacom's widely traded class B shares rose $2.4375, or 4.4 percent, to $58, a four-year high. D2.
 
New-Home Sales Fall 5 Percent
Sales of new single-family homes fell an unexpected 5 percent in March to an annual rate of 828,000 units, the Commerce Department said. It was the first drop in four months. The housing market's resilience has been one cause of inflation concerns. D3.
 
Columbia/HCA Profits Slide
Columbia/HCA Healthcare's first-quarter profits fell 53 percent, to 31 cents a diluted share. But that was a penny above forecasts, and the stock edged up. The company said it was revising a plan to spin off about 100 of its 336 hospitals. In Nevada, Medicaid fraud investigators served a grand jury subpoena on of the company's hospitals. D3.
 
Humana's quarterly profits rose 28 percent as forecast. Humana said it expected an annual profit gain of 20 percent to 25 percent. D3.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Gains in Hard-Hit Blue-Chip Issues Push Markets Higher

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The stock market rallied yesterday, ending five sessions of declines that were fueled by fears that the Federal Reserve would increase interest rates.
But bond market interest rates held steady, with the yield on the 30-year bond unchanged at 6.07 percent. However, that was up from 5.79 percent at the beginning of the month and 5.98 percent just a week ago. 
 And the rally lost a lot of its steam in the last half-hour of trading, when the selling by computer programs knocked about 30 points off the Dow Jones industrial average, according to Birinyi Associates of Greenwich, Conn.
The Dow finished up 52.56 points at 8,951.52 points. The technology-heavy Nasdaq index fared better, climbing 19.87 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,851.64, while the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 9.52 points, to 1,094.63.
The market's gains were led by some stocks that had been hit hard in the recent slump, indicating that a lot of investors may have thought that these big blue chips were closer to fairer prices once again. For example, General Electric, which had dropped for seven sessions, rose 1 3/16, to 82 5/16, and Coca-Cola, which had been drifting lower for 17 sessions, climbed 1 1/4, to 73 11/16.
Merck & Company also rose after falling sharply for two and a half weeks. It closed at 116, up 1/2. Sears, Roebuck finished up 1 9/16 at 57 13/16, after being as high as 58 15/16.
The fear of higher interest rates came into sharp focus on Monday with a report that the policy makers at the Federal Reserve were now leaning toward an increase in interest rates. There are several economic reports due out today that investors will study to decide whether the pace of growth and inflation could actually lead the Fed to act. The central bank's policy makers are scheduled to meet on May 19.
The key report, according to Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, is the Employment Cost Index, the gauge of inflationary pressures that Fed officials watch most closely.
It has been rising, but slowly. In the fourth quarter of last year it rose 3.3 percent over the previous year compared with a 12-month increase of 3 percent through the third quarter. Mr. Fine said that the Wall Street consensus was for an increase of 3.5 percent to 3.6 percent. If the number is higher, he said, people would expect the Fed to be more worried about wage and compensation increases, which could force prices higher, even though there are few current signs of price pressures.
The Government also reports the preliminary estimate of economic growth for the first quarter, with the consensus forecast around 3.5 percent. If the economy should be a lot stronger, that could also worry investors, sending interest rates higher and stocks lower.
But the economic data for April, beginning a week from tomorrow with the employment report, are more important for assessing what the Fed will do. Many economists believe that if the economy is slowing from its first-quarter pace, the Fed will keep its short-term interest rate target unchanged for the time being.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Treasuries Little Changed
Treasury prices ended little changed yesterday, as concerns over new supply coming to market continued to put pressure on bonds.
Investors were also worried that data due out today -- on first-quarter gross domestic product and employment costs -- could show further strength in the economy that would prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.
Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the fixed-income department of J. W. Charles Securities Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla., said he considered the Employment Cost Index number "to be critical."
"We're in the type of market environment that has overreacted to the last few reports, so good news might be ignored and bad news could send the market into a tailspin," he said. Economists are expecting a gain of nine-tenths of 1 percent in the index for the first quarter, compared with a gain of 1 percent in the fourth-quarter of 1997.
The price of the 30-year bond slipped 2/32 yesterday, to a price of 100 24/32. Its yield was unchanged at 6.07 percent.
The Treasury sold $11 billion of five-year notes at auction yesterday, at a yield that had been expected to range between 5.785 percent and 5.790 percent. But at the end, the notes were awarded at a yield of 5.795 percent, slightly higher than expected.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new five-year notes:

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Local Payoff On a Stadium Is Uncertain

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
According to a two-year-old study by KPMG Peat Marwick, a new baseball stadium for the Yankees on the West Side of Manhattan would create about $100 million in annual income for New Yorkers. Check that: according to the Giuliani administration, the 45,000-seat stadium would generate a cool billion.
Maybe the computers at KPMG slipped a decimal point. Or maybe the Yankees have become considerably more popular with free-spending tourists since the firm finished its assessment, then viewed as optimistic. 
 Whatever the explanation -- the city has yet to flesh out the billion-dollar figure -- it won't make believers of everyone. "As an economist, I wouldn't believe any study I saw," said Carol O'Cleireacain, New York City's former budget director.
Such skepticism stems in part from the desire of local governments and businesses to find positive results in the studies they commission on the economic effect of regional development and stadium projects. But, in part, it is driven by the limits of data and the wide variations in conclusions based on which assumptions are made.
"It's always a problem measuring the new money you bring in from the outside, as well as estimating its ultimate impact on income and jobs," explained Patrick Howie, an economist at Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa.
Perhaps most damning, the uniformly bullish analyses for other cities have proved uniformly inaccurate.
"Sports stadiums just haven't been engines of economic development," concluded Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College who co-edited "Sports Jobs and Taxes: The Economic Impact of Stadiums" (Brookings Institution Press, 1997).
In concept, analyses of the effect of regional development projects are straightforward. First, define the relevant region -- in the case of the Yankees, the five boroughs of New York City. Then figure how much extra income and employment will be generated within the region. Then factor in the multiplier effect as the initial spending creates more income and jobs.
In practice, though, it is a messy business, piling imprecise estimates on slippery assumptions. To generate benefits beyond the initial construction work, the new stadium must attract more customers or bigger-spending ones. But this critical number is a matter of educated guesswork: In the KPMG study, the projected increase of 50 percent was simply extrapolated from the experience of three smaller cities that have recently built Major League Baseball stadiums.
Likewise, it was assumed that spending at concession stands, derived from less-than-scientific ball park surveys, would increase to $10 a person from $6.50 and that the demand for premium seating would follow the pattern of other cities, where luxury suites attract large corporations.
To calculate the multiplier effect of increased spending on sports, analysts use a standard tool of economics called input-output analysis, which effectively describes how much will be spent on mustard for every extra $1,000 spent on hot dogs. But Mr. Zimbalist argues that such analyses are hopelessly crude: core information is derived from decades-old data produced by the Commerce Department along with necessarily simplistic extrapolations of how much of the demand for mustard and other inputs will be met by suppliers within the region.
Then there is the question of who gets the income. Many people question the value of public subsidies that transfer income from a broad base to a handful of rich players and team owners. But apart from the issue of fairness, Mr. Howie noted, "distribution is a key to the regional economic impact."
Money spent at, say, a local bowling alley largely ends up as income to employees and suppliers in the region. By contrast, money spent on Yankee tickets will be reflected in player and owner income, who are, at best, part-time residents of New York.
Indeed, by cannibalizing from other sources of local entertainment, major-league sports may actually reduce the net income of residents.
With the aid of researchers from the Brookings Institution, Mr. Zimbalist and Roger Noll, an economist at Stanford University, examined the economic effect of new stadiums in Baltimore, Cincinnati, Cleveland and San Francisco. "Even under the best of circumstances," Mr. Zimbalist concluded, "you just don't see a net payoff."
Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards, often cited as the most successful of the new stadiums, illustrates the point. Attendance did increase by two-thirds, to an average of 45,000 fans a game.
But Bruce Hamilton and Peter Kahn, economists at Johns Hopkins University, estimate that the $41 million in additional spending by out-of-towners created just 460 permanent jobs in the Baltimore metropolitan area. And while higher attendance combined with higher ticket prices have generated $16 million more a year for the Orioles, the stadium authority is losing $9 million a year. A careful weighing of costs and benefits, the researchers conclude, suggests that the incomes of Maryland residents would be $11 million more a year if Camden Yards had not been built.
The best economic argument for subsidizing professional sports is one not captured in economic impact assessments. While sports generate relatively little revenue -- the average is about $65 million a year for a baseball franchise -- vast numbers derive pleasure from watching games on television, rooting for their heroes, speculating on pennant races and the like. Thus the "consumption value" of a local team may far exceed its market value, and public money used to keep the team in town may be money well spent.
Mr. Zimbalist concedes the point. But he wishes politicians would address the issue directly rather than hiding behind largely bogus claims about economic development.
"If keeping a team is worth, say, $10 a year in taxes on every resident," he said, "why not sell it that way to the voters?"

HEADLINE: Senate Rejects Bid to Create a NATO Unit to Resolve Conflicts

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
The Senate today rejected an attempt to create a tribunal within NATO to help resolve conflicts that might affect the alliance before they erupt into full-blown hostilities, as happened in Bosnia.
By a vote of 62 to 37, Senators defeated the proposed amendment to the plan to add Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to the 16-member military alliance that the Senate is debating this week. 
 Supporters said the measure would add another check against ethnic or regional strife within NATO's borders.
"Why is this needed?" asked Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican who sponsored the measure. "The history of the 20th century shows that great conflicts can arise from small disputes. The cold war imposed a discipline on the alliance that kept conflicts in check. That discipline is no longer in place."
Senator John W. Warner, the Virginia Republican, had more general worries about the NATO of the future, which could someday include all 12 nations that want to join the alliance. "We don't know what NATO is going to look like after we go from 16 to 28 nations," he said. "I look upon a profliferation of problems of unknown origins and unknown descriptions."
Critics said the proposed tribunal would distract from NATO's focus on collective security, and ignore its historical role in curbing tensions between alliance rivals, like Greece and Turkey.
"NATO is not the N.L.R.B.," said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Delaware Democrat, referring to the National Labor Relations Board. "NATO has been protecting the free world for 49 years. It's totally irrational to squander that leadership by tampering" with the alliance.
Senator Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, said the amendment would "turn NATO into a world side-show, a propaganda stage."
More important than the three votes today and the debate over expanding NATO eastward toward Russia were the developments off the floor. Senators huddled to decide which amendments to debate and which to discard, and to lay the groundwork for a final vote, which could come late on Thursday.
Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, a former Republican Senator from Maine, quietly worked behind the scenes to water down a proposed amendment by Senator Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican, that would reduce the United States share of NATO costs.
Supporters and opponents of expansion both say enlargement is a sure bet now; the only remaining drama is the final vote tally and a handful of amendments. Modifying the 1949 treaty requires the approval of two-thirds of the Senate and of all 16 NATO members.
Nonetheless, Administration aides say that officials from President Clinton on down, including Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who is traveling in Asia, are telephoning Senators to lobby for expansion and against amendments they fear would dilute it.
Senators unanimously approved two other amendments today. One urges the three prospective NATO members to scour their archives to help account for members of the American armed forces missing from past wars or cold war incidents. The other requires the President to report to Congress on prospective NATO members beyond the three candidates under review.
On Thursday, Senators will vote on the most contentious amendments, including one that imposes a three-year hiatus before NATO considers any new members, and one that requires prospective new NATO members to join the European Union economic alliance before they can enter the military alliance.
The Senate will also vote on whether to demand that Congress be allowed to formally approve the NATO-led operation in Bosnia as a condition for approving NATO expansion.
Republican critics of the Administration's Balkans policy want to force President Clinton to obtain Congressional approval of the Bosnia mission before the United States agrees to the addition of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to NATO.
Opponents of the measure say it amounts to legislating foreign policy on a treaty. "This is a treaty, this is not a conference report," said Senator Biden. The amendment is "worthy of debate, but it should not" be part of the treaty, he said.
More broadly, the amendment marks an effort to rein in the scope of NATO's future missions to prevent the alliance from policing ethnic strife and embarking on dangerous and costly peacekeeping missions.
"The new NATO will signal an end of NATO as a defense alliance and the beginning of its new role as a regional peacekeeping organization," said Senator Larry E. Craig, an Idaho Republican who sponsored the amendment.
A second amendment, sponsored by Senator John Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican who is seeking his party's presidential nomination, would be even more restrictive of NATO's ability to send forces outside its boundaries.
Under the measure, NATO's mission would be to defend the territory of its members, not their national security interests, as is now the case.
"It would be perilous indeed if we were to change the nature of NATO to make it a global police operation instead of the defender of territory that it was designed to be," said Senator Ashcroft.
Senator Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican, concurred. "To transform NATO into a nuclear supercop for all of the globe is dangerous," he said.
Opponents of expanding the alliance voiced fears that pushing its borders eastward would inflame Russian imperialism and create new rivalries among countries left out of NATO.
"What worries me most is that NATO expansion needlessly risks poisoning Russia's relationship with the United States, and increases the odds that Russian ultranationalists will gain power in the post-Yeltsin era," said Senator Paul Wellstone, the Minnesota Democrat.
He added: "Why in heaven's name are we rushing to expand a military alliance into Central Europe? It will recreate a dividing line in Europe, only further east."
Senator Dale L. Bumpers, the Democrat of Arkansas, said he was lobbied by Mr. Clinton and Secretary Cohen, but he still planned to vote no on expansion. "We cannot deny what this treaty is all about," he said. "It's about hemming Russia in. They may be dumb, but they're not stupid."
Enlargement supporters tried to allay fears that enlargement would ignite a new cold war. "No one can know for certain how NATO expansion will work out," said Senator Max Cleland, the Democrat of Georgia. "But the hand of history is on our shoulder. We must try."
Senator Jack Reed, the Democrat of Rhode Island, said he would vote for adding three new members. "Russia is prepared to accept them," he said. "That will not undermine our cooperative efforts to disarm the world."
But Mr. Reed said he drew the line at this round. "Quick entry of more members will compound" problems of cost and tensions between NATO's wealthier and poorer members, he said.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS -- Global Tug, National Tether;
As Companies Look Overseas, Governments Hold the Strings

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
For nearly three years, Caterpillar Inc. has been banging its head against the Clinton Administration door, trying to get Government-sponsored loans for the sale of its big earthmovers to China. Beijing is buying them by the dozens to build the giant Three Gorges Dam, which the Administration considers damaging to the environment.
So the Chinese have turned to suppliers in Japan and Europe, where governments are less concerned about the environment and more forthcoming with credit. "We've only managed to sell the Chinese a few off-highway trucks," a Caterpillar official said. 
 That is hardly the description of a giant multinational ranging unfettered across the world. For all the talk of economic globalization, the process is still in an early stage.
A few multinationals, such as I.B.M., Royal Dutch/Shell or Imperial Chemical Industries, are ahead of the pack in spreading their revenues, research, financing, stockholders and management over many countries. But the majority are more like Caterpillar in America, the Mitsubishi Corporation in Japan or Volkswagen in Germany. For all their involvement in overseas sales and investment, nationality still binds them to home.
"What we have is United States, European and Japanese corporations trying to dress in global clothing," said William W. Keller, executive director of the Center for International Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "But if you conceive of globalization as being the rootlessness of corporations, that is a paradox. You don't have corporations without states attached to them. When they need help, you find out who they really belong to."
Many corporations have invoked the competitive pressures of an increasingly borderless global economy as the reason for moving operations and jobs abroad and to press for other concessions.
But a proliferation of treaty negotiations in recent months, aimed at setting rules for the global economy -- most of them favorable so far to business -- has raised a fresh question: just how untethered are these companies and who, therefore, should have a voice in the rule-making?
"We have to keep separate that the mobility of corporations has increased from the notion that we are living in a completely seamless integrated world market that gives national government no bargaining power to set standards," said Dani Rodrik, an economist at Harvard. "The latter has not happened."
Some want to stop the process of globalization. But others, including a re-energized American labor movement, are more interested in setting international rules of the road. Indeed, 12 different rule-making negotiations are currently under way.
Most are inspired by the North American Free Trade Agreement and the treaty that set up the World Trade Organization, in which the United States and 116 other nations agreed essentially to recognize W.T.O. rulings as having the power of national law. Several of the agreements now being discussed would require Senate ratification and would be similarly binding. That would push the setting of global rules beyond the voluntary guidelines that have characterized most such agreements since World War II.
"Thus far, the corporations, more than any other group, are shaping the new global regulations," said Raymond Vernon, an economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. "It is not that they are abandoning their countries for a global identity. They are simply pushing abroad and arguing that if the obstacles are cleared away, they will produce enough for everyone and raise all boats."
The recent surge in rule-making brings out strange bedfellows. Corporate America and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. find themselves on one side, favoring an international stage, while the most visible advocates of those who want the rules made in America include Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator and politician, and Ralph Nader, the liberal consumer advocate.
"Rather than international negotiations, the rules should be written through Congress, where you can have discussion and debate," Mr. Nader said. As an example, he argued, Congress can no longer effectively ban imports of products made with child labor. Because the W.T.O. does not specifically prohibit such trade, such a law could be challenged before the organization, which could then fine the United States.
American corporate executives see in the new wave of rule-making not only the elimination of remaining trade barriers but also the removal of restrictions on investment abroad and greater freedom to purchase foreign companies. For Mr. Nader and Mr. Buchanan, however, these are hidden tools to make the shifting of jobs abroad that much easier. Mr. Buchanan advocates protective tariffs to keep companies at home, while Mr. Nader would discourage job-shifting by canceling tax breaks, imposing a "social tariff" and prohibiting Export-Import Bank loans for exports that contain too many foreign parts.
The bank once financed only those exports manufactured entirely in the United States. But it has relaxed that rule in recent years and now, for example, provides credits to customers of the Boeing Company to purchase aircraft that have as much as 15 percent "foreign content," and sometimes more.
Bucking such trends is futile, says John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. He calls the Nader-Buchanan approach simplistic. "It is a very good feeling to tell the workers we are going to bring all the jobs back," he said, "but it is not realistic."
With that in mind, the American labor movement has joined corporate America in embracing global rule-making. Instead of waging a losing battle to keep jobs at home, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is demanding a seat at the rule-making table, with only limited success so far. The intention is to preserve labor standards at home by raising them abroad.
That would be done by writing into every agreement a ban against child and prison labor, as well as guarantees that foreign workers can assemble freely and engage in collective bargaining. "If you can get rid of repression, workers can negotiate their own conditions," Mr. Sweeney said. The Administration included the A.F.L.-C.I.O. prescription in a bill now before Congress asking for $18 billion in new American financing for the International Monetary Fund. The language has survived so far in the House and Senate.
The treaty talks draw little public attention. They range from negotiations to eliminate tariffs on products such as cellular phones and computers to high-level talks between European and American business executives to develop common product standards that would then be incorporated into binding treaties.
The World Trade Organization, born in the tariff-cutting Uruguay Round agreement, plays a big role in this process, setting new standards, reducing more tariffs and eliminating other barriers to trade and investment.
"This is about international commerce," said Diane Sullivan, director of international trade at the National Association of Manufacturers. "Labor and the environment are not excluded, but they are not at the center of the W.T.O's concerns."
These outsiders are clamoring to make their views known in the negotiations for a treaty that is to be called the Multilateral Agreement on Investment.
The agreement is being negotiated under the umbrella of the 29-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Government negotiators, most representing major industrial powers, have met periodically at the organization's headquarters in Paris. The last session took place in mid-April. The group's main goal is to produce a binding treaty that would give foreign corporations a legal status equal to that of domestic companies, establish rules for prompt and sufficient payment in cases of expropriation and give foreign companies equal bidding rights in privatizations of state enterprises.
The United States already has a number of similar, bilateral agreements, but this would be the first multilateral treaty. And it is drawing fire from Mr. Nader and others, including labor, which is pressing for a greater say in the talks. As a result, the early May target date for completing an agreement has been postponed at least six months to allow for "consultation and assessment," the organization said this week.
Acknowledging the pressure, Alan Larson, Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs, who represents the United States in the negotiations, said: "There is strong support for measures in the treaty that would advance this country's environmental goals and our agenda on international labor standards. This treaty will not interfere with the ability of the United States to regulate in a normal and nondiscriminatory fashion to protect the environment or worker safety or health."
Faced with such regulation, Mr. Rodrik of Harvard argues, corporations will not decamp. "We exaggerate how effectively corporations can evade national rules," he said.
Indeed, many top executives of United States multinationals see their companies as essentially American in identity. That was evident in interviews with a half-dozen of them, and in the replies of others to a letter from Mr. Nader, who has been campaigning for companies to recite the Pledge of Allegiance, in the company's name, at each annual meeting of shareholders. The pledge would be a gesture of corporate loyalty to the United States in return for the tax breaks and other advantages that companies receive.
None of the 45 corporations that replied to Mr. Nader have agreed to such a proposal. Many argue that it would interfere with efforts to be good corporate citizens elsewhere in the world. Yet most spoke of their companies as essentially American in their management, headquarters, ownership and workers.
"It would be difficult to disassociate ourselves from America, even if we wanted to do so," Steve Burrow, president of the Anheuser-Busch Companies' international operation, said in an interview. "Our packaging is even red, white and blue, and the American eagle is part of our image. But our obligation is to our shareholders, and our international operation is an important part of increasing share value."
All these themes run through Caterpillar's effort to get low-interest credit. The company has moved about 25 percent of its production abroad; the rest is concentrated in the Midwest, where management and research are also centered. But overseas sales are rising rapidly, and the corporate goal is to have 75 percent of sales from abroad by 2010, up from 50 percent today.
The Export-Import Bank plays a significant role in this strategy, already providing low-interest credits for $300 million of Caterpillar's $19 billion in annual revenue. If sales for the Three Gorges project on the Yangtze River in China were to be similarly financed, the total would be $350 million or more.
Capital, of course, now flows relatively easily around the world, making loans available practically everywhere. But when Caterpillar is competing to sell diesel engines to Zambia, gold mining equipment to Russia and earthmovers to China, the global lenders are not so quick to offer low-interest loans.
So Caterpillar and other multinationals continue to turn to their home governments. "In really tough, high-risk, high-opportunity markets, a government will always have greater leverage for repayment than a bank," said William C. Lane, a Caterpillar executive in Washington. "You really have to have someone in your corner."

HEADLINE: 13 States Plan Antitrust Move Over Microsoft

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
Attorneys General from 13 states, apparently intent on blocking the imminent release of the Microsoft Corporation's next version of its Windows software, are in the final stages of preparing a joint antitrust action against the company.
"The decision on our action is imminent, and in my opinion some action is likely," said Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Attorney General. "I think it will be in the next couple of weeks." 
 While several of the state officials said in interviews that they would rather act in conjunction with the United States Justice Department, which has been pressing its own antitrust suit against Microsoft, they are prepared to proceed without the Justice Department.
The states intend to act quickly because Microsoft plans to begin shipping the next version of the software, the Windows 98 operating system, to personal computer makers in mid-May and to release it to the public by late June.
The Attorneys General refused to say exactly what their suit would charge because the matter is still under investigation. But interviews with officials in all 13 states, as well as 3 other states that are monitoring the discussions, showed a common interest in preventing Microsoft from using its dominance in personal-computer operating systems to promote the sale of other software products.
And the states' concerns go beyond the integration into Windows 98 of Microsoft's Internet Explorer software for navigating the World Wide Web -- which has been one of the issues for the Justice Department.
Microsoft's operating system software provides the basic instructions on nearly 9 of every 10 PC's sold. And these days, the PC operating system is not only the control mechanism for an individual computer but also a launching pad into the expanding world of Internet commerce. And the states worry that Microsoft could use its industry dominance to dictate which other companies have access to it.
"My concern is that there is, in fact, very active competition, the possibility of entry by other companies, in this very important area," said Charlie Condon, the Attorney General in South Carolina.
A senior aide in another Attorney General's office said "the problem we want to address is the exclusionary activities that involve tying and leveraging Microsoft's monopolistic position in operating systems to unreasonably restrain competition in other areas."
Word that the states were preparing an antitrust action against Microsoft has emerged in a number of news reports the last few weeks. On Friday, PC Week Online, an on-line industry news service, said a number of states would move to block the shipment of Windows 98.
A Microsoft spokesman, Mark Murray, said today: "At this point the states haven't given us any specific information on their concerns. I would hope they would tell us before there is any legal action, so we can respond and try to resolve their concerns."
With Windows 98, Microsoft significantly expands its practice of including other software products as part of the program. For example, in addition to Internet Explorer -- which competes head-on with the Netscape Corporation's Navigator Web-browser software -- Microsoft has embedded its Web TV software in Windows 98.
Web TV is a Microsoft-owned service that enables people watching television to surf the Web, too. As part of its licensing arrangements for Windows 98, Microsoft is said to be planning to offer PC makers discounts on the software if they agree to install circuitry into the computers that would enable them to receive television signals.
Microsoft has long said that its practice of integrating other software products is key to the company's future. After last week's Federal appeals court hearing on the Justice Department suit, William H. Neukom, Microsoft's vice president for law and corporate affairs, said: "This case involves a fundamental principle for us, the freedom of high-technology companies to continue to innovate on behalf of our customers. Part of innovation has to be integration. We are going to continue to integrate products."
Several Attorneys General said it was important to act before Windows 98 went on sale because any lawsuit would become significantly more complicated once computer manufacturers began buying the new program and installing it on customers' machines.
Some of them suggested they were acting in part because they were afraid Washington would not act soon enough. A joint suit would probably be filed in Federal court, meaning that any judgment or injunction would have force nationwide.
"There are significant advantages to coordinating a Federal-state action," said Attorney General Scott Harshbarger of Massachusetts. "But state attorneys general often have different time frames, and I think as attorneys general we are prepared to move on our own. And we're very close."
If the states, or Washington, waited to file suit after the release of Windows 98, "the action then would have to include another large set of defendants, the manufacturers," one Attorney General said, speaking on condition that he not to be quoted by name.
Mr. Murray, the Microsoft spokesman, said that blocking the release of Windows 98 "would be costly, disruptive to consumers, destructive to the high-technology industry, and it would undermine the strength and health of the U.S. economy."
Told of those comments, Mr. Condon, the South Carolina Attorney General, replied: "That's a valid concern. But if you let it be released, speaking hypothetically, then it's so much harder to put the toothpaste back in the tube."
Justice Department officials declined to comment today on the plans of the state Attorneys General. Though all of the Attorneys General interviewed described a suit as quite likely, none said they had made a final decision to act. In several of the states, officials declined to talk about the case.
"We're at a critical stage now; we can't discuss it," said an official in the Illinois Attorney General's office.
The other involved states are New York, Ohio, California, Texas, Wisconsin, Minnesota, West Virginia, Florida and Iowa. The Attorneys General are circulating documents and drafts of the proposed suit among themselves and, they say, finding it surprisingly easy to decide how to proceed.
"In the Microsoft task force, it's remarkable how well 13 states are working together," said Tom Miller, Attorney General of Iowa. He is chairman of the Anti-Trust Task Force for the National Association of Attorneys General.
"It's amazing how the same concerns popped up all over the country, crossing different party lines and different regions of the country," Mr. Condon said.
If the states do file suit, the action would continue a trend in recent years of attorneys general banding together to pursue cases in tobacco, product advertising, telemarketing and other initiatives in consumer protection -- a job that Washington has seldom embraced with the enthusiasm it has for other governmental functions.
Of course, there can be political benefits for the state officials, too. All the Attorneys General now involved in the case are elected officials, and many are up for re-election this year. Mr. Harshbarger is running for Governor of Massachusetts.
New York, Texas, Massachusetts and California are described as leaders of the group; each of those states serves as home to large concentrations of high-technology companies whose interests the Attorneys General are trying to protect.
But other states, like Iowa and South Carolina, have few of these companies. Most states have anti-trust laws patterned after the Federal law, and many Attorneys General say they are acting on behalf of consumers.
As Mr. Miller, the Iowa Attorney General, put it: "We enforce the anti-trust laws to protect consumers. If Microsoft can use its monopoly in operating systems to leverage its way into other areas, then consumers will suffer because of price and quality, and the whole system will suffer from loss of innovation."
But there are still other reasons. In South Carolina, for example, Mr. Condon seems interested in protecting the state's economy -- and making history.
"We just got a report that unemployment in this state is 2.4 percent," he said. "The economy is booming, and I am certain that a large part of that is new technology. I want it to keep going."
But, he added: "I suspect before our lives are over we will look back at this as the time when the ground rules are set for these industries. It could get rough; there's lots at stake here. But this could indeed be one of the most important cases of the next century."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Agrees on Spending Bill That Faces Veto Threat

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
Republicans in the House and Senate agreed tonight to a bill providing nearly $6 billion in emergency relief to disaster victims as well as money to maintain American troops in Bosnia and the Middle East. Both houses are expected to approve the bill on Thursday.
But the agreement included no money for the International Monetary Fund or the United Nations, a situation that led the Clinton Administration today to threaten to veto the spending bill. 
 "It's out," said Representative Robert L. Livingston, chairman of the Appropriations Committee and leader on the House side of the conference. "It's not going to happen."
The Senate had approved the $18 billion I.M.F. funding by a vote of 84 to 16, but senators at today's conference could not prevail on the House to change course. "The House is adamant," said Senator Ted Stevens, the Alaska Republican who was chairman of the conference.
Franklin D. Raines, President Clinton's budget director, said in a letter to the House Appropriations Committee that money for the monetary fund and the United Nations was "imperative."
"Delay could leave us unable to protect American workers, farmers and businesses in the event of an escalation or spread of the Asian financial crisis or a new crisis," Mr. Raines wrote.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said in an interview that he had hoped the conference would at least offer part of the $18 billion request for the monetary fund as a "down payment."
Tonight, as word spread of the conference decision to exclude the monetary fund, Linda Ricci, a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget said: "We sent a clear message about a broad array of problems, and the next step is to see where this legislation winds up."
Still, Senator Stevens said he believed that the Administration's veto threat was not serious.
"The Presidents who were really worried about a veto have called me," he said. "I haven't had a call." He also predicted that Mr. Clinton would not veto a bill that would maintain troops overseas.
Mr. Livingston said the President was throwing a "tantrum" simply because he could not have his own way.
The conference of House and Senate members tangled throughout the day as they tried to hammer out a compromise between their differing versions of the emergency spending bill, a process made more complex as members loaded up the bill with extraneous items.
For several hours, the whole deal was on the verge of collapse because of a tense stand-off between House and Senate Republicans over flood relief money for a tiny town in southeast Alabama. (The request for $25 million was reduced to $5 million.)
By early evening, the conference members had resolved most of their differences, with the major exception of changes over student loan policy. Aides were to meet through the night to try to iron out their differences over the loans, which involve making interest rates more attractive to banks. The Administration worried that the bill could wind up subsidizing banks and balked at the changes.
With Republicans in control of both houses, the conference offered a glimpse into some of the philosophical differences that separate the more moderate Senate from the more conservative House. At the same time, it showed that some House conservatives were seeking to avoid another political showdown with the President, like the one that forced a partial Government shutdown in 1995.
The House, inspired by deficit hawks, had voted to offset all spending in the emergency bill with corresponding cuts in other domestic programs, including housing for the poor and unspent money for airport construction. The Senate had no such corresponding cuts. The conference agreed to the offsets only for non-defense items.
But they did not complain because they had won on other major areas in the final agreement -- chiefly, refusing to provide money for the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations.

HEADLINE: Legal Immigrants Attain Parity in Pay and Taxes

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

 BODY:
Legal immigrants in New York make more money and pay more taxes the longer they live here, and after 15 years of residence, they earn and pay more than natives. And their children grow up to earn just as much as other Americans, according to a new study of the incomes and taxes of immigrants in the state.
But even as legal immigrants move into the state's economic mainstream, paying roughly the same proportion of their income in taxes as natives, they also have higher rates of welfare use than natives, the researchers found. 
 Demographers at the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research organization in Washington, undertook their study, which will be released today, after Congress voted to reduce welfare benefits to legal immigrants in 1996. The study was financed by several nonprofit groups, including one created by the financier George Soros, an advocate for immigrants.
The study focuses on the contributions immigrants make to society in earnings and taxes, an approach that has prompted other scholars to criticize the findings for neglecting the costs associated with immigration in welfare, education and criminal justice expenditures.
"You want a cost-benefit analysis," said George J. Borjas, a professor of public policy at Harvard University. "This is just half the equation. It tells you what they pay, but not what they cost."
Jeffrey S. Passel, who conducted the study with Rebecca L. Clark, acknowledged that they examined only one side of the issue, but he said the findings are still crucial to answering the larger questions of whether immigrants, on balance, are good for the country economically, and whether the new restrictive welfare laws will help or hinder them as they try to succeed in the United States.
Research sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences that was published last year concluded that in New Jersey, households headed by natives paid $232 a year more in state and local taxes because of the presence of immigrants. In California, the comparable figure was $1,178 a year. Educating the children of immigrants was the greatest expense resulting from their presence in the country.
The Urban Institute study made no attempt to estimate the net cost of immigration to New York taxpayers.
For the first time, it broke down New York's population of nearly 3.4 million foreign-born residents by legal status. Of those, 1.4 million are legal immigrants who have not become citizens, 1.2 million are naturalized citizens, 200,000 are refugees, and 540,000 are illegal immigrants.
They found that New York's legal immigrants, including naturalized citizens, who make up 15.4 percent of the population, pay 15.2 percent of the taxes, a total of $17.8 billion in Federal, state and local taxes. About $7 out of every $10 they paid went to the Federal Government. Both immigrants and natives pay 30 percent of their income in taxes.
They estimated that legal immigrants earn slightly more on average than natives ($18,700 versus $18,100). Refugees had the lowest earnings, $8,300, and illegal immigrants made $12,100.
Immigrants generally had higher rates of welfare use than natives in 1995, 17 percent compared with 11 percent, before new Federal restrictions on welfare to legal immigrants were adopted.
Almost a quarter of households headed by legal immigrants who had not yet become citizens and 4 out of 10 refugee households received welfare. Among legal immigrants, only naturalized citizens had lower welfare use than natives, at about 8 percent.
Welfare was defined to include public assistance and Supplemental Security Income payments to poor people who were elderly or disabled. The Census data needed to evaluate the impact of new, more restrictive Federal welfare laws has not yet been released.
The New York Community Trust, the Robert Sterling Clark and Heron foundations and Mr. Soros's Emma Lazarus Fund paid for the $150,000 study, whose findings were largely drawn from data provided by the Census Bureau, the Internal Revenue Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
"It seems there's a fundamental unfairness that legal immigrants are paying taxes like everyone else, but are being treated differently in terms of benefits," Mr. Passel said.
He and Ms. Clark said their research provides no clear answers about the consequences of new welfare laws, but raises provocative questions.
They found, for example, that many refugees in New York, most of them from the former Soviet Union, are still dependent on welfare years after they entered the country. What will happen to them under new laws that end their eligibility for public assistance after five years and for Supplemental Security Income after seven years unless they become citizens?
And, they ask, what will be the effect of laws that more sharply restrict the access to welfare for new legal immigrants in their early years in the country, when their incomes are lowest?
"We observed fantastic income growth among legal immigrants during their first 10 or 15 years in the country," Ms. Clark said. "The question is whether the new restrictions on welfare benefits will be a kick in the pants or a kick in the head for legal immigrants. Will they prod immigrants to do better? Or leave them worse off?"
In measuring the costs and benefits of legal immigration, they said, it is crucial that researchers develop ways to separate legal immigrants from other types of foreign-born residents. Legal immigrants should be considered separately from refugees, who are admitted for humanitarian reasons without regard to their economic potential and have much higher rates of welfare use, or with illegal immigrants, who have much lower rates of compliance with income tax laws.
The Census data that most researchers use as the basis of their inquiries do not subdivide immigrants by their legal status, and earlier research has inadequately distinguished among different types of immigrants, the Urban Institute researchers said.

HEADLINE: Another Blow to Miami: Knight Ridder's Move

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, April 29

 BODY:
Knight Ridder's plan to move its corporate headquarters from here to Northern California will have little economic impact on Miami but has nonetheless delivered a symbolic blow to a city trying to recover from an image hewn in recent years by corruption, financial trouble and voter fraud.
Knight Ridder, the nation's second-largest newspaper publisher after the Gannett Company and one of the few Fortune 500 corporations based in Miami, announced on Tuesday that it would reduce its staff and shift about 45 corporate employees to the San Jose area within the next year. 
 P. Anthony Ridder, the chairman and chief executive of Knight Ridder, said that the Internet had created both new competition and opportunity for newspapers and that "Knight Ridder people simply must be immersed in the kind of futuristic and entrepreneurial thinking found in Silicon Valley."
"Our hope is that by being out there and being involved in activities there, when ideas are being formed, we will be on the ground floor so we can be moving faster than anybody else," Mr. Ridder said today in an interview.
Miami-Dade County officials characterized the economic impact of the move as minimal. Knight Ridder, which made profits of $413 million last year, is leaving about 175 employees behind in two centers that handle accounting operations and telephone calls for its newspapers. And two of the company's newspapers remain here: The Miami Herald and El Nuevo Herald, with a combined work force of more than 2,000 people, or about 10 percent of Knight Ridder employees.
The move affects only about 150 of the company's top officials and corporate employees, about a third of whom will go to California. Others are expected to continue corporate functions here or be placed with other Knight Ridder properties, although an undetermined number of employees will probably lose their jobs, Mr. Ridder said.
Miami officials said Knight Ridder's departure was a huge psychological loss. They said it robbed the area of prestige and credibility at a time when the area is it saddled with an unemployment rate of 6.7 percent and is trying to lure companies and promote itself as an international business center.
Still, Knight Ridder, a presence here since the merger of Knight Newspapers and Ridder Publications in the 1970's, was praised today as an unmatched corporate leader that contributes more than $1 million to charity each year and that has taken an active role in civic affairs.
Today, Mr. Ridder said the company would continue to be a major donor to South Florida causes and would honor its commitments, including donating nearly $10 million in land and street improvements to a downtown revitalization plan that includes a new performing arts center.
Not everybody at Knight Ridder agreed with the relocation. Alvah H. Chapman Jr., a board member and former company chairman, cited hardship on the employees who must move.
Twenty civic, business and political leaders in the Miami area have scheduled a meeting with Mr. Ridder on Thursday for a fuller explanation.
"At this point, no one is convinced that you need to be in Silicon Valley to take advantage of the technology available today," said William Cullom, president of the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce.
In Silicon Valley, Knight Ridder owns The San Jose Mercury News and Knight Ridder New Media, its on-line research and development arm.
Mr. Ridder said that a Santa Clara County site for the new headquarters was being sought and that the move should take place within nine months.

HEADLINE: Mayor Seeks High Fees to Curb Cruises by Gambling Industry

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

 BODY:
After economic development officials spent months encouraging ship lines to offer gambling cruises off New York piers, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that the city would try to curtail the cruises by charging extremely high fees for them to operate from city piers.
The Mayor and his aides indicated that the move toward higher rents had a dual purpose: to curb the expansion of the gambling industry in the city and to allow the city to secure as big a share of the industry's profits as possible. 
 "We should extract for the people an enormous amount of money," Mr. Giuliani said at a news conference yesterday. "I'm a pro-business Mayor, not a pro-gambling Mayor."
Mr. Giuliani denied that his statements represented a turnaround. When the cruises began running from New York ports last year, the Mayor had expressed concerns that gambling cruises could be infiltrated by organized crime and vowed to place severe restrictions on them.
But after the city set up a Gambling Control Commission and the Mayor assigned Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington as the administration's point man on gambling, cruise operators sensed a friendlier environment and several came forward to seek permits to rent city piers.
But while responding to questions yesterday about the status of four new applications to operate gambling cruises from the city's ports, the Mayor reiterated his original concerns about the operations. "I don't believe this is good public policy -- offshore gambling -- because it isn't controllable enough," he said.
The Mayor insisted that his statements yesterday reflected no change of heart. "We're doing everything we can to limit it to the smallest amount that we have to deal with, which has always been my position," he said. "My position has always been that we should try to keep that to the bare minimum."
In a television interview in December, the Mayor said the city should keep the gambling operators under close scrutiny, and that the city "should extract a substantial amount of money for it that can be invested in the city."
Still, the city had not discouraged any cruise operators from applying, providing they could muster the $100,000 application fee set by the city's gambling commission and pass a rigorous background check. But in a meeting at City Hall about two weeks ago, when officials of the gambling commission told Mr. Giuliani that they were moving toward authorizing two more lines to begin cruises, the Mayor expressed reservations, said a city official who was present at the meeting, but who spoke on condition of anonymity.
There is currently only one cruise ship, the Superstar Capricorn, operating from the city. The ship, which is operated by Manhattan Cruises and began offering cruises into international waters on Jan. 28, pays $400,000 a year to depart from a city-owned dock at 12th Avenue and West 55th Street. The line carries about 450 passengers each weeknight and 750 each weekend night.
Mickey Brown, the president of Manhattan Cruises, responded calmly to the Mayor's comments. "We have been treated fairly since we started this business," he said, "and I'm very confident we will continue to be treated fairly. It's reasonable for the city to expect to get the maximum benefit out of the business."
Jack Deacy, a spokesman for the Mayor, said that was precisely what the city was planning.
"We have not absolutely ruled out the use of city piers for use by these gaming ships," Mr. Deacy said. "But we would require a great deal of money for rental of these piers should we decide to make them available, and the arrangements we have now are under review."
Mr. Deacy said the exact rental figure had not been determined.
Six companies, including Manhattan Cruises, have applied for new permits. Mr. Deacy said the Gambling Control Commission was continuing background checks, and added that any new operators could expect to pay much higher rent than that paid by Manhattan Cruises.

HEADLINE: Lilco Is to Stop Selling Credits to Upwind Polluters

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 29

 BODY:
In a move that could help reduce the amount of air pollution that drifts from Midwestern and Southern states to New York, the Long Island Lighting Company announced today that it would stop selling pollution credits it earned by cleaning its own smokestacks to polluters in those states.
The decision, coming at the urging of New York State, underscores a limitation of a major strategy enshrined in the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act: that marketplace trading of the right to pollute is an inexpensive way of cleaning up the environment without setting inflexible Government rules. But as New York State and its neighbors have learned, the marketplace cannot stop the wind from blowing pollution eastward. 
 Under the act, any company that cut its emissions below Federal standards could earn pollution credits that it could then sell to other companies that were having a hard time meeting those standards. Thus, the companies that did improve would be rewarded for doing it, while the laggards had to, in essence, buy the right to keep polluting.
But environmentally sensitive areas like the Adirondacks and the Catskills have suffered immensely under the free-market approach, experts say, as major polluters in the South and the Middle West have found it cheaper to buy pollution credits instead of cutting toxic emissions that eventually blow back into New York and contribute to its acid rain problem.
The move by Lilco marks the first time a company has agreed to tailor the sales of its pollution credits to prevent them from falling into the hands of out-of-state polluters whose emissions might harm the company's home state, according to environmental experts and state officials.
Even so, there is no guarantee that the move by Lilco will reduce pollution or acid rain in New York State, since polluters in the South and the Midwest could turn to other companies to buy the credits. But experts say Lilco's move reduces their flexibility in gathering credits and may force them to purchase credits in smaller parcels from many different companies.
The move represents a striking reversal for Lilco, which has been harshly criticized in recent years for selling hundreds of thousands of pollution credits to dozens of utilities and coal companies scattered throughout states that are upwind of New York, including West Virginia, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Kentucky and Indiana.
The decision is also significant because Lilco is among the most aggressive sellers of pollution credits in the state, state officials say.
The company has sold 260,000 credits since 1994, the vast majority of them going to polluters in the upwind states. The credits cost about $140 each and allow polluters to emit one ton of sulfur dioxide, a major contributor to acid rain and smog. Lilco's credits account for about one-half of one percent of all the sulfur dioxide emitted in the United States.
Lilco estimates that it would be entitled to 1.2 million credits over the next 30 years.
The announcement today was hailed as a victory by state officials and environmentalists. They said it ought to send a strong message to Federal officials that pollution-credit trading has allowed utilities in regions like the Midwest to continue burning high-sulfur coal at the expense of states like New York that have laws and regulations forcing such companies to reduce their own emissions.
"This is a principled act on behalf of Lilco," said John P. Cahill, the State Commissioner of Environmental Conservation. "This is the first time in the nation that any state has acted on the recognition that these trades create regional inequities." John F. Sheehan, spokesman for the Adirondack Council, said the agreement was particularly important because it could help reduce acid rain in environmentally fragile areas like the Adirondacks. He noted that state and Federal officials estimate that by the year 2040, nearly half of that region's 2,800 lakes and ponds will be too acidic to sustain the fishes and plants that now live in them if the acid rain problem persists unabated.
"This is a significant deal because Lilco is a major player in the pollution credit market," he said.
But even as environmental groups praised the deal, they insisted that it did not diminish the need for either Federal or state legislation that would prevent pollution-credit sales that help polluters in one region at the expense of another.
"This is a Band-Aid approach that doesn't address the larger problem," said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat who is chairman of the environmental conservation committee. "There is still a need to pass legislation that regulates the other utilities."
The pollution-credit trading system was approved by Congress at the urging of economists and some environmentalists, who said it would improve efficiency in pollution reduction. The intent is to encourage that reductions be made in the cheapest way possible while not affecting the amount of emission reduction nationwide.
The act gave Lilco a windfall because a New York State law had forced it to reduce emissions in the 1980's to levels below what the Federal law requires. As a result, Lilco has 70,000 pollution-credit allowances a year to sell.
Under the deal announced today, Lilco would not sell credits to companies in 10 Southern and Midwestern states. They are Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana and Wisconsin. Nor would Lilco be allowed to sell credits to companies in New York and four nearby states, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware, according to the deal.
The deal also contains a provision that would prohibit any company that does buy credits from Lilco from turning around and selling those credits to polluters in states that Lilco is not permitted to trade with directly.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Plans to Bypass Referendum on Stadium Financing

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani plans to summon little-known powers granted to him by the City Charter to block any attempts to hold a referendum on the future home of the New York Yankees, an aide to the Mayor said last night.
The Mayor's effort, which the aide said he would announce this afternoon, is intended to thwart plans by Peter F. Vallone, the City Council Speaker, to insert a question on the November ballot about whether the City Charter should be amended to prevent city funds from being used to build a stadium for the Yankees outside the Bronx. 
 While the Mayor has said he wants the Yankees to stay in the Bronx, his administration has been trying to build support for a stadium on the West Side of Manhattan.
The mayoral aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Giuliani's charter plan would work this way: He would convene a charter-revision commission and instruct it to develop a charter-related question to place on the November ballot. According to the City Charter, the aide said, "the Mayor's question takes precedence over any other."
Last week, Mr. Vallone said he would do "whatever is necessary and responsible to keep the Yankees in the Bronx." He also said that the taxpayers had to decide whether city money should go toward building a new stadium.
"I believe that we need to hear from the taxpayers before we sink a billion dollars into a new stadium in Manhattan," Mr. Vallone had said.
 Mr. Vallone had proposed his Charter plan to answer a public outcry over the possibility of moving the Yankees out of the Bronx. The team's principal owner, George M. Steinbrenner 3d, has expressed strong dissatisfaction with the Yankees' current home, especially after a fallen slab of steel forced the stadium to close for nearly two weeks.
Aides to Mr. Vallone said they were researching last night whether they could petition to get a Charter referendum on the November ballot, in addition to one posed by Mr. Giuliani. And Mr. Vallone himself vowed that the Mayor would not succeed. "For every move there is a countermove, and we will deal with it," the Speaker said.
Just last month, the Speaker and the Mayor were nearing another political showdown over revisions to the City Charter. But they agreed to a truce and disbanded their plans for separate charter-revision commissions, saying they would work together to change the charter as they saw fit.
The Speaker has repeatedly complained that the last charter revision, in 1989, failed to fully spell out the Council's powers after the Board of Estimate was disbanded, and that the lack of clarity had led to a series of lawsuits between the Council and the Mayor.
Although the revision led to a concentration of power in the Mayor's hands, the Council still has some say in the spending of public money and in land-use questions.
The city's Independent Budget Office, which is nonpartisan, also plans to announce today an 18-page study concluding that building a new stadium for the Yankees or Mets would have limited economic and fiscal benefits for the city.
"While the limited economic benefits that would likely materialize may justify some expenditure of public funds," Ronnie Lowenstein, the office's chief economist, said in a statement, "very substantial contributions from private sources -- primarily the teams -- would be required to make the new stadiums a fiscal winner for New York City."

HEADLINE: On-Line Trail to an Off-Line Killing

BYLINE: By AMY HARMON 

DATELINE: BOWMAN, N.D., April 28

 BODY:
For nearly a year, Elisa DeCarlo had been logging on to the Internet daily to type messages to an on-line support group about her battle against alcohol. It did not matter that Ms. DeCarlo did not know where most of the 200 or so other members of the group lived, or even their names. All that mattered was that they were there for her, and she for them, in a fight that some days sapped all of her strength and sense of humor.
But on a Monday morning, March 23, sitting in her usual bathrobe attire, drinking her usual cup of coffee as she scrolled through the previous day's E-mail, Ms. DeCarlo, a 38-year-old comedian in Manhattan, lost faith in her virtual community, she said in an interview. Along with the typical postings from members about their weekends was a message from a man she knew as Larry. In graphic detail, Larry described how in 1995 he killed his 5-year-old daughter, Amanda, here in the southwestern corner of North Dakota. 
 In the message, posted at 12:50 P.M. on March 22, Larry recounted how, distraught at the end of a bitter custody dispute with his ex-wife, he had set fire to his home and trapped his daughter inside.
"The conflict was tearing me apart, and the next night I let her watch the videos she loved all evening, and when she was asleep I got wickedly drunk, set our house on fire, went to bed, listened to her scream twice, climbed out the window and set about putting on a show of shock, surprise and grief to remove culpability from myself," Larry wrote, according to archives of the support group's E-mail, available to any member on the Internet.
"Dammit, part of that show was climbing in her window and grabbing her pajamas, then hearing her breathe and dropping her where she was so she could die and rid me of her mother's interferences."
Ms. DeCarlo said she was horrified by the E-mail message, but she grew further dismayed over the on-line debate that followed. While some members of the group were appalled by Larry's account, others rushed to his defense, trying to assure him that he was experiencing a fantasy driven by guilt over his divorce. Others tried to comfort him by telling him the crime was long past.
It seemed to Ms. DeCarlo that the nature of on-line communication -- which creates a psychological as well as physical distance between participants -- was causing her friends to forget their off-line responsibilities to bring a confessed murderer to justice.
On March 24, amid an E-mail debate known as a flame war, Ms. DeCarlo was one of three members of the support group to notify the authorities.
The police here in Bowman said Larry Froistad, a 29-year-old computer programmer living in San Diego, called them on March 27 and confessed. Mr. Froistad has since been extradited to Bowman, a town of about 1,800 people, and he is scheduled to be arraigned on murder charges on Friday. The courthouse is a few blocks from the slab of concrete and rusted plumbing that is all that remains of the house where his daughter died in a 1995 fire that was ruled accidental.
Vincent Ross, Mr. Froistad's lawyer, said his client would plead not guilty. Mr. Ross said Mr. Froistad, who worked for the Sony Corporation, might have been taking antidepressants at the time of the March 22 posting on the Internet. Mr. Ross suggested that he might dispute the validity of the E-mail and challenge its use as evidence.
"Any statements that Mr. Froistad allegedly made have to be taken in light of his mental condition," Mr. Ross said, "and certainly there is no evidence that Mr. Froistad killed his daughter."
For many of those who knew Mr. Froistad through the ether, his unbidden declaration is testimony to cyberspace's singular capacity to invoke trust among strangers. But the E-mail transcripts in the wake of the confession also provide a glimpse into the interpersonal and moral predicaments raised at a time when an increasing amount of social interaction is taking place in electronic arenas, devoid of cues like tone of voice and facial expression, and structured around their own sets of rules and mores.
"My position here is that we, as a list, have two responsibilities here -- to ourselves as members of this list community and to the larger community beyond," read an E-mail on March 26 by Frederick Rotgers, a psychologist who helped found the support group two years ago.
"That may sound radical to some, but I believe it is an essential feature of the Internet, and one that we must protect if it is to continue to be a source of great support for people who are in need."
Dr. Rotgers said he had not notified the law-enforcement authorities after being informed that someone else in the group already had, because "since the child was already 'dead' no purpose would be served in the form of protecting anyone for rash, emotional and poorly thought-out action."
 
Self-Help Group For Problem Drinkers
 Dr. Rotgers administers the group, known as the M.M. List, as a volunteer for Moderation Management, a nonprofit self-help organization based in Woodinville, Wash., for people who consider themselves problem drinkers but not alcoholics. He is director of the program for Addictions, Consultation and Treatment at Rutgers University.
Rather than turn Larry over to the police, Dr. Rotgers said he had sent private E-mail to him with referrals to therapists near San Diego.
"I had no basis for knowing whether it was true or not," he said in an interview. "Neither did anyone else on the list."
Many on the M.M. List said they believed that Larry was simply expressing his desire to be punished for surviving a horrible accident. Perhaps, as he himself suggested in later postings and then discounted, he had unconsciously invented a false memory. Others said he might have done it, but that their role as a support group was not to judge. The few who disagreed became the target of often vicious "flame" attacks.
On the evening of March 22, a few hours after Larry's initial posting, one participant wrote: "Oh, man, you are really challenging me. It would be O.K. if you would just go away. This is just repulsive stuff and I just can't deal with you. I personally will not read a post by you again. You do not deserve anything!"
Someone else quickly responded: "To me, YOUR post is completely unacceptable, especially in this forum. I am repulsed by YOUR post."
Jim Shirk, of Bremerton, Wash., said he had notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation. When news of Larry's arrest reached the group, one member called for the informers to come forward. Mr. Shirk, 59, who said he had been sober for 19 years and is a licensed chemical-dependency counselor, sent the member a private E-mail explaining his desire to remain anonymous.
Instead, the member posted the E-mail to the whole list, and sent Mr. Shirk private E-mail back: "Just how big a pervert are you? I bet you really get off talking to the F.B.I. Wow. Did you ask them if you could see their guns?"
Others accused Mr. Shirk, a proponent of the Alcoholics Anonymous approach to treating addiction, which calls for total abstinence, of using the incident to tarnish the reputation of Moderation Management.
"You get a gut feeling for what's real and what isn't and it struck me as very frightening," Mr. Shirk said in a phone interview. "What really scared me was the part after he described everything he did, where he says he wants another family. I felt both professionally ethically and personally ethically that I had to do something."
Some members simply wanted to get back to the purpose of the group.
"Can we please talk about drinking? I need your help here," read one posting a week into the exchange.
 
Illusory Anonymity Is Seen on Internet
Some longtime Internet users have been communing in disembodied form for years, with the ups and downs any real-life communities naturally experience. On-line services like Echo Communications in New York and The WELL in Sausalito, Calif., which serve as gathering places for hundreds of discussion topics have weathered many a flame war, as have Internet news groups.
"You do not transform when you log on," said Stacy Horn, author of "Cyberville" (Warner Books, 1998), a book about Echo, which she founded. Ms. Horn recalled that when one veteran member declared that he was a Nazi, and offended many others with his anti-Semitic postings, Ms. Horn required him to start his own topic area. People flocked there, virtually, to argue with him.
The Froistad case is not without its off-line version. In 1994, Paul Cox was convicted of manslaughter in the murder of a couple in Larchmont, N.Y. Members of an Alcoholics Anonymous group testified that Mr. Cox had told them that he thought he might have killed the couple in an alcohol-induced blackout in 1988.
Experts who study the sociology of cyberspace say the intersection of the confidentiality ethic of self-help groups, and the sometimes illusory anonymity of on-line communion, can make for particularly difficult situations. Among those in the M.M. support group, a frequent source of controversy has been that participants can drink and post simultaneously -- as many believe Larry was doing that Sunday. Spouses have been known to subscribe under a false name to maintain their privacy themselves or, some have said, to keep track of the other.
Yet the combination is also what has made the global computer network such a boon to people seeking support on a wide range of issues, from cancer patients to senior citizens to gay teen-agers.
"People will reveal more on-line than they might in person," said Sara Kiesler, a professor at the Institute for Human Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University. "Psychologically, economically and in every other way, it's cheap talk, people really enjoy it, and it feels safe too. You're just talking to the screen sometimes people get oblivious to the dangers and they say things they wouldn't have said otherwise."
That may or may not help explain the question that still looms in the minds of many of Larry Froistad's on-line and off-line friends.
"What I can't get out of the thing is why would a guy up and write something like that on the Internet?" said Rodney Redetzke, 35, a mechanic in Bowman who helped Mr. Froistad tear down the remains of his house after the fire.
While Bowman's police chief, Don Huso, reopened the investigation into the fire after hearing from Ms. DeCarlo, he did not issue an arrest warrant until Mr. Froistad called him directly five days after his disturbing Internet posting.
"He said, "Don, I set the fire,' " said Mr. Huso, whose only other contact with Mr. Froistad was several years ago when he had to tell him it was against city ordinances to raise rabbits in his backyard. "The memories I have of this is that I did it to destroy Amanda."
According to the E-mail transcripts and the criminal case file, Mr. Froistad called Mr. Huso the day after Dr. Rotgers, the psychologist, posted to the E-mail list that someone had gone to the police.
If convicted, Mr. Froistad faces life in prison.
 
Suspect Described As Introspective
Residents here remember him as an introspective computer enthusiast smarter than everyone else. In a town where any straying from the norm is regarded with a certain suspicion, neighbors described him as different. "Larry was the kind of guy you could ask him a question and he'd come back and answer you with another question," said Mr. Redetzke, the mechanic. 'My wife would always say, 'Larry, come down to our level!' "
The son of a Naval Reserve officer, Mr. Froistad also joined the Reserves after his divorce from his wife, Ann, in 1990. He returned to Bowman two years later and fought and gained custody of Amanda. The thick divorce file contains a report from a psychologist who interviewed Amanda in those years.
Reached in Rapid City, S.D., Ann, who has remarried, declined to comment on the case.
Among those in the M.M. support group, the furor has largely died down. Its postings are now from people seeking advice on how to get through their 30-day abstinence periods and querying the meaning of alcoholism.
Audrey Kishline, the founder of Moderation Management, said the group was considering not maintaining archives of the E-mail conversations, and issuing a more strongly worded notice to new subscribers that their words, once released on to the Internet, can never be considered completely confidential.
But Ms. DeCarlo, the comedian, said she now attended only face-to-face meetings of the chapter she leads in New York.
"Ultimately, we are alone," she said. "The closeness is for the most part illusory. If Larry walked into a room, I wouldn't know him. On line, they're just words on a screen.

Excerpts from E-mail between Larry Froistad and fellow members of Moderation Management, a support group for problem drinkers, as obtained from the group's archives. Idiosyncracies of capitalization and spelling are from the originals.
 
LARRY: 'AMANDA I MURDERED'
My God, there's something I haven't mentioned, but it's a very important part of the equation. The people I'm mourning the loss of, I've ejected from my life. Kitty had to endure my going to jail twice and being embarrassed in front of her parents. Amanda I murdered because her mother stood between us. . . .
 
ELISA: 'What DO YOU MEAN?'
Okay, Larry, what do you mean, you murdered your daughter? Is this emotional hyperbole or cold fact? And are you getting professional help? Worriedly, Elisa
 
LARRY: 'LIstened to her scream'
OK, it seems to me that there's a great deal of risk to this; my email can be traced, I've been wide open about my identity. But somehow I've unintentionally left the impression that I'm flailing myself for some sort of weird self-gratification. Maybe I do that to some extent. But when I talk about killing my daughter, there's no imaginative subcomponent.
 
I suffered for years trying to get custody of her after her mother divorced me. When I did, I still had to deal with her mother's constant attempts to take her back. I had the upper hand; in fact, her mother gave up her summer custody just before I killed Amanda. But I always felt that I was not in complete control. My mother told me that I was too hard on her, that I expected too much from her. When I brought her home from her mother's, I abandoned the rules I had set and let her do whatever she wanted--in fact my mother and grandmother visited the next day and she forgot that she was supposed to get dressed before receiving visitors. :) It really was very cute when she woke up and started to walk into our living room, buck-naked. I loved her for her willingness to be fun in simple ways. I would do anything to have her back; but the conflict was tearing me apart, and the next night I let her watch the videos she loved all evening, and when she was asleep I got wickedly drunk, set our house on fire, went to bed, listened to her scream twice, climbed out the window and set about putting on a show of shock, surprise and grief to remove culpability from myself.
 
Dammit, part of that show was climbing in her window and grabbing her pajamas, then hearing her breathe and dropping her where she was so she could die and rid me of her mother's interferences. Hearing her wheeze in the smoke which I could barely stand--looking at her bedroom door burning--these are things I can't forget.
 
Those last two screams that I tell everyone saved my life--they are wounds on my soul that I can't heal and that I'm sure I'm meant to carry with me. I am damaged goods, and as much as I feel I need the comfort of someone in my life that I can be good to, someone I can build a new family with--the simple fact is that I don't deserve those things and I'm meant to suffer a thousand times longer than my little girl did.
 
I cried like a baby in the emergency room at the hospital; I was very disappointed that I couldn't see her after they pulled her out of our house (where they took her before they carted me off); I was stunned and shocked the whole time they flew me down to Rapid City for observation and such, and I've been destroyed ever since. . . .
 
KAY: 'what you described does not sound rational'
 
Whew Larry -- I for one have been thinking about your post just after you wrote it and I happened to be on line. I guess I feel that I should say something -- even though I am not one that has been corresponding much with you recently but because I am a pediatrician and a mother.
 
I must admit to being a little confused in that I'm not sure, other than numbing the situation, what role that alcohol played in this. What you described does not sound rational -- even in drunkeness and I suspect, from what you said, you don't understand it a well either. -- obviously, you should have been prosecuted and managed not to be -- I would assume your ex-wife does not know this which makes your sharing with this group very very weighty I think.
But I think you do need something very specific for what has happened -- and I don't think this group is enough. What a very painful thing, in many many ways.
ELISA: 'Do the police know'
 
Okay, Larry, second question: do the police know you murdered your daughter?
 
FREDERICK: 'Think about contacting a therapist'
 
Larry, Several folks have sent me private emails expressing genuine concern over some of the stuff that you've posted very recently. They are concerned, that you might be contemplating suicide or other drastic, harmful and ultimately counterproductive actions aimed at dealing with what seems to have become for you an awful situation. I'm writing for all of the folks who wrote me offlist, and I believe for all of the folks on this list, to urge you to seriously think about contacting a therapist and working things through with yourself in a safe manner. Take care of yourself, my friend. And let us all know how things are going. The people here really care about you.
Larry: 'I'm sorry'
 
I'm sorry to everyone I hurt by my post. I certainly don't want to drive anyone away from the list, but I was hurting and continue to, and it's a BIG part of why I drink as much as I do. (pg. A30)

April Business Pace Slows

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Business activity in the New York region grew at a slower pace this month as manufacturing stalled, a survey of service and factory executives that was released yesterday showed.
The National Association of Purchasing Management-New York index declined in April to 52.6 after rising in March to 59.5. It was the first decrease in the index in three months. 
 A purchasing management index reading of 50 or more suggests the metropolitan New York economy is expanding. A reading below 50 signals weakness.
The index for factories in the New York region declined to 47.9 in April from 55.3 in March. It was the first drop below 50 for the manufacturing index since March 1997. The index for nonmanufacturers decreased to 53.1 in April from 59.9 in March.

Vallone Urges Favoritism For State Contracts

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
Unveiling a centerpiece of his economic plan as he runs for governor, Peter F. Vallone, the New York City Council Speaker, proposed yesterday that the city and the state favor contractors within the state when buying products and services.
At a news conference, Mr. Vallone, a Democrat, couched his presentation in statistics showing the state lagging the nation in economic growth, a point he has stressed in attacks on the record of Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, who insists the state's economy is booming. Mr. Vallone said the proposed contract favoritism "is a crucial first step to addressing a very serious problem." 
 New York City already has a law favoring contractors based in the city. Rather than saying the lowest realistic bid wins -- the rule that governments usually follow -- city law says a city-based company can win a contract while bidding up to 5 percent more than the low bidder.
Stephen Kagann, chief economist for the Governor, called it "an irrational, foolish proposal that would raise the cost of government, which would mean increased taxes and a loss of jobs."

Infant Mortality Rate Shows Steady Decline

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
The state's infant mortality rate declined in the most recent statistics available, continuing a nearly decadelong trend, a report released yesterday by a Newark-based children's advocacy group said.
In 1995, the rate was 6.7 infant deaths per 1,000 births, compared with 7.7 infant deaths per 1,000 births in 1994. 
 The number of infant mortality cases, in which children die up to a year after birth, also declined to 775 in 1995 from 910 in 1994, the Association for Children of New Jersey reported. There were 1,086 cases in 1990, the association reported.
The report also found that the number of mothers who did not receive any prenatal care declined by nearly 13 percent, and that the number of children receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children fell 17.6 percent in 1997.
Ciro Scalera, the executive director of the association said "the jury is still out" on the reasons behind the declines. If children are leaving the welfare rolls because the economy is good and their parents are getting jobs, he said, it is obviously good news. But he said that if they are getting off welfare because their parents were told they were no longer eligible for benefits, then children may be at risk.

SERIES: ISRAEL AT 50: Dissonant Jubilee

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, April 29

 BODY:
It has been the fashion among Israelis on this 50th anniversary of their state to feign indifference to the jubilee, and Israeli commentators have expended considerable ink in analyzing why.
They explain it as a reaction to the difficulty of celebrating when driving into a shopping mall still requires a security check, when unemployment is high, when the most bitter conflicts are no longer with the Arabs, but among Jews -- between believers and non-believers, between right and left, between messianic believers in settling the Land of Israel and those who would trade land for peace. 
 They note that after 50 years, there is still no peace. Dennis Ross, the indefatigable American mediator, is back in Israel for what seems the thousandth time, still searching for a way to extract the Oslo process from the thickening mud of mutual distrust, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu snarls defiantly, "I will not capitulate to the U.S."
Not surprisingly, this tangle of problems and passions is reflected in the variety of events and demonstrations for Independence Day, which began this evening with fireworks, rock concerts and parties around the country.
The director of the jubilee program, Doron Shmueli, banned any reference to the Oslo peace agreements from the official celebrations on Thursday, prompting loud protests from the left.
Reform and Conservative Jews plan to bring men and women to pray together at the Western Wall, in defiance of Orthodox strictures.
Right-wing Israelis plan to mark the anniversary by laying the cornerstone for the contentious Jewish housing project in Har Homa, in Arab-dominated eastern Jerusalem; left-wing forces are calling for mass demonstrations to oppose them.
All this might well explain why the Israelis are approaching their jubilee with a strong ambivalence.
Yet anyone who has lived in Israel also knows that complaining and self-searching are a venerable tradition among the Jews, long preceding their state. For every gripe, there is also a blue-and-white Israeli flag fluttering from a passing car or gracing a house. And when pressed, Israelis will acknowledge a profound pride verging on awe in which they hold the remarkable achievement -- many say miracle -- that is Israel today.
"Grumbling is an integral part of Israel's story," the historian Tom Segev wrote in the newspaper Haaretz. "But Israel at 50 seems to be one of the greatest success stories of the century."
In the same paper, the columnist Yoel Marcus presented a detailed list of the problems that drive Israelis to view themselves as "a poor, forlorn Samson."
"Nonetheless," he concluded, "we are still here, a small but devilishly clever nation, a small country with the soul of a superpower."
If there is indifference, argued Zeev Chafets, a columnist for The Jerusalem Report, it may well be toward the woefully mismanaged and politicized official program, and not the anniversary itself.
"Maturity, and not malaise, is the reason that people aren't fired up by the official jubilee festivities," he wrote. "Most Israelis are very proud of this remarkable country, and not a few of us are in love with it. On Independence Day, and throughout the year, we will celebrate Israel's 50th at the beach and in synagogues, at intimate dinner parties and outdoor rock concerts.
"We may even drop in on some official ceremony -- but don't count on it."
In interviews with men and women who remember that Friday afternoon of May 14, 1948, when David Ben-Gurion read out the declaration of independence in Tel Aviv, many were troubled by various aspects of the state that has evolved -- the bitter conflicts among Jews, the absence of peace.
But they were unanimous in voicing wonder that a people dispersed for 2,000 years in 140 countries, speaking 100 tongues, managed to return to their ancient homeland and to start speaking its ancient language.
"I didn't think that in 50 years we would have five million Hebrew-speaking people, with such industry, agriculture, research and development, nor that we would have five wars, and win them," said Shimon Peres, the former Prime Minister, who was at Ben-Gurion's side when the State was declared.
Only by looking past the daily crises and disputes is it possible to truly assess the magnitude of that feat.
From 600,000 embattled Jews in 1948, many traumatized survivors of a concerted effort to eradicate their people from the face of the earth, Israel has grown into a strong and prosperous country of almost 6 million. From a struggling patchwork of communal farms, it developed into a global power in high technology, with a per-capita income approaching that of some European countries. From a makeshift militia battling against enormous odds, it shaped a regional military superpower.
Even the founding legends have matured beyond recognition. The same northern swamps that were drained so the embattled pioneers could eke out a subsistence are now being refilled by a nation sufficiently prosperous to care for its ecology.
"It is a prophetic statement that Israel is an eternal people, and in the modern world you become an eternal people when you can argue with the language of power," noted Rabbi David Hartman, an American-born philosopher and director of the Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem.
"We have been around for 2,000 years in history, but as long as we were weak and homeless, you could ignore our living spiritual dignity. I don't want to get a Moral Man of the Year award -- dead. I want to be alive. That is what Israel is all about. It is the will of a people to be alive."
Yet if that part of the Zionist dream has succeeded, the other part, the achievement of "normalcy," of a place for a Hebrew state among the nations of the world, is far from complete. Israel still draws more attention and discussion than almost any other nation in the world, and "Middle East" remains a synonym for tension.
Half its borders are not fixed, and it is still formally at war with half its neighbors. Terror remains a constant threat. Iran is completing a new ballistic missile, and as the jubilee year began, Israelis lined up once again for gas masks and anti-anthrax serum against the threat of an Iraqi attack.
If Israel has become a refuge for Jews, it is not yet a magnet. Last year, only 1,800 Jews immigrated from the United States, and a troubling proportion of those who come prove to be extremists.
Though democratic rule has never been challenged, Israelis remain deeply divided whether their country is a "Jewish state," with the religious law and messianic ambitions that implies, or a "state for the Jews," a liberal democracy at peace with its neighbors. Meanwhile, the million-strong Arab minority remains a people apart.
A popular song in the Israeli Army some years ago addressed a series of questions to Theodor Herzl, the father of political Zionism a century ago, here addressed by his Hebrew name:
Wipe the dirt from your eyes, Binyamin Zeev,
 Place your hand on your heart, and tell me,
 Is this what you envisioned?
 Is this what you predicted?
 Is this what you wanted?
The notion of stepping back from the harsh physical work of building the state to ask some fundamental questions about its content and direction has come very much to the forefront now that Israelis no longer worry about being wiped off the map, or dying of thirst.
A historical documentary series prepared for the jubilee, "Tkuma," showed dramatic images of the Israelis' heroic struggles and achievements, but it also reminded them of the painful truth that their triumphant ingathering after centuries of dispersion also meant the dispossession of another people, the Palestinians, millions of whom still live as refugees, and for whom the creation of the Jewish State is mourned annually as the "Nakva," the "Catastrophe."
Gideon Rafael, 85, a founding member of the Israeli Foreign Ministry and a distinguished diplomat, said no one believed in 1948 that Israel would be have to fight five wars with the Arabs, and certainly not that after 50 years, there would still be tensions. In the early 1950's, Mr. Rafael recalled, he was appointed Israel's liaison with Arab states at the United Nations.
"I never thought that so early in my career I would land a lifetime job," he quipped. "None of us would have thought that the conflict would not be resolved 50 years later, not the wildest pessimists."
Nor would they have believed that the conflict with the Arabs could become so entwined with the conflict among the Jews.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by a religious nationalist who viewed any Jewish surrender of West Bank land as betrayal. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was elected six months later on the slogan that he was "good for the Jews," and his right-wing coalition has steadfastly resisted ceding any more territory.
The passion of this debate was starkly demonstrated at two gatherings this week commemorating Israel's fallen soldiers. In Tel Aviv on Tuesday, right-wing parents assailed the writer Yizhar Smilansky when he declared that there might be peace by now if Rabin had not been assassinated in 1995. Today, bereaved parents rebelled against the presence of the Deputy Housing Minister, Meir Porush, at a ceremony in Holon because as a member of an ultra-Orthodox party, he represents a constituency whose men do not serve in the Army.
To many Israelis, this battle of the left-wing and secular "Tel Aviv" against the nationalist and religious "Jerusalem" is a struggle for the soul and destiny of Israel.
At the extremes, the battle is shrill and sometimes vicious. To hear an adversary called a Nazi is no longer shocking; there are left-wing Israelis who murmur, "They had it coming" on hearing a settler was killed, while right-wing extremists have made a shrine of the tomb of Baruch Goldstein, the Brooklyn-born settler who massacred 29 Muslim worshipers in Hebron in 1994. Between these extremes, however, lie many distinct gradations and groupings, each with its own agenda.
Ultra-Orthodox "haredim" struggle to maintain the ghetto life of 19th-century shtetls in their crowded neighborhoods. The Orthodox Sephardic members of Shas fight for housing and jobs for their own, as do the Russian immigrants of Natan Sharansky's Israel B'Aliya party. Members of the Third Way party are largely interested in keeping the Golan Heights in Israeli hands. Religious nationalists seek every opportunity to conquer another hill in the West Bank, a struggle they view as God's mandate for His Chosen People.
However disparate these groups, both the last election and more recent polls confirm that they have coalesced into two broad camps. A poll taken earlier this month by the Teleseker organization asked respondents whether they perceived themselves more as Jews or as Israelis. The general population broke evenly, with a third defining themselves as "Jewish," a third as "Israeli" and a third as both. Not surprisingly, the poll found that the secular and left-wing tended to see themselves as Israelis, while the religious and the right defined themselves predominantly as Jews.
These divisions, to be sure, were always there. Mr. Rafael, the diplomat, recalled how the drafters of the declaration of independence battled over whether to invoke God until Moshe Sharett, the first Foreign Minister, found the compromise declared trust in "the Rock of Israel," leaving everyone free to decide whether this was "God" or collective Jewish wisdom.
Such improvisation has marked every intervening conflict. The solution to the current dispute over conversion between American Reform Jews and the Orthodox establishment in Israel, setting up joint schools but leaving actual conversion to the Orthodox, was the latest such compromise.
But contrary to the expectations of the early Israelis, newcomers have consistently resisted melding into a new Hebrew nation. On the contrary, people who viewed themselves simply as Jews in their former lands found that on arrival in Israel, they became "Ultra-Orthodox," or "Ashkenazi," or "Sephardic," "Russian," or, to the amazement of English-speaking Jews, "Anglo-Saxon."
Perhaps it was only natural that once all together, the differences they picked up in the centuries of separate existence would become more pronounced. And for a people that never distinguished between its religious and ethnic identity, defining a Jew throughout history as a member of the people and the religion, finding a way to separate religion and state without tearing the nation apart is a permanent challenge.
If it took Israel 50 years to build a potent army and a flourishing economy, resolving these contradictions is certain to take far, far longer. The trick will be to do it without breaking apart, without more assassinations.
"This is not temporary," said Aviezer Ravitzky, chairman of the Department of Jewish Thought at Hebrew University, who has written extensively on the conflict of state and religion. "My grandchildren will continue this cultural debate. The danger is that we don't speak a common language anymore. If my language is totally secular, and yours is totally religious, I don't know your pains anymore, I don't know where you're coming from anymore. We need a common language, to rebuild a common language."
Rabbi Hartman sums up: "For the first time, we are facing the real inner conflicts in the Jewish people. This is the challenge of the next 50 years. Can we build a living, powerful Jewish civilization that is not ghettoized, that appropriates the best of Western democratic values, tolerance, pluralism, freedom of conscience, and a political philosophy of treating the 'other' with dignity? That is the battle, and I am in that battle."
 
Israel at 50
 
These articles focus on facets of Israel as it nears the anniversary of its independence, proclaimed on May 14, 1948. This year under the Jewish calendar the anniversary falls on Friday, but it is being observed in Israel today to avoid violating the Sabbath. The series, which began on April 6, has examined the country's social diversity, the controversy surrounding a history television series, the transformation of the economy, the Palestinians, American views of Israel and an artists' project that highlighted the region's conflicts.
