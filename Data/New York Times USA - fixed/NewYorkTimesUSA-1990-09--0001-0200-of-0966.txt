HEADLINE: ECONOMISTS FAULT POPULATION FIGURE FOR NEW YORK CITY

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
Could a city that enjoyed its greatest economic boom since World War II, experienced a dizzying rise in housing prices, attracted the largest wave of immigration since the days of Ellis Island and seemed to grow more crowded in every conceivable way actually be smaller now than it was in 1980?
Economists in the city, perhaps demonstrating a rare degree of agreement, are hard pressed to reconcile the Census Bureau's preliminary finding that New York City lost 38,000 residents in 10 years with all the signs of vitality, renewal and growth that they have seen in the five boroughs during that time.
''This city had an unusually good decade,'' said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. ''This just doesn't match up with it.'' 
 
Bureau Expects Number to Rise
The Census Bureau's New York City population estimate of 7,033,179 is about 400,000 lower than estimates by the Regional Plan Association, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and the WEFA Group, an economic forecasting service; 800,000 lower than a New York University estimate, and about 1 million below the city's own calculation.
The bureau will not comment on its figure, other than to say it expects it to rise after the city submits block-by-block challenges. But as it stands now, the bureau's count is hard for economists to explain, given the axiom that jobs attract people.
After losing about 10 percent of its jobs and about 10 percent of its population in the 1970's, New York City reversed course and gained 370,000 jobs in the 1980's. Some were filled by suburbanites, of course, but if commuting increased in the beginning of the decade, the evidence suggests that it leveled off by the end. The Port Authority's chief economist, Rosemary Scanlon, said the city was actually sending some workers to the suburbs as reverse commuters as the decade closed.
 
Rise in Births
More women entered the work force during the 1980's, but economists still consider the large rise in employment in the city a persuasive indication of an underlying rise in population.
The census estimate also seems at odds with what Emanuel Tobier, a professor at the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University, said has been a 24 percent increase in births in the city from 1980 to 1988. That is twice the increase in the nation as a whole, he said, and reflects an echo of the baby boom as well as a wave of immigrants, many of them women of child-bearing age.
Spurred by the rise in births, Professor Tobier collected other statistics on deaths, public and private school enrollment and Social Security and Medicare enrollment and, using complex formulas and demographic trends, concluded that the city's population was 7,622,000 in 1987. Based on continuing increases in births, he said, he believed the city grew by about 70,000 in each of the next two years.
 
More Houses and Apartments
''It's a mystery,'' Professor Tobier said of the Census Bureau's lower population estimate. ''I don't know how it's going to come out.''
The bureau has not provided a borough-by-borough breakdown of its preliminary estimate, but some evidence suggests not only that there have been gains but also that they have been spread across the city.
For example, New York City added 50,000 units of housing from 1981 to 1987, according to the most recent city survey. Some 37,000 units were added between 1984 and 1987 - at a time, incidentally, when the vacancy rate barely rose. Brooklyn and Staten Island each added 11,000 new apartments or houses in those three years, but the other boroughs had increases, too.
And this was before the city's $5 billion housing rehabilitation program had produced any units and before a surge of new luxury construction at the end of the decade, encouraged by tax incentives and prosperity.
 
Other Statistics
There has also been a startling rise in housing prices during the decade, with cooperative and condominum apartments in Manhattan nearly doubling in cost, even with recent declines. Who bid them up? And in 1989, more than 22,000 first-time applicants for public housing gave a home address indicating that they already lived in public housing, presumably doubled up with other families.
Between 1978 and 1990, the city gained 84 office buildings and added 54 million square feet of space, according to the Real Estate Board of New York.
Subway ridership rose by 8.5 percent between 1982 and 1990, and motor vehicle registration in the city increased by 24 percent from 1980 to 1988.
Revenue from the city's personal income tax nearly tripled, from $879 million to $2.56 billion, in the 1980's, despite a tax cut during that time.
 
Difficulties in Urban Areas
In discussing the city's population, economists are usually quick to cite a flow of immigrants estimated at 100,000 a year during the 1980's. There has been concern that census enumerators missed large numbers of new settlers, many of whom lack proper documents and are reluctant to give information to Government workers.
Officials of cities across the country have long worried about the ability of census-takers to count urban areas accurately. In 1980, the bureau acknowledged that it missed 400,000 or so New Yorkers, but the city failed in a legal effort to compel the agency to make a correction. The city, joined by other cities and states and civic and civil rights groups, has a pending lawsuit that is seeking to compel the Census Bureau to adjust its final 1990 tally to correct for an undercount, based on results of a additional post-count survey.
Despite their longstanding anxiety and distrust of the Census Bureau, city officials, along with others, were startled by this week's preliminary estimate because it was 300,000 lower than the bureau's own interim 1988 estimate. Officials follow the figure closely because it determines Federal subsidies and House seats.
Mr. Ehrenhalt, noting that the Census Bureau's work had only begun, said a drop of 38,000 was ''not beyond the bounds of possibility,'' but added, ''I see great difficulties reconciling this with what we know about the city.''
New York City's economy weakened considerably after the stock market collapse of 1987, but employment held up reasonably well until last year. Even with problems like crime, drugs and a school system viewed warily by many residents, economists believe that it is unlikely that the city lost 300,000 people in just two years.
''There would be moving trucks everywhere,'' Ms. Scanlon said.

HEADLINE: MEDICARE FEE PLAN SENT TO CONGRESS

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
In what health officials called a major step toward overhauling Medicare's chaotic reimbursement system, the Secretary of Health and Human Services yesterday gave Congress a model national fee schedule for 1,400 commonly performed medical procedures.
The report by the Secretary, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, is the culmination of several years of Government effort to narrow the wide discrepancies in payments that doctors in different regions and different specialties receive from the Federal insurance plan for the elderly and disabled. Officials hope the new system will raise fees for primary-care doctors, whose services are felt to be undervalued, and in general reduce those for surgeons and other specialists for their procedures.
 
Scale of Relative Value
Dr. Sullivan's report was mandated last year when Congress directed the Department of Health and Human Services to develop a national fee schedule based on a ''relative-value scale'' that would take into account physicians' time, overhead and insurance expenses in the setting of fees. 
The report made public yesterday was a preliminary proposal for evaluation by Congress, physicians and others. A final version must be in place by Jan. 1, 1992, the deadline Congress has set for the new system.
There is no national fee standard now and each doctor's reimbursement is determined separately. Payments are based on the fees physicians charged two decades ago, with small incremental increases that in recent years have often not kept pace with inflation. As a result, doctors practicing in the same field and in the same building could receive different Medicare reimbursements for the same procedure because of historical differences in their fees.
Although the specifics of the model plan are tentative and certain to be substantially changed, ophthalmologists in most parts of the country would probably have their payments reduced for cataract operations with an artificial lens implant. In the Secretary's model, that service comes out to about $1,300, but the operation is now sometimes allotted more than $2,000 in doctor's fees.
For general practitioners seeing a new patient, the results would be mixed: a private doctor in Manhattan might find his reimbursement cut from a current rate of perhaps $150 to about $70, while his counterpart in rural Kentucky might find his payment raised from $50 or so.
''The national fee schedule will be the most wide-ranging and fundamental change in Medicare's physician payment system since the creation of the Medicare program in 1965,'' Dr. Sullivan said in a statement accompanying the report.
The Government's relative-value scale will apply only to reimbursement for Medicare patients, but health experts expect rates set in that manner to influence physicians' fees and payments in the private sector as well.
While health experts have expected a proposal for relative-value reimbursement for almost a year, Dr. Sullivan's model is expected to touch off an energetic debate about how the different medical services have been valued.
Dr. James S. Todd, executive vice president of the American Medical Association, said, ''There have been many many models in the past year but this is the first official one given to Congress to say grace over and the first official document that will be acted upon.'' The association has supported what Dr. Todd called ''the radical concept'' in a general way.
''It is the first step in rationalizing the way in which physicians are compensated by the Government,'' Dr. Todd said.
The new system involves ''value units'' assigned to each procedure or medical service based on a doctor's time, overhead and risk of malpractice suits. The total relative-value score is multiplied by a conversion factor in dollars to determine the payment for a visit.
For example, a comprehensive medical examination for a new patient earns 35.9 points for the primary-care doctor's time, 22.9 for overhead and 3 for malpractice risk, for a grand total of 61.8. A CAT scan of the abdomen earns 57.6 for the doctor's time, 146.9 for overhead (presumably based on the cost of the equipment) and 16.4 for malpractice, for a total of 220.9. A skin biopsy earns 25.5 time points, 17.8 in overhead and 1.0 in malpractice for a sum of 44.3.
 
Changes Are Foreseen
The conversion factor proposed in Dr. Sullivan's report is $1. While the report states that this number is ''not arbitrary,'' experts predict it will be modified as a result of the coming debate and must be set to assure that the total cost of the Medicare program does not change.
The 1,400 services listed in the new proposal include procedures from every major medical field except anesthesia and represent two-thirds of the annual outlay for Medicare. Values for the rest of the approximately 7,000 procedures will be set in coming months. The Government is still working on how to allot relative-value units to the anesthesiologist's time, a Federal spokesman said.
Federal health officials said they hoped the proposal would narrow the gap between the incomes of specialists and primary-care doctors as well as that between urban and rural doctors, many of whom are struggling because fees set long ago are extremely low.

HEADLINE: For Elderly Just Hanging On, An Oasis of Jobs Is Shrinking

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GRAND ISLAND, Neb., Aug. 25

 BODY:
''I'm what you call a displaced homemaker,'' said Doris Gibson, who is 66 years old and by any measure poor. She traces her poverty to the day 13 years ago when her husband walked out on her, and her survival to a Federal paycheck that will be harder and harder for future Doris Gibsons to get.
Mrs. Gibson is paid the minimum wage for helping to keep the books at an adult day care center in this placid community of 39,000 people that is no more an island than the state of Nebraska is.
She and her co-workers at the center, Irene Holroyd, 71, and Howard Tibbs, 77; and other people in similar straits like Helen Shultz, 61, a kitchen aide at Northwest High School here, and Dorothy Bernice Trout, 64, who does word processing at a nearby community college, are participants in a little-known public assistance program that is a rare survivor of Washington's antipoverty initiatives of the 1960's. #20 Hours of Community Work Through the Labor Department's Senior Citizen Community Service Employment Program, the neediest of able-bodied older people are paid $3.80 an hour for 20 hours of community service work a week. But as things now stand fewer people will be able to join the program because it is feeling the squeeze on the Federal budget. 
The Labor Department says the $367 million budgeted for this year will support jobs for 64,933 people nationwide, 865 fewer than last year. In the current budget deliberations, Congress is considering spending about $400 million next year. But because of increases in the hourly minimum wage, from $3.35 to $3.80 last April and to $4.25 next April, at least 4,000 more jobs would be dropped.
The jobs are with public agencies and nonprofit institutions; the program also provides training that permits about 20 percent to go on to regular jobs. Participants must be over 55 years old and have less than $10,525 a year in income, including Social Security, in the case of couples, or $7,850 if single. Both figures represent 125 percent of the federally calculated poverty line.
 
Only Neediest Need Apply
Almost 10 million older people meet the economic qualifications, so the law requires that the jobs go to the neediest among those who hear about the program and apply for it. The average age of participants is 68, one-third are over 70, and a few are past 90. Some are under 62, the age when people can start collecting pension benefits and Social Security.
The Labor Department distributes money to states largely according to their population. California, with $29.4 million, and New York, with $24.8 million, get the most, while Alaska, Hawaii and Delaware get the least, $1.6 million each. Nebraska gets $2.9 million.
Ten national organizations screen applicants and manage the program, among them the National Council of Senior Citizens, the American Association of Retired Persons and the National Urban League.
The agency that manages the biggest part of the program, however, is a lesser-known organization called Green Thumb Inc., which is getting $93.9 million of the $367 million this year. Green Thumb was originally founded by the National Farmers Union to steer retired farmers to government groundskeeping jobs. It now manages the program for 18,000 participants, two-thirds of them women, in the rural areas of 44 states. It supports 363 people in Nebraska.
 
Too Old for New Careers
Nationwide, a tight labor market has persuaded business to look to retirees as a new source of workers. But that trend offers little hope for the people who apply to Green Thumb. Many are too old to embark on new careers or work the standard 40-hour week. Many employers also balk at hiring old people for fear that their health will fail, pushing up insurance costs.
Some people here have been rescued by their twice-a-month $152 Federal paycheck, but that does not mean they all regard it as a godsend.
Most of the women never had jobs, or they left them ages ago to work at home rearing families. While many say they relish proving themselves in the workplace, they resent the turns of fate that forced them to go to work at a time of life when so many others are relaxing. And they say it is demeaning to learn that their homemaking skills are worth just the minimum wage.
 
An Array of Life's Problems 
Participants tell widely different stories of the circumstances that drove them into the program, but most involve deteriorating health or the loss of a spouse or sometimes both.
Mrs. Gibson's husband, Bob, was a traveling man, an agent for the Railway Express Agency, now defunct. ''He loved people,'' she said. ''He loved women.''
''He was going to Sioux City, Iowa,'' she recalled. Then the homebound mother of two young daughters, she said she told him: '' 'Eleanor and Leonard live there. Why don't you look them up?'
''He called the next night and said, 'I found Eleanor.' I said, 'What about Leonard?' 'Divorced 15 years,' he said.
 
I said, 'Uh-oh.' ''
Suddenly alone, poor, middle-aged and searching for work, Mrs. Gibson said, she found that no one could use her for the work skills that her husband had asked her to put aside a quarter century earlier. So, for several years, she did menial jobs in Grand Island nursing homes and took Government-subsidized courses to get the equivalent of a high school diploma.
Then three years ago, when she was hounding the local office of the state's job service, people there urged her to see Ada Miller, Green Thumb's area director. ''Ada said, 'How about an office job?' and I said I'd love it. At the center I do bookkeeping. I keep track of the volunteers - their hours and expenses - and then I have to write a check for them every month.''
 
Ailing Wife and the Janitor
The janitor at the day care center is Howard Tibbs, a spry, compact man with a full head of dark hair. He reared 10 children while operating an automobile repair shop at his home here for more than 50 years. Then his wife's poor health, and cataracts in both of his eyes, put his business on hold.
His wife, Eulalia, 71, came down with a degenerative disease 12 years ago. ''She fell through the screen door, and we laughed about it,'' Mr. Tibbs said. ''Gradually she went to a walker. After a while she couldn't do that. It's a little like Alzheimer's. I had them write it down.'' He took a physician's card from his wallet. ''Olivopontocerebellar degeneration,'' it says.
''I've been taking care of my wife most of the time,'' Mr. Tibbs said. ''Ain't nothing wrong with her mind, but her voice is gone. She can just barely move her head and hands. She's been in the hospital since the fifth of February. After I leave here, I go up there to the hospital and feed her every night.''
Her medical care is covered by Medicaid. For income, Mr. Tibbs said, ''I have Social Security, $380 a month. That's all I have besides this.'' He said he works from 12:30 to 4:30 P.M. five days a week at his Green Thumb job but comes earlier and stays later doing volunteer work there, like helping an old man with an artificial leg. ''He can't go to the bathroom unless it's off,'' he said. ''I take it off.''
 
Her Fortunes Crumbled
Dorothy Bernice Trout, whose only other income is a $455 monthly Social Security payment, says her fortunes crumbled with the loss of her husband, who was a diesel mechanic for trucks. ''He died in 1970 of Lou Gehrig's disease,'' she said. ''He was 45. We were raising three children. He had it for six years and it wiped us out. That's why I'm working. He was not a believer in life insurance.''
Mrs. Trout went to work for the first time at the age of 44, first as an editor and reporter for a small-town newspaper and later as an aide to a veterinarian. Now she has emphysema. Regular employers will not hire her for fear of becoming ensnared in her medical costs, she said, and she is only able to work part time. Thanks to the Federal program, she types course lessons into a word processor for instructors at Central Community College in Hastings, Neb., and does other clerical chores.
Delbert L. Niemeier, Green Thumb's director for Nebraska, said he has 34 active applications for the program. ''It's been going up over the last three years,'' he said. ''They lost the farm. They lost the spouse. They're desperate in the sense that they don't have enough to meet their obligations.''
Helen Shultz, the aide in the high school kitchen, never had a regular job. ''I was just a housewife,'' she said. ''I had nine children. They're 43 to 17. Men you see for jobs - they don't know what it is to run a house.''
''I've applied for other jobs and haven't gotten any,'' she said. ''Nobody bothered to call back.''
Mrs. Shultz's husband has retired from his job as a house builder, and all they had was his Social Security check of $517 a month when Green Thumb put her in the high school kitchen a year ago.
 
'Out With Other People'
''This job is the first time I've been out with other people,'' Mrs. Shultz said. ''I get the ice. I stack the cookies. I wash the tables after they eat. I took a home-care course and was certified. But I don't know if I'd like to take care of people who are terminally ill. I wanted to be around children. Happiness is children. I wanted to be around noise and activity.''
But even women with long work force experience, unlike Mrs. Shultz, and in good health, unlike Mrs. Trout, find they have to turn to the program. Irene Holroyd had three children and was divorced 22 years ago. She had run a bakery with her husband and then took a job as a dental technician.
Mrs. Holroyd retired at 65 but could not get by on her Social Security check of $393 a month, her sole income. ''I own my house,'' she said. ''I raise practically everything I eat. The insurances are what's bad.'' She spent weeks looking for work through the office of the state's job service here.
''They couldn't find anything because of my age,'' she said, so Mrs. Miller of Green Thumb found her a job at the day care center. ''Today I cooked oatmeal and fixed their breakfast,'' she said. ''I try to keep them busy, like playing cards with them or whatever they want to do. I do the dishes.''
But the days at work appear to be numbered for her co-worker Doris Gibson. Mr. Gibson never divorced her, and just before he died in April, he told their daughters of his railroad pension.
Mrs. Gibson said she should be getting the pension checks, $814 a month. She is glad for that, she said, but she expects it to put her beyond the limit for the work program and out of a job that means so much to her - the only job she was able to get.

HEADLINE: Mideast Crisis Puts New Spotlight On an Idle Oil Plant in California

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GAVIOTA, Calif., Aug. 31

 BODY:
After standing unused and mothballed for nearly three years on a desolate bluff over the central coast of California, the Gaviota Oil and Gas Plant here is emerging as a key element in the American response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
The plant was meant to receive and separate crude oil and gas from the Santa Maria basin off Point Arguello, where three offshore pumping platforms, also mothballed, are poised to tap into the largest domestic oil field to be discovered since Prudhoe Bay in Alaska in 1969. Oil experts say the field, with more than 300 million barrels of recoverable reserves, could produce nearly 100,000 barrels a day to replace some of the lost supplies from the Middle East.
But environmental objections and local politics have combined to thwart production in a complex dispute over whether the oil should be transported to gasoline refineries by tanker ship or by pipeline. And now, in an effort to mediate the dispute and get the oil flowing, the Federal Government is stepping in. 
In an interview in Washington on Thursday, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said the Point Arguello oil was considered a major part of a short-term strategy to raise domestic oil production. A team sent by Mr. Watkins conferred with company and local officials in Santa Barbara last week.
The plant, about 30 miles northwest of Santa Barbara, was completed in late 1987 but has remained idle since then for two reasons. First, the company could not complete plans for a direct pipeline to refineries in Los Angeles. And then the California Coastal Commission rejected plans to move the oil by tankers, citing environmental concerns.
So the plant, built at a cost of $2.5 billion, stands silent.
The Gaviota plant has emerged as a symbol to the oil industry and to its environmental foes of what is wrong with the nation's energy policy. The industry contends that overbearing local requirements have thwarted domestic oil production; environmentalists maintain that more drilling only promotes further energy profligacy at the risk of fragile ecologies.
The oil industry, led by the Chevron Corporation, leader of the 18-partner project, says the time has come to ease local environmental rules to permit the shipment of oil to refineries in Los Angeles at least temporarily by tanker, which would be faster and less costly than any of several pipelines that could serve as an alternative.
''This is the largest single nonproducing source of domestic oil that we can tap in the short term in the entire United States,'' said Richard T. Hughes, a lawyer for Chevron in San Francisco.
 
Memories of 1969 Blowout
Officials in Santa Barbara County, where memories of the 1969 Unocal blowout that fouled local beaches are still fresh, say they prefer pipelines as environmentally less risky and accuse the companies of using the Iraqi crisis to force their will.
''The oil companies see this as a window of opportunity to prove that local government is standing in the way of national interest,'' Thomas A. Rogers, chairman of the county board of supervisors, said in an interview.
Even under the best of circumstances, the Point Arguello field is not likely to start producing oil soon. Chevron has requested a permit to begin tanker operations but, after studies and hearings, it will not come up for a vote of the five supervisors until early November. If they permit the use of tankers to carry the oil, appeals by environmentalists could force further delays.
Moreover, even if a decision is made to begin production it will take six months just to prepare the mothballed plant here, said G. Michael Marcy, a Chevron spokesman. And it will take another six months to reach full production; the pumps at the plant are filled with special grease to preserve them while inactive, and the pipes are filled with inert nitrogen.
Robert D. Almy, deputy director of the county's Resource Management Department, estimates that it could take up to 15 months to reach peak production.
The county maintains that the oil could be shipped through the unused All-America Pipeline inland to Bakersfield, Calif., and transferred to other pipelines there to Los Angeles or to refineries in Texas. But Chevron says that because the Arguello oil is a heavy, low-grade crude these alternatives are either too costly or impractical.
The Point Arguello project is a decade-long story that has brought the political conflict between energy development and environmentalism to its sharpest point.
 
Three Platforms Built
Chevron and its partners bought leases in Federal waters in 1979 and struck oil in 1981. Two platforms, Hermosa and Hildago, were built by Chevron, and another, Harvest, by Texaco Inc., but they have been capped for five years amid a dispute over how to bring the oil to the refineries.
In 1984 the county supervisors approved the Gaviota plant on the condition that it ship the oil by pipeline to the Chevron refinery in El Segundo, near Los Angeles.
The plant here is designed to separate propane, gas, sulfur and other products from the oil before shipping the remaining crude to gasoline refineries. Two buried pipelines would carry the oil and gas from the platforms, about 10 miles offshore, to the plant. These pipelines, which were completed in 1987, are not a matter of dispute.
Mr. Marcy, the Chevron spokesman, said that the plans had gone through 44 permitting agencies and that the company agreed to 165 conditions imposed by the county, including planting thousands of eucalyptus and pepper trees to try to hide the plant from U.S. 101, and to preserve a nearby monarch butterfly habitat.
''We have agreed to hundreds of mitigations,'' he said. ''We are close to the point where we cannot do anymore.''
Sam Davis, the plant manager, said the partners are spending $3 million a month just to maintain the unused plant.
 
Interim Permit Sought
Plans to build a special pipeline to Los Angeles were dropped in 1987 because of political opposition from Los Angeles and other cities along the pipeline route. The company then asked the county for an interim permit to move oil by tanker. That was approved in May 1989, but it was revoked on appeal by the California Coastal Commission, a state agency, on the ground that the oil companies had not made adequate precautions to clean up any spills.
''We tried to make a pipeline and we were stopped,'' Mr. Marcy said. He added that Chevron was exploring plans to have a pipelilne built along railroad tracks that pass the plant and extend 120 miles to Los Angeles. That would be he shortest route, but it would take more than two years to build. In the interim, the company wants to ship the oil by tanker.
Political opposition to oil drilling along the central coast of California is fierce. Henry Feniger, president of Get Oil Out, a 20-year-old group formed after the 1969 blowout, said the solution was not drilling oil but saving oil.
Asserting that his group was ''opposed to oil drilling as a way to solve domestic energy problems,'' Mr. Feniger said: ''We do not have an energy policy. We like to waste on the one hand and exploit on the other.''
Even so, since the offshore wells are already drilled here, Mr. Feniger and county officials are reconciled to having it shipped through Santa Barbara by way of a pipeline.
''If Chevron decided to ship by pipes we'd help them,'' said Mr. Almy, the county resource management official.
Mr. Rogers, the supervisors' chairman, said there were two feasible pipeline alternatives. One is the heated All-America Pipeline, which runs just behind the Gaviota plant to Texas; the other runs to Los Angeles by a connection to the Four Corners pipeline at Bakersfield.
Mr. Rogers said either of these would cost only $1.50 more a barrel than tanker shipping, a cost that he said was ''dwarfed'' by the recent increase in oil prices.
Given the low quality of the Arguello crude, Mr. Marcy of Chevron said, both alternatives were economically impractical. In particular, he said, the ''Rube Goldberg'' connection at Bakersfield would require the crude to be diluted with a lighter oil because the pipeline leg to Los Angeles was not heated.
 
Pipeline Plan Termed Costly
This would mean 50,000 fewer barrels of Arguello crude would reach the refineries and would ultimately add nearly $1 billion to the overall cost of the project, he said. The companies estimate that shipping by pipeline would cost $5 a barrel, compared with $1.80 a barrel by tanker.
The Federal Government's role in efforts to solve the controversy is unclear. Environmentalists here have suggested that oil company lobbyists in Washington interceded with Secretary Watkins to put pressure on the local government.
Chevron has issued a statement saying it was the Energy Department that approached the oil partners and that ''we have no interests in circumventing the county process.''
In a letter to Mr. Rogers on Aug. 15, Mr. Watkins wrote that the Point Arguello oil could have a ''significant impact'' on ''our overdependence upon insecure foreign sources'' and that he hoped his general counsel, Stephen Wakefield, could serve as an ''intermediary.''
Under the county's zoning ordinances, Chevron can request a waiver from its pipeline commitment by proving that there is a national emergency, or that the available pipeline has inadequate capacity or that the pipeline costs are ''unreasonable,'' taking into account alternative transportation costs and environmental effects.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
U.S. READY TO SEND ISRAELIS NEW ARMS AS SIGNAL TO IRAQ

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
The Bush Administration is preparing to transfer as much as $1 billion worth of advanced weapons to Israel to buttress the country's defenses against Iraq and address Israeli concerns about recent arms sales to Saudi Arabia, Administration officials said today.
Officials said the promise of advanced weaponry to Israel is intended to send a clear signal to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq that the United States intends to stand by its main Middle East ally.
Israel, while keeping a low profile in the Persian Gulf crisis, has placed its military on heightened alert. Israeli and American officials have warned that Iraq, in an effort to shatter Arab opposition to the invasion of Kuwait, might try to draw Israel into the Middle East conflict through a direct missile attack against Israel or by moving military forces into Jordan. 
 
Military Balance in Mideast
Aside from worry over the possibility of an Iraqi attack, Israel and its American supporters see a need to offset the new arms sales to Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other Arab countries, which they believe could alter the military balance in the Middle East.
American and Israeli officials are still negotiating final details of the arms package, which could include the delivery of F-15 and F-16 fighter planes, Patriot ground-to-air missiles that can be used to intercept incoming missiles, M-60 battle tanks and Apache tank-killing helicopters, largely from United States stockpiles in Europe.
The idea for additional aid originated with the Israelis and has been approved in principle by the Defense Department and top national security officials at the White House, Administration officials said. The details and timing of arms deliveries remain to be worked out, with both sides hoping to begin the transfer of some weapons as soon as possible. Officials said the value of the transfer could range from several hundred million dollars to about $1 billion.
 
Apart From $1.8 Billion
The transfer of weapons, through leases or sales, would come on top of $1.8 billion in American military assistance to Israel planned for this year before the Persian Gulf crisis developed.
Administration officials in recent days have reaffirmed to leaders of American Jewish groups and members of Congress the longstanding American commitment to maintain Israel's military advantage in the Middle East.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney met last week with leaders of Jewish groups, and this week a delegation of Israeli military officials, led by David Ivry, the Director General of the Israeli Defense Ministry, traveled to Washington to discuss additional American military aid with the State Department and Defense Department.
Washington's relations with Israel have been relatively smooth during the gulf crisis, American and Israeli officials say. Israel has been responsive to American requests that it not become directly involved in the conflict, or take any pre-emptive action against Iraq. Washington, in turn, made clear that it was willing to consider added military aid to Israel.
The crisis has deflected attention from the impasse that had been developing between the Administration and Jerusalem over the Israeli Government's reluctance to open a dialogue with the Palestinians on the basis of a compromise formula proposed last spring by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d.
To bolster Saudi Arabia against a possible attack from Iraq, the Administration announced this week that it would make an emergency sale of $2.2 billion worth of weapons to Riyadh, including 24 F-15 fighter planes, 150 M-60 tanks and 200 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. In addition, Pentagon officials said the United States would probably sell the Saudis another 24 F-15's early next year.
''The White House and State Department called to say they recognized an imbalance was occurring and that some form of additional weaponry for Israel would be found to remedy that,'' said Senator Rudy Boschwitz, Republican of Minnesota.
 
'Shifting Alliances'
One leader of an American Jewish group, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said: ''Arms to the Saudis pose a real dilemma for the Jewish community. On the one hand Saudi Arabia has legitimate defense needs right now. But this latest package constitutes a clear threat to Israel in the long run. No one knows what will happen to Saudi Arabia in the future. Middle East politics is made up of shifting alliances.''
Several hurdles must still be cleared to complete the proposed arms deal. One problem is matching the list of weapons that Israel wants with what the United States can afford to give up.
 
Soviet Talks May Free Tanks
The Pentagon, for example, expects to have surplus M-60 tanks once arms control talks with the Soviet Union are concluded. The available tanks, however, are an older version of the model the Israelis would like, and would not be available for several months.
In addition, the United States has already earmarked surplus F-15's and F-16's to other nations, including Morocco and the Philippines, as well to reserve units in the United States.
Israel's principal requests include Patriot ground-to-air missiles to counter enemy missiles, and top-of-the-line fighter planes to protect Israel in a multi-front air attack.
Financial terms are also under discussion. Israel cannot afford to pay for the weapons, and the United States is facing its own budget constraints, worsened by the costs of the Persian Gulf military operation, now estimated at $2.5 billion.
 
Looking at '1,001 Ways'
As a result, ''people are looking at 1,001 ways to solve the financing problem,'' an official said.
The options under study include leasing arms to Israel and positioning American planes and tanks at Israeli bases, transferring ownership in an emergency. An official said the United States might also give or sell at discount general military supplies or ammunition, thus freeing money that the Israelis could spend on weapons.
Creative financing is not new in American military aid to Israel. In the 1970's, the United States lent hundreds of millions of dollars to Israel on favorable terms. The terms were so favorable, said Richard Grimmett, a military analyst with the Congressional Research Service, that many of the loans were completely forgiven.
In the 1980's, the United States gave Israel military assistance with no strings attached. Since 1986, Congress has fixed the military aid to Israel, the single largest recipient of American foreign assistance, at $1.8 billion.

Bigger or Stronger Europe?

BYLINE: Flora Lewis

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
The two Germanys have signed their treaty of unification, the last major act of the German Democratic Republic before it disappears into a single Germany on Oct. 3. The question of its role in Europe, indeed the role of nation-states in Europe, becomes increasingly urgent as the countries to the East move on from the euphoria of freedom to the agony of transformation.
Preoccupation with the Persian Gulf crisis has diverted attention from the critically decisive period ahead in Europe. It adds difficulties because it has always been harder for the Common Market to move in periods of economic dislocation such as the new oil shock will bring. 
The whole timetable of Europe's evolution has changed. There will be a new all-German government based on elections Dec. 2, even before the European Community (absorbing East Germany) begins its major meetings on monetary and political union later that month in Rome. Their results will determine whether there is a European Germany or a German Europe, as the Federal Republic's Hans-Dietrich Genscher puts it.
There are hints that Bonn's pledge for a strong new push to integration is eroding with the temptation of a special role in the East. There have been suspicions this would happen. But so far Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and Mr. Genscher as well, have insisted they are resolved to anchor the new Germany in a union with increasingly limited national sovereignties.
The issue is put in terms of priority for ''broadening or deepening'' the Common Market, that is, opening to a number of new members, or tightening rules to move nearer a United States of Europe. Both cannot be done at once. The more countries involved, the harder it will be to unify them.
Eastern Europe is clamoring for an early promise of inclusion because it sees it as the lifeline out of its doldrums. So the debate can be veiled in the argument over sympathy for its plight versus the Community's need to build its own house solidly first.
A meeting of Aspen Institute Italia this week showed second thoughts about Europe's direction, in favor of accommodating Eastern wishes. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who hates the idea of integration, would have been delighted. It sounded as though Germany and Italy were moving her way toward a loose, unconstraining Community, or at least a ''two-speed Europe'' allowing choice of how much national power to pool, leaving France a lonely federalizer.
This is a crossroads. It's not just a matter of diplomatic haggling. The founders' idea was to defang the nationalisms that had devastated Europe by creating common institutions binding states together. Their success was based on mutual obligations.
Despite concern about a ''Fortress Europe,'' America should continue to support that idea because it is in a confident, supranational Europe that it can find its most effective partner. Germany will be the weightiest member whether the Community is weak or strong, but the stronger the Community, the less a future Germany is likely to go its own way.
In the longer run, this is in the interest of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union as well. But they are understandably desperate about the immediate future and want close ties quickly, even if that would undermine the foundations of a sturdy Europe.
There are better ways to meet their needs for a sense of attachment. The new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is working on coordination of aid to the East, but it isn't doing anything so far to promote coordination among recipients. None of them are asking for that, they are so eager to shed their old ties.
But destruction of the Soviet bloc doesn't mean they no longer need to trade with each other. They will benefit from mutual exchanges just as Western Europe did. Their trouble is that up to now their exchanges have been distorted, aggravating inefficiencies, because of their system.
All recognize the advantage of achieving convertible currencies, but it is beyond their present capacity. On Jan. 1, the Soviet Union will charge Eastern Europe hard currency for gas and oil supplies, a devastating blow to them made all the worse by the sharp rise in prices.
Brussels has proposed an Eastern Payments Union, like the one sponsored by the U.S. during Western European reconstruction. It is a good way to speed transition to open trading. The stabilization fund the West would need to provide would cost less than convertibility support for each country separately and ease pressure on the Community to sidetrack integration. The U.S. is hesitant but it shouldn't be. It knows better than anybody about the value of union.

HEADLINE: Letter: On Garbage;
Let the Free Market Tackle Solid Waste

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is difficult to understand your casual dismissal of my proposal to use an auction system to site undesirable plants like landfills, incinerators and radioactive dumps in New York State (''Mr. Rinfret on Garbage,'' editorial, Aug. 15).
Siting is the most difficult part of the solid waste issue. We ship 11 percent of our solid waste out of state. The states that receive our garbage are becoming resistant and may soon close the door. 
The fundamental problem is twofold: (1) there is very little economic reward for any municipality that takes such a facility, and (2) there is no cost to a municipality that deals with the problem by pushing it into someone else's backyard. Because this process is essentially political and involves pushing costs onto others, anyone who ends up with the facility is regarded as a loser, and everyone who avoids the facility considers himself a winner.
My proposal would impose costs on municipalities that do not take the facility and offer a reward to the municipalities that do. Because of shared benefits and burdens, there would be no winners or losers.
The auction would help the affected locality deal with three important externalities: (1) The bonus money would be used to assure that the facility is top-notch, safe and sound; (2) the money could be used to compensate those neighbors who are most directly affected by the facility; (3) the money would be used for general compensation of local residents by lowering taxes (or, if the locality is run by Democrats, raising spending).
You criticize the plan by arguing, ''Poorer upstate communities would stand little chance against the resources of, say, Scarsdale, Bronxville, Rye and other well-heeled communities in Westchester County.''
You ignore the fact that my plan envisions a regional approach, and nothing would require small upstate counties to participate with downstate neighbors on the issue of solid waste.
Eight years of Cuomo administration inaction has not solved the problem. Witness mishandling of the proposed resource recovery facility at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
I believe New Yorkers have had enough of government inaction on solid waste. Let's get private enterprise and the free market more involved in the solid waste issue. Why be afraid of trying something different?

HEADLINE: Economic Cooperation for East Europe

 BODY:
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland are now vigorously competing to be the first to throw off their remaining Communist shackles and free their markets. In time, these steps will benefit them economically. More immediately, they'll help attract Western capital and assistance. 
But some aspects of this rivalry are worrisome. Cutthroat competition for foreign investment could lead to wasteful efforts - excessive tax breaks, for example. Protectionism against neighbors' imports in the hope of saving failing businesses could be pernicious. Unfettered economic nationalism could make these countries less worthy aid recipients and riskier business partners.
To head off such nationalism after World War II, the United States gave Marshall Plan aid to the war-devastated countries of Western Europe on the condition that recipients cooperate regionally. That same strategy could be usefully employed in Central Europe today.
Eastern Europe's recent history complicates the task. Comecon, the Communist version of a common market, gave cooperation a bad name. Comecon geared production to serve Soviet needs, thereby distorting national economic development. And much of the cooperating was bilateral, with the Soviet Union, rather than regionwide.
One striking measure of Eastern Europe's lack of integration is that, even today, only six flights a week link Prague and Budapest by air. On most days there are none.
As if Comecon's legacy weren't problem enough, rival nationalisms, long suppressed under Communist rule, are now surfacing to further impede cooperation. When Hungary's Prime Minister Antall declares he's ''responsible'' for Hungarians outside his borders, he stirs resentment in Czechoslovakia as well as Romania. A better way to assure the well-being of Hungarians wherever they live is for old rivals to cooperate.
If Czechoslovaks, Hungarians and Poles work together on regional development, they'll help reassure skittish investors that they're ready to overcome centuries of national antagonism. Washington can help make its own aid more effective by promoting regional cooperation.

HEADLINE: U.S. Guidelines Address Meatpacking Injuries

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
The Labor Department is establishing a test program in the meatpacking industry to protect workers from painful and crippling injuries caused by repetitive motions.
The new guidelines for the industry resulted from negotiations between industry and union representatives, department officials said Thursday. Compliance is voluntary. The Labor Department is not ordering packing companies to adopt the new guidelines, which will be sent to them in the next few days. But if they do not adopt them, department officials said they would fine packers whose workers have a high incidence of repetitive motion ailments. 
Elizabeth Dole, the Secretary of Labor, said the guidelines would emphasize design of the workplace with the physical needs of workers in mind. New approaches might include revised tool designs, improved safety equipment and rotating workers to reduce repetitive work.
The department plans to study the program's effectiveness and use the results to reduce injuries in other occupations, especially those in which computers are used.
 
Carpel Tunnel Syndrome
Office workers striking the keyboards of video display terminals and supermarket checkers who sweep items over electronic scanners frequently complain of repetitive motion injuries like carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder of the wrist and hand.
''Repetitive motion injuries, which include lower back injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome and tendon disorders, now comprise 48 percent of all recordable industrial workplace illnesses,'' Mrs. Dole said. ''The economic burden of such injuries to employers and society is enormous.''
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 240,900 workplace illnesses were reported in 1988, the last year for which figures are available.
Mrs. Dole said the beef and pork packing industry was chosen because its 140,000 workers suffer from workplace injuries at a rate 10 times the national average. Meatpackers are often required to repeat the same motion as much as 8,000 times an hour, which can cause cysts, swollen tendons and nerve damage.
Mrs. Dole said it would take years of study before any enforceable rules could be established.
 
'Real Protection' Demanded
A spokesman for Howard M. Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee's Subcommittee on Labor, said the Senator was troubled by the program because it was voluntary and had no enforcement power.
''After 10 years of Administration neglect, American workers deserve real protection,'' Mr. Metzenbaum's spokesman said.
J. Patrick Boyle, president of the American Meat Institute, said the organization had already taken steps to redesign tools and equipment.
Al Zack, a spokesman for the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents 100,000 meatpackers and helped develop the guidelines, said, ''The guidelines are a positive step forward, but without an honest-to-goodness inspection and enforcement program they are meaningless.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
No War Unless Iraq Strikes, U.S. Gulf Commander Says

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: IN SAUDI ARABIA, Aug. 31

 BODY:
The commander of American forces in Saudi Arabia said today that there would be no fighting here unless Iraq launched an attack.
''There is not going to be any war unless the Iraqis attack,'' said the commander, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf.
In his first news conference since coming here four days ago, the four-star Army general played down the possibility of using offensive force to compel the Iraqis to withdraw from Kuwait.
''The force that I am assembling here is exactly the force that was briefed to the President of the United States as necessary for the defense of Saudi Arabia,'' said the general, who described the discussion of a possible use of offensive American forces as ''hypothetical.'' 
 
Military Buildup Continues
The general appeared to be signaling that the main means at present for driving the Iraqis out of Kuwait would be economic pressure and not military force. His comments may also reflect the calculation that the United States is still building up its military presence here and has not yet assembled the kind of ground force that it would like to have if it were to mount an attack on Kuwait or Iraq.
General Schwarzkopf visited American forces in this country today and spoke in blunt terms about the Iraqis and about the American military presence here. During a visit to an Air Force unit at a base here, the general said the United States was prepared to repel any Iraqi attack.
''If he dares come across the border and comes down here, I'm completely confident,'' General Schwarzkopf told members of the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing from Myrtle Beach, S.C. The wing is equipped with A-10 attack planes, which are designed to destroy tanks. General Schwarzkopf said the deployment of the A-10's here greatly increased the American ability to take on Iraqi armored forces.
During his news conference, the general also expressed confidence that the United States could repel an Iraqi invasion but was less categorical. ''If the Iraqis are dumb enough to attack, they're going to pay a price,'' he said, but added that he could not give a 100 percent assurance that the United States forces could successfully defend the Saudi kingdom.
 
Warning on Chemical Weapons
The general also issued a blunt warning that any Iraqi use of chemical weapons would prompt a major American military retaliation. If Iraq uses chemical weapons, he said, ''they will pay for it big time.''
The general, a former football player with an avuncular manner, described Iraqi's military leaders as a ''bunch of thugs.''
Yet at other times the general appeared to be playing the role of a diplomat. He repeatedly emphasized that the United States had no intention of establishing permanent military bases in Saudi Arabia and tried to sidestep questions about who was ultimately in charge of the multinational forces deployed here.
''This is not NATO,'' he said. ''This is not a single command, and there doesn't need to be.''
The general also did not give a direct answer when asked whether the United States could employ military forces based in Saudi Arabia without Saudi consent. The head of the Arab forces here, Prince Khalid bin Sultan bin Abdulaziz, who is a Saudi lieutenant general, told reporters this week that the United States would have to consult with Saudi Arabia before taking any military action using forces based in the kingdom.
The general declined to give a general breakdown of areas of operations of the forces in this country or to say whether the American military was aiding Kuwaiti guerrillas fighting the Iraqis.
 
Assessment of Iraqi Army
Discussing the Iraqi military deployment, the general said Iraqi forces were still in a generally defensive configuration but said they could shift into a more offensive mode. Describing the Iraqi Army, he said that ''some of their equipment is fairly good, some of their units are lousy, so if their equipment is lousy, we certainly are taking this all into account.''
The general suggested that the presence of American hostages at military targets in Iraq would not influence his decisions.
''I would tell you that obviously I am just as concerned as anyone else about every single human life,'' he said. ''What I have to do is plan the military component and not concern myself with the hostages.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
In Moscow, Gulf Crisis Ranks Second

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Although Iraq is closer to the Soviet border than New York is to Boston, the gulf crisis that has fixated the rest of the world seems almost peripheral to residents of this capital of competing crises.
In a week when the newspapers predicted that tobacco riots might soon be followed by shortages of bread and aspirin, when a bumper wheat crop was rotting in the fields, when Moscow was puzzling over a diphtheria outbreak, when President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was wrestling with threats of secession and depression, Iraq did not dominate the headlines and scarcely figured in conversation on the street.
If Mr. Gorbachev sometimes seems to have less fire in his belly than President Bush when it comes to taming Saddam Hussein, one reason is that on this issue Soviet public opinion is less intense and more ambivalent than in the West.
 
Public Opinion a Factor
And Mr. Gorbachev, unlike his predecessors, has to reckon with public opinion in making his foreign policy. 
''The effect of Iraqi behavior and especially the hostage situation has been to solidify Western public opinion behind President Bush and strong sanctions,'' said a Western diplomat here.
''In this country, the balance of opinion is very different - much more introverted, concerned with domestic problems, scarred by Afghanistan, and very wary of getting involved in any sort of an overseas commitment.''
Western and Arab officials here say that given the isolationism here and decades of close ties to Iraq, the wonder is how fully Mr. Gorbachev has collaborated in the American-led campaign against Moscow's longtime ally and weapons client.
They say they have seen no evidence that Moscow is circumventing the embargo against Iraq, or the cutoff of arms deliveries that Moscow announced before the United Nations imposed sanctions.
 
Position Is Clear
The Arab diplomats say Moscow has so far made plain to Iraq and its supporters, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, that it will not support any settlement short of a full Iraqi retreat. Moscow has not nibbled at Iraq's attempt to link a withdrawal from Kuwait to Israel's surrender of its occupied territories.
''There can be no doubt that the Soviet position is very firm and very clear,'' said one senior Arab diplomat.
Diplomats here put little stock in the accusations of some American conservatives that the Soviets are playing a double game in the gulf - pretending to support the campaign against Mr. Hussein, the Iraqi President, while privately relishing the higher oil prices that play hell with the American economy and promise a windfall of several billion dollars to Soviet producers.
Higher oil and gas prices, and the higher gold prices that accompany a time of crisis, are indeed a boon to the Soviet Union, although the decrepit industry is in poor shape to take advantage of them. Oil production has actually been declining because of antiquated equipment.
''You could make the windfall argument against a number of oil-producing countries, including Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom,'' a Western diplomat said.
 
'Small Net Gain'
More important, the diplomats contend, it is hard to imagine that Mr. Gorbachev would jeopardize the most valuable prize he has won for his country - Western good will, and the prospect of long-term financial assistance - for a short-term oil profit.
''The Soviets get a small net gain, but not on an order of magnitude to provide a motive for a double game,'' said a Western diplomat.
By collaborating in the sanctions against Mr. Hussein, Moscow stands not only to secure its candidate membership in the club of civilized nations, but to greatly enhance its relations with the rich Gulf states and moderate Arab countries like Egypt.
 
Wider U.N. Role Sought
Soviet leaders have been pressing to give the U.N. a wider role, and multilateralism has become more urgent to Moscow with the withering of the Soviet bloc in Europe.
Against the advantages of cooperation, however, Mr. Gorbachev has had to weigh the risks of becoming embroiled in an enterprise that could lead his country into war, or that his political rivals and the military might view as shamefully subservient to America.
The Soviet and American approaches have diverged on several points.
Mr. Gorbachev has been slower than other members of the United Nations Security Council to sanction the use of military force against Iraq, and has so far declined to send ships to help the blockade.
On Thursday, senior officials of the Foreign Ministry and the military expressed deep misgivings about the American-led buildup in the region, and worried aloud that United States Marines might be planning a permanent encampment in Saudi Arabia.
The Kremlin has not severed its treaty of friendship with Iraq, contending it is useful to keep open the lines of communication.
When Iraq ordered that all foreign countries leave their embassies in Kuwait, the Kremlin insisted that its embassy and its recognition of the Kuwaiti Government in exile remained legally intact - but removed all Soviet nationals from occupied Kuwait.
 
Many Technicians Remain
Moscow has also made no public attempt to withdraw 193 Soviet technicians who were sent to Iraq before the crisis to explain and maintain Soviet weapons, and several thousand other specialists have continued working in construction and oil-field projects.
Soviet officials say publicly that these experts do not violate the letter of the U.N. embargo. Privately, they say that a quick withdrawal could have precipitated reprisals, and that they hope to pull the specialists out as soon as woman and children go.
Mr. Gorbachev has also been trying to avoid any step that could draw his country into a conflict. Russian mothers took to the streets in revolt last year when the Kremlin tried to call up the reserves for peacekeeping duty in Azerbaijan, a Soviet republic.
Serious doubt has also arisen whether a country still bitter from its 10-year failure in Afghanistan would support a decision to send soldiers abroad, against an enemy armed and trained by the Soviet Union and prepared to use chemical weapons.
Indeed, the Western diplomats suggest that ordering troops to Iraq, when the military is in disarray and the country is mired in an economic crisis, could be the end for Mr. Gorbachev.
 
A Lukewarm Affection
It is not that Mr. Hussein enjoys any popular affection in this country. Iraq to the ordinary Russian is just another third world country that sups at the Soviet treasury. But neither is there much feeling that keeping him in line is a Soviet affair.
''Isn't it enough that so many young men die in Afghanistan, and continue to perish in Armenia and Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Kirghizia?'' mused a writer in the liberal weekly New Times, arguing against ''the role of Don Quixote.''
The writer concluded, ''There is no reason for our people to go charging at windmills in the name of 'restoring universal justice,' or to shed their blood beyond the borders of the fatherland.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
U.S. Says Gulf Moves' Cost Will Far Exceed $25 Billion

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., Aug. 31

 BODY:
The worldwide burden-sharing program for the Persian Gulf operation will require tens of billions of dollars in financial aid to third-world countries, repayment for trade lost in the embargo against Iraq, donations of fuel to American military forces and other contributions, Administration officials said today.
The officials said they could not provide an exact price tag. But they said the cost would significantly exceed estimates of $25 billion that were reported today. Much of the program remains to be negotiated by President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who plan missions abroad next week. 
 
Counting on Fuel for Military
But officials said the United States expects, among other things, that the oil-producing nations will provide all the fuel for American military forces deployed in Saudi Arabia, that Japan will contribute significantly more than the $1.3 billion it has announced it will give to the program, and that Washington will have to pay a ''sizable share'' of the cost.
As part of its contribution, the United States is planning to eliminate a substantial portion of Egypt's military debt of $6 billion to $7 billion, officials said. The exact figure is still under discussion.
In the Red Sea today, the Pentagon said a United States Naval vessel stopped and boarded an Iraqi oil tanker for the first time since the United Nations authorized the use of the military to enforce the trade embargo on Iraq.
The guided-missile cruiser Biddle stopped the tanker at 8:36 A.M. Eastern time, found it to be empty and allowed it to proceed, the Navy said. The tanker's captain cooperated and no violence was reported, officials said.
In Kennebunkport, Mr. Bush's vacation home, the White House said today that the President had spoken to the leaders of France, Britain and Saudi Arabia as part of effort to coordinate the ''burden sharing'' program he announced on Thursday in Washington.
All three countries are expected to play a major role in the effort, which is intended to give financially strapped countries an incentive to adhere to the economic sanctions against Iraq and make it more difficult for President Saddam Hussein to simply hunker down in Kuwait in hopes that the embargo will slowly start to unravel.
The program has two essential elements, they said. One is to help pay for keeping scores of thousands of American soldiers in the Saudi desert, along with dozens of British, Canadian and French warships in the waters around the Arabian Peninsula. Saudi Arabia has been contributing aviation fuel, and the Saudis and other oil producers are eventually expected to provide all the fuel for the American military in the Persian Gulf, officials said.
 
Helping Mideast Economies
The other element is to aid countries that are suffering financially from the economic sanctions because they are losing trade with Iraq, income associated with Iraqi oil exports, or the incomes of their citizens who normally work in Iraq. The officials said the first phase of the project will focus on Egypt, Jordan and Turkey, which the United States says have been hardest hit by the gulf crisis.
In the longer term, one official said, assistance will be arranged to another tier of countries, including India, Morocco, Bangladesh, the Philippines and countries in Eastern Europe.
''This crisis hasn't happened in a vacuum,'' an official said. ''If you look at the efforts we've made recently to bring stability to Eastern Europe, we don't want that all to be undone because of what's happening in the Middle East.''
In most cases, aid - direct payments, loans, loan guarantees and other programs - will be provided without the requirements of economic revisions usually attached to loans to developing countries, officials said.
''Simply to insist on ideal economic reform policies in a very trying and difficult situation does not make good sense,'' an official said.
 
Girding Political Stability
''To be blunt about it, we're trying to stabilize countries and it does not make a lot of sense to ask them to adopt economic policies that will destabilize them,'' he continued. ''We're sensitive to the need for Egyptian economic reform, for example, but not at the price of political stability.''
In Washington today, Reuters quoted Barber B. Conable Jr., president of the World Bank, as expressing concern about the issue. He urged nations taking part in the financial aid program not to drop the usual conditions attached to the bank's lending programs.
Administration officials declined to give targets for contributions from individual nations, although they said a large percentage would come from oil-producing countries. Nations like Britain and France, which are already contributing military forces to the region, also are expected to provide financial aid under the program, officials said.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER'S WORLD;
Despite Complaints, Solicitation by Phone or Mail Is Growing

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
Your name, address and telephone number are no longer yours to give out only as you choose. Direct marketers all over the nation have them and are using them with increasing intensity to sell products and services.
The flood of unsolicited third-class or junk mail and intrusive telephone calls is reaching new heights and a good many consumers are irritated by what they regard as an invasion of privacy. In most cases, the sales pitches are legal and there are no laws, state or Federal, that prevent marketers from legitimately seeking your patronage by mail or phone. And because these techniques are showing better and better results, they are likely to continue to be a major factor in selling merchandise. 
Even if you contact the companies offering unwanted material, or take other action to stop calls and mail, you may still be solicited. ''There's no sure method of getting off all the lists,'' said Sara Cooper, a senior program associate of the National Consumers League, a nonprofit organization in Washington.
Of course, not everyone objects to direct marketing. The in-home sales market has grown because more Americans like the convenience of shopping by mail or phone.
 
 'Free' Vacations
Almost 92 million people ordered goods and services this way in 1989, compared with about 64 million in 1984, according to the Simmons Market Research Bureau in New York. The Direct Marketing Association, a national trade group, reports that businesses mailed more than 13 million catalogues last year and that consumers placed 3 billion phone calls to place an order or obtain information on products.
With such demonstrated interest, direct marketing companies are stepping up their efforts not only to keep customers, but to attract new ones. Good prospects are people who have bought similar items from their competitors.
The attraction of shopping at home for so-called bargains accounts for the variety of offers of ''free'' or inexpensive vacations, magazines, home-improvement packages, insurance policies and other items. And it means that advertisements for sweepstakes - games of chance in which no purchase is required - are appearing in consumers' mailboxes with more regularity.
''Like any direct marketer, we will mail to certain households more than others,'' said David C. Sayer, director of advertising of Publishers Clearing House, a magazine subscription agency in Port Washington, L.I., that runs many sweepstakes. ''If you bought from us in the last year, you could get two to five mailings a year.''
The sales pitches from some companies that sell through the mail are often frenzied, carrying names of the recipient in large type and suggesting that you will lose millions or forfeit a luxury car or trip if you do not respond immediately. Sometimes there are exaggerated promises of a prize or unrealistic savings. Cases of high-pressure marketing have been reported in which improper charges are made against a person's credit card and no merchandise or promised travel is ever received.
''You often get in the mail an artfully worded notification to claim an award or a distribution,'' said Stephen R. Jones, a vice president of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, the umbrella organization for local bureaus. ''But there are some catches to it. You may have to pay a redemption fee or pay a high shipping and handling charge.''
Telephone marketing is also on the rise. ''The telemarketing industry has become a huge operation in the last six or seven years,'' said Herschel Elkins, a senior assistant attorney general in California. ''You have an increase in the number of companies that are primarily engaging in interstate activities.''
Where do these marketers get your name and address? There are lists galore that are sold or rented to them by periodicals, associations and thousands of companies that deal with consumers. There are lists available by occupation, age group and special interest. And there are lists obtained from motor vehicle bureaus, ZIP code directories, telephone books and dozens of other sources.
Certain lists also have telephone numbers, many of which are obtained simply from the telephone directory. Direct marketers sometimes call holders of unlisted numbers, too, much to their surprise. Marketers may get these numbers by making random calls via a computer. They also get unlisted numbers of people who gave their phone numbers when entering a contest or requesting information about an investment, product or service.
Legislation has been introduced in both houses of Congress to prevent telemarketing fraud and abuse. The House Committee on Government Operations has said telemarketing fraud costs consumers billions of dollars annually.
The Senate bill has a provision that could prohibit computer-generated calls that cannot be terminated immediately by the consumer. At present, a consumer's line can be tied up until the recorded message is completed, even if the person receiving the call no longer has the telephone off the hook.
 
THROW IT OUT OR JUST HANG UP
If you want to receive fewer unsolicited letters, postcards and telephone calls, write to the Direct Marketing Association at 11 West 42d Street, P.O. Box 3861, New York, N.Y. 10163, and ask to have your name removed from company mailing or phone lists. You can also write directly to the companies.
Here are some tips for dealing with direct marketers from the Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan New York.
Resist succumbing to high pressure sales pitches on the phone. If you are interested in an offer, a legitimate company will send you information or give you time to consider an offer.
Never give out your credit card number unless you initiated the contact or are confident the caller will not misuse the information. If you suspect fraud or misrepresentation, hang up the phone or throw away the mailing.
If an offer intrigues you but you doubt its authenticity, check with the local Better Business Bureau.

HEADLINE: Gasoline Up As Supplies Stay Tight

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
Wholesale gasoline prices jumped again yesterday, but crude oil prices rose more modestly. Demand for gasoline remains strong, because of shortages of refinery capacity, traders said.
The United Nations trade embargo has shut down nearly all large refineries in Kuwait and Iraq, and other oil exporters lack the equipment to refine much of the extra production they are now putting on the market.
The wholesale gasoline contract for September delivery expired up 7.25 cents a gallon, or 8.1 percent, at 96.32 cents at the close of trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The increase followed a jump of 4.35 cents, or 5.1 percent, in the contract on Thursday. The crude oil contract for October delivery rose 55 cents a barrel, or 2.1 percent, to $27.32 on the New York Merc. 
For the week, however, oil prices dropped $3.59, and wholesale gasoline prices fell 8.3 cents. Oil and petroleum product prices fell sharply on Monday, and despite gains later in the week, they did not fully recover.
Gasoline prices are at a level that is likely to result in ''much higher prices at the retail pump, which will trigger conservation and bring the market back into equilibrium,'' said Philip K. Verleger Jr., an energy economist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
A strong statement yesterday from a two-day emergency session of the Arab League in Cairo, demanding reparations from Iraq for starting the current Middle East crisis, contributed to fears that a war might still disrupt production, said Robert S. Jonke, an energy futures trader at Cargill Investor Services. Oil prices jumped 25 cents when the news arrived, he said.
Saddam Hussein, the President of Iraq, has been slow to honor his pledge to release Western women and children who are being held in Iraq and Kuwait, and traders have taken that as another indication that war remains a possibility, said Virginia Wiater, a crude oil broker for United Energy on the floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Gasoline prices have risen faster in Europe than in the United States, so more crude oil is being shipped there, and some cargos of gasoline are now headed there from the United States, Mr. Verleger said.
Part of the sharp increase yesterday in the September gasoline contract reflected traders' searching for cargos to meet previous commitments to deliver oil, traders said. The contract for the October delivery of gasoline rose 3.34 cents, to 86.18 cents a gallon.
But the large difference between September and October prices is also an indication that short-term gasoline supplies are extremely tight, Mr. Verleger said.
''One has to ask the question whether this is the first harbinger of impending gasoline lines,'' he said. But he projected that higher retail gasoline prices were more likely than the long lines and would be much healthier for the American economy.
Oil companies' profit margins are also being pinched now because when crude oil prices first rose, the companies did not raise the wholesale gasoline prices they charge to dealers proportionately, said Kenneth D. Miller, a senior principal at Purvin & Gertz, an energy consulting company in Houston. And they have difficulty doing so now because oil prices have slipped back a little and consumers expect lower prices at the pump, he added.
The American Automobile Association said yesterday that its nationwide spot-check on Wednesday found an average price for self-service regular unleaded gasoline of $1.307 a gallon. That compares with $1.062 over Labor Day weekend last year, said Geoff Sundstrom, a spokesman for the Orlando, Fla.-based group.
The contract for September delivery of heating oil rose 0.35 cent, or one-half of one percent, to 75.89 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: No Need Seen to Tap Oil Reserve

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Saying that oil supplies remained nearly in balance with demand despite the embargo against Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil, the International Energy Agency, which represents 21 industrial nations, decided today not to recommend that members begin drawing down emergency reserves.
After a meeting in Paris, the agency's governing board said that member governments would take emergency cooperative measures, including the use of government-controlled oil stocks, only ''if the situation so warrants.''
Agency officials forecast that the loss of 4.3 million barrels a day in Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil would largely be offset in September by increased production elsewhere, the use of company petroleum stocks and reduced demand that resulted from higher energy prices.
 
Sufficient Supplies Seen
Ulrich Engelmann, chairman of the agency's governing board, said: ''For the present, the market is generally well supplied. Given the oil market outlook for the next two months, governments do not consider additional measures to be necessary right now.'' 
Some oil experts have criticized the member nations for not tapping their strategic reserves, which total a billion barrels, equivalent to 150 days of the industrial world's net oil imports. The United States and other countries contend that the reserves should be drawn down only in the event of a shortage, not to control prices. But some economists, arguing that a jump in prices can endanger the world economy, say the reserves should already have been tapped.
''They have this stupid idea that what matters is a quantity shortfall,'' said Robert Mabro, director of the Oxford Institute for Energy Research. ''For me what matters is a price explosion.''
 
Agency Set Up in '74
Some officials in the agency's secretariat said that if the shortfall were to exceed 500,000 barrels a day, the agency members would approve emergency measures to tap the reserves. The governing board said its secretariat ''shall monitor the situation carefully and prepare the necessary steps'' if such use is warranted.
The United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and more than a dozen European nations formed the Paris-based agency in 1974 to coordinate the industrial world's response to an oil crisis. The agency has encouraged governments to establish strategic reserves and has developed emergency plans for conservation and for tapping government stocks.
The agency, which is operated by consensus, has also encouraged the development and use of energy sources other than petroleum, including coal and nuclear power.
Helga Steeg, the agency's executive director, announced today that France had begun negotiations to join the agency. France refused to join at the beginning because it saw the agency as an anti-OPEC group and feared that membership would injure France's good relations with the Arab world.
Agency officials said oil supplies were largely in balance with demand in August principally because Iraqi and Kuwaiti production before the embargo was still being delivered and because oil companies were drawing some 300,000 barrels a day from their own stocks.
Agency officials said the first impact of the loss of 4.3 million barrels a day would be felt in September. Nevertheless, they said, supply and demand would be in relative balance because companies were expected to draw down stocks by about a million barrels a day and non-industrialized countries were expected to reduce their stocks by 600,000 barrels a day.
In addition, the agency officials say, the increased production that Saudi Arabia and some other nations began in August, after the invasion of Kuwait, will begin to reach the market in September, increasing supplies by 1.3 million barrels a day.
 
Rise in Demand Feared
Saudi officials say they have increased production by two million barrels a day, but energy agency officials say that oil will not reach market until October.
''For October, this higher oil production and further commercial stock draw is expected to meet much of the shortfall,'' the agency's governing board said today.
But the board added that demand could increase in the winter, and that companies would not be able to continue drawing down signficant amounts of their stocks.
As a result, some agency officials see a hard-to-manage shortage of more than 500,000 barrels a day developing late this year, even with Wednesday's decision of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise production by an expected four million barrels a day. Some officials say OPEC may not be able to get that extra oil to market by the end of the year.

Oil and the Mideast
The International Energy Agency decided not to recommend that members begin drawing down emergency oil reserves, saying that supplies remained nearly in balance with demand despite the embargo. [Page 27.] Gasoline prices jumped again, while oil rose more modestly. Demand for gasoline remains strong, and shortages of refinery capacity persist, traders said.

HEADLINE: About New York;
A Shrine Is Born In the Incubator Of the 'Wretched'

BYLINE: By MARTIN GOTTLIEB

 BODY:
To the side of a blacktop city park at First Avenue and East First Street, a bronze plaque affixed to a fiberglass rock has been drawing a varied stream of pilgrims all summer.
It leads Arnold Howard Freeman, widely known as Howard, who sells used copies of quality books from an adjacent armchair, to marvel: ''At all times, 24 hours a day, they come here, couples, singles, too, and they read, mostly in silence. The other day someone sat down in front of it in the lotus position for about three hours and copied. Yesterday there were people here at 2 A.M.''
On the plaque is ''The Black Sheep,'' a poem by the performance artist Karen Finley. It opens with a conversation between two veteran funeralgoers in the age of AIDS, one swearing never to attend another ''death party'' for someone he didn't know. 
 
 Cause-cause-cause I feel I feel so
 sad cause I never knew their life -
 and now I only know their death.
 
 The poem moves to reflections on the multitudes in ''the black sheep family'':
 
 There's always one in every family
 Even when we're surrounded by bodies
 we're always alone.
 The poem continues later:
 
 That's our life. That's our story.
 Usually we're outcasts, outsiders
 in our own family.
 Don't worry - get used to it.
 The sentiments most pointedly encompass gay people, women, people with AIDS, bohemians and the sorts of constitutional contrarians who make up the parade on the bustling little strip that Howard calls the boulevard.
But given its location, ''The Black Sheep'' addresses and includes much more. The corner is at the heart of the city's great immigrant incubator, the Lower East Side.
Homeless men sell whatevers on either side of the sculpture.
Asian-American teen-agers play handball on courts behind it. Across First Avenue is a homeless encampment occupied mostly by African-Americans in a stripped-down park named for I. L. Peretz, often called the father of Yiddish literature and a champion of the oppressed Jews of turn-of-the-century Poland.
Ms. Finley is best known for her performance work, including ''We Keep Our Victims Ready,'' which concludes with ''The Black Sheep.'' The work has moved audiences with its at times shrieking expression of women's abnegation and abuse; its railing against a power structure, white, male and heterosexual, that Ms. Finley argues has closed itself to the pain of those outside it, and its final declaration of redemption and renewal in the arms of each other for the neglected and the hurt.
To a broader public, however, it is best known through the clumsy debate over the National Endowment of the Arts, which has rejected Ms. Finley's latest grant proposal. Ms. Finley's opponents portray the piece as little more than a contrivance summed up by her stripping to her underpants and smearing herself with chocolate. That characterization can only strike those who have seen the performance as wrongheaded and pernicious.
Ms. Finley's defenders have pointed to the power and morality of her work and - in no small part through the ways in which she uses her body - to its startling ability to voice the pain and longing of society's outsiders.
As its reception on First Avenue points out, Ms. Finley's work accomplishes something else. It strikes a particular and resonant chord in a city whose proudest heritage is the accommodation, however painful, of waves of ''wretched refuse,'' tainted by suspect ethnicity, politics, sexuality or life style.
''People stand here in the heat and read this thing - and that's pretty good for New York,'' Alun Uluc said recently near ''The Black Sheep,'' where she paused with her 9-month-old daughter, Emel. ''Basically every black sheep in every state and even Europe comes here and they all blend in - that's what the East Village is about.''
So much so that Reggie Joseph, an unemployed carpenter, sells rice paper rubbings of the poem for $5 at a good clip. Juan Garcia, who had come downtown from East Harlem to visit a friend, said he particularly liked ''The Black Sheep'' passage that reads:
 
 We always speak our mind
 appreciate differences in culture
 believe in sexual preferences
 believe in no racism, no sexism, no religionism.
 Mr. Garcia was wearing a bandage across his nose as a result of a mugging in Newark.
The Black Sheep installation cost $5,000 and is sponsored by Creative Time, which presents art in public places throughout the city. It will remain at the site until October.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
BUSH WILL MEET GORBACHEV ON SUNDAY, GULF ON AGENDA; IRAQIS LET SOME HOSTAGES GO

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., Sept. 1

 BODY:
President Bush announced today that he and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will meet in Helsinki on Sept. 9. Administration officials said the meeting was intended to display superpower solidarity at a time when Washington is eager to hold together the alliance against Iraq.
The meeting in Finland's capital, which Mr. Bush said had been arranged at his initiative over the past week, was scheduled at a time when the Soviet Union has been sending mixed signals about the military standoff on the Arabian Peninsula.
Some Soviet officials have suggested that Moscow is uncomfortable with the American presence there, 700 miles from the Soviet border, and Mr. Gorbachev expressed concern on Friday about the possibility of warfare. Others suggest that the Soviet leader is seeking a higher profile in the gulf crisis. [Page 18.] No Big Disagreement Seen Mr. Bush, who has already met with Mr. Gorbachev twice as President, said he was ''very anxious'' to discuss the Persian Gulf situation with him. But he took pains to stress that he and Mr. Gorbachev were not at odds on the Middle East, where Washington and Moscow once competed for influence. ''It wasn't driven by any worry that we might be apart,'' he said of the planned one-day meeting. ''Rather that there's a wide array of questions that could use consultation at this time.'' 
Talking to reporters at his vacation home here today, Mr. Bush said he and Mr. Gorbachev had no particular peace plan to discuss in Finland, where Mr. Bush will arrive on Saturday. He also said he did not foresee a role for the Soviet Union either as part of the worldwide financial-assistance program that Mr. Bush is putting together or as a mediator in the Persian Gulf. [Excerpts, page 6.] ''I don't see any mediating role at all, and I don't think the Soviets see themselves having a mediating role,'' Mr. Bush said.
 
Talks on Arms Expected
The President said he and Mr. Gorbachev would also discuss other issues, including negotiations on a treaty to reduce conventional armed forces in Europe. ''I think we can get done what we need to do in one day and that's what he feels also,'' Mr. Bush said.
Marlin Fitzwater, Mr. Bush's spokesman, said the two leaders had to ''overcome a few humps'' relating to artillery and aircraft in the conventional arms negotiations in order to finish off that treaty for signing in Paris at a 35-nation meeting in December.
In Moscow, the scheduling of the meeting was reported without comment.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev are expected to issue a joint statement after the meeting and hold a news conference together.
A senior Administration official in Washington said the United States arranged the meeting in part to make certain that the two nations would be able to continue the extraordinary confluence of interests and the cooperation that have been a highlight of the Persian Gulf crisis.
The meeting also is seen by Washington as an important symbol, the official said, to help hold together the international coalition against Iraq and to counter President Saddam Hussein's effort to portray the crisis in the gulf as a fight between Iraq and the United States. ''If you want an international and Arab consensus to hold, then we and the Soviets have to be visibly on board together,'' the official said. Having the two leaders issue a joint statement condemning Mr. Hussein is seen as a powerful way of doing that, the official said.
He added that the United States had taken note of recent Soviet concerns about the gulf crisis and wanted to make sure that a problem does not develop between the two countries and that other nations cannot take an apparent Soviet-American division as an excuse to break away from the trade embargo against Iraq.
 
U.S. View of Soviet Role
Reacting to reports from the Middle East of a possible Soviet mediation effort in the gulf, Administration officials said the United States would welcome any Soviet effort to persuade Mr. Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait. But they were eager not to have any such initiative portrayed as mediation because that suggests the fight in the gulf is between Iraq and the United States alone, an official said.
The President portrayed the meeting next weekend as part of the new, less formal relationship between the leaders of the two nuclear superpowers and as an outgrowth of the cooperation between Washington and Moscow in a region where the interests of the two countries often collided in the past.
Mr. Bush recalled that he and Mr. Gorbachev had agreed to meet more frequently at their most recent summit talks in Washington. ''We both agreed up at Camp David that this kind of informal, unstructured format might be very good in a world where there are so many changes,'' he said. ''So it's a good chance to test that now.''
Finland was chosen for the meeting because it is more convenient for Mr. Gorbachev, officials said.
 
Communication by Cable
Mr. Gorbachev is the only major world leader to whom Mr. Bush has not spoken by telephone or in person during the gulf crisis. But Mr. Bush said that he had been in ''direct contact'' with the Soviet leader, by diplomatic cable, and that he did not feel the need to telephone him because he had anticipated a face-to-face meeting.
Mr. Bush said the meeting was arranged in telephone conversations between Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and said Mr. Baker had told him the Soviet Union was very enthusiastic about the proposal.
Mr. Bush angrily denounced the manner in which Mr. Hussein has allowed only a trickle of foreign hostages to leave Iraq and Kuwait. ''It is so base and outrageous that I think most people in the Arab world are very embarrassed by this,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And I think that's certainly true of others around the world. I've talked to so many leaders and they all agree that this is just a despicable performance.''
Asked how long he could tolerate Mr. Hussein's holding foreigners as hostages, Mr. Bush said, ''I don't deal in deadlines.''
 
Relief for Egypt Weighed
Mr. Bush said it was his instinct at this point to ask Congress to drop all or part of Egypt's $7 billion military debt to the United States as part of an effort to help that country deal with the economic hardships wrought by the gulf crisis. But he said he had not made a final decision on the issue.
Mr. Bush was not asked about reports that the United States is preparing to transfer as much as $1 billion worth of advanced weapons to Israel to buttress Israeli defenses against Iraq and offset recent arms sales to Saudi Arabia.
In an earlier briefing for reporters, Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, did not comment directly on the talks. He said discussions with Israel about arms transfers were ''an annual affair of consultation between the United States and Israel.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Gauging Next Move by Hussein: Uneasy Wait in a Tense Standoff

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 1

 BODY:
''I can't predict what he's going to do,'' said President Bush about his current nemesis, President Saddam Hussein, at a news conference on Thursday. ''The unpredictable nature'' of the Iraqi leader, Mr. Bush argued, makes it impossible to say if war lies ahead.
But many Middle East experts think they understand President Hussein well enough to deduce what he is likely to do, at least in the near future. They say his options are clear enough, his patterns of past performance well enough known, his habits of mind evident enough to make educated guesses.
Most of them believe that the Iraqi dictator, having concluded that he has made a major error in arousing the wrath of the West and of part of the Arab world by brutally overrunning Kuwait, will now lie back for a while.

''As we see it,'' an Israeli military official said, ''Saddam is gathering as many cards as he can now for either a political or military settlement, while also buying time. He clearly doesn't want a military confrontation with the United States.''
''The best option from his point of view,'' said Sir Anthony Parsons, a retired British diplomat highly respected for his knowledge of the Arab world, ''is to sit it out, lower the temperature, try to continue to split the Arab people from the Arab governments, split the solidarity - such as it is - of Arab governments themselves, create an antiwar atmosphere in the West and hope over a period of weeks or months that the outside world, with its well-known short attention span, will begin to not take it too seriously, that the sanctions war will start to crumble, that widespread cheating will develop.''
 
Small Concessions May Work
Academic specialists, military experts, intelligence specialists, diplomats and others interviewed in a half-dozen cities, from Washington to Jerusalem to Tokyo, tend to agree. Some said that it might be possible to offer President Hussein enough small concessions, without pandering to his dreams of regional hegemony, to reach a political solution and avoid war.
Certainly lying low has been the pattern this week, as President Hussein told captains of Iraqi merchant vessels not to resist inspection by United States Navy ships, ordered his ground forces into more emphatically defensive positions, kept his air force well within Iraqi airspace and began, albeit slowly, to release Western women and children he had been holding hostage.
Many commentators and a few American officials have pictured the 53-year-old Iraqi leader as erratic, eccentric, even mad. But most who know him and have studied him consider him cunning, ruthless, vain, bloodthirsty, but not demented in the slightest - a man whose motives and goals are quite comprehensible, even if the world considers his methods despicable.
''This is no psychotic megalomaniac,'' said Prof. Jerrold Post of George Washington University, a psychiatrist who specializes in developing psychological profiles of political figures. ''He is a highly rational man - dangerous but well focused.''
''We should remember,'' Professor Post added, ''that this is a man who waits, very patiently, uses time as a weapon, to get what he wants. If he sees a way out of this, with a fig leaf, he'll take it, and then two years from now, five years from now, his appetite for power will be undiminished and he'll strike again somewhere.''
 
'Kind of Foreboding'
Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, worried about that possibility, has called for the United States to drive President Hussein and his army from power.
Mr. Lugar, who is probably the most influential Republican on Capitol Hill on questions of foreign policy, said he found it ''kind of foreboding that the Iraqis are backing off from confrontation, becoming almost pacific, playing defense, making us sit out there and wait until something happens.''
 
No Immediate Results
Few regional experts expect economic sanctions to bite quickly. James Schlesinger, a Republican who served as Secretary of Energy, Director of Central Intelligence and Secretary of Defense under a variety of Presidents, said the other day that real results would take from six to eight months.
If full-scale war does come, he said, the United States would suffer ''many thousands of casualties.'' The only alternative, Mr. Schlesinger suggested on PBS's ''MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour,'' is a diplomatic solution in which President Bush would get much less than he has demanded - Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and restoration of its ruler to power.
''Saddam Hussein is not a fellow to capitulate readily,'' he said. ''We tend to think in terms of unconditional surrender, but normally in the case of undconditional surrender you have to impose a military defeat before you get the surrender rather than the other way around. Just threatening him with destruction won't do it.''
An American intelligence official, deeply involved in the Persian Gulf crisis, said the situation would take some months to ripen. After that, he said, the Iraqis might strike directly, by killing some of the hostages or letting them starve, or indirectly, through a terrorist attack on a military target or a civilian airliner.
''In this situation, the strategic advantage lies with Saddam, not with the United States,'' the intelligence man continued. ''If Bush were to launch a raid, Saddam Hussein is the immediate winner. He wins in the eyes of the Arab world even if he loses, because he's carrying on the dream of the pan-Arab movement. He'd get creamed, but remember that Nasser lost the Six-Day War and came out of it as a hero.''
 
In Search of a Rationale
Hussein A. Hammami, Jordan's Ambassador to Washington, also sees a play for Arab sympathies as one of President Hussein's best options.
''Do not delude yourself that most Arabs welcome the presence of American troops in the area,'' he said. ''The United States can't be an arbiter of Arab differences and at the same time the strategic ally of their enemy Israel.''
Some experts see a pattern, especially in Mr. Hussein's relations with Iran, that suggests a willingness on his part to back down, especially if the retreat can be pictured to the Iraqi people, through tame news media, as a victory of sorts. In this case, said Marshall Wiley, a former chief of the United States interests section in Baghdad, ''He will need to find some way out where he can appear to have a rationale other than bowing to economic and military pressure from the United States.''
There are dissents from the view that the Iraqis are open to compromise.
''It is still feasible that he would say okay to a compromise, but I don't think it is in the cards'' said Dominique Moisi, deputy director of the French Institute on International Relations. ''What can he do? Basically nothing. I don't think he has options any longer. He has cornered himself into a position from which he cannot exit. If I were to be brutal, I would say he can only lose face or lose his power and life.''
What shape might a compromise take?
Mr. Hussein's overall goal, most diplomats agree, is dominance of the Persian Gulf through military strength and control of oil pricing. There is no disposition whatever among the United States and its partners to grant him anything as part of a deal that would put him closer to those aims.
But by his own accounts and those of more disinterested parties, such as Henry M. Schuler of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, an expert on oil and the Middle East, Mr. Hussein has more limited goals, too: less tenuous access to the Persian Gulf for his tankers, higher oil prices and a larger share of the enormous Rumalia oil field straddling the Kuwait-Iraq border, which can produce up to a million barrels of crude oil a day.
Those might be accommodated, at least in part, in a settlement.
 
Kuwait's Economic Resistance
By raising its output and opposing higher prices in the months before Mr. Hussein's attack, Kuwait made it impossible for Iraq to increase its oil revenues to gain the money needed to rebuild after the long gulf war with Iran. The ''newly assertive, excessively greedy'' Kuwaiti policy, Mr. Schuler said, was designed to deter what Kuwait took as Baghdad's designs on its territory. It had the opposite effect. ''We cannot tolerate this type of economic warfare which is being waged against Iraq,'' Mr. Hussein said in a speech to a closed session of an emergency conference of the Arab League in Baghdad on May 30. ''I say that we have reached a state of affairs where we cannot withstand the pressure.''
Then there is the question of access to the Persian Gulf, which has become an obsession for Iraqis. As a result of the Uqair conference of 1922, at which Britain carved up a remnant of the Ottoman Empire into pieces that became modern Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, Iraq alone among the three was denied a satisfactory outlet to the sea. That became an especially galling circumstance when the Shatt al-Arab was closed to tankers by the gulf war between Iraq and Iran.
 
'Needs Ladder to Climb Down'
Iraq's only usable port now is Umm Qasr, at the mouth of a subsidiary channel of the Shatt al-Arab which the Iraqis have been dredging. Berths and other port facilities at Umm Qasr have been expanded. But ships must take one of two paths around Bubiyan Island, which is in Kuwait territory, to reach the gulf from Umm Qasr.
Another element of a compromise might therefore be a long-term lease of Bubiyan Island, which Baghdad had been seeking before the invasion.
Israeli officials see real significance in the fact that when Iraq declared most of Kuwait a new Iraqi province last month, it did not include Bubiyan and Warba, a smaller, less strategic island. They were declared part of Basra province, and a senior Israeli military officer said that might mean Mr. Hussein intended to try to keep them while yielding Kuwait proper as part of a crisis-ending compromise.
''It is clear to me that Saddam Hussein is flexible and powerful enough that he can pull out of Kuwait, if the alternative is his extinction or anything close to that,'' said Amatzia Bar-Am, an expert on Iraq at Haifa University. ''But he needs a ladder to climb down in order to do that.''

HEADLINE: GULF CRISIS CLOUDS ELECTION OUTLOOK IN U.S. CAMPAIGNS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 1

 BODY:
Taking to the stump this Labor Day weekend for the traditional start of the fall campaigns, politicians are confronted with a terrain in which the two most powerful forces shaping any election, peace and prosperity, could shift from under them like Arabian sands.
It has been a long time, candidates and their aides say, since so many global uncertainties have seemed so likely to shake up the political scene in the 66 days between now and Election Day.
Democrats had hoped this election would be about the sagging economy, the savings and loan scandal, the environment, abortion and education. And they continue to press those issues, as do some Republicans. But domestic concerns, which normally dominate midterm elections, are suddenly being overshadowed by the biggest international crisis in a generation. 
As a result, the issues have shifted back toward foreign policy and national defense, areas of traditional Republican strength, a development that Republicans hope will hold through Election Day and protect them from the losses that the President's party would be expected to suffer in a midterm election.
 
Expectations Upside Down
The Middle East crisis has confounded the expectations around which many campaigns were built. Challengers who thought the anti-politician mood in the land would make this a good year for them are struggling for attention. And candidates in general are finding it hard to keep their political footing and almost impossible to know what the political terrain will look like a few weeks, or even a few days, ahead.
Will there be war in the Persian Gulf? If there is, how will it go? Will the economy continue to deteriorate? Will the budget talks remain stalemated and force politically unpalatable automatic across-the-board budget cuts just weeks before the election?
These are among the major unknowns as candidates fan out in their quest for the 35 Senate seats, 435 House seats, 36 governor's chairs and 6,257 state legislative seats at stake on Nov. 6.
The speed with which outside events have altered the scene can be seen in one of the country's most hotly contested House races, in northwest Oregon. Representative Denny Smith, a Republican, was on the ropes earlier this summer as his Democratic opponent, Mike Kopetski, hammered him for his ties to a failed savings and loan association.
Then on the day that Iraq invaded Kuwait, Mr. Kopetski said the United States should avoid the use of military force and should work through the United Nations to resolve the crisis. Now it is Mr. Smith who is on the offensive, using radio advertisements that begin with Adolf Hitler screaming in German and follow with an announcer who says, ''Mike, appeasement is wrong.'' Mr. Kopetski now has to spend his time emphasizing that he supports President Bush's policy in the gulf.
 
Few Real Contests
But even a major crisis in the Middle East could not change some realities of American politics. The system has become so constricted that the outcome of many races, particularly for Federal office, is already assured. The battle between Mr. Smith and Mr. Kopetski is one of fewer than 50 races in the House and a dozen in the Senate that will be truly contested this fall, as the advantages of office - particularly the ability to raise money - make most incumbents impregnable.
Yet both sides believe a lot is at stake. Republicans would like to make gains in Congress, or at least prevent major losses, so they can make a major run at the Democrats in 1992, when George Bush will be at the top of the ticket and most House members will be running in districts newly drawn in the wake of to the 1990 census. And there is far more national interest than usual in races for state office this year, because governors and legislators elected in November will draw the new Congressional districts.
 
Focus on Redistricting
Republicans see redistricting as their last chance in this century to break the Democratic hold on the House, so they are pouring workers and money into races for governor and state legislature. Democrats are responding in kind to protect their 36-year hold on the House.
Democrats control 29 of the 50 governorships and say they are certain to pick up more on Election Day. But in several crucial races, from Ohio to Florida to California, the governors' contests could go either way.
The race for governor in California, the single biggest prize of this busy election year, is rated a tossup between Dianne Feinstein, the Democrat, and Senator Pete Wilson, the Republican.
While some consultants detect a greater resistance to negative campaigning, this California race demonstrates the continuing nasty quality of American politics. Ms. Feinstein and Mr. Wilson spent most of August trying to tie each other to the savings and loan scandal. What resulted, a recent poll by The Los Angeles Times indicates, was a considerable increase in the disapproval that Californians expressed toward both candidates.
A Wilson adviser, Don Sipple, said the month had been a victory for Mr. Wilson because his negative rating rose less than Ms. Feinstein's.
 
Rise in Campaign Spending
Although many candidates say the fear of economic hard times and the taint of political scandal have made it harder to raise money, the figures show that the amount of money being raised and spent on campaigns is still rising. House and Senate candidates had raised $279 million by the end of June, up 3.3 percent from the same point in 1988, and spent $191.8 million, a 5.8 percent increase, according to the Federal Election Commission.
In many places taxes remain an important issue. Proposals to limit budgets or lower taxes will be on the ballot from Massachusetts to California. So will proposals to raise taxes, as legislators avoid a vote on raising taxes themselves, instead asking the voters.
Frustration with the political system has also bubbled over in ballot proposals to limit the terms that office holders can serve. Two initiatives affecting state office holders are on the ballot in California, and in Colorado voters are being offered a proposal that would limit not only the terms of state legislators, but also those of the state's Congressional delegation. A 12-year limit for state office in Oklahoma is on the primary ballot on Sept. 18.
 
Looking at Military Records
The gulf crisis has already thrown off many a campaign. Candidates who were promising to pay for anything from health programs to tax cuts with the ''peace dividend'' hoped for as a result of the easing of superpower tensions suddenly find the money being spent in the gulf instead.
Other candidates find that the surge in support for the military has made their own military record, or lack of one, more interesting to voters than it might have been a few years ago. For example, Representative Roy Dyson, a five-term Democrat from southern Maryland and a strong supporter of the military, found himself under siege this week when it was disclosed that he had been a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War.
Such an emphasis on military records has implications for national politicians as otherwise different as Vice President Dan Quayle, who avoided Vietnam by serving in the National Guard, and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, who had student deferments during the Korean War.
An expert on Congressional races, Prof. Michael S. Lewis-Beck of the University of Iowa, said basic forces, like the state of the economy and the standing of the President, were a better guide to the outcome of the fall campaigns than shifting events. Based on that, he and a colleague, Tom Rice, predict that the Republicans will lose 18 seats in the House and 3 in the Senate.
A month ago many Republicans shared that pessimism. But the gulf crisis changed that. ''If we were sitting here today debating the economy, or debating the S.& L. crisis and debating abortion,'' said Edward Rollins, co-chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, ''I'd say these are not exactly the three campaign issues I want to run on.''
A New York Times/CBS News Poll in mid-August showed that the gulf situation had helped divert some Americans' attention from issues on which the Republicans are vulnerable, like the economy, to issues of foreign policy and defense, where the Republicans are stronger.
More than one out of every five Americans in the poll said the gulf crisis was the most important issue facing the country, and those were also considerably more likely to say that Republicans were better at handling the issue. Correspondingly, those who picked the economy as the most important issue tended to favor Democrats to handle it better.
Frank Greer, a Democratic consultant to several candidates for senator and governor, said public interest in Middle East would wane if the stalemate there continued, allowing domestic issues to return to the fore by Election Day.
In the meantime, he said, Democrats are not helpless. Paul Hubbert, the party's candidate for governor in Alabama, gets his biggest applause, Mr. Greer said, when he calls on President Bush and the Republicans to crack down on price gouging by the oil companies.
''This is a governor's race in Alabama,'' Mr. Greer said. ''People feel Republicans are more on the side of oil companies.''

HEADLINE: Redone Ellis Island: Burnished but Not Brash

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
When the newly repaired Statue of Liberty was unveiled in 1986, the accompanying Liberty Weekend celebration became an apotheosis of the 1980's, a four-day, multimillion-dollar extravaganza of fireworks, patriotic kitsch and corporate boosterism.
Now, as its sister landmark, Ellis Island, much of which has been restored and finely burnished as the Museum of Immigration, is readied to receive the public on Sept. 10, the mood is distinctly more subdued.
Ellis Island, the harrowing gateway for millions of terrified but hopeful refugees, more than any other place has come to symbolize the definitive American experience, immigration. From 1892 to 1924, 12 million people sought entry on its barren shores.
 
Honoring All Immigrants
But the museum itself honors all American immigrants, whether they came here freely or as slaves. It is a more complex and somber landmark than the Statue of Liberty. The sober, unflamboyant way in which it will be unveiled is also a testimony to the times. 
This time the ceremony will not include 850 drill team girls, 5,000 homing pigeons or a single Elvis Presley impersonator.
The refurbished immigration building, a grand Beaux-Arts palace of turrets and vaulted ceilings that was designed more to awe than reassure, takes up seven acres of the island. Nearby, there is an Art Deco ferry terminal, built as a Works Progress Administration project in the 1930's. It provided work during the Depression, but was rarely used.
The remaining 20 acres are dotted with 19th-century buildings that once served as hospital wards, baggage rooms or dormitories. The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, a private association responsible for financing and supervising the restorations, had initially envisioned turning the southern part of the island into a grandiose historical amusement park, an immigration theme park that critics quickly called an ''ethnic Disneyland.''
Instead, the National Park Service, which manages Ellis Island, decided to lease those buildings to a real-estate developer who would begin restoring them in 1990 as part of a $100 million world conference center. So far, the developer, William Hubbard, director of the Center for Housing Partnerships, has been unable to nail down investors.
 
Limits on Corporate Largess
A long-planned genealogical tracing center for the island, a computerized archive of all Ellis Island immigrants, remains unfinanced, a testimony to new limits on corporate largess.
Scattered across the landscape of Ellis Island are other, more lasting signs of a newly troubled economic climate.
Near the beautifully reconstructed $156 million registration hall that houses the museum are unrestored, dilapidated buildings that await development, a tribute to New York's stagnant real-estate market.
A black-tie benefit dinner for patrons will be held on Sept. 8, to raise money for the dedication the next day. That ceremony will be solemn, reverent and studiously short on extravagance.
 
No Glitz This Time
''It's going to be a dignified, tasteful ceremony, nothing glitzy or splashy,'' said Donald Mischer, an award-winning producer of television variety specials, who will provide the entertainment for the dinner and the dedication.
''In 1986 we were in a great patriotic surge,'' said Stephen Briganti, president of the foundation. ''Now the economy is not as good, and there are serious problems in the world, like Iraq.''
''We wanted something serious for Ellis Island,'' Mr. Briganti said, ''something more cerebral.''
The Liberty Weekend celebration, which was paid for from money raised for the restoration, ran $10 million over budget. Mr. Briganti said that the pared-down 1990 event would cost ''a fraction'' of Liberty Weekend, but declined to specify how much.
The Ellis Island Restoration Commission has been developing a high-tech Family History Center that would enable visitors to enter their names in a computer and trace their ancestors through Ellis Island. So far, the sponsors have collected biographical data on 17 million immigrants, but have been unable to raise the $14 million the project would require.
 
Costs Dampen Enthusiasm
''When you talk to companies, they all love the idea,'' Stephen Fenton, an advertising executive and commission member, said, ''until you tell them the cost.''
And few of the corporations that sponsored the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island restoration, paying $3 million to $5 million in exchange for promotional opportunities, have elected to use Ellis Island in product advertising.
''The big hitters did not see a way to get involved with Ellis Island,'' said Lee A. Iacocca, the chairman of Chrysler, who headed the restoration fund-raising effort. ''The statue is an icon, a world symbol. Ellis Island is a much tougher sell.''
In 1984, in what was considered a landmark of private-sector initiative -and marketing-driven philanthropy -the restoration was mostly financed by corporations. Mr. Iacocca, energetic, brash and, at the time, impervious to critics' charges that he had commercialized the Statue of Liberty, raised more than $300 million by selling 21 corporations extensive tie-ins for their products.
 
'Other Priorities This Year'
A.T.& T., which did not get involved with the Statue of Liberty events in the 1980's, became an Ellis Island sponsor and is currently using Ellis Island as a theme in its long-distance telephone advertising. But most of the corporations that bought the right to use the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island logo for advertising in 1984 are not taking advantage of it this time around.
''We have other priorities this year; it's just not in the budget for a major promotional campaign around Ellis Island,'' explained John Barr, director of marketing for the Eastman Kodak Company.
''The statue was like the flag or Uncle Sam, an identifiable symbol that companies could make use of in a positive, bombastic way,'' said Carol Connell, public affairs director for Joseph E. Seagram & Sons. ''There is nothing bombastic about Ellis Island. It hasn't got the same hoopla.''
Stephen A. Greyser, a professor of marketing at Harvard Business School, said: ''Companies have less money; their advertising budgets are squeezed. Events like this are a fringe or luxury activity and are not on the budget list.''
 
Mixed Reviews of 1986 Hoopla
Also, memories of the manner and extent to which companies marketed the Statue of Liberty - there were Statue of Liberty air fresheners and swizzle sticks - remain mixed.
''It was rather difficult last time,'' said a spokesman for a major corporate sponsor who spoke on the condiditon of anonymity, and whose company has refrained from developing an Ellis Island promotional campaign. ''There was a great deal of negative publicity about the selling the statue. I can't imagine many companies were impressed with the reception they got as sponsors.''
This time, corporations that have contributed from $3 million to $5 million are choosing to soft-sell their participation.
Eastman Kodak, for example, underwrote the Augustus Sherman Gallery, a collection of photographs taken by an Ellis Island clerk in the 1890's. The company's donation is quietly acknowledged in a plaque.
 
It's the Public's Turn
''I got chastized for allowing Coca-Cola and U.S. Tobacco to 'desecrate' the statue,'' Mr. Iacocca said of his 1986 marketing blitz. ''We didn't push it too hard this time. Why commercialize? We don't need any more money.'' He was referring to the foundation's restoration projects.
When the foundation did, in fact, decide that it needed additional money to create an endowment to help cover the National Park Service's maintenance costs, it turned not to corporations, but to the public, with a scheme called the Ellis Island Wall of Honor.
Donors sent contributions of $100 to $10,000 to have their ancestors' names, regardless of whether they came through Ellis Island, written on copper plaques placed on top of the sea wall that surrounds the museum.
''I saw my name in bronze on the Statue of Liberty,'' Mr. Iacocca said, explaining the origin of the idea, ''And I thought thousands of other people would also like to have their names up there.''
Almost 200,000 people sent in checks, ranging from Barbara Bush, who paid $100 to commemorate one of her ancestors, Thomas Thayer, who emigrated from England in 1630, to a Washington restaurateur, Duke Zeibert, who paid $10,000 to have his Polish emigre parents' names inscribed on the wall. The foundation raised $20 million by selling donors the opportunity to have their family names inscribed on the Wall of Honor, and is building a second wall to accommodate continuing demand.
The Wall of Honor is the one departure from Ellis Island's rigorously accurate historical restoration, one that the National Park Service agreed to, warily.
''Maybe we wouldn't have done that wall, there are a lot of purists in the Park Service,'' said Herbert Cables, deputy director of the National Park Service. ''But the foundation raised $300 million, and we owe a great deal to that process. We are in no position to second guess.''

HEADLINE: Who Decides Who Works At Jobs Imperiling Fetuses?

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BENNINGTON, Vt., Sept. 1

 BODY:
The unobtrusive factory, tucked behind a hillside shopping center in this little college town, runs all day and all night seven days a week. The 280 production workers make lead automobile batteries for Sears, Goodyear and other big customers. Only 12 workers are women, and none of them can have children. The company won't hire any who can.
The air inside this plant, and at 15 others owned by Johnson Controls Inc. of Milwaukee, is laced with tiny particles of lead and lead oxide, indisputably toxic substances. The company says the levels of lead are low enough for adults but excessive for children and fetuses.
The only female production workers employed by Johnson, the nation's leading maker of automobile batteries, are those like Virginia Green, who are too old to become pregnant, or those like Cheryl Chalifoux and Cheryl Cook, who have had surgery to see that they do not become pregnant. The company makes no exceptions for women who abstain from sex or use contraception. ''The issue is protecting the health of unborn children,'' a company statement says. 
 
Alarms Are Raised
Johnson's policy, in effect for eight years, has begun to arouse working women's advocates in much the way the abortion debate has. A few other companies, including General Motors, have adopted the practice, and the advocates fear that more will cite other potential causes of miscarriage and fetal injury, like heavy lifting and exposure to other substances, in excluding women from the workplace.
In one of the major cases facing the United States Supreme Court this year, it has agreed to hear an appeal in October from the United Automobile Workers, which represents many of Johnson's employees. The union contends that the policy violates the 1964 Civil Rights Act barring workplace discrimination against women and minorities, and jeopardizes women's hard-won gains in male-dominated industries.
The union argues that the lead in the plants is also dangerous for men, although evidence of its effect on male reproductive organs is scant and inconclusive. So men can apply for the jobs, which are among the best-paying in a small town like Bennington, while most working-age women are excluded.
 
Company Denies Bias
The company says it is not biased against women, and it denies allegations that its policy means it does not trust women. ''You can't turn aside our concern for a child's health,'' said Denise M. Zutz, spokeswoman for the company. ''That's at the center of our position. At the same time, we have a legitimate position in protecting our shareholders' interest.''
The workers maintain that the lead in the plant is excessive for everyone, and that the company could do more to make it safer for everyone.
''We wish we knew of a way to do that,'' Ms. Zutz said. In the company's view, there is no economically feasible way to reduce the lead levels significantly. Johnson Controls, citing concerns about competition, declined to let reporters look inside the plant here or talk to its management.
The company spokeswoman said Johnson sees the issue as both a humanitarian concern, protecting fetuses, and an economic one, avoiding both the costly protective measures that would reduce lead exposure and the risk of lawsuits if any babies are born damaged.
 
Privacy Issue Is Raised
But many women's advocates see the issue in different terms. They say the debate in a way is even more basic than the debate over abortion rights, since it calls into question not only a woman's control of her fetus but also her control of her unfertilized eggs.
They say the policy also raises a question of privacy, in that by taking a job at Johnson a woman in effect lets the world know she is sterile, and that it raises the question of who knows what is best for a woman.
''It doesn't matter what I do in there,'' said Ms. Chalifoux, the 31-year-old single mother of two young children, who left a factory job here paying a maximum of $6.34 an hour to work for Johnson Controls for up to $15 an hour. ''I can't have children.'' Ms. Chalifoux had a doctor block the two Fallopian tubes, which carry eggs to the uterus, so she would have no more children.
She did not make that decision in order to get the job, but she can now reap the economic benefits of her decision.
Still, she said, the policy is unfair and degrading. ''It's your body,'' she said. ''They're implying they're doing it for your own good.''
 
'They Don't Trust You'
Ms. Cook, 34, a married mother of two, had surgery for the same reasons and joined Ms. Chalifoux in leaving the other company to go to Johnson Controls. ''I work right in the lead,'' she said. ''I make the oxide. But you should choose for yourself. Myself, I wouldn't go in there if I could get pregnant. But they don't trust you.''
In 1982, when Johnson Controls adopted the fetal protection policy, Ms. Green moved from her job stacking lead plates for batteries to a job in the company laundry, where lead levels are low. She was 50 then, the mother of a 10-year-old daughter, and still able to have children.
''They called me into the office and told me I couldn't be on my job any more because I was fertile,'' Ms. Green said. ''I feel that's your own business. They didn't say, Sorry; they just told me I was moving.''
 
Says Opportunities Were Lost
Management has continued to pay her plate-stacker wages, not a laundry worker's lower wage. But she says she has lost opportunities to do other jobs, although she is infertile now. The plant runs on three shifts - 7 A.M. to 3:30 P.M., 3 P.M. to 11:30 P.M., and 11 P.M. to 7:30 A.M. - and she said she has lost her claim on the first shift.
''Since time immemorial,'' said Isabelle Katz Pinzler, director of women's rights at the American Civil Liberties Unnion, ''the excuse for keeping women in their place has been because of their role in producing the next generation. The attitude of Johnson Controls is: 'We know better than you. We can't allow women to make this decision. We have to make it for them.' ''
Ms. Pinzler said no one had yet found an indisputable case of a lead-damaged child born to a lead worker. But occupational health experts say there is no doubt that a child could suffer birth defects because of his mother's exposure to lead.
But the company says it has a moral obligation to the parties that cannot participate in the woman's decision: the unfertilized ovum and the fetus. It says it also has a financial obligation to stockholders, who would bear the brunt of suits brought by employees' children born with retardation or nervous system disorders and other health effects that lead can cause.
 
Arguments Set Oct. 10
The Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments about the policy on Oct. 10. The U.A.W. seeks a reversal of a 7-to-4 decision last October by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago. That court acknowledged the burden the company places on women, but it agreed with the company that the policy was a ''business necessity'' allowed under the civil rights law.
For the implications of the decision, women's groups cite the opinion of a dissenter on the Chicago court, Judge Frank H. Easterbrook, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan. Judge Easterbrook called the case ''likely the most important'' involving sex discrimination since enactment of the civil rights law. ''If the majority is right,'' he wrote, ''then by one estimate, 20 million industrial jobs could be closed to women, for many substances in addition to lead pose fetal risks.''
In explaining Johnson Controls' decision not to let reporters inside, Ms. Zutz said making batteries was a competitive business and a visitor could learn something about the production of the company's batteries and pass it on to another maker. But union leaders and employees here said the company worried that someone might observe cases of lead contamination that exceeded even those allowable for adults.
Mark Santelli, the president of the U.A.W. local, said conditions were ''110 percent better'' than they were a decade ago. The company has provided respirators to about 75 workers, all with lead in the blood approaching magnitudes deemed unsafe. It provides workers with uniforms, pays them to take showers before leaving by counting shower time as work time and has installed an elaborate vacuuming system that changes the plant's air 100 times an hour, blowing in fresh air from the roof and sucking it out through grates on the floor.
Even so, Mr. Santelli said, lead particles waft through the plant, getting into clothing and settling as a fine dust on the machinery. And on occasion the vacuuming system backfires. He said the leaded dust sucked out of the plant was collected in bags, but sometimes the dampers malfunctioned and the dust was blown back into the plant.
 
From Metal to Paste
Ms. Cook runs the ball mill, a two-story-tall tumbling machine that makes the lead oxide, which is transported from the mill to a mixing tower, where the oxide is formed into a paste. The paste is then compressed to make the lead plates that become the core of the batteries.
Ingots of lead, about two feet long and four inches thick, are put into the tumbler. With heat and oxygen, the ingots are spun around and around, until they turn to dust.
Appparently because of her exposure to the lead, the company gave her a special helmet, one that blows fresh air over her nose and mouth. ''They said I had to wear it,'' she recalled. ''So I wore it and then they said this other guy needed it. All of a sudden they decided I didn't need it any more.''
Some people are more susceptible to lead contamination of the blood than others, said Joanne Leard, the union's health and safety monitor at the plant. She said Ms. Cook was among the more susceptible. As a relatively new employee, Ms. Cook is laid off when business slows in December and rehired in May, when it resumes. By the time Ms. Cook leaves on layoff, Ms. Leard said, the lead in her blood is close to the maximum allowable level and then recedes while she is out of work.
 
Five Months With pay
Men are affected in the same way, Ms. Leard said. About two years ago, a 25-year employee of the plant had to be sent home for five months at full pay, as required by law, to let the lead in his blood recede.
''He came back to work when it was down, but it's back up again even though he works in a low-lead area,'' she said. ''He now has dizziness, aches in his joints and constipation.''
''They're so concerned about protecting the female,'' Ms. Leard said. ''They should protect the men as well.'' Some people think the real issue ought to be occupational safety, not sex discrimination. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration says it has no plans to reduce its 12-year-old maximums for lead.
In the Supreme Court case, Joseph A. Kinney, executive director of the National Safe Workplace Institute in Chicago, has filed a brief on behalf of Johnson Controls, but he said that was only because letting women assume the burden of their safety undermined OSHA's responsibility in mandating safety.
''The discrimination side of the issue needs to be resolved,'' Mr. Kinney said. ''But the ideal thing is to regulate lead out of the workplace and any other toxin that poses fetal damage.''

GRAPHIC: Photos: The United Automobile Workers union contends that Johnson Controls' policy prohibiting the hiring of women who can bear children violates the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear the union's case against the Milwaukee automobile-battery manufacturer in October; ''They should protect the men as well,'' said Joanne Leard, left, who monitors safety for the union. The company says lead levels in the factory are safe for adults but excessive for fetuses, but Ms. Leard says adults of both sexes suffer ill effects.

HEADLINE: Gas Lines Form in Poland to Beat Rising Price

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARSAW, Sept. 1

 BODY:
While Poland's elite gathered this week in Gdansk to celebrate Solidarity's glorious past, the nation's drivers were treated to an uneasy glimpse of what may become this country's future: gas lines.
Poland imports all its oil from the Soviet Union and Middle East and the queues began snaking around the gas stations immediately after the Government said on Thursday that prices would go up 33 percent beginning today. The announcement caused throngs of Poles to line up for one last tankful at the old price.
The lines lessened on Saturday. But senior Government officials say they may well return this fall if Poland is unable to make up a shortfall caused both by a cutback in shipments from the Soviet Union and the loss of oil from Iraq. 
Jan Nowokowski, a purchasing official at the state-run Ciech company, on Friday confirmed reports in the Polish press that the country has only a two to three weeks' supply of oil on hand. Mr. Nowokowski said he was now trying to buy oil from Britain and Iran. He appealed to the United States to persuade Saudia Arabia to change its policy and sell oil to Poland. ''Things are getting worse rather than better,'' Andrzej Porebiak said as he waited his turn at a station in the outskirts of Warsaw. ''Maybe they should change some ministers. The people at the top don't think about what it's like out here.''
 
Political Effects Pondered
Sentiments like that worry senior officials in the Government of Tadeusz Mazowiecki who fear that the mixture of higher gas prices - and possibly tight supplies - may prove politically volatile this fall. No date has been set for national elections, but they are widely expected within months. Mr. Mazowiecki and his Government have appeared to be increasingly vulnerable to criticism by Lech Walesa, the Solidarity chairman and undeclared candidate for President whose political appeal is based on the premise that the people ''on the top'' are out of touch with the workers.
That suggestion is likely to be reinforced by the Government's handling of the price increases. Rumors had begun to circulate about a week ago, but the announcement was made Thursday on the eve of the Polish equivalent of Labor Day weekend. School opens on Monday here, and families returning from the seaside and mountains were fighting the traffic jams brought on by the gas lines.
The rise in gasoline prices, officials here said, was caused both by the loss of 750,000 tons of Iraqi oil and the continuing effect of a shortfall in Soviet deliveries, which were 20 percent behind what had been contracted. Poland had hoped to buy 12 million of its 14 million tons of oil this year from Moscow but, as in other Eastern European countries, problems in the Soviet oil industry have caused this year's deliveries to fall well below what was expected.
All this made Poland's decision to join the economic boycott of Iraq a complicated one, particularly in view of the Government's precarious public standing. ''We had no doubt we had to do it,'' one senior Polish official said last month of the sanctions. ''But it was extremely complicated for us. In our economic and political situation, to have in a few weeks a gasoline shortage is extremely hard and could have some real consequences.'' As the lines blocked traffic across the country Friday, most of the Government gathered in the city of Gdansk to mark the 10th anniversary of the Aug. 31, 1980, agreement that ended a strike at the shipyard and began Solidarity's 16 months as a free trade union.
In two days of celebrations in Gdansk, Mr. Walesa and Mr. Mazowiecki traded salvos over whether the Government was doing enough to encourage broad political participation. Neither declared his presidential candidacy, but there were hints from both sides signaling the end of the ''cucumber season,'' the Polish idiom for the dog days of August.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Gorbachev Steps Into the Gulf Lineup

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 1

 BODY:
In the briefest possible announcement, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev informed the Soviet nation tonight that he had elected to become a far more visible world player in the critical standoff over Iraq's invasion and seizure of Kuwait.
The announcement, a single sentence at the beginning of the national television news show, Vremya, was a simple mention that President Bush and President Gorbachev ''are due to meet in Helsinki on Sunday, September 9, to discuss international and bilateral issues.''
No elaboration was offered and no reference was made to Iraq. But the sudden summit announcement made the chief topic clear, coming only a day after Mr. Gorbachev stressed his own concern that ''the building up of military confrontation might lead to unpredictable consequences'' in the tense Persian Gulf. 
 
Chance to Explain U.S. Buildup
The meeting in Helsinki, the Finnish capital, marks a further step in the evolution of closer, more peaceful relations between the erstwhile cold war rivals, with the two national leaders concentrating world attention on an imminent crisis about which they have expressed basic agreement.
Beyond that, the meeting will afford Mr. Bush an opportunity to respond to some Soviet misgivings of late over the White House's precise military intention in packing large numbers of troops into Saudi Arabia.
After three weeks of quietly tolerating the American buildup, Soviet officials began questioning the nature of the United States military strategy this week. In comments before a parliamentary committee, Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Belonogov declared that there were ''no guarantees that the United States will leave Saudi Arabia after the crisis is over.''
Mr. Belonogov, who has been a principal in Moscow's collaboration with the West in opposing the Kuwait invasion, noted that the Soviet Union had never approved the deployment of American troops in Saudi Arabia and that the situation was becoming ''more and more explosive.''
 
Mediation, Not Force
But Mr. Gorbachev himself diplomatically took some of the edge off that criticism in remarks Friday at a news conference. The Soviet leader again strongly condemned the Iraqi annexation of Kuwait and echoed the Kremlin's position of a month ago when a joint Soviet-American statement was issued demanding that Iraq roll back its annexation of Kuwait.
While repeatedly stressing the need for political mediation, not force, in the gulf crisis, Mr. Gorbachev said the United States military presence was at the invitation of the Saudis and in conformance with the United Nations charter. He rejected a news correspondent's suggestion that policy differences might be arising between the Kremlin and the White House as the buildup grows.
''We all have to be very responsible so that military conflict will not break out,'' he declared. ''This is our mutual concern,'' he said of the United States. ''If you think it shows a difference in policy, I think it shows cooperation.''
The presence of Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev standing together in reiterating their criticism of the Iraqi attack will provide a graphic new factor in the attempt to exert world moral pressure and force President Saddam Hussein to withdraw his troops from Kuwait.
 
Boon for Global Solidarity
As much as the meeting is an obvious boon to Mr. Bush in his campaign to demonstrate global solidarity against Iraq, it will also allow Mr. Gorbachev to remind his own troubled people, so distracted by economic woes, that Soviet prestige remains an important factor in world affairs.
In speaking of the Kuwait crisis on Friday, Mr. Gorbachev again supported sanctions against Iraq, but he stressed the view that only political efforts, not military force, would produce success. He urged all parties to double their political efforts at ''not allowing the conflict to reach a dangerous phase.'' In particular, the Soviet leader said the political role of Arab nations should be used more.
''We should try to find keys to a peaceful settlement of this acute international conflict through using the Arab factor,'' he said.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Saudi Minister Says U.S. Force Is Only Defensive

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia, Sept. 1

 BODY:
Saudi Arabia's Defense Minister said today that his country could not be used as a staging ground by the American military for rescuing hostages under Iraqi control or for beginning offensive attacks against Iraq.
''The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is not a theater for any action that is not defensive for Saudi Arabia,'' the Defense Minister, Prince Sultan, said. He said the large American military force here could be used only to defend Saudi Arabia. 
Prince Sultan's comment came in response to a question at a news conference here at which he also complained that news reports about possible military action against Iraq were ''escalating the situation.''
The Defense Minister's comments were the most explicit recent statement by Saudi officials about the role that American forces are to play here.
 
The U.S. View
While President Bush has said that American forces are being sent to Saudi Arabia for defensive purposes, he has also bluntly warned Iraq that he is holding Baghdad responsible for the safety of American hostages under Iraqi control and has stressed that Iraqi troops must leave Kuwait.
Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander of American forces in the region, told reporters on Friday that there would not be a war unless Iraq starts one. But at the same time, General Schwarzkopf declined to rule out offensive action against Iraq, saying that he would not answer hypothetical questions.
Lower-ranking American military officers have talked about the possibility of attacks on Iraqi forces in Kuwait and Iraq, suggesting the range of options in a debate over whether Washington should take military action to force Iraqi troops out of Kuwait and topple President Saddam Hussein, or wait for months to see whether economic sanctions work.
 
Senators Divided on Timetable
The debate was reflected in a visit today by 14 United States Senators to American troops here. David Durenberger, Republican of Minnesota, told a marine that the standoff will not go on indefinitely.
He said the United States will take stronger action if necessary ''in another month or so,'' adding that ''there is a limit to the expectations a lot of people have about how long American forces can stay in this part of the world.''
But Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, took a contrary view. ''I think it is best that we not set a timetable,'' Mr. Levin said, adding, ''We have to get ready psychologically and militarily here and at home for our being here a long time.''
Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, said, ''It is obvious that the President's strategy will take some time because the economic impact of the embargo has to bite on Iraq.''
 
Support for Arms to Saudis
About half of the Senators here had opposed arms sales to Saudi Arabia in the past. But today some said they would support new arms sales to Saudi Arabia. ''I was the leader of the opposition, but not anymore,'' said Alan Cranston, Democrat of California. ''Now they are allied with us. They are sitting on the front lines. They will take the first casualties.''
''Obviously, we will be a lot more receptive than I was previously'' to a Saudi arms package, said Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
A Month of Crisis in the Persian Gulf

 BODY:
Aug. 2 Iraq invades Kuwait hours after talks broke down between the two nations over oil production and debt repayment. Iraqi troops seize vast petroleum reserves and Kuwait's capital, plunging the Persian Gulf region into crisis. Witnesses report hundreds of casualties. The Kuwaiti ruler flees. President Bush calls the invasion ''naked aggression.'' The United Nations Security Council votes overwhelmingly to condemn it and demand the Iraqis' immediate and total withdrawal.
Aug. 3 Iraqis move into position for a possible attack on Saudi Arabia. Baghdad announces that its troops will begin withdrawing Aug. 5 unless the security of Iraq or of occupied Kuwait is threatened. 
Aug. 4 The Iraqi occupiers fortify positions in Kuwait. The 12 nations of the European Community impose an immediate embargo on oil imports from Iraq and Kuwait. Hasty plans for an Arab summit meeting fall apart.
Aug. 5 Mr. Bush, all but committing himself to use military force against the Iraqis if necessary, says their assault ''will not stand.'' Their withdrawal, he says, is the only acceptable outcome.
Aug. 6 The United Nations Security Council orders a sweeping trade and financial boycott on Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
Aug. 7 The United States says Iraqi forces, having overrun Kuwait, pose an imminent threat to Saudi Arabia. Washington orders American armor, jet fighters and paratroopers to the Saudi kingdom.
Aug. 8 Thousands of American troops are deployed on Saudi soil, which Mr. Bush vows to protect.
Aug. 9 United States and allied naval forces in the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea and Persian Gulf will soon begin enforcing a blockade on Iraqi trade, Bush Administration officials say.
Aug. 10 The Arab League votes to send troops to Saudi Arabia. Of the league's members, only Libya and the Palestine Liberation Organization openly back the Iraqis as this watershed decision is reached.
Aug. 11 Egyptian and Moroccan troops begin to land in Saudi Arabia. Mr. Bush makes it clear that he will be pleased if the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, is overthrown.
Aug. 12 Mr. Bush orders American forces to block Iraqi oil exports and all imports to Iraq except some food shipments, Administration officials say.
Aug. 14 Pentagon officials disclose that the United States has deployed more than 20,000 troops in Saudi Arabia. The Administration is considering the partial mobilization of reserve forces to help deter an Iraqi attack there.
Aug. 15 Baghdad offers to meet almost all of Iran's terms for resolving key issues left from their eight-year war. The step is meant to counter Iraq's growing isolation.
Aug. 16 Mr. Bush and King Hussein of Jordan meet for two hours at Kennebunkport, Me., but fail to make progress toward easing the crisis.
Aug. 17 Administration officials say the President has decided to call up a limited number of reservists. The Pentagon commandeers commercial jetliners to carry cargo and troops to the gulf region.
Aug. 18 Saudi Arabia serves notice that it will raise its oil production by two million barrels a day with or without the support of other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. This would equal half the oil kept off the world market by the embargo.
Aug. 19 President Hussein says he will free foreigners being held hostage in Iraq and Kuwait in return for a complete military and political pullout by the United States from the gulf region.
Aug. 20 Iraq begins moving Americans and other non-Iraqis to industrial and military sites for use as human shields against attack. Mr. Bush, for the first time, says the people trapped in Iraq are hostages. He says America will not be intimidated.
Aug. 21 United States naval vessels that are shadowing two loaded Iraqi oil tankers, bound for Yemen, hold in abeyance a threat to halt the vessels forcibly after Yemen declares that it will not unload them.
Aug. 22 The United States announces that along with other countries, it is defying Iraqi orders to close its embassy in Kuwait by Aug. 24. Mr. Bush moves to put thousands of American reservists on active duty.
Aug. 23 Iraq warns the United States and other nations that if they try to keep their embassies open in Kuwait, the Iraqi Government will see that as ''an act of aggression.''
Aug. 24 President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union warns Iraq that he is prepared to back further measures to tighten the embargo against its commerce. This is a long step forward in isolating Iraq.
Aug. 25 By a vote of 13 to 0, with 2 abstentions, the Security Council adopts a resolution that gives the United States and other nations the right to enforce the embargo by stopping vessels under way to or from Iraq.
Aug. 27 American officials say Iraq has reversed its orders to its merchant vessels and has told them not to offer resistance if United States or other naval forces, in carrying out the blockade, try to board the ships to inspect them.
Aug. 28 President Hussein announces that he will permit all foreign women and children to leave Iraq; he had earlier barred their departure. Mr. Bush obtains overwhelming support from over 170 members of Congress whom he briefs on the crisis.
Aug. 29 The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries authorizes its key oil producers immediately to start pumping all the petroleum they can. This forstalls a shortage, fears of which have made oil prices surge upward.
Aug. 30 Mr. Bush says he is requesting aid from other nations - including Saudi Arabia, West Germany and Japan - to help cover the enormous costs of economic sanctions and military operations in the gulf region.
Sept. 1 President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union announce that they will meet in Helsinki on Sept. 9, with the Middle East on the agenda. Iraq allows about 750 hostages to leave.

HEADLINE: U.S. Guidelines Address Meatpacking Injuries

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
The Labor Department is establishing a test program in the meatpacking industry to protect workers from painful and crippling injuries caused by repetitive motions.
The new guidelines for the industry resulted from negotiations between industry and union representatives, department officials said Thursday. Compliance is voluntary. The Labor Department is not ordering packing companies to adopt the new guidelines, which will be sent to them in the next few days. But if they do not adopt them, department officials said they would fine packers whose workers have a high incidence of repetitive motion ailments. 
Elizabeth Dole, the Secretary of Labor, said the guidelines would emphasize design of the workplace with the physical needs of workers in mind. New approaches might include revised tool designs, improved safety equipment and rotating workers to reduce repetitive work.
The department plans to study the program's effectiveness and use the results to reduce injuries in other occupations, especially those in which computers are used.
Office workers striking the keyboards of video display terminals and supermarket checkers who sweep items over electronic scanners frequently complain of repetitive motion injuries like carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder of the wrist and hand.
''Repetitive motion injuries, which include lower back injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome and tendon disorders, now comprise 48 percent of all recordable industrial workplace illnesses,'' Mrs. Dole said. ''The economic burden of such injuries to employers and society is enormous.''
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 240,900 workplace illnesses were reported in 1988, the last year for which figures are available.
Mrs. Dole said the beef and pork packing industry was chosen because its 140,000 workers suffer from workplace injuries at a rate 10 times the national average. Meatpackers are often required to repeat the same motion as much as 8,000 times an hour, which can cause cysts, swollen tendons and nerve damage.
 
'Real Protection' Demanded
Mrs. Dole said it would take years of study before any enforceable rules could be established.
A spokesman for Howard M. Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee's Subcommittee on Labor, said the Senator was troubled by the program because it was voluntary and had no enforcement power.
''After 10 years of Administration neglect, American workers deserve real protection,'' Mr. Metzenbaum's spokesman said.
J. Patrick Boyle, president of the American Meat Institute, said the organization had already taken steps to redesign tools and equipment.
Al Zack, a spokesman for the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents 100,000 meatpackers and helped develop the guidelines, said, ''The guidelines are a positive step forward, but without an honest-to-goodness inspection and enforcement program they are meaningless.''

HEADLINE: CAMPUS LIFE: U. of Texas at Dallas;
Something Brand New On Campus: Freshmen

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
The University of Texas at Dallas began the 1990-91 school year on Thursday with a major addition to its campus - freshmen.
Now this 20-year-old commuter institution for upper-level and graduate students has a more authentic college flavor, with teen-agers starting off to class, filling the Student Union building and adding daytime activity to a predominantly evening university where the average age of students has been 30.
Under a new curriculum designed earlier this year, the 111 freshmen, most of them 18 years old, will receive a grounding in liberal arts while concentrating on the primary emphases of the university - research, math, science and engineering.
''The concept here is not another University of Texas at Austin or Texas A&M, but rather a Texas-style Massachusetts Institute of Technology,'' Peter O'Donnell, one of the leaders of the program, has said. 
 
'I'm Really Excited'
Before classes began last week, the newcomers completed a two-day orientation program. They toured the campus, 18 miles north of downtown Dallas, learned about university life and were divided into five groups for extensive discussions with faculty members and administrators. They ended with a Texas-style barbecue at the home of the university's president, Robert Rutford.
''I'm really excited about being a part of the first class,'' Leila Grio, a computer science major from Dallas, said. ''I will be a part of everything they do here to set examples for later classes.''
Michael Anshelevich, a math major who recently emigrated from the Soviet Union, said, ''I think U.T.-Dallas is the best place in Dallas and maybe in Texas for me. It is a good place for mathematics study, and I think I will enjoy it and have a good experience.''
The decision to add freshmen and sophomores to the 8,300-student institution came from a coalition of political and civic leaders working with the Texas Legislature.
Thinking that a four-year school was necessary to compete with the nation's leading colleges in math, science and engineering, the Legislature approved the expansion in July 1989. But the university was forbidden from spending money on recruiting until the Texas Education Coordinating Board approved the program in February.
Christopher A. Parr, the dean of undergraduate studies, then sent 12 representatives to 128 schools in all neighboring Texas counties to find candidates for the first freshman class.
''The law was very specific in its limits,'' Mr. Parr said last week. ''Until the expansion was approved, we were prohibited from devoting any resources to recruitment. Since the final approval came very late in the recruiting process, we had to get off the starting block in record time.''
Despite the late start, the freshmen include four valedictorians, four salutatorians and a National Merit finalist. These first-year students have average combined scores of 1125 on the Scholastics Aptitude Tests (out of a possible 1,600 combined score) and have grade-point averages in the top 10 percent of their graduating classes.
 
'More Noise and Energy'
David Schulz, the university's director of news and information, said the university hopes to expand next year's freshman class to 200 and ''ultimately to about a thousand.''
To accommodate the incoming freshmen, school officials have added six faculty members to maintain the student-faculty ratio at 19 to 1. They also added 20,000 volumes to the library and modified existing laboratory space.
The university is in the middle of a $3 million fund-raising drive to pay for the first two years of the freshman class. Texas Instruments is leading the drive by accepting donations from private businesses, with more than $1.7 million already raised and spent by the university.
But the benefits are worth the price, many upperclassmen say. ''I know that they are going to bring that youthful feeling to the campus, and they will bring a bit more noise and energy as well,'' said Pamela Slayton, a senior public-administration major from Dallas.
Kelly Ward, a junior economics major from Dallas, said, ''A lot of times it's kind of dead on campus, but now it's a bit more rowdy and crazy with the freshmen around. We usually have a big crowd during the evening, and now this will add to the day atmosphere.''
President Rutford added: ''This is a rare event in the U.S. to have an institution started by granting Ph.D.'s and sort of downwardly integrate. There are not many places that have ever done that.''

HEADLINE: CAMPUS LIFE: Roosevelt;
Economics Course Beckons Scholars From Eastern Bloc

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
The first two of Roosevelt University's ''Scholars for Freedom'' from Eastern Europe stepped off the plane at O'Hare International Airport last week, ready for a yearlong course in free-market economics.
The scholarship recipients, Laszlo Pribusz of Gyor, Hungary, and Petr Leidl of Kralupy, Czechoslovakia, will take two semesters of courses, and expect to spend next summer as business interns in Chicago. The scholarships are aimed at attracting students from Eastern European countries undergoing economic change. 
Gilbert Ghez, professor of management and economics at Roosevelt, initiated the program last December by persuading the university to provide full tuition, room and board plus spending money to two students from Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland or Romania. Later, Scandinavian Airlines agreed to pay air fare and Chicago businesses and foundations donated textbooks among other things.
The program's objective, Mr. Ghez said, is to teach students ''the ways of market economies as these economies are under transformation and are seeking to adopt the ways of free markets.''
In the last six to eight months, it has been hard for course offerings in Eastern Europe to keep up with the changes there, Mr. Ghez said. Textbooks are hard to get in sufficient numbers, he said, and professors' knowledge is behind the times.
Mr. Leidl, 21 years old, who has completed three years at the Prague School of Economics, said he wanted to study in the United States because he feared change would not take place at his university before he graduated. Last fall he was a student leader in the uprising in Czechoslovakia, traveling to factories to explain the country's changes to workers who knew little of the events in Prague.
Mr. Pribusz, 24, is a graduate of the Budapest University of Economics, which was known as Karl Marx University until a few months ago. As a student, he started a desktop publishing company, using I.B.M. and Xerox machines, which made books and papers more readily available to the university's students.
Through that experience he said he found that ''very few people have the necessary education to operate a private company'' in Hungary.
Mr. Ghez emphasized that training students like Mr. Pribusz and Mr. Leidl so that they can return home as business leaders could help avoid a brain drain in Eastern Europe as the ablest scholars and business people come to the West.
He may not have to worry. After about an hour in Chicago, Mr. Leidl's thoughts were close to home.
''Prague is the most beautiful city in the world,'' he said, ''and it has the world's greatest beer.''

HEADLINE: Aspiring Jazz Musicians May Soon Have an Alternative to Smoky Cabarets

BYLINE: By PATRICIA STEWART

 BODY:
Since its beginnings nearly a century ago, jazz has often been passed from one generation to the next through a chain of chord progressions, rhythmic patterns and melodic lines delivered in smoky clubs. Within a few years, aspiring young jazz musicians may be able to study their craft in a conservatory in Durham, N.C., devoted exclusively to jazz.
Two years have passed since Durham was selected and more than three since a project was first announced to establish a conservatory dedicated to the high priest of be-bop, the pianist and composer Thelonious Monk, who died in 1982. Attention has now turned to planning a curriculum and raising a $50 million endowment and $12 million for the construction of a campus.
One of the hardworking duos in jazz is Thelonious Monk Jr., the pianist's son and chairman of the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz, and Thomas R. Carter, its executive director, whose fund-raising consists partly of one-day stands at government, corporate and foundation offices. 
''We're starting to change the whole concept of the way people present jazz,'' Mr. Monk commented before this year's gala benefit for the institute at Duke University in March, ''by virtue of the fact that I'm standing here and saying the word 'jazz' and the word 'millions' in the same sentence, since we are trying to raise millions for jazz and we are in the process of doing that.
''The academic setting is what's been missing,'' said Mr. Monk, adding that he hoped similar institutes would spring up in coming years. ''The academic setting is what's going to weave jazz into the cultural fiber, so that it is stamped 'Made in America.' ''
 
A Setback
The institute's fund-raising drive had a setback when the North Carolina Legislature in its June session omitted from its budget a $5 million grant, which was to be matched by private donations. Mr. Monk said the state was facing a $500 million deficit and ''we were one of a number of things that had to suffer.''
''It means our focus has shifted a little from public funding to private,'' Mr. Monk said. ''It's a blow, but it has by no means stopped us. It's slowed us down a bit.''
The Monk Institute is affiliated with Duke University and North Carolina Central University, and students will earn a Bachelor of Arts degree in jazz performance under a program certified by the National Association of Schools of Music. The institute has attracted a range of jazz players to an academic council headed by the trumpeter Clark Terry, and a broad spectrum of prominent toe tappers. Bill Cosby is the honorary chairman of a board, appointed this year, that includes Mr. Terry, Clint Eastwood, Martin Luther King 3d, George Butler of CBS Records, and Maria Fisher, president of the Beethoven Society.
The site for the institute has been acquired in downtown Durham, and a design competition has been conducted among fifth-year architecture students at Howard University.
And while the campus for the institute is still on the drafting table, two of its programs are well under way. The first stages of an international exchange program took American and European students and musicians last summer to Dolo, Italy, a small city near Venice that has named its music school for Thelonious Monk. And an international jazz piano competition aimed at finding new talent has been held in Washington for the last three years under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution. Three participants have signed recording contracts.
The competition has been judged by some of jazz's finest pianists, including Hank Jones, Roger Kellaway, Ahmad Jamal and Horace Silver, and two closely linked with Monk - Barry Harris and Tommy Flanagan. Mr. Harris is also a leading figure in jazz education and a member of the institute's academic council.
Mr. Terry and others at the institute are now planning the Louis Armstrong Trumpet Competition, which will replace the piano competition in November.
 
Several Pilot Programs
A series of pilot programs will be conducted in the coming school year at the Street Academy High School, an alternative school in the old Boys' High School building in Bedford-Stuyvesant, and at schools in North Carolina and possibly Los Angeles.
For those on the academic council of the institute, one consideration is how to plan a jazz curriculum when one of the role models is Beethoven. The idea for the institute came largely from Mrs. Fisher of the Beethoven Society, when approached by members of the Monk family for her thoughts on a permanent memorial. At Monk's funeral, the jazz historian Ira Gitler noted the comparison that is made between Monk and Beethoven, each a maverick in his time.
''I thought, well, would it be a good idea to honor America's traditional music,'' recalled Mrs. Fisher, who is 86 years old, at the gala in Durham. ''And I inquired around and I said, has ever a classical organization honored the classical music of America, and they said no, and I thought, well why don't I do it?''
One member of the academic council already in Durham is Paul Jeffrey, the tenor sax player in Monk's band in the 1970's. Mr. Jeffrey is artist in residence at Duke, teaching jazz history and ensemble, and he expresses frustration with the number of colleges and universities with a jazz faculty of one. ''They wouldn't teach European classical music this way,'' he said.
''We envision having whole groups coming in,'' he said of the Monk Institute. ''Take the Count Basie band off the road and put them in residence for a month.''
 
Good Foundation
Mr. Jeffrey said he believes a good music education can be especially important for jazz musicians, who perform their own compositions instantaneously when improvising a solo, because ''there's no eraser.''
While the past produced the likes of Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk, Mr. Jeffrey said he thinks the eras in which they played would nevertheless have benefited from some of the changes he hopes to help bring about. ''I think the music somewhat was compromised - the lack of documentation, the lack of even adequate places for the musicians to play. I think a lot of people still think that the musicians have to be in some dive, breathing smoke.''
Mr. Harris said in New York that documentation of the music would be one concern of the institute. ''For one thing, we're going to have in our library all of Monk's tunes transcribed.''
The most important thing for the students is an emphasis on ''the ABC's of music,'' said Mr. Harris, who directed the Jazz Cultural Theater in New York from 1982 to 1987, teaching children as young as 5. ''You don't walk around talking about 'A, B, what comes after B?' That should be stuff that you don't walk around guessing at. It's the basic stuff that we really hated the most - scales, arpeggios, those are the things.''
 
No Compromises
Mr. Monk and others connected with the institute refer to it as ''the first conservatory in the world devoted strictly to jazz.''
''The primary difference with the Monk institute, other than its general size and magnitude, will be the fact that we're not going to compromise the music,'' Mr. Monk said.
''Most of the time it's a problem of economics. The music gets compromised because eventually someone makes a decision: 'Well, you know we're not moving along with this jazz thing the way we would like to; maybe we should get a couple of singers, a pop thing, something like that.'
''What we're trying to do, and that's why we're shooting for such a high goal in our endowment,'' Mr. Monk said, is to insure that the validity and the sanctity of the music is never compromised at the Monk Institute, for any reason.''
Or, as Mr. Harris put it, ''The whole thing is to perpetuate the music.''

BYLINE: By ANNA HUSARSKA; Anna Husarska is an editor at the Polish independent daily Gazeta Wyborcza.

DATELINE: WARSAW

 BODY:
''Dynastia'' is Polish for ''dynasty.'' But nowadays it is more chic to say ''DIE-nas-tee,'' the American way. This new fashion started two months ago, when the initial installment of the United States-produced series was telecast on Poland's Channel 1. Since then, 10 times a week - twice daily from Monday to Friday - Poles are treated to the carryings-on of the enormously rich Carrington family of Colorado.
Some 16 million Polish viewers watch every evening at 6 and an additional 2 million at 11, when the same episode is repeated, as they follow the overheated romantic permutations of the oil-magnate Blake Carrington, his unhappy wife, Krystle, their spoiled daughter, Fallon, their homosexual son, Steve (both children from Blake's earlier marriage to the vengeful Alexis), and sundry other wealthy and glamorous Americans. 
Television programming from the United States is hardly new to Polish viewers, who as early as the 1960's were watching the western series ''Bonanza'' and ''Zorro.'' But there are a number of reasons why a fresh invasion of programming began this summer, when broadcasts of ''The Donahue Show,'' ''The Wonder Years'' and ''Sesame Street'' also started.
''Until the end of June,'' says Jan Dworak, vice president of the Polish TV Committee, which oversees the country's two Government-operated channels, ''the so-called ideological quotas that we inherited from the Communists were still in force, and there was a limit to how much material from capitalist countries could be shown. This is, by the way, the reason why the first soap operas in Poland came from Brazil, labeled third world and not capitalist.''
The first 39 installments of ''Dynasty'' were purchased for broadcast to the Polish home audience by newly created private import companies (which also import rice and oil) for $900 each. Many viewers are already inquiring about further episodes of the ABC prime-time staple laden with sultry women in furs and jewels and dashing men in tuxedos living indolent and self-centered lives amid sumptuous surroundings. Indeed, as their country switches from a centrally planned economy to a market economy, Poles are eagerly looking for guidelines on how to be a capitalist. ''Dynasty'' may provide clues, despite the fact that it's something of a stretch to equate the state-appointed manager of a shipyard in Gdansk with an oil mogul in Denver.
Not all Poles, however, feel that ''Dynasty'' offers useful role models; a television columnist in the Warsaw daily Zycie Warszawy recently wrote: ''The aim of each one of us, as taught by Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz, is to obtain the wealth of a Carrington. But can we treat 'Dynasty' as an instructive work? Educated on Socialist films and stories, we recognize immediately this gloomy bloodsucker with a dollar instead of a heart. I demand that 'Dynasty' be quickly taken off the air, as incompatible with the image of a capitalist recently launched in our country.''
The installments of ''Dynasty'' that Poles are seeing have no subtitles or dubbing. Instead, viewers hear a male voice reading a Polish translation of the dialogue, a practice Polish viewers are accustomed to.
The man who reads the dialogue is Marek Gudowski, a 35-year-old economist-turned-announcer. Mr. Gudowski is not very enthusiastic about the content of what he is reading; he claims that it bores him to death. ''It's a tremendous waste of time to watch it,'' he says, ''and to broadcast it daily is to put the viewer at gunpoint.''
Why is the series not dubbed or subtitled? ''Because it would be very expensive,'' explains Marek Libecajt, the director of imported programming at Poltel, the Government's TV agency. ''And, frankly, the quality of this serial does not justify huge investments.''
Mr. Gudowski suggests another argument against subtitles: ''Polish viewers have no time to lose glued to the screen. My reading the text allows them to carry on with domestic chores, such as cooking, ironing or washing the dishes.''
Apartments in Warsaw are usually small, so Mr. Gudowski's voice can be readily heard in all rooms and not a word of Krystle, Blake et al. is lost.
The dialogue from ''Santa Barbara,'' the long-running NBC daytime soap opera about well-to-do Californians, which started on the other Government-operated channel the same day ''Dynasty'' began on Channel 1, is read by a couple - a man takes the male roles and a woman the female ones.
Ania Nowakowska, a secretary to a deputy in the Polish Parliament, has not been watching ''Dynasty'' because, she says, she has ''no time to waste on stupidities.'' Yet she concedes that she would watch the program if the 6 P.M. Polish-language version were followed at 11 P.M. in its original English version. ''Seeing it first in Polish and then in English would help me learn English,'' she explains.
If not educational, what role does ''Dynasty'' fulfill on Polish television? For Jadwiga Laskowska, a dentist who watches the show, it is ''a fashion show.'' Unfortunately, however, because the episodes shown in Poland were made several years ago, the styles are out of date, she says.
Stasia Merenholz, an 80-year-old woman who follows international news closely, says that she watches every episode: ''The whole world saw it. So there must be something in it.'' But, she adds, she has yet to see the ''something.''
Wandzia Gabrys, who works as a dishwasher, says she is shocked by the wealth displayed in these programs. ''All those servants and maids - they have to pay them a lot, I guess,'' she says. ''And to think that I do not even earn enough to pay taxes in Poland. If I had so many servants, I would ask them to do the shopping and stand in line for me.''
Agnieszka Szyszlo, a trilingual secretary at the daily newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, wonders why she has so far seen no blacks on ''Dynasty.'' She also points to the absolute lack of humor in the serial.
According to an opinion poll conducted by Polish television four weeks after the series began on July 2, ''Dynasty'' was being watched at 6 P.M. by between 53 and 58 percent of viewers over 15 years old. The approval rating was high, with half of the viewers regarding the program as ''very good.''
Is a 53 percent a high rating? In the 6 P.M. time slot, it is passable, but the weekly public address by Labor Minister Jacek Kuron at 8 P.M. is watched by 12 million, which is more than 40 percent of Poland's adult population.
In the tumultuous period Poland is now living through, leisure time has given way to real politics. When a number of viewers were asked what they do when live debates from Parliament are shown at the same time as ''Dynasty,'' they all said they switch to the coverage of Parliament. But, of course, there's always the late-evening rebroadcast of ''Dynasty.''

This Courtroom Is a Long Way From 'L.A. Law'

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK

 BODY:
It took only a brief stint as a juror in Manhattan to convince Andy Wolk that when it came to criminal justice in New York, reality is the best story of all. But as Mr. Wolk or any other writer can attest, reality is never easy to simulate, particularly the reality of a system under siege, and particularly in a made-for-TV drama.
First, you have to strive to capture the ambiguities, the chaos, the tensions, the pressures and the pathos of a process unimaginable to those who aren't in the middle of it. To do that, you need someone who knows it intimately, to lead you through the Stygian world of police stations, holding pens and arraignment rooms, to help you sidestep oversimplification, sensationalism or sentimentality. Then you need someone to finance the project and present the results, however raw or disturbing they may be.
Mr. Wolk found his backer in Home Box Office, which pumped $2.3 million into the project. He found a stage in Pittsburgh, which opened up its courtrooms, police stations and prisons for him and allowed him to foul them all up temporarily so as to better resemble Brooklyn. And he found his Virgil in his brother Peter, who learned the legal terrain during a decade as a lawyer in Brooklyn - at Bedford-Stuyvesant Legal Services and the Legal Aid Society. 
This Saturday evening at 9, HBO will offer ''Criminal Justice,'' a 90-minute drama starring Forest Whitaker, Anthony LaPaglia, Jennifer Grey and Rosie Perez. The script, produced by Michael Apted and Robert O'Connor, was written by Andy Wolk and marks his film directorial debut. It tells the story of a 19-year-old prostitute named Denise Moore (Ms. Perez) who is brutally robbed as she leaves a Brooklyn crack den. In addition to stealing her night's earnings, her assailant leaves a Marla Hanson-like slash across her cheek.
From a pile of mug shots and a lineup, Denise identifies her attacker as Jesse Williams (Mr. Whitaker), an unemployed man in his early 20's who lives only a couple of blocks from the crime scene in East New York. He is quickly arrested, and the plot proceeds to follow Jesse through every stage of his prosecution, from the time a detective throws him down on a desk and sarcastically snarls his Miranda rights at him, through his incarceration, to the resolution of the case six months later. It is a profane and ugly trip from which many of the usual thematic signposts, like good and evil, guilt and innocence, are conspicuously absent.
''I wanted to create a story where you would go back and forth, where your preconceptions would be challenged,'' Andy Wolk said recently in a upper West Side coffee house. ''Hollywood has a perception that people want things romanticized, that they want the witness getting up there and saying, 'I did it!' But there's nothing romantic about this. This is tough and hard and gritty. This is the way things are.'' And that, Mr. Wolk said, is what HBO wanted. ''Michael Apted told us there is one word we should keep in mind: verisimilitude,'' he said. ''We repeated the term so often that it came to be known around the set simply as 'the V word.' ''
And ''L.A. Law'' this isn't; indeed, ''Criminal Justice'' takes the process of de-glitzing the big-city practice of law, already begun by ABC's ''Equal Justice,'' one step further. Mr. Wolk, 39, comes from a mini-line of lawyers: his father, Sidney, was a lawyer and regional inspector for the Internal Revenue Service; his brother, four years his junior and a graduate of Northeastern University Law School, is now serving as law secretary to Judge Leonard Rienzi of the State Supreme Court in Brooklyn. Mealtime discussions in the Wolk home in West Orange, N.J., often involved legal themes; Thanksgiving dinners and seders were sometimes followed by mock cross-examinations or jury selections.
Like many New Yorkers, Andy Wolk instinctively resisted jury duty until, in October 1986, he ran out of acceptable excuses. He ended up sitting on a crack-related murder case from Harlem, one requiring two weeks of testimony and three days of deliberations. The defendant was acquitted, and Mr. Wolk vowed to re-create the world he had just experienced, if only from afar.
''I wanted to put the viewer in the position of the jurors, to let the deliberations happen in people's living rooms,'' he said. From the outset, he tried to avoid some idealized portrayal, the kind of process depicted in Sidney Lumet's 1957 film ''12 Angry Men.''
And in fact, what Mr. Wolk has captured is more Henry Ford than Henry Fonda. The bewildering world Jesse and Denise enter is one in which everybody involved - judges, defense lawyers, prosecutors - are drowning. The object in that world is not to dispense justice but to dispose of cases. Defendants don't so much defend themselves as hedge their bets, trading away the only thing they have - their ability to tie up the system even longer - for a better break. There may still be lip service to old ideals. The words of the 17th-century English jurist Sir Edward Coke, ''The welfare of the people is the Supreme Law,'' are blazoned on the fictitious courtroom wall.
But, as ''Criminal Justice'' tries to demonstrate, trials are about as common as triple plays; what really happens, in various forms and forums, is bargaining. ''When the jury system works, it's great, but this is a system where no one wants jury cases,'' the writer-director said. ''The system is set up to do the exact opposite of what goes on in 'L.A. Law' - that is, not to go to trial. I wanted to show that in the most dramatic and frightening way possible.'' To do that, he wends his way through the various stages of the process, from booking, through the police lineup, through arraignment and indictment.
Jesse's Legal Aid lawyer, David Ringel (Mr. LaPaglia), can't tell whether his client is as innocent as he insists; Ringel seems to oscillate on the point, as many viewers are likely to do. Like most people, if not most television villains, Jesse has his good side. He is a devoted father, the type who is seen fetching disposable diapers for his son when the police pick him up. (If no one else, the Procter & Gamble Company had no doubt about Jesse's culpability: it refused to let either Pampers or Luvs be used in the filming.) He's also a good son, the type who grows apoplectic when his devoted mother is insulted.
And like most victims, if not most television victims, Denise Moore is flawed: She has a criminal record and may well have been too high on drugs either to have seen her attacker or to have remembered clearly what she saw. Adding to the ambiguity is the choice with which Jesse is faced. If he pleads guilty to robbery and assault, he can be out of prison in 18 months. If not, Ringel tells him, ''We're talking '2001: A Space Odyssey' before you hit the streets again.''
The lawyers, like the protagonists, also have their nuances. At the age of thirtysomething, Ringel speaks with the raspy Weltschmerz and cynicism of George C. Scott at sixtysomething. This is a battle-weary veteran, not some dewy Ivy Leaguer of the sort played by Willem Dafoe in the film ''Mississippi Burning.'' At one point, he commiserates with another jaded Legal Aid lawyer over a client's all-too-familiar alibi. ''Can you tell me why, if there are eight million people in the naked city, there are only two stories?'' he asks. But as Major Strasser discovered in Monsieur Rick, the cynicism only masks the idealism.
''I think Ringel is a pretty good lawyer, like the average Legal Aid lawyer,'' said Peter Wolk. ''But I don't know if Ringel is still going to be at Legal Aid in another one, two or three years.''
The prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Carter (Jennifer Grey), also has her imperfections. She is only superficially solicitous of Denise and has no doubt whatsoever of Jesse's guilt. Her job is not to hold hands or assure that justice is done, but, as she see it, to convict the creep.
Under normal circumstances, the measly pay of a Legal Aid lawyer might be more palatable with a young, attractive and unattached lawyer on the opposing side, and as ''Criminal Justice'' unfolds the viewer may discern an ''Adam's Rib'' romance in the making. But one never develops - deliberately, according to Mr. Wolk. (In any case, Liz Carter is a lawyer from the Debra Winger-''Legal Eagles'' school, the sort who wears severely tailored suits, smokes continuously, rarely smiles except at one of her own cutting remarks and invariably calls men by their last names. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, Hollywood's women lawyers will not consider using first names a sign of weakness.) ''Criminal Justice'' is not without its cliches, like saxophones wailing and cell doors slamming. But Mr. Wolk and his brother, who sat in as an unpaid technical adviser, say that they labored to get things right, or at least as things usually are. Most of the inmates are real. So, too, are the mug shots, the rap sheets, the files and the lingo.
Andy Wolk said that some of his brother's former colleagues at Legal Aid had already seen the film, and instead of the usual ex post facto nitpicking of insiders, walked away wondering whether or not Jesse Williams really robbed Denise Moore.
''It's very gratifying,'' the director said, ''because that's exactly what this movie is set up to do.''
 
DIRTY DOINGS
Though ''Criminal Justice'' ostensibly takes place in Brooklyn, it was actually filmed in Pittsburgh, where costs were lower and officialdom more cooperative. There was only one problem: The city wasn't sufficiently filthy.
Even in a more immaculate era, it would have been hard enough for the film's production designers, Dan Bishop and Dianna Freas, to re-create New York nearly 400 miles to the west. But doing so now, at a time when the city has seldom been scuzzier, presented a particular challenge. They did so through a process they describe as ''de-renovation,'' but which could also be called B.Y.O.G.: bring your own garbage.
To make the streets, corridors and courtrooms of Pittsburgh look more Brooklyn-like, they imported banged-up cars, soda bottles, candy wrappers and plenty of newspapers, mostly crumpled up New York tabloids and ethnic broadsheets, and sprinkled them around liberally. They turned over trash cans. They brought in stacks of ''I H NY'' coffee cups. At that, keeping pristine Pittsburgh dirty was not easy. ''We had to hire 24-hour security guards so that the stuff wouldn't be carted away,'' said Andy Wolk, the film's writer-director. ''And we had to stop the janitors. We had to tell them, 'No! Leave it dirty!' ''
To authenticate what seemed to New Yorkers to be the excessively clean Pittsburgh courtrooms, the crew rubbed paste wax on the wood paneling, then left it there until shooting was complete. They dulled up walls with lackluster latex paint, supplemented by strategically placed smudges and fingerprints. They replaced modern office furniture with dingy metal models from the 1950's.
What posed the most nettlesome problem was graffiti: there was none. Ms. Freas and Mr. Bishop drove around Brooklyn photographing specimens, then faithfully reproduced them, in both English and Spanish, on every available flat surface within the camera's eye. Only the formula was false: the paint was water-based and easily removed. Thus, when the New Yorkers departed, Pittsburgh could once more be Pittsburgh.

Trouble in 'Flatland,' or The War Against Confusion

BYLINE: By D. J. BRUCKNER; D. J. R. Bruckner is an editor of The New York Times Book Review. His book on the American type designer F. W. Goudy will be published by Abrams in November.

 BODY:
Often the presentation of information obscures its meaning. To Edward R. Tufte, the correction of this scandal lies in design. He has made it his mission to turn statistical tables, scientific observations, schedules, maps, timetables and much more into ''bright and splendid visions'' reflecting the ''crystalline qualities of information display.'' If he has his way, a piece of paper, which he calls ''flatland,'' will reveal depths, contours and subtleties of reality we have never seen before.
Mr. Tufte does work in graphic design and teaches design, among other subjects, at Yale, but the main weapons in his war against confusion are books written to inspire other designers. His first book on graphic display, ''The Visual Display of Quantitative Information,'' has been selling steadily since it first appeared in 1983. His second, ''Envisioning Information,'' was published in June.
He is a bit puritanical. ''To envision information . . . is to work at the intersection of image, word, number, art,'' he has written. The implication is that the graphic designer who strays from that intersection adds to the mess. ''Clutter and confusion are failures of design,'' he says, ''not attributes of information.'' Understanding is the whole point: information should be presented to promote reasoning about it. 
''I want information design to be based on ideas, on reasoning, and to give it the power of ideas,'' he says, ''and to develop the esthetics of information design. I don't just want to put on a scientific performance, but to produce something beautiful. There has been too much cliched thinking and not enough rigor in the field of design.''
Mr. Tufte (rhymes with mufti), who is 46 years old, teaches statistics, graphic design and political economy at Yale University. He earned his bachelor's and master's degrees at Stanford University before going on to Yale for a Ph.D. in political science.
After a 10-year stint teaching at Princeton he returned to Yale in 1977 as a faculty member. When he began teaching he also took up art; his prints hang on the walls of his home in Cheshire, Conn., near New Haven, and his sculptures rear up in the gardens, appropriately in abstract geometrical forms. The whole house bristles with design: Mr. Tufte's projects spread through all the rooms of the ground floor. Upstairs his wife, Inge Druckrey, who teaches design at Yale and the Rhode Island School of Design, presides over a large studio full of drawing tables and cabinets from which she extracts typographical designs by her students, laying them out for admiration with the care one reserves for works of art.
Mr. Tufte has been a consultant on statistics and information design to several corporations, the Federal Government, transit systems and the news media. In 1980 and 1984 he worked as a consultant to The New York Times, helping design its election polls and the reports on their findings.
Through most of this century, he wrote in ''Visual Display,'' data graphics were considered ''mainly devices for showing the obvious to the ignorant.
''It is hard to imagine any doctrine more likely to stifle intellectual progress.'' But in the late 1960's the celebrated statistician and data analyst of Bell Laboratories and Princeton, John W. Tukey, ''made statistical graphics respectable,'' Mr. Tufte said, by ''using them effectively to explore complex data.'' In 1974, Mr. Tufte and Mr. Tukey taught a seminar together on statistical graphics at Princeton. That experience led to ''The Visual Display of Quantitative Information.''
Mr. Tufte talks about bad design as a kind of moral affront. ''The world comes to us in three or four dimensions,'' he says. ''And we don't do very well when we reduce it to flatland. We take in enormous information - word, number, image - through the eye. I believe in the wide-eyed, fresh-eyed view.'' In a sense his work in design is, as he calls it, ''a kind of geometrical thinking, reducing four dimensions to two,'' and it is significant that his conversation betrays a fascination with architecture.
Computers will not alter the task of presenting multidimensional information on flatland, he says. Their capacity to affect the design of information is limited by their own design: ''The screen is flatland and merely an exterior manifestation. The computer was designed from the inside out in that sense; fundamentally it was made to do something else. To really change our capacities in design, one would have to be designed from the outside in. So paper will remain the place of the art.''
Surprisingly, publishers missed the appeal of that argument. Mr. Tufte took the manuscript of ''Visual Display'' to several. They proposed many changes, a small press run and a high price for the book. So he mortgaged his house, took out bank loans at 18 percent interest, set up his own publishing house (Graphics Press, located in Cheshire) and published ''Visual Display'' at $36 a copy.
He sold it by direct mail, 96,000 copies in 10 printings, bringing in just under $3.5 million, and he became something of a mythical figure in publishing as well as in design. The book presents a comprehensive theory of data graphics in a spare text threaded through a series of eye-opening illustrations. And Mr. Tufte's many suggestions for improving data graphics taken from scores of publications - most often by simplifying them, getting rid of what he calls ''chartjunk'' - have become a source of instruction, and amusement, throughout the design world. Ideally, he says, the work of a designer disappears altogether: ''If a design is good the reader should never notice it; it will have made the information totally engrossing.''
In 1985, two years after the first book was published, he began work on ''Envisioning Information,'' which Graphics Press published in June at $48 a copy. ''Most beautiful books are beautiful throughout in the same way,'' Mr. Tufte says. ''This is meant to be beautiful in many different ways.''
It is an extraordinary piece of typography and printing, a book with a singular and powerful personality. Of course, this author has an indulgent publisher whose success with his previous book allowed him to spend $700,000 on the production of this one. His use of color is lavish and subtle. He has some points to make about how much better complex information is conveyed in subdued colors than in bright ones, and he makes his argument through the printing process - ''the book is the message,'' he says. One chapter required printing 11 colors on 12; the sheets had to be run through the press 23 times.
Mr. Tufte shares his techniques with the reader, at one point reproducing exactly a marvelous system for learning geometry without words - by studying and combining shapes in different colors - that was first published in London in 1847, and then redrawing part of it to let the reader see how it can be done better. When he reproduces a pasted-in foldout triangle from among 20 geometric devices of that kind included in a book printed in London 420 years ago, he includes on his page the slight discoloration the triangle made on the aging paper of the original.
His examples of good information design include pages from 17th-century books by Galileo, modern epidemiological maps, charts of sunspot observations for a century, a stunning Czechoslovak airline map and schedule from the 1930's, a Japanese spy's copy of a wonderfully complex and clear railroad timetable for the island of Java in 1937, Constantine Anderson's famous isometric map of midtown Manhattan - the range is enormous. Information design, like mathematics, is a universal language, he contends - Q.E.D. And he allows himself to provide his own endorsement: ''Information design is a solved problem; this book is the catalogue to the museum of design art.''
Up to a point - for, of course, he is already working on another book - to be published, like the others, five years after it is begun. Why five years? ''Well, I figure I am not going to do a lot of these books, so I had better get each one exactly right.''
And what is to result from all this zeal? Magic. Mr. Tufte is bent on introducing action in time, a fourth dimension, into flatland. He says his first book was about numbers, the second about nouns and the new one will be ''about verbs - how you animate things.'' Research for the new volume began with the purchase of the library of a man who spent his life collecting books, catalogues and pamphlets on magic.
Now in Mr. Tufte's house easels, light tables and drawing boards display old pictures illustrating disappearing acts, men in top hats waving their arms over empty receptacles while legends printed on curved lines indicating the sweep of the arms read ''gone'' or ''empty.'' He smiles the smile of those who achieve ''innocent seeing,'' and says: ''There is a beginning. There is movement in flatland.''

Redemption on the Jersey Turnpike?

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
By rights, these should have been disastrous weeks for the bonds of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.
In the aftermath of the Kuwait invasion, the entire bond market has shuddered over the prospect that rekindled inflation would push up interest rates. The turnpike authority is also vulnerable because of the impact higher oil prices and weaker economic activity would have on commercial traffic and, thus, on toll revenue. Indeed, some municipal bond issues have fallen as much as $40 per $1,000 bond since early August. 
The authority's Series 1985 bonds, by contrast, have fallen only about $12.50 per bond - even after The Bond Buyer, an influential daily market journal, reported last Wednesday on the widening gap between the authority's expenses and its revenues. The likely reason for this buoyancy is that the market is betting the turnpike authority will redeem these bonds at face value before the Persian Gulf crisis can take its toll.
If the market turns out to be wrong, however, turnpike investors may suddenly find that the authority's ability to repay them hinges on the political muscle of Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat whose state tax increases have made news across the country and provoked furious opposition at home.
The authority's bonds are both widely held and closely watched - especially the $2 billion issue of Series 1985 bonds, sold five years ago to finance an ambitious road-widening program.
The issue, sold in haste to avoid restrictive new Federal tax rules, was the largest ever sold in the tax-exempt market, and surely one of the most controversial. The authority's abrupt actions infuriated almost everyone except the investment bankers who profited from the deal. Those who protested, publicly and privately, included residents of the towns affected by the expansion plan, transit engineers trying to coordinate turnpike traffic with other arteries, environmentalists concerned about wetlands traversed by the road and the state officials confronted with the necessity of ultimately hiking tolls to pay debt service on the bonds.
Faced with a storm of opposition, the turnpike authority eventually backed down, sharply scaling back its construction plans. That move may placate local officials, transit planners and environmentalists. But it offers no comfort to those who must find the funds to pay debt service on $2 billion worth of bonds for the next 28 years.
The amounts involved are sobering. The authority will pay $160 million in debt service next year; when principal repayments on the 1985 bonds kick in during 1993, the authority's debt service will climb to $228 million, of which all but about $55.5 million is owed to holders of the Series 1985 bonds. And toll revenues are already falling about $40 million short of 1990 expenses.
The prospectus for the 1985 bonds warned that the authority would need to raise its tolls substantially - at least 100 percent - to finance future debt service on the bonds. ''When the bonds were sold, everybody took it for granted that, yes, tolls would be raised,'' said Eileen F. Hopkins, a bond analyst at John Nuveen & Company in Chicago.
But turnpike tolls were last increased in April 1980, and recent attempts to muster the political backing for an increase have failed. Instead, the authority board members have elected to dip into reserve funds to cover the budget gap while the Florio administration tries to find a politically viable route out of this dilemma.
The first step has been to create a new state panel to devise a comprehensive transportation plan for the state, explained Gordon Hector, director of public affairs for the turnpike authority. That process is expected to be completed late this year or early in 1991, Mr. Hector said. ''That's when we will know how our plans fit into the overall plan,'' he added.
The authority's options, obviously, are limited. Under the terms of the Series 1985 bond covenant, it can return the bondholders' money any time after Nov. 21, thereby avoiding future debt service bills. It can invest the $1.3 billion remaining from the original issue, earning interest on it and using that income to partially defray future debt service. Or it can spend the money on the transportation infrastructure in New Jersey and face the toll-hike consequences.
The bond market, clearly, is betting that bondholders will get their money back sometime soon. That is why the 1985 bonds are trading within a few dollars of their redemption value. And the market may be right, said Ms. Hopkins of Nuveen. With any major change in the use of bond funds open to legal challenge by investors, the Governor may see redemption as the best way out of a bad mess.
But the Governor and his advisers may elect to use the money - which, to be fair, is sorely needed for transportation improvements at a time when other sources of funds are scarce. In that case, the Governor will have to confront the politically incendiary problem of raising tolls on a roadway that serves 73 percent of state residents.
Mr. Hector warns that the authority is ''nowhere near a decision'' on what to do about the bond issue, and may not be for some time. Meanwhile, the state income-tax increases already enacted at the Governor's behest have produced a bitter backlash, with some critics lobbying for a recall election to oust Mr. Florio from office. That has prompted many in the bond market to conclude that the Governor lacks the political power to raise tolls and has no option but to redeem the bonds. To do otherwise, one trader argued, would be ''political suicide.''
Maybe so. But pundits in the the Garden State are still trying to figure out where Mr. Florio got the legislative votes - and the nerve -to increase the state income tax and revise the state's aid to local school districts in the face of entrenched opposition. Those moves, they say, argue against underestimating Mr. Florio's appetite for battle.

Ominous News From Japan

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
The Bank of Japan's increase of its discount rate to 6 percent from 5.25 percent has raised new questions about how much higher world interest rates will go and how many more investors will be drained from weak world equity markets.
The likely answer is that Japan will move again, adding new pressure to the upward tilt in rates. This bodes ill all around. With higher rates increasing the cost of borrowing for investment, the growing economies in Europe and Japan would slow some. Their stock markets would remain under pressure. The United States, where the economy has been kept barely afloat with exports, would lose buoyancy as slower growth abroad curbed sales. 
Higher rates abroad would put the dollar under more pressure and the Federal Reserve, if possible, would be in an even more difficult dilemma. The need to raise interest rates to support the dollar and fight inflation would be challenged by the demand for lower interest rates to keep the economy from falling into a serious recession.
And financial markets around the world were already under pressure from tensions in the Persian Gulf, as interest rates rose in response to the inflationary fears generated by the jump in oil prices after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
In the 11 countries followed in J.P. Morgan's government bond index, the average increase in interest rates since the Aug. 2 invasion was 51 basis points or just over half a percentage point.
On average, the return for investors in August was down 1.41 percent in local currencies, following a rise of 1 percent in July. Even in foreign bond markets, where American investors recently got a lift from a weakening dollar, the return since the invasion has dropped 0.23 percent, far from the robust 5.13 percent increase in July. The rise in the dollar on Thursday and Friday, especially against the British pound, wiped out much of the currency gain for the month. A dollar return of 3.56 percent through Wednesday was cut to 1.25 by Friday.
In Australia, the return was up 3.27 percent in dollar terms, with the average yield down 37 basis points on 1- to 3-year maturities and up 33 basis points on 7- to 10-year maturities. But in Australian dollars, the local return was up only 0.77 percent. The worst market was Japan. The return for the Japanese was off 2.46 percent. But the falling dollar trimmed this loss to 0.16 percent for Americans. Interest rates on 7- to 10-year maturities rose 57 basis points in Japan.
The jump in the Japanese discount rate was expected. It conformed with forecasts of many analysts, made well before the Iraqi invasion, that interest rates would rise in Japan and Europe but hold or fall in the United States. This combination has already led to a weaker dollar and hurt stock markets worldwide. Markets in Britain and the United States have also been hurt by slowdowns in the economy and corporate earnings.
But as soon as the Japanese discount-rate increase was announced Thursday, talk of another began - because short-term market interest rates, at 8.19 percent, are still so much higher. In September, the Japanese get new data on business investment intentions for the third quarter and the gross domestic product for the second quarter. Strong growthand continued high investment levels - the factors that in June set off the recent round of rising interest rates - could trigger another cycle of rising interest rates followed by a another jump in the discount rate.
''The market is still expecting another discount rate hike,'' said Yuichi Kohashi, senior vice president of Daiwa Securities America in New York.
In Germany, no increase in interest rates is expected until after unification in October. But the costs of unification seem to be growing daily, and inflationary pressures are increasing. The inflation rate over the last year rose to 2.9 percent in August and is now expected, with the rise in oil prices, to be over 3 percent by the end of the year. These factors, said Warren Oliver, European economist at UBS Phillips and Drew in London, should be enough to force the Bundesbank's hand by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: Recession: Are the Questions How Deep and How Long?

BYLINE: By Joel Kurtzman

 BODY:
The economic news was gloomy even before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait: half a year of lackluster growth, rising inflation and a softening employment picture. Now, as oil prices rise and consumer confidence tumbles to its lowest level in seven years, the battered economy is sure to take another beating. But does it mean recession or just more of the same - the softest of soft landings? And if it does mean recession, how long and how deep?
Three economists, Allen Sinai, executive vice president and chief economist at the Boston Company; Francis H. Schott, senior vice president and chief economist at the Equitable Life Assurance Society; and R. David Ranson, president and chief economist at H.C. Wainwright & Company Economics Inc., discussed their forecasts for the economy with Joel Kurtzman of The New York Times.
 Q. Mr. Sinai, even before Iraq invaded Kuwait and oil prices started to rise, you said the country was on the verge of a recession. Is that still your view? 
Mr. Sinai: Yes. We can cite a whole host of economic data: the slow momentum in retail sales, the poor July employment report, the slide in final demand in the second quarter that showed up. And there were the fundamental factors as well: slow growth in real income and a six-quarter decline in profits. These are very negative for consumption, consumer spending and for business capital spending.
The Iraqi event is very hard to factor in because it is a political event, and could be erased from the landscape of the forecasting world at any time. But I'm assuming that we will have a protracted situation in Iraq at least through the end of the year, although not necessarily a shooting war. That means crude oil prices will settle at about $25 to $28 a barrel.
I am therefore assuming that whatever mild recession might have happened without Iraq will be intensified.
What does this mean in terms of duration? Anywhere from two to three quarters of declines in real gross national product, and a peak-to-trough decline in real gross national product of 1 to 1 1/2 percent measured fourth quarter to fourth quarter.
Mr. Schott: It's a little bit academic to say this, but before Iraq I wouldn't have been sure that we were actually getting to the point of a recession. But now I am reasonably sure and agree that we are heading toward a two- to three-quarter recession. However, I think the recession will be fairly mild. My forecast is for a three-quarter recession, most likely beginning in the fourth quarter of 1990 and going through the first half of 1991. On a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis, we'll have positive growth of between one-half and one percentage point. The Federal Reserve will come to the assistance of the economy sooner or later.
But the excesses in the economy - the high corporate debt ratios - are going to have to be corrected. There will be workouts or even defaults during this period. We are in for some tough times on Wall Street and in corporate boardrooms for some months to come.
Let me make one reservation, however. There is some level of military activity in the Middle East - and nobody can be sure exactly what that level is - that could upset this forecast completely. Enough of a shooting war, enough of a Pentagon acceleration in spending, enough new defense expenditures and there will be no recession.
Mr. Ranson: My perspective is different. I'm not at all sure there are going to be any declines in G.N.P. Whether we're in a recession depends to on how the authorities decide it is to be defined. The standard definition isn't absolutely watertight. It's very arbitrary, you see.
However, if there is a recession, I think we're probably already in it. It just hasn't shown up as yet in the data. And any recession would be very brief. I am expecting growth next year to return to normal.
 Q.What do you consider normal growth?
Mr. Ranson: Three percent growth of G.N.P. or something close to 3 percent. In 1992, we expect growth to be even higher than normal, possibly as high as 3 1/2 to 4 percent.
By the way, if we are in a recession, it has little or nothing to do with the Iraqi crisis, and I don't expect the crisis to deepen it. I say this because the price of oil historically has not been a very good predictor of economic output.
I am a great believer in interest rates as the economy's leading indicator. It is possible to draw a graph showing how interest rates explain movements in G.N.P. over the last 30 or 40 years. It's a very tight fit. But if you add oil prices into the graph, the change is really very trivial.
Q. Rising oil prices are usually associated with rising levels of inflation. Do you think inflation will accelerate if oil prices stay where they are?
Mr. Ranson: No I don't. Inflation is likely to be stable. The best indicator I know of for inflation is the overall level of commodity prices in general. Commodities are up over last year somewhat. But I think an inflation rate of 4 percent is very likely for next year. The Iraqi invasion won't affect that.
Mr. Sinai: Well, I'm not so sure. Let's assume crude oil settles in at around $25 a barrel and the Iraqi event does not escalate into a big shooting war that shoves crude oil prices up to $35 to $40 a barrel. Let's also assume that the Iraqi event doesn't just magically go away. Then my calculations are that inflation in the consumer price index would be on the order of 5 to 5 1/2 percent fourth quarter to fourth quarter.
Mr. Schott: Taking into account the same important reservations Allen just stated, I agree that the C.P.I. will rise at a rate of 5 to 5 1/2 percent. I am also assuming that the oil price will settle around $24 to $25 a barrel and that the Iraqi event will not go away but will not get worse.
Mr. Sinai: Defining a recession in the classical way - two quarters of declines of real G.N.P. - misses the point. My sense is that business is really much more depressed - business in general - and has been in recession for longer than we have been talking about. But part of the reason recession doesn't show up in the statistics is because we have been in a protracted period of anemic growth. A prime example of that is non-residential construction and housing. We're running housing starts at a little under 1.2 million units and that really is pretty poor. We have a recessed economy that is taking another turn downward.
 Q. People argue that the savings and loan crisis and the problems beginning to surface among some large banks could deepen a recession, should one occur. Is this your view?
Mr. Sinai: The decline in economic activity that we are in the midst of will make the problems of the commercial banking system and all the financial institutions worse. We have a very fragile situation right now. There is a good-size risk that as our financial institutions come under more pressure, there will be intensified restraints on lending. That in turn would give us an even bigger decline. It could turn a mild-to-moderate recession into a standard - maybe worse than standard - recession. It's a very big risk element.
Mr. Ranson: I have a more optimistic view. There is plenty of historical evidence on the role that debt plays in the economy. As far as I can tell, changes in debt levels or in borrowing are not useful as leading indicators of the economy. They do cause distresses and tragedies on the individual and company levels, but I'm not at all sure that indebtedness plays a very major role when it comes to the overall economy.
Q. But won't high levels of indebtedness in a recession lead to more bankruptcies, layoffs and less consumer spending? Won't this make a recession deeper?
Mr. Ranson: I don't believe so. I believe the economy's resources consist of human beings, human capital, physical capital and knowledge about how to use them. The ability of the economy to operate doesn't depend on balance sheets or flows of funds. If some companies go bankrupt, however large they are, their human capital still exists. They will be taken over by other owners and the economy will go on from there. I don't feel there's a major link between bankruptcy and the aggregate rate at which the economy can perform its functions.
Mr. Schott: That is a pretty venturesome view. Most people believe that bankruptcies and workouts make a recession deeper.
Mr. Ranson: I don't see any empirical evidence of that.
Mr. Sinai: Any downturn that comes into play - especially if there's rising unemployment - will set up forces that will make the real economy spiral even deeper. This is a very risky situation. I'm afraid I'm more concerned about it than David.
 Q. What should the Federal Reserve be doing at this juncture?
 Mr. Schott: We have to emphasize the cruel dilemma that the Federal Reserve faces. I think the Fed has to ease rates some - a quarter of a percent on the Fed funds rate. I believe the Federal Reserve will ease rates some. Perhaps the Fed won't do that this week, but it will do that before the end of September.
The problem is, however, that first of all, the Fed has been trying to hold out on easing rates in order to get the Administration and Congress to come to a budget agreement. With the Iraq situation, that hope has gone down the tubes. That means trouble for the Federal Reserve, because the Federal deficit will be much worse in fiscal '91 than it was in fiscal '90.
Mr. Sinai: The Fed can't help much this year even if it lowers interest rates, except to minimize the burden of interest costs on the Federal debt and to lower interest costs on households that have floating-rate mortgage debt. This will mean a lower dollar, which carries with it an inflationary risk.
But, if the economy is sliding into a recession, then lower short-term rates ought to help housing pick up some in 1991. The lower dollar ought to help exports some. And it would cushion consumer spending a little bit. But I'm not thinking just about a quarter-point easing of the Fed funds rate. A quarter-point would be step one. A point or so reduction in interest rates is needed beginning now and over the next year. That would cushion the recession.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
A Superpower Goes Begging For Bucks

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
As the superpower amassed its tanks and planes in the Middle East last week, its top diplomat got out his tin cup and prepared to seek a way to pay for the expeditionary force.
That spectacle, of Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, along with Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, mapping a trip to the countries that have the cash, among them West Germany and South Korea, may help to explain why the dollar has been far weaker in this world crisis than in previous ones.
The need to push so hard for cash provided another reminder of how important the budget talks that are about to resume will be, and of the penalties being paid for not getting the country's fiscal house in order before a crisis hit. 
The gulf crisis did seem to ease a bit, at least from a Wall Street perspective, as diplomacy came to the fore. Gold, the old favorite in times of stress, tumbled and gave up most of its post-invasion gains. Stocks recovered only a fraction of their Kuwait-related falls, but the Dow Jones industrial average still rose 81.44 points, or 3.2 percent, to 2,614.36, for its best weekly gain since early May.
Smaller stocks, which fell further as prices tumbled, also bounced back more rapidly. The Russell 2,000 rose 3.9 percent, for its best weekly showing in more than two years.
The rebounds were not enough to keep August from entering the books as the fifth worst month since World War II for the Dow, trailing only October 1987 and three brutal months in 1973 and 1974, following the first oil shock.
Individual investors seem to have taken the plunge in stride to a much greater extent than did the professionals on Wall Street. Mutual fund companies were pleasantly surprised at just how little money came out of their stock funds, and Fidelity Investment's discount brokerage customers were net buyers in every week of the month. On Monday, when prices were rallying, buy orders at Fidelity outnumbered sell orders by a three-to-one margin. Whether that reflects wisdom, or complacency, will be determined later.
Wall Street is a place that loves to talk about the big issues, whether recession or war and peace. But just now a substantial part of the Street's attention is focused on a more parochial concern: Will Congress enact a tax on securities transactions? With the budget crisis clear, and draconian Gramm-Rudman spending cuts on the horizon, such a tax might pass.
That could hit stocks even more than Saddam Hussein did, at least if a new study, supported by the Mid-America Institute for Public Policy Research, is to be believed. Yakov Amihud of New York University and Haim Mendelson of Stanford estimated that the Dow industrials would fall by 18 percent if a half-percent tax on securities transactions became law.
Of course, every group would prefer that the tax burden fall somewhere else. But without some action to close the budget deficit, the question facing America is sobering: No matter how powerful its guns, can a country be considered a superpower if it can't afford the bullets?

OPEC Decides to Give the Desired Response
 
One doesn't just order a cab driver in the Arab world to head across town. One respectfully inquires if he is going in that direction. On Wednesday, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced that it is, indeed, going where the United States would like. OPEC members are now free to pump all the oil they can. For weeks, the United States and its allies have requested that OPEC compensate for the boycott of Iraqi and Kuwaiti supplies. But Iraq has threatened neighbors who comply with United States requests. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, backed by an OPEC accord, appear ready to produce even more than experts thought they could. An agency representing major oil consumers decided against drawing down emergency oil reserves, but doubted that OPEC could pump enough to avoid serious shortages come winter. For now, OPEC unity has brought lower oil prices - from $30.91 to $27.32 a barrel last week. 
 
Satellites for Tonga?
 
The tiny, South Pacific island kingdom of Tonga has volcanoes, coral reefs, coconuts and bananas. Its 100,000 residents have 5,000 radios and 4,000 telephones. Now King Taufa'ahau Tupou 4th wants to add at least 13 communications satellites. Tonga has found a loophole in international law allowing it to claim the last orbital slots for satellites than can link Asia and the United States. Not that Tongans are clamoring for more ''I Love Lucy'' reruns or the ability to check coconut futures on the commodity exchanges. Tongasat, a Government-sponsored company with no money of its own, instead aims to raise perhaps $500 million from investors, then charge users millions of dollars a year for each satellite slot. Officials of Intelsat, the consortium of 199 nations that supplies most international satellite service, are fuming over the potential loss of the slots. They say that Tongasat is a front for a savvy American telecommunications specialist, Matt C. Nilson, who thought up the venture and convinced the Tongans to adopt it.
 
Japan's Rate Rise
 
The Japanese tightened last week, and the United States is likely to feel the squeeze. Japan raised its discount rate to 6 percent from 5.25 percent last Thursday, the fifth increase in just over a year. Japanese interest rates are approaching the levels of United States rates - even though economists expect Japanese consumer prices to rise less than 3 percent this year, not half as much as in the United States. Economists say that higher Japanese interest rates could hurt the value of the dollar and repatriate Japanese money that has been flowing into American bonds. The likely result is higher interest rates in the United States on the eve of a recession.
 
Soviet-Saudi Raprochement
 
The Russian Republic in OPEC? Just a recent suggestion from Boris N. Yeltsin, the republic's president, who claims control of the region's oil. The Soviet Union was drawing closer to Saudi Arabia even before the Middle East crisis, allowing Moslem pilgrims to visit Mecca for the first time. No formal diplomatic relations yet, but the Soviets hosted Saudi Arabia's Ambassador to the United States last month.
 
Bush Passes the Hat
 
President Bush sounded like the chairman of a global United Way last week as he urged other nations ''to bear their fair share'' of Middle East costs. The United States is spending billions on military forces and economic sanctions there. The President intends to dispatch Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to West Germany, Japan and the Middle East, seeking contributions of as much as $25 billion.
 
In Brief
 
Toys 'R' Not Us: The Japanese relaxed their laws to allow some large American stores to open shop. But now come the Japanese retailers with plans to gang up against newcomers. Toys 'R' Us, which plans 100 Japanese stores in the next 10 years, faces organized opposition from domestic toy retailers who promise to aid competing shops.
 
Ernest W. Saunders, the former chief of Guinness P.L.C., was sentenced to five years in prison. He was convicted of conspiracy, fraud and theft in his successful 1986 battle to take over the Distillers Company.
 
Japan's Ministry of Finance gave one- and two-day suspensions to four investment houses, including Daiwa Securities and a Citicorp susidiary, for aiding in stock manipulation.
 
COMPANIES
 
A Boost for the Air Bag
 
At first, auto companies offered air bags as options costing as much as $800. Then they cited the weak response from customers as proof there was little demand. Last week, the General Motors Corporation said that by 1995, a driver's-side air bag would be in every car it builds in the United States. Some safety experts say the air bags might save thousands of lives, especially since the company's passive seat belts are said to be flawed. A G.M. spokesman explained the move with marketing language instead, saying, ''There's little doubt the American car-buying public is moving into a more safety-conscious mode.''Chrysler already equips almost all its cars with air bags, and Ford plans to in the mid-1990's. Toyota and Honda appear to be lagging behind - giving American companies a rare design advantage over their major Japanese rivals.
 
The United Automobile Workers named G.M. as its ''strike target'' last Tuesday. Contracts with the auto makers expire Sept. 14.
 
IN BRIEF
 
When two of the South's largest banks agreed last year to merge, they at first decided to call themselves the Avantar Financial Corporation, a name that reeked of adventure, perhaps in outer space. Well, the Citizens and Southern Corporation and the Sovran Financial Corporation were officially united yesterday - as the C&S Sovran Corporation. A mouthful, perhaps, but at least familiar food.
 
The Tisch family, betting on weak banking stocks to revive, has bought major stakes in Continental Bank, Baybanks and Equimark.
 
THE ECONOMY
 
Arguing With the Census
 
They will fight in the fields and in the streets. They will fight block-to-block and then house-to-house. Local and state politicians will not flag or fail until the Government admits there are heaps more Philadelphians, Atlantans, Houstonians and New Yorkers than the Census Bureau estimated last week. Never mind that satisfying all these complaints might leave the nation with a population larger than India's. This is what the agency gets for letting local authorities review preliminary figures. The final numbers will determine not only Congressional representation and Federal benefits, but also where many businesses and investors direct their money and jobs. For many local officials, the census has become nothing more than the continuation of politics by other means.
 
The Countryside Shrinks
 
Don't look for rural areas to rebound during the 1990's. The countryside suffered greater population losses than expected during the last decade - as many as 1.4 million people, according to preliminary census figures - after gaining during the 1970's. Doug Bachtel, a sociologist at the University of Georgia, says that the exodus is likely to continue. Even if farming becomes more profitable, it will continue to become more mechanized, he said. And factories that moved into small towns searching for cheap labor are now looking overseas. So the young and the educated move to the cities, leaving the poor and elderly back home. In Taliaferro County, Ga., where the population fell from 2,032 to 1,761 during the decade, more than one in five residents are older than 65, compared with less than one in eight nationally. ''People in Florida are getting their retirement benefits from Merrill Lynch,'' Mr. Bachtel said, referring to their investments. ''People in rural America are getting their benefits from Uncle Sam.''
 
Consumer Confidence Drops
 
Consumers swore they felt an earthquake in August, rattling them so badly that they might be afraid to go out to shop. Two indexes showed last week that, as the Middle East crisis intensified, consumer confidence took the sharpest plunge since the October 1987 stock market crash. The University of Michigan reported that consumers were less confident than at any time since the 1982 recession. And the Conference Board, a business group, confirmed Michigan's finding that consumers are especially pessimistic about the next six months - which often foreshadows a recession. Lacy H. Hunt, the chief economist at Carroll McEntee & McGinley, said that with unemployment claims also rising in the last two weeks, ''The best that we can expect is very sluggish growth.'' Economists are waiting for September figures to see whether consumers really felt an earthquake, or just the neighbors moving their furniture around upstairs.
 
More Bad S.&L. News
 
A healthy savings and loan these days seems to be one whose cancer is not terminal. The Office of Thrift Supervision reported last week that losses and loan problems are growing at many of the nation's strongest institutions. The figures raise questions about whether the savings and loan industry can survive without being taken over by commercial banks.
 
Energy: Lack of Policy
 
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins responded to the prospect of oil shortages by suggesting a rough sail and a bumpy ride. He wants to sail into the waters off Santa Barbara, Calif., to pump oil near a coastline cherished by environmentalists and tourists. And he wants all Americans to inflate their tires to the maximum pressure for more energy-efficient, but more jarring, rides. No sense in speeding the development of a comprehensive energy policy due for delivery to the Capitol next spring, Mr. Watkins added. Better to do the easy things now, make the tougher changes later.

HEADLINE: Creating a Giant Computer Highway

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: RESTON, Va.

 BODY:
Traced in the phosphors glowing on the screen of his computer, Robert E. Kahn sees the 21st century:
Hair-thin strands of glass fiber are threaded through computerized libraries to supercomputers, large high-resolution video screens and hundreds of thousands of computer work stations located throughout the country.
Many scientists, educators, Government officials and corporate executives believe that Dr. Kahn has, in fact, put in place the early stages of a technological transformation that will be every bit as profound for America in the next century as the transcontinental railroad was in the last.
From his base at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives, a nonprofit company he created in 1986, Dr. Kahn has successfully orchestrated a remarkable coalition that brings together major corporate competitors, Government agencies and educational institutions. All have agreed to take part in the research necessary to create a fully integrated, high-speed national network of computers, possibly early in the next century, that will unleash a tremendous burst of scientific, educational and economic activity.
Such a national network - an information infrastructure, Dr. Kahn calls it, much like a national highway system for data - would make it possible to ship enormous amounts of information back and forth at what are called gigabit speeds (billions of bits of data per second), almost a thousand times faster than anyone using today's fastest electronic networks. 
Its planners say that once the network is completed, scientists, scholars, students, economists and business executives will have instant access to computerized libraries the size of the Library of Congress. The potential for hundreds of new businesses will be created and old ones will be energized by the emergence of a vast coast-to-coast electronic marketplace.
Doctors will have the assistance of artificially brilliant computer systems in treating patients; so will pharmaceutical companies, in designing drugs. Extremely clear sound will be transmitted cross-continent along with high-resolution television pictures on screens the size of an office or living-room wall. Business and personal travel - and the nation's voracious appetite for oil - may well begin to decline as such video becomes widely available for sales conferences, for example, or other kinds of interaction.
 
Setting the Seeds
In June, the National Science Foundation awarded Dr. Kahn's Corporation for National Research Initiatives $15.8 million to oversee the research on setting up five separate networks and experimenting with new hardware and software technologies. The grant is small, but Dr. Kahn believes it is not inappropriate to his approach, which is to start by seeding dozens of small, separate research efforts and then let the successful ones mature.
''We don't want to decide what the infrastructure will be,'' said Dr. Kahn. ''We want to be in the position of building experiments. The industry will learn enough lessons so that they will be able to do it right.''
Moreover, the National Science Foundation project has developed important funding commitments from many of the country's largest high-technology corporations. Although Dr. Kahn said it was impossible to offer an accurate estimate of private funding, several computer researchers on the project put corporate commitments at more than $300 million.
Government officials estimate the cost of building the entire national network reaching all American homes at more than $200 billion, an imposing price tag. But many economists, scientists and others, when asked about the cost, say the economic and, ultimately, the social benefits will exceed the costs by a large margin. ''It's the same question that you could ask if you were going to build a national highway system for the first time,'' said Erich Bloch, director of the National Science Foundation.
And the costs of not building it could conceivably be higher in the long run. America's principal economic competitors have already decided the investment is worth the risk. Japanese corporations have made a $20 billion commitment to building just such a network, and in France work has also begun on an ambitious national digital library. The positive side of the Asian and European commitment is that it may eventually lead to information-sharing on a worldwide basis.
 
In the Beginning
For Robert Kahn, 51 years old, the quest for a nationwide gigabit network began quietly enough. He was trained as an engineer, and, after starting what he thought would be a teaching career at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, decided he should take a year off to gain some ''real world'' experience. He arrived at Bolt Beranek & Newman, a Cambridge, Mass., think tank in 1968, just in time to participate in the design of the ARPAnet, the granddaddy of all computer networks.
ARPAnet turned out to be extraordinarily successful. It has now been replaced by an international web of almost 2,000 networks in 35 countries known as the Internet. In the past year, data traffic on its main pathway, NSFnet, has been 3.2 billion data packets a month and increasing at a monthly rate of 25 percent. The Internet is broadly similar to what Dr. Kahn and others envision as the network of the future. But it is very much slower - and speed will make all the difference, ultimately, in terms of the volume of information that can be easily shared.
It was from the ARPAnet project that Dr. Kahn acquired such strong feelings about network potential.
In 1972, he joined the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), where he would work for 13 years, using it as a vehicle to finance what he regarded as innovative research. That experience was to prove useful. Unlike many technology visionaries, Dr. Kahn is a down-to-earth, matter-of-fact person. No wild preoccupation with futuristic images of life now unknown. Instead, he devotes himself to the less flashy, to designing the basic ''plumbing'' for a project, plotting the details of how it would work - and, not incidentally, how it would be paid for.
The political infighting and bureaucratic barriers in Government were said to have taken their toll on him. That along with his realization of the need for broad coalition-building and his views of how money would have to be raised and carefully spent led Dr. Kahn to leave DARPA in 1985.
But the idea of raising enough money for a project as intangible as an information network was not easily accepted at first. ''In the beginning,'' he said, ''it wasn't clear how computer networks were going to be used. A lot of the research community originally thought I had gone off my rocker.'' John Seely Brown, a computer scientist at the Xerox Corporation, said, ''Funding infrastructure in general is hard, but when it's invisible it's even harder.''
And in recent years, Government officials and corporate executives alike have loudly debated the merits of paying for major initiatives to help create or to rescue one threatened institution or high-technology industry or another.
 
Jobs and Accessibility
 But Dr. Kahn argued to all who would listen, pointing out that the value of earlier generations of infrastructure has been easy to demonstrate: Roadways create jobs and move commerce; electrical power grids light the countryside, and the national telephone network is instantly accessible to all.
Now, after several frustrating years of making the rounds at high-technology computer, communications and software companies as well as on Capitol Hill, Dr. Kahn's vision has finally taken hold.
''I give him tremendous credit,'' said Robert W. Lucky, executive director of communications research at A.T.& T.'s Bell Laboratories. ''He had a vision . . . and even though it was a tough sell, he hung in there.''
Dr. Kahn has worked quietly in the background building the new partnership that includes computer giants like the International Business Machines Corporation and Cray Research Inc. and communications companies - the seven regional Bell operating companies and both A.T.&T. and the MCI Corporation - as well as many of the nation's best universities.
Surprisingly, for a figure who learned much of his effectiveness amid the political battling of Washington, he seems to be free of any band of detractors.
''Bob has had to forge working relationships between people who normally don't work together,'' said David Sincoskie, a communications engineer at Bellcore, the research arm of regional Bell operating companies.
''We have to build on what America does best and that rests on our capacity for innovation and on our diversity,'' said Dr. Brown of Xerox. ''The promise in this information highway is to provide a way to let groups of designers work together effectively.''
Senator Albert Gore Jr., Democrat of Tennessee, is one who has listened to these arguments. He has introduced a bill in Congress to provide $1.75 billion over three years to finance a data network that would link the nation's universities and supercomputer centers. The bill is believed to stand a strong chance of passage this year.
 
The Workings
Traditional telephone networks create the equivalent of a circuit, or a wire, between any two callers and must have enough wires to guarantee that most callers at peak hours can reach each other.
Data transmissions from one computer to another are automatically broken up into individual ''envelopes,'' like those sent to the post office, each with a separate address. The network hardware is then responsible for routing all envelopes and making sure they are assembled in the right order at their final destination. But with computers, there are dozens of pathways by which an envelope can be sent; if one pathway is busy, the envelope will simply be sent along another.
For Dr. Kahn, the components of an information infrastructure extend beyond the basics of computers and fiber-optic cables. Like a highway system - which requires gas stations, truck stops, intersections and traffic lights in addition to roadways - an information infrastructure will need specialized resources in addition to simple communications.
Dr. Kahn cites as an example the creation of a library system that would be computerized and connected but would not exist in one centralized computer. Instead, the nation's information would be located in widely separated specialized databases, which would range from yellow-page-type information stored in phone company computers, say, to geological fault figures stored in an oil-company or university mainframe.
A new class of sophisticated tools will have to be developed and used, such as knowledge robots, or ''knowbots,'' as Dr. Kahn calls them. These otherworldly creatures will have ravenous appetites for information. They will be sent on fact-finding missions for humans, traveling at almost the speed of light to the appropriate electronic destinations and searching through appropriate databases. Prototype knowbots have already been created in software designed by scientists at Dr. Kahn's N.R.I. and put to work, experimentally.
In addition, refined computer hardware will have to be produced to handle the communications speed of gigabit networks and the volume of data that will accumulate as knowbots scan all the paper books and research journals on a virtally endless list of topics.
The financial challenges seem scarcely less daunting than the technological ones. Some experts believe that, in addition to the current coalition of support, the infrastructure will have to start early on to help pay its own way. Michael L. Dertouzos, for one, director of the computer science laboratory at M.I.T., believes that the information marketplace will soon begin to grow so quickly that it will spew out revenues.
 
The Critical Mass
He describes applications such as reverse advertising, in which a consumer would demand a specific product or service and the computer network would locate it anywhere in the country. ''If you have small number of these services, it's not exciting,'' he said. ''But once you have a critical mass, it all goes bananas.''
Dr. Kahn and his partner computer scientist, Vinton G. Cerf, have explored a number of financial alternatives, including the possibility of taxing users or computer services. Dr. Cerf looks for parallels in the way in which the Government gave incentives to railroad builders, who received square-mile chunks of land where their lines ran. That might suggest, for example, that a communications company may be willing to lay out large sums of money to help build a high-speed information network - if, in return, it were to receive a franchise on some of the lucrative data services that would result.
''I keep looking for the square mile of the information age,'' said Dr. Cerf.
 
ARPAnet, GRANDDADDY OF THEM ALL
In the late 1960's, a small community of computer scientists with a vision of permitting scientists and engineers to share information instantly and easily, no matter where they were, came together under the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency. The idea was that, from a desk in Cambridge, Mass., a scientist would be able to use a supercomputer in Sunnyvale, Calif., as if it were in the next room. The result was dubbed ARPAnet.
Having a computer network that served both as a means for instantaneous communication among researchers and an experimental communications laboratory was a revolutionary notion.
Paul Baran, a scientist at the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, Calif., who had been looking for ways to make telephone networks more reliable in the event of nuclear war, thought to break up digital messages into ''packets,'' each of which could be addressed electronically and sent by whatever route available to its destination.
J.C.R. Licklider, a psychologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, worked on linking computers. Bolt Beranek & Newman, a Cambridge, Mass., think tank won the 1968 contract to design a network.
The original ARPAnet was built around small computers (terminal interface processors), which handled connections with slow dial-up terminals, and separate message-passing computers, interface message processors. Each IMP would be connected to another IMP on a leased phone line and be capable of sending and receiving at what then seemed like very high speeds. Today's networks routinely carry data at 20 times that speed; tomorrow's, it is thought, will make it 700 times that speed.
The first ARPAnet node was installed at the University of California at Los Angeles in late 1969. By the following year, it had arrived at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
ARPAnet became the first computer network in the nation, and in it, each computer was an equal partner. That ''peer-to-peer'' concept remains the fundamental idea in networking.
To be at an ARPAnet site was to be among an elite, and academic job offers were weighed with that in mind. After all, would a research microbiologist accept a job at a school with no microscopes?
 
 THE MOTIVAITONS OF DR.KAHN
In 1985, frustrated with the bureaucratic limitations and infighting inherent in a Government agency, Robert E. Kahn set out to do what no one else was doing in this country.
A year later, he formed the Corporation for National Research Initiatives, hoping to raise $1 billion and to act as cross between the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (a model of government-private coordination fostering business and technology) and such small-scale, private American efforts as the Microelectronics and Technology Corporation that attempt to ''push technology forward.''
So far, Dr. Kahn's organization has fallen short of its original goal, but he has created an important model for building new infrastructure critical for American competitiveness.
At the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Dr. Kahn had guided the financing of computer-science research. Since the 1960's, DARPA had served as a supporter of projects as diverse as research that led to personal computers and inquiries into areas such as artificial intelligence and speech recognition.
But during the 80's, DARPA's freedom to fund pure research was increasingly curtailed by political pressures that dictated that Pentagon-funded research be closely linked to weapon systems.
In response, Dr. Kahn's computer section fashioned an ambitious project, the Strategic Computing Initiative, to design robot tanks and artificial-intelligence systems to help with advanced-weapons deployment.
But many of the nation's best computer scientists resisted the idea of working directly on high-technology weapons.
The strains encouraged Dr. Kahn, scientist by training, Government project manager for more than a decade, into the role of independent entrepreneur with a difference. His company is strictly nonprofit.

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
Where's the Barbarian? Where's the Gate?

BYLINE: By NANCY MARX BETTER: Nancy Marx Better is a New York-based writer who frequently covers business.

 BODY:
Several months ago, one Harvard Business School student near the top of his class accepted a summer internship with a prominent Wall Street investment bank. Before arriving in New York, he devoured ''Barbarians at the Gate'' and ''Liar's Poker,'' the twin bibles of Wall Street's corporate culture. He braced himself for the industry's frantic pace and for the dizzying whirl of cocktail parties and recruiting dinners he expected to attend.
''I thought I had a pretty good idea of what I was getting into,'' he said. 
From Memorial Day to Labor Day, he crunched numbers and proofread documents. He became fluent in the language of red herrings, pro forma statements and Securities and Exchange Commission filings. He saw most of the things he'd heard about from his friends who had worked on Wall Street - that is, everything but a live deal.
''We kept putting books together on different companies and waiting for a response,'' said the intern, referring to the process of preparing a company for sale. ''But we never closed anything while I was there.''
Indeed, it has been a long, dry summer on Wall Street - the kind where investment bankers have headed for the Hamptons before Friday noon, cellular telephones and laptops in tow but often left untouched. What has been a time of belt-tightening for industry veterans has been one of soul-searching for summer associates - students between their first and second year of business school.
These future recruits were weaned on stories of Mike Milken, Henry Kravis and Bruce Wasserstein. And they still earn as much as interns did before the stock market crash of 1987: about $15,000 for 10 weeks, as much as first-year associates get before bonuses. But their first brush with the high life has been decidedly low-rolling.
''A lot of people went into investment banking in the 80's because they wanted to be Masters of the Universe,'' said a student at Yale's School of Management who insisted on anonymity. (Since the insider-trading scandals, most firms have prohibited junior employees from talking to the press.) ''Now, the reputation of the business has come down to earth. It's hard to be a hero if your firm isn't doing a lot of deals and making a lot of money.''
With mergers and acquisitions - keystones of the business - dampened by a slumping economy and August's devastated markets, few B-school students spent the summer elbow to elbow with corporate captains as they have in the past. Some firms had so little work that interns were put on waiting lists to get assignments. ''At one point there were about 10 people ahead of me,'' said one M.B.A. at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ''We sat around and watched the World Cup soccer tournament on TV.'' Shearson denies this.
When there was business, it often consisted of ''transaction development'' - drumming up new deals. Other interns worked on restructurings, repairing the mistakes made by the heros of yesteryear, and on Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings.
During their free time, they hit the recruiting circuit - with disappointing results. ''Being a summer associate on Wall Street used to be a three-month-long party,'' said one Wharton student. ''You used to be able to go out every night. It's definitely not that way anymore.''
Gone, for the most part, are the sunset cruises around Manhattan, orchestra-seat tickets to Broadway shows and four-course meals at chic restaurants that firms have traditionally held for recruitment purposes for all summer interns, Wall Streetwide.
Investment banks today are hosting smaller, more subdued affairs. This summer, the Morgan Stanley Group Inc., for one, invited Wharton students for drinks at the Central Park Zoo and Harvard students for billiards at an Upper West Side pool club. That is a bit bland compared with the blowouts it had been known for in the past. In the summer of 1987, before the crash, the firm took a group of Stanford M.B.A.'s to the harness races at the Meadowlands in New Jersey to gamble.
Some firms have cut back on evening functions in favor of power breakfasts in their boardrooms. Other are prescreening candidates before entertaining them. ''It used to be that everyone got invited everywhere,'' said the Wharton student. ''Now they don't want to spend money unless they think you're really serious.''
Robert Scalise, director of career placement at the Harvard Business School, explains: ''They don't want their ability to throw parties to be the reason somebody goes to work for them. Since they're not hiring as much, they want to take a targeted approach instead of a shotgun approach.''
Mr. Scalise says the new recruits are taking a contrarian approach. ''There's a feeling among these students that if you're really good, you can make a difference,'' Mr. Scalise said. ''When an industry's in the pits, they think that's the time to go in. That's why investment banking remains so attractive.''
In general, employers appreciate this attitude. ''The students are much more realistic,'' said Collette Gardner, a vice president at the Bankers' Trust company. ''They're asking about long-term career objectives instead of how much money they're going to make the first year.''
But there are those who miss the killer instinct in new recruits. ''The associates we had this summer weren't as aggressive as those of the past,'' said one mergers-and-acquisitions specialist. ''They didn't have a warrior attitude like we did. The guys who came in with me were ready to bite the head off a chicken if they had to.''

HEADLINE: FORUM;
Accepting the Risk in Forecasting

BYLINE: By PETER SCHWARTZ; Peter Schwartz is president of Global Business Network, a strategic consulting firm in Berkeley Calif., and author of ''The Art of the Longview.''

 BODY:
Tens of billions of dollars were wasted in the 1980's by investing in the wrong future. More will be lost in the decades to come. One of the costliest examples was the collapse of the synthetic fuels industry. Energy companies and the United States Government first spent billions of dollars on the false assumption that oil prices would endlessly rise only to cancel their efforts when prices fell. They failed to understand the oil roller coaster. Now that Saddam Hussein has set off another price rise, we wish we had the option of producing synthetic fuel. There have been other recent forecasting disasters as well.
New ways of thinking and gaining strategic insight can help us overcome the two main obstacles to getting the future right. 
First, most organizations - and individuals - engage mainly in introverted thinking. Their perceptions are shaped by a narrow range of contacts and are mostly reinforced by the limited views of their peers. As people work together they share an unconscious desire to see a favorable outcome as the most likely outcome.
Second, these limits to thinking are further constrained by the desire to have a single-line forecast - the price of a barrel of oil in 1995, for example - or at least a most likely scenario. But the real world is inescapably uncertain. Clinging to the illusion of certainty increases the vulnerability to unfortunate surprises.
Scenario planning is one tool useful for dealing with this problem. Scenarios are simply stories about the way the future might unfold. They emphasize the logic behind events and are not intended as forecasts. They are exercises that can help managers plan and prepare for uncertainty by offering them a glimpse of several different futures. Investors, managers, the military and people in government could have benefited from constructing several different scenarios about Iraq's intentions after the conclusion of its war with Iran.
The Royal Dutch/Shell Group - where I was head of business environment - was ahead of most companies in thinking about the future. Shell anticipated the oil price increases of the 1970's and the collapse of the 1980's. Shell used this information to build new refineries before oil prices rose and to postpone the purchase of new oil fields until prices fell back down. How did we do it?
Shell did not have more facts than anyone else. The same data we had was available to many other companies in the oil industry. Nor did Shell seek a better way of producing a forecast. Rather, Shell's approach was to systematically gather as much information as possible from sources outside the company. This information was then used to produce several different scenarios for the future of the oil and gas industry.
In 1984, before President Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power, our group at Shell examined the future of the Soviet Union and how it would respond to its mounting economic problems. We decided to look at the Soviet Union because it was one of Shell's main competitors in the European gas market. One of the scenarios took the view that the Soviet Union would undergo radical political and economic reform and end its hold on Eastern Europe. With political tensions reduced, it could gain some competitive advantage in selling gas to Europe. Because this scenario was only one of several, it could be considered seriously.
Many managers, in business and government, prefer the illusion of certainty to the understanding of risks and realities. How can they then be blamed if the forecaster fails? Scenarios that illuminate uncertainty can help management prepare for the future as it unfolds. It is the ability to act confidently with a knowledgeable sense of risk and reward that distinguishes a business executive from a bureaucrat or a gambler.

HEADLINE: MESSAGE FROM SADDAM;
Curiously, a Dictator Forces the Middle East to Ponder Democracy

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
DEMOCRACY has had many strange midwives.
Wars, social upheavals and economic dislocations have all at one time or another given birth to democratic movements. And now maybe the strangest midwife of all has appeared. A bizarre byproduct of Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait is that it has begun to stir a debate - both in the Middle East and in Washington - about democracy in the Arab world. It is still a nascent and unformed debate, and it may lead nowhere, as have other such stirrings in the past. But there is no denying that the Arab nation, which has slumbered through glasnost and perestroika and all the popular revolutions from Berlin to Bucharest, is asking itself some new and fundamental questions precisely because of the storm unleashed by the Iraqi dictator. 
''There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein is the wrong man with the wrong method, but he may have come at the right time,'' said Nawaf Salam, a prominent Lebanese intellectual and Harvard University researcher who watched from his home in Beirut as the Iraqi invasion unfolded. ''What his invasion of Kuwait did was put all the fundamental and forgotten questions in the region on the table. First of all: money. What you could see in Beirut this summer was a whole new awareness of how much oil wealth some of these little gulf states really had amassed. If you asked people a month ago what size were the fortunes of the emirs, they could not tell you. But now people are aware. They talk about $900 billion in petrodollars invested by the gulf states abroad, at a time when Egyptians are hungry, Syrians are bankrupt and Lebanon is destroyed.''
This awarness, in turn, has raised more sharply than ever the questions of who controls this great wealth and why. Said Mr. Salam: ''People are asking, 'Why should 200 Kuwaiti princes control 20 percent of the world's oil?' No wonder that one of the solutions Arabs are talking about for Kuwait is elections. If real elections and a real democratic republic were the outcome in Kuwait, then one could say that this was a welcome crisis. It could transform the whole gulf.''
It may already have done so. Even if Iraq evacuated Kuwait tomorrow, few can imagine the Emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah - who fled to Saudi Arabia by helicopter soon after the Iraqis invaded - returning to power with business as usual, with the distribution of wealth in Kuwait the same, with the Kuwaitis who stayed behind to fight and resist saying: ''Please, Mr. Emir, here is your palace back. Thank you. Now we will go back to our tents.'' The poor Arab states, such as Egypt and Syria, which have also fought for Kuwait, will also present their bills for a new distribution of wealth. And if there is change in Kuwait, what will be the spillover next door in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, all of which have even more conservative feudal systems?
These questions are no less fundamental for the Bush Administration. President Bush has declared that one of the four objectives of America's intervention in the Persian Gulf is that ''Kuwait's legitimate Government must be restored,'' and he has several times specified that this meant a return to power of Kuwait's exiled tribal monarchs, the al-Sabah family. But that is a position with which many in Congress find themselves increasingly uncomfortable.
Representative Lee H. Hamilton, the Indiana Democrat who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on the Middle East, said: ''I know that I and many of my colleagues are hesitant about lining up with tribal monarchies and identifying our interests with them. I personally would not want to make it one of the United States' objectives that we restore the al-Sabah family. That would put us in conflict with the worldwide trend toward democracy, as well as with our own democratic values. We have to recognize that one of the spinoffs of this crisis is that it is going to put stress on all the traditional monarchies from Jordan to Saudi Arabia.''
In fairness, the al-Sabahs have always been the most progressive of the gulf monarchies. Historically, Kuwait, blessed with the only natural deep-water bay in the Persian Gulf, was a desert outpost whose Bedouin tribesmen made their living from pearl diving and fishing until oil was discovered at the outset of World War II. Its local politics has been dominated by the al-Sabah clan since 1756. The al-Sabahs' ascent and continuation in power were partly products of their own industry and partly products of their cooperation with the British, who installed them as Kuwait's first independent rulers when Her Majesty's Government relinquished its control there in 1961. Two years later, the House of al-Sabah allowed the establishment of a National Assembly to advise it on governing the country. The al-Sabahs also allowed for a relatively free press, which rankled their gulf neighbors. But every time parliamentarians or editors became too obstreperous the Emir would dissolve the assembly or shut down the newspaper. Kuwait's independent Parliament, the only freely elected representative body in the gulf region, was last suspended in 1986.
What Washington should do about the al-Sabahs is not purely a philosophical question. If the gulf crisis continues to move from the battle lines into the diplomatic bazaar, as it has been moving for the last week, it is likely that the fate of the al-Sabahs will become a centerpiece of negotiations. It is easily imaginable that at some point over the next few weeks or months, as economic sanctions really begin to bite, President Hussein could say to his Arab neighbors: ''My brothers, I am ready to withdraw my army from Kuwait, but you don't expect me to leave empty-handed. You know I can't do that. I need some compensation, something to save face.''
No doubt he would ask for an oil well and an island or two. No doubt these would be rejected by the other Arabs and the West. But what if the Iraqi leader asked only for a new ''popular'' government in Kuwait, one more representative of the people and more sympathetic to Iraqi concerns? That is an offer that many Arab governments might leap at in order to defuse this crisis, which, if it comes to war, could topple them as well.
It is clear that such a possibility is already in the back of President Bush's mind. Lately, he has refrained from mentioning the al-Sabahs, and last week he even remarked that whether the Kuwaiti ruling family remains in power is ''a matter for the Kuwaitis to decide.''
''If the Americans insist that the al-Sabahs must return, then what does that say about Washington's committment to democracy?'' asked Samir Khalaf of Princeton University, an expert on social change in the Arab world. ''But if they don't support the return of the al-Sabahs, then how do they justify the preservation of the House of Saud? The al-Sabahs have no fewer palaces than the Saudis. If the only reason the Americans are involved in the gulf is oil, that is bad. I hope it is more. I hope it is to create a political atmosphere there to bolster democracy. I hope that they are at least listening to the voices that Saddam Hussein has inadvertently given vent to.''
But that is a ticklish question. Among the President's four objectives in the gulf there is no mention of promoting democracy. Besides rolling back the Iraqis, restoring the Kuwaiti Government and protecting American lives, the President said, the United States seeks to preserve the ''security and stability of the Persian Gulf.'' In the last 50 years the United States, whatever its oratory, has tended to support democracy when it serves the interests of stability and to back away from insisting on it when it could destabilize an area of national interest. At stake in the gulf is the stability of oil supplies and the need to preserve the sanctity of borders so that the post-cold war world will not devolve into chaos. American troops are not passing out Arabic translations of the Constitution. To expect the United States to begin promoting democracy in the Arab world may be a bit too much to ask.
''Let us be honest, democracy just isn't on the menu in the Arab world today,'' said Fouad Ajami, an expert on Arab intellectual thought at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. ''What you have in the Arab world today is either the rule of the monarchs or the rule of the tyrants, the rule of kings or the rule of army officers. With Lebanon gone, there is no democractic 'third way.' In the monarchies like Kuwait, the social contract was that the ruler ruled and the citizen made money and minded his own business. It was not democracy, but it fit these tribal societies. There was a softness to them, a respect for limits, and men led lives of dignity.''
In places such as Syria or Iraq the social contract was quite different. There, Mr. Ajami said, ''the rulers ruled and the citizens cowered for their very lives.'' While the emirs and sheiks just wanted to do business quietly, the Saddam Husseins and the Hafez al-Assads were selling political utopias, Arab nationalist visions, the pursuit of which justified mass murder. In the Syrias and Iraqs, the presidential seals might as well read: Rule or Die. One man triumphs, the others weep.
To think that the debate ignited by the Iraqi invasion could easily overturn either of these systems - the monarchical or the dictatorial - and replace it with pluralistic democracy would be naive. The resources of the modern Arab state to survive in its two basic forms are enormous. Money, overlapping intelligence services, brute force and cunning have produced a remarkably stable generation of Arab regimes: Algeria's President Chadli Benjedid has been in office since 1979, Egypt's Hosni Mubarak since 1981, Saddam Hussein since 1979, Libya's Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi since 1969, Morocco's King Hassan II since 1961, Syria's President Hafez al-Assad since 1971, Jordan's King Hussein since 1953.
But there is a difference in this crisis, and it may yet produce real change. The discontent it has exposed is not simply something cooked up by intellectuals. The crisis has put out of work thousands upon thousands of Arabs - Egyptians, Syrians, Lebanese, Palestinians, Algerians - who had depended on employment in Iraq and the gulf oil states. All have returned home nursing grievances and starved for jobs. Combine their existence with the fact that all the old Arab ideologies - socialism, fundamentalism, Nasserism - have been discredited, and it makes a very potent force for social change.
The other new factor is the unprecedented involvement of the United States in the Arab world. Americans find it easier to support non-democratic governments when they are not fighting and dying for them. That was a big problem in Vietnam. So if shooting starts in the gulf, or even if the United States finds itself deeply and expensively involved there for months or years, Americans are going to begin asking a lot of questions about these regimes for which they are sacrificing. Before this crisis is over President Bush will probably have to have a long talk with America's Arab allies, to let them know that Saddam Hussein has served a warrant on their societies and that while the United States does not expect them to become Jeffersonian democracies overnight, some sort of change is necessary - for their own sakes as well as for Washington's. From that perspective, the Saudis, Egyptians, Syrians and others might wind up more scared of George Bush than of Saddam Hussein.
When Mr. Hussein invaded Kuwait, one of the first things he did was change the name of the main hospital there from the Al-Sabah Hospital to the Saddam Hussein Hospital. He has an affection for buildings named after himself, but then so too did the al-Sabahs. Is the only choice in the Arab world really between these two alternatives, the benevolent monarchs and the cruel dictators? For Americans, such questions have been either nonexistent or tertiary. But for most Arabs on the street, these are the real issues raised by the gulf crisis - not oil prices, not the sanctity of borders and certainly not abstractions about the post-cold war order.
If the Arabs can find a ''third way,'' then the gulf crisis will be remembered by them as a catalyst for positive change. If they cannot, than it will only serve to highlight a region that never changes. The desert poets will recite that the storm came and the storm passed and the Arab East stayed the same.

HEADLINE: What America Did After the War: A Tale Told by the Census

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
THOUGH foggy as a steamed-up bathroom mirror, the early 1990 census figures released last week offered the country its first look at itself as it emerged from the 1980's: the sagging cities, spreading suburbs, and the southern coasts and the Southwestern states bulging with economic and political muscle.
The legacies of the decade were in many ways similar to those of the 1970's, though Asian and Latin American immigrants gave the population a less homogeneous cast. But the census tends to narrow the demographic gaze to 10-year stretches. It is over the last 40 years that the most profound changes have emerged as America has become a different country, gaining about 99 million people along the way.
Beginning in 1950, a nation of 150,697,000 began to follow the sun. Over the next four decades, it paved 42,798 miles of Interstate highways, bought 300 million cars, and went for a ride. First the South headed north, then the North headed south, but always, the East headed west. 
At the start of the postwar era, America was a land of high-rise cities with farms not far distant. Though the farms were staggering and collapsing from the lingering wounds of the Depression, 23 million Americans - 15 percent -lived on them, and 30 million others lived in communities of fewer than 2,500 people. That was one-third of the country. The vast majority of the rest were urbanites: New Yorkers, Bostonians, Chicagoans, Detroiters, Clevelanders, milling steel and making cars.
In the end, the country's profile was dominated by the suburbs and what came to be called the sun belt. California, whose population was the size of Pennsylvania's in 1950, is now home to at least 29.2 million people, and it is 70 percent bigger than New York, the next largest state.
In 1950, Florida was a marshy expanse of land, home to 2.77 million people - ranking 21st in the country. Last week's preliminary census figures gave it 12.7 million people, which puts it fourth in the nation.
Four decades ago, Texas had about 1.59 million people, slightly more than Oregon. By 1990, the state had grown nearly fivefold, its 16.8 million or more people putting it in third place. Nearly one in five of its residents, or 3.7 million in 1985, was Hispanic, more than double the number 20 years before, the first year the census looked for Hispanics.
Wherever people chose to migrate, the kinds of communities in which they settled quickly began to change.
It was not only rural areas that faded but also the factory towns that once seemed so invincible. The world of ''The Last Picture Show'' began giving way to the world of ''Roger and Me.'' At the same time, new kinds of communities thrived, as the Levittowns were going gray, malls were going bust and retirement communities - designed for 31 million Americans 65 and over - moved away from employment centers, up into the mountains and out to the seashore.
As much as anything, the cold war was an engine of change. Starting in the 1950's, the Interstate highways were built, the better to maintain military mobility. The young were told to stay in school and learn science, the better to beat the Russians in space. The distance between home and work grew, the percentage of high school and college diplomas in the population increased.
The defense and aerospace companies of Southern California - Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas, Hughes Aircraft, TRW - expanded, jobs drawing people drawing new jobs. In 1963, 27 percent of the equipment the Defense Department bought - planes, guidance systems, missiles - was made in California. The state's share of defense contracts dwindled almost to 20 percent in the late 1970's, until President Reagan's Star Wars program helped push it back up to 27 percent in the mid-1980's.
Well-educated Americans were more mobile and California was a good place to move. With the change in the immigration laws in 1965, Asian immigrants - tens of thousands in the 1970's, hundreds of thousands in the 1980's - found California a logical place to go.
It was in the semiconductor industry of Santa Clara County, south of San Francisco Bay, that many first- and second-generation Asian immigrants found a home. According to Lenny Siegal, an economist for the Pacific Studies Center in Palo Alto, about 40 percent of manufacturing jobs in Silicon Valley are held by Asians. About 12 percent of the county's population is of Asian descent.
Over those same years in the rest of the country, the era of the small farmers hastened toward a long twilight. By the end of the 1980's, with tighter credit and droughts, fewer than five million Americans - less than 2 percent - lived on farms. The brief renewal of the 1970's was over, and rural America found itself a land fewer and fewer people wanted to live in.
The new unit of human habitation, the suburb, was instantly recogniz-able to everyone, but almost impossible for demographers to define. Suburbs began in the 1940's as fringe communities around central cities, in something the Census Bureau called a ''metropolitan area.'' In the 1960's, there was as much fringe as city, and still they continued to devour farmland.
Periodically the Census Bureau would change the nomenclature and the contours of metropolitan areas in a futile scramble to capture the swarming suburbs. Nearly four Americans in five now live in metropolitan areas, often in communities that call themselves cities, but have the flat silhouette of the suburbs. After sheltering the biggest generation of children in the country's history, the houses emptied out. After the 1980's fewer people lived in each house and developers enjoyed a boom. Over 40 years, the number of homes grew nearly half again as fast as the number of people.
Put 40 years of life in DeSoto County, Miss., on fast-forward and you can see America turning inside out. In 1950, within the barbed-wire fences that enclosed cotton fields stretching eastward from the Missisippi River, lived 24,599 people. Two-thirds were black. Virtually all were farmers. There was no industry other than the land. Memphis, the nearest big city, was 40 miles distant, another way of life.
The new preliminary census counts give DeSoto County a population of 67,124, not quite triple what it had been. During the 1960's, Interstate 55 pushed south through the county, bringing Memphis with it. DeSoto County is now part of the Memphis metropolitan area. ''When you drive into it, you'd never realize you've gone from one state to another or one town to another,'' said Bill Smith, an economic analyst for the Center for Policy Research and Planning in Jackson, Miss. ''The small farms have been almost wiped out.''
There are still farms but most often the fields are planted with houses. There are small factories making elevators and armored cars, concrete and security lights. The black farmers and some of their white neighbors, Mr. Smith said, almost certainly went north - to Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, to steel, to cars, to inner cities.
The number of black college graduates went from 125,000 in 1950 to about 2 million in the late 1980's, according to the political scientist Ben J. Wattenberg. As that number peaked, demographers were beginning to pick up the first signs that another generation of blacks was beginning to head back to the South, to work in the expanding service industries.
Other trends, too, paused in their headlong rush. Divorce rates, which almost doubled between 1950 and 1985, began to decline slightly in the late 1980's. Women, while continuing to move out of the home and into the workplace, started having babies again after a decade's postponement.
The number of births, which reached a postwar low in 1974, topped the 4-million mark in 1989, a number nearly equal to the high point of the baby boom in the mid-1960's. A growing number of children are born to interracial couples, currently about 3 percent of all births.
''We are going to be the model for other pluralist nations,'' said Mr. Wattenberg, whose forthcoming book is called ''The First Universal Nation.''
''On balance, this is a great development, although it will cause a lot of turbulence,'' he said. But no more turbulence than the latter half of the century has already brought.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
More Oil from more PLaces Could Loosen Gulf's Grip

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
TO many Americans, it's clear enough why Saddam Hussein must be stopped: Such a man cannot be permitted to control the oil lifeline to the world's industrialized nations. But even if Mr. Hussein were to retire to Switzerland tomorrow, the West's dependence on the Persian Gulf - and thus its vulnerability to conflict in the Middle East - would continue to grow.
That is why many analysts believe that as long as the West depends on oil, it would be worth a considerable investment to undercut the gulf region's near-monopoly on oil exports. The most promising sources of competition: Latin America and the Soviet Union, regions with a lot of oil and an urgent need for every extra dollar they can earn from exports.
World oil reserves totaled about 640 billion barrels in 1980, roughly a 30-year supply. A decade later, with new discoveries, reserves of oil in the ground are estimated at a trillion barrels, while world consumption has hardly changed. But paradoxically the Arab noose on oil consumers is tighter than ever. 
In the 1970's, notes Daniel Yergin, the head of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, the West could look forward to fresh gushes of crude from the North Sea, Mexico and Alaska. But in the 1980's virtually all the new finds were in the Persian Gulf; the combined reserves of the two largest consuming nations - the United States and the Soviet Union -have actually slipped by a tenth. Today Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Iraq, Iran and Kuwait can lay claim to 63 percent of the known remaining petroleum.
Importers could reduce dependence on foreign oil by curbing energy consumption, switching to more secure fuels or redoubling efforts to squeeze oil from spent domestic fields. But the pickins' are not nearly as easy as they once were.
 
The West Cuts Back
Higher market prices, higher fuel taxes and conservation regulation have reduced the amount of energy used per unit of output in the West. America's gross national product has increased by 52 percent since 1973; energy consumption has increased by just 9 percent. But while further energy conservation is certainly possible - a doubling of auto mileage would save America about two million barrels of oil a day - the gains would be costly.
Nor does domestic production offer much hope. Billions of barrels of oil have yet to be extracted from older domestic fields as well as from the few virgin fields left in Europe and North America. But some of this oil is in ecologically sensitive areas and most of the rest would be very expensive to recover.
By the same token, the cheapest and easiest opportunities for fuel substitution have already been exploited. The expansion of coal and nuclear power face daunting political and environmental barriers. And while natural gas is clean, the cost of weaning cars and trucks from oil would be awesome. Replacing or converting 200 million vehicles at an average cost of, say, $5,000 would run to $1 trillion, and that's only the beginning. No one knows how much it would cost to provide the natural gas for even a fraction of a converted fleet.
And without a long-term policy, a short-term plan to curb American consumption and encourage American production, as the Energy Department announced last week, the difference would be minor.
True independence from Persian Gulf oil is thus an impossible dream, most experts acknowledge. What may be possible, however, is to arrest the growth of imports from the region by increasing production in other parts of the world.
Diversification of supply is, in itself, a virtue. The smaller the percentage of oil coming from any one place, the less the risk that war or embargo (as in 1973-74) or revolution (as in 1979-80) could create a damaging shortage. But equally important to Western energy security, asserts Philip Verleger, an economist at the Institute for International Economics, is the development of production capacity in economies with an unquenchable demand for cash to finance domestic growth.
 
Distribution of Oil
Saudi Arabia is already easily capable of doubling the amount of oil it pumps; another big oil discovery would thus be unlikely to increase Saudi exports. Nigeria or Mexico or China, by contrast, need every dollar they can scrounge. Extra capacity there is likely to translate reliably into extra production.
The catch is that oil producers outside the Persian Gulf already have substantial incentives to increase output. The fact that they have not usually means that they cannot - at least not without help from foreign friends, and the West has been reluctant to extend that help on terms exporters will accept.
No real change is in the works - the United States, the natural leader, has yet to indicate its willingness to lead. But ideas for diversifying oil supplies have been discussed at the international lending agencies and the Department of Energy, for decades, and in the wake of the Iraq crisis, attitudes seem ripe for change.
 
The Debt Logjam
Send Money
This year about 10 percent of the remaining oil will be pumped from American and British fields.
Mexico, by contrast, will pump about 2 percent of its oil, and Venezuela only 1 percent. The lower rate of extraction in the third world is in part linked to restrictions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, in part to decisions to husband resources for future generations. But mostly it reflects a lack of capital and expertise.
State-owned oil companies in Latin America, notably in heavily indebted Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela, cannot borrow from foreign banks to pay for the expansion. Nor do they have the technology to develop offshore reserves.
The World Bank and other multilateral lenders could fill the gap. But they have been reluctant to redirect scarce cash from other projects, arguing that help would be available from private oil companies.
Opposition to direct foreign investment in oil runs deep throughout Latin America, and in Mexico is an icon of the nation's liberation from colonialism. But as one London-based oil executive put it, ''the old demonology is passing.''
The Latin oil producers might well accept foreign partners some day. Western governments might speed the courtship by guaranteeing that private investments in oil would not be lost to expropriation. They might also guarantee a future market by swapping existing debts denominated in dollars for promises to deliver petroleum. A debt-for-oil deal was used by the United States to carry Mexico through a financial crisis in the early 80's.
 
High-Risk Development
Unwanted Oil
Roughly half the oil in Latin America is in Venezuela, and much of that is too heavy to be extracted with ordinary equipment or converted to fuel in conventional refineries.
But Venezuela is not likely to find private investors to put up billions for projects that would not turn a profit unless oil remains in the $25 to $30 range.
Importing countries could ease the capital squeeze by guaranteeing a break-even price for the heavy oil to be delivered a decade hence. If market prices did not hold up, the buyers would of course lose a lot of money. But the importers might still get their money's worth in energy security if the deal were part of a broader agreement committing Venezuela to a substantial increase in production of conventional oil.
 
The Soviet Union
More, Comrade
The Soviet Union is the world's largest oil producer. But it burns most of what it pumps, exporting just one-third of its 12 million barrel daily output. And according to Chuck Movit, an analyst at PlanEcon in Washington, output, which peaked in the late 1980's, is now in free fall: production will probably be no greater in 1991 than it was in 1979.
Reversing the trend would be no easy matter: Soviet oil fields were badly damaged by exploitation in the 1980's. And there is an acute shortage of sophisticated machinery, the consequence of the general decline in Soviet industrial production and a crash effort to increase the availability of consumer goods. So Western capital and technology might make a big difference. Some joint ventures with foreign oil companies are already in the works, and although it is not yet under serious consideration, the way could probably be greased with subsidies and easing transfers on nonmilitary technology.
But as Morris Adelman, professor emeritus at M.I.T. argues, the cheapest barrel of oil in the Soviet Union is the barrel not consumed. Enormous amounts of energy are wasted because there is no incentive to conserve it. Aid to buy energy-efficient equipment might help. It surely would if it were tied to internal price reforms that forced consumers to pay the real cost of the oil diverted from exports.
Any extraordinary effort to increase oil exports from non-Arab sources would require leadership and money from America. ''It's hard to see our Government doing this sort of thing,'' said Daniel Yergin of Cambridge Energy. But then, it was hard to imagine a year ago that President Bush would be sending thousands of Americans to the Persian Gulf to keep Saddam Hussein in the corral.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
How New England Loved Real Estate and Lost

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
THE image of New England that was beamed out to the larger world in the 1980's was that of an economy in fighting form, brawny and booming, with high technology and high finance leading the march toward some glorious new era for the country's original industrial heartland.
But hindsight shows holes in that picture. As prosperity has receded across the Northeast, some economists have concluded that what looked like a hearty hybrid of old industry and new was more like a hot-house flower that bloomed briefly, if brilliantly, in an artificial environment of easy money, speculation and unwarranted optimism.
At the core of the revisionist view is real estate. Although it was clear during the peak years of the mid-1980's that developers and construction crews were changing the face of the region - especially in cities like Hartford, where the amount of downtown office space tripled in just 10 years - the prevailing attitude then was that all the building and real estate lending were simply a reflection of economic health. 
For a while, this was the case. The military buildup that began in the late 1970's and the spurt of growth in the computer-industry corridor around Boston heralded a new era. The swelling profits at banks and insurance companies seemed to be another sign, if one was needed, that good times were here to stay.
But in the period that most people would probably identify as the best of times - roughly 1984 to 1988 - New England's economic base, especially manufacturing, was already in decline. The six-state region lost nearly 56,000 manufacturing jobs in 1986 alone, for example, according to DRI/McGraw Hill, an economic consulting firm in Massachusetts.
The effect of those losses, however, was ''masked,'' according to a study recently published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and only became apparent in 1989, when construction fell and overall employment leveled off. Between 1984 and 1988, construction employment alone rose an average of 8.8 percent a year in the six New England states, the study said. In 1986, in an atmosphere where many people believed that the production of ideas, information and services represented the economic future, the region gained a total of 166,000 jobs even while it lost 56,000 in manufacturing.
What was happening, economists say, was the equivalent of forgoing a balanced if boring meal in favor of a plate full of candy bars. Manufacturing jobs make an economy grow, albeit slowly. Real estate, with its effects on law and banking - not to mention the restaurants and car dealerships where people splurged - can make an economy bounce off the walls.
''The last five years of the boom were cooked,'' said Edward Moscovitch, a Massachusetts economist who wrote the study for the Federal Reserve Bank.
What made the influence of real estate harder to track at the time, according to economists and bank regulators, was that so much of the regional economy, in varying ways, had beenpulled into the spiral. In much the same heady way that people discussed the soaring values of their homes, banks expanded their real-estate lending and hiring. Law firms were thriving on all the transactions, and they were hiring, too.
Another contributing factor came from Wall Street. Beginning about 1983, hundreds of small savings banks and savings and loans across the country went public and offered shares on the market. At the same time, however, each had to get higher returns on its investments to stay competitive. That called for real estate lending.
At many banks, the growth in real estate investment dovetailed with other temptations like junk bond trading and mergers. ''There was a dropping of traditional standards,'' said Robert F. Miailovich, assistant director of the division of bank supervision at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. ''Everything was coming up roses and people forgot certain principles.''
The results of the economy's unmasking can be measured in dollars lost and dreams dashed. Hartford, for example, has lost about 40 percent of its downtown hotel rooms over the last nine months. Across wide stretches of Massachusetts, condominium developments sit empty, some of them abandoned and incomplete.
In New Hampshire, applications for food stamps have jumped 54 percent in the last year, the sharpest jump of any state in the country. A survey about consumer confidence, conducted last month by the Conference Board, a business-backed group, showed that New England residents had the most dismal view about the economy since records began in 1981.
Yet New England has not done a Texas-style bellyflop - a point that many people across the Northeast repeat like a mantra - and economists say the differences between the two areas are as important as the parallels.
Unlike the Southwest, which rode to prosperity on the soaring price of oil in the early 1980's, the Northeast did not see signficant population increases - in part because of high housing prices. According to preliminary census figures, the populations of Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Jersey, for example, all grew by less than 4 percent over the decade, while New York's population stayed about flat.
In addition, the Northeast was already more densely populated than most parts of the country, and had more restrictions on development. Those combined forces, economists say, both prolonged the boom and cooked it all the harder.
Because the population did not grow very much, incomes climbed as employers were forced to compete for workers. The fact that open land was scarce drove up real estate prices as well. In 1980, for example, the median price of an existing home in New England was $67,882, only slightly above the national median. By 1989, the same home had reached $161,000, nearly 77 percent above the national figure.
The development restrictions, which builders say can result in a project taking twice as long to complete as it would elsewhere, may also have have made the overbuilding harder to stop, some economists say.
Human foibles gave the wheel a final spin. ''You can also never underestimate stupidity,'' said Raymond G. Torto, an economist at the University of Massachusetts. ''There was a deal-driven mentality that fed on itself.''

HEADLINE: The Month That Shook the World

 BODY:
In a month that weighed like a year, the crisis in the Persian Gulf has unsettled the conventional axioms of a generation. Until Saddam Hussein seized Kuwait, few imagined that the United Nations could truly unite, that sanctions might really bite, or that Russians and Arabs could join in a collective response skillfully led by President Bush.
Though enormous risks remain, this is an impressive start. The upcoming talks between Mr. Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev underscore how much the world has changed in this first frontal challenge to peace and security in the post-cold war era. 
A month's experience has yielded two precious lessons about the emerging global security system. The first is that U.S. leadership is indispensable to collective action. The second is that international participation and the patient use of international agencies serve the interests of all, and provide a chance to shape as well as heed global consensus.
Iraq's crime was unambiguous: the conquest and looting of a tiny neighbor. By menacing Saudi Arabia as well, Iraq threatened to gain a chokehold on the world's oil supplies, and economies. Saddam Hussein compounded his offenses by seizing hostages, bullying diplomats and proclaiming a holy war against Arab neighbors.
The U.S. is assembling a mighty international force in Arabia. And the U.N. has put together an impressive embargo. Iraq's reliance on oil revenues and its geographical situation make it peculiarly vulnerable to these sanctions. The following are among the sensible markers for sustaining the pressure as the siege continues:
Keep uniting the U.N. Its unanimous resolutions - to condemn Iraq, impose bruising sanctions and authorize use of force to make sanctions stick - are critical to success. They legitimize international action beyond narrow national interests. The U.N. is proving its worth.
Nurture the enforcing coalition. Soviet support for an arms embargo and sanctions against Iraq has helped make Desert Shield a joint venture, gaining the support of Arab states, as well as Turkey, Japan and the European democracies. It will not be easy to keep all together, and there is obvious utility in a direct exchange between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev. Unity is essential, and so is the principle that the coalition partners share the common burden equitably.
Don't rise to Baghdad's bait. Saddam Hussein seeks desperately to present himself as an Arab underdog pitted against an imperial America and Israel. But his quarrel is with the world, the central truth that Mr. Bush rightly keeps putting in the foreground - despite rising passions over the plight of U.S. hostages.
Give the embargo a chance to work. Hasty Hawks would like to stampede Mr. Bush into an unprovoked strike against Iraq, even before the quarantine takes full effect. But the already growing lines in Baghdad show that the squeeze has a good chance of success. Using massive force now would shatter the anti-Iraq coalition.
Begin now to shape peace terms. This may be the hardest task for Mr. Bush. The U.N. demands call only for unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait, the restoration of its lawful rulers and the freeing of hostages. If Saddam Hussein complies, that would leave his war machine intact, enabling Iraq to resume its aggressions after the siege is lifted.
Prudent conditions for an enduring settlement have to go much further. They need to provide for the destruction of Iraq's chemical and nuclear weapons potential under international inspection, and international policing of guaranteed frontiers in the gulf. Saddam Hussein's territorial and financial claims against Iraq could be submitted to the World Court, and the U.N. also could address issues like the future government of Kuwait. The problem is that these conditions go beyond the present U.N. consensus, and many member states almost certainly would resist them.
Mr. Bush has succeeded in mobilizing a remarkable collective response. But he will have to be at least as skillful in widening the purposes of the enterprise and sustaining world unity. At stake is nothing less than the new world order he and other leaders struggle to shape.

HEADLINE: Riskless Hormone

 BODY:
Bovine growth hormone is the first of many genetically engineered products that promise to enhance agricultural efficiency. But the hormone is meeting strong resistance, based in part on the stirring of unfounded fears. A recent study by the Food and Drug Administration confirms that the hormone presents no risk to human health. 
When injected into cows, bovine growth hormone raises milk production by about 14 percent. The product is opposed by some dairy farmers, who fear so spectacular an increase in production would push less efficient producers out of business.
The farmers have an ally in the Foundation on Economic Trends, which opposes the concept of genetic engineering and has questioned the hormone's safety. Both Wisconsin and Minnesota have enacted a temporary ban on use of the hormone, as has the European Community.
Synthetic bovine growth hormone is made in bacteria programmed with the cow's gene. It is almost identical with the cow's naturally made growth hormone, small amounts of which are present in milk anyway. The traces of bovine growth hormone in milk, whether natural or synthetic, are destroyed in the gut like other proteins. Even if they somehow entered the bloodstream, bovine growth hormone doesn't make humans grow.
The hormone works in the cow by creating a secondary hormone, trace amounts of which are also present in milk. The secondary hormone is identical with its human counterpart, raising the question of whether infant formula made from the milk of hormone-treated cows might be bad for babies, since they could get a larger than normal dose of the secondary hormone. The F.D.A.'s answer is no, because the secondary hormone is present in the same quantities as in mother's milk, and is in any case destroyed in the heating process used to make formula.
Fears about hormones and genetic tinkering have a powerful resonance, but there remains no valid reason for resisting bovine growth hormone on grounds of risk to human health.
All new technologies deserve careful scrutiny, especially genetic engineering because the effects of changing the biological machinery are often hard to predict. But once all reasonable tests have been done, resistance should not continue on the basis of unfounded fears and apprehension. Unless products like bovine growth hormone receive a more informed appraisal, a valuable new technology will be unnecessarily delayed.

HEADLINE: Why Moscow Must Walk the Tightrope in Iraq

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''The Soviets: Steady, if Slow'' (editorial, Aug. 24) brings up some doubts about my country's policy toward Iraq. Is Moscow playing a double game in the Persian Gulf? The Soviet leadership has taken a tough stand toward the aggressor, but the decision to keep Soviet military experts in Iraq has given birth to all kinds of speculations. That decision, however, proceeds from a statement by the Soviet Government consistent with the Soviet-American declaration approved by Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d at Vnukovo Airport near Moscow. 
Many have said that the Kremlin should have broken off military contracts with Iraq for aggression against Kuwait and recalled all Soviet military experts. But Baghdad might have viewed this as a signal of Moscow's readiness to use immediate military force against Iraq, and Iraqi authorities could have turned all Soviet citizens into hostages.
The reason the Soviet leadership is not evacuating its military experts is to use the Soviet presence in Iraq not only to obtain safe passage out of the country for many Soviet citizens but also to resolve the crisis by political means. Hundreds of thousands of people would be killed and poisoned with gas in a war for a liberation of Kuwait and foreign hostages. A destruction of Saudi and other Arab oilfields by Iraqi aircraft and rockets would cause great damage to the world economy. But even such losses would not guarantee survival for the thousands of foreign hostages.
Moscow is evidently pressing the Iraqi regime to withdraw its troops from Kuwait immediately and unconditionally, and to free all hostages. It is also trying to bring home to Baghdad the dangerous consequences of a war for the Iraqis. Mindful of the need for using military force against the aggressor, the Soviet leaders prefer the United Nations to be the sole instrument for the accomplishment of this mission.
Indeed, under the United Nations aegis, armed forces of different countries would act on behalf of the world community, put Baghdad in complete international isolation and make it pay for its aggression.
While calling on Saddam Hussein to listen to reason, Moscow also considers the entire situation in the Middle East. The Palestinian extremists voiced their support for the Iraqi dictator and are desperately anxious to act on his side. Such steps could sow terror throughout the region, with United States, Soviet, British and other citizens falling victim to their collective action against the aggressor.

HEADLINE: A Balanced Budget Would Finish Us Off

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Those of us who are old enough can remember the political battle fought in 1932 between Franklin D. Roosevelt and Herbert Hoover. The main issue was which candidate would best reduce Government expenditures and balance the budget, thus restoring prosperity. Roosevelt, the winner, fortunately did not follow his own campaign position on fiscal soundness, at least not until after he was re-elected in 1936 and then seriously tried to balance the budget. The result: a serious recession in 1937. 
We now know that the nation did not pull itself out of the Great Depression until two things happened: (1) Starting in 1940, we had massive deficits, in contrast to the small ones of the 1930's. (2) We undertook massive military expenditures (that justified the huge deficits and did not clog up the civilian marketplace with overproduced civilian goods).
Each of these justified the other and continued to do so until recently. This formula for prosperity (at the expense of future generations) has continued successful for 50 years. Now, the collapse of the Communist threat and the explosive political campaign for a balanced budget threaten to return us to 1939. We have not solved the problems of the national economy, but learned to live with them.
Contrary to the conventional wisdom of economics and economists, it is my belief that the national budget cannot be balanced, at least not for more than one fiscal year. If we succeed in moving dramatically toward a balanced budget, a major recession will hit us, greatly reducing tax income and increasing Government expenditures through what is left of the ''safety net.'' Success will beget failure. If we come to believe, like Hoover and Roosevelt in 1932 that a balanced budget will cure our economic ills, we will likely move from recession to Great Depression II.
We should remember that government deficits tend to transfer money from those who have it but are not using it to those who want to consume and invest. This is an essential function, and we must somehow learn to live with it, without the dire consequences of multitrillion-dollar debt.
In the words of John Maynard Keynes, there must be a better answer than to leave huge pump-priming deficits to future generations. But remember, Keynes also noted in his definitive economic forecast that ''in the long run, we are all dead.'' So why worry?

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
A Collective Effort

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
''The Japanese have a hell of a stake in this,'' said Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, a liberal Democrat, after a briefing by President Bush on the Middle East crisis, ''and ought to pay a hell of a share.''
At the other end of the political spectrum, Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina said after the same briefing: ''I think it was unanimous that we ought not to pay for this alone.''
In response to this indisputable point, Mr. Bush now has turned to an effort to assure international financial support for the collective effort to curb Saddam Hussein. The obligation of the Kuwaiti emirate, with its vast treasure in foreign banks, and of the rich Saudi princes, is obvious. Japan and Western Europe have more at stake in oil supplies than the United States, and as much in the principle that's invoked - collective security. 
Mr. Bush would not be out of line to ask that these vitally concerned nations share most of the costs of an undertaking in which the U.S. supplies most of the forces and equipment. Why should Americans pledge lives to collective security if others as deeply affected are unwilling to pledge money?
The question was emphasized on the day of Mr. Bush's briefing by the Pentagon's entirely expectable announcement that the cost of Operation Desert Shield, through September, would not be $1.2 billion as previously stated, but $2.5 billion. The history of military cost estimates suggests that even that doubled prediction probably will be surpassed.
The end-of-September deadline, moreover, looks ever more unrealistic, as the prospect of a long military standoff deepens. The allied, mostly American, forces in Saudi Arabia appear to have stymied the possibility - it never was a certainty - of an Iraqi invasion. At the same time, Saddam Hussein has given no hint -quite the opposite - that he's likely any time soon to pull back from his conquest of Kuwait, as demanded by the U.S., the U.N., most Arab nations and most of the rest of the world.
The President appears - at least for now - to be unwilling to push Mr. Hussein out of Kuwait by military force, much less to attack Iraq directly in order to oust him. The desire of Israel, in its own interest, for U.S. offensive action against Mr. Hussein may be understandable; but Mr. Bush could hardly consider such a war in the American interest.
That would scuttle collective security, since a U.S. attack on Iraq would be supported only by Israel. It would damage U.S. backing in Europe and elsewhere and destroy some of the oil-producing capacity supposedly being kept available to the world. Japan and Germany are unlikely to help pay for that.
Such an attack also would shatter the tenuous Arab support for the collective effort, convert the present international resistance to aggression into a U.S. war with an Arab nation, make Mr. Hussein a greater hero in Arab eyes and endanger the thousands of hostages he's holding. Mr. Bush's homefront support might vanish with that of the rest of the world, as Americans found their sons in a real war rather than in Grenada or Panama. Domestic support for a stalemate in the desert will decline also, but probably not as decisively as for a stalemated or losing war, with casualty rates sure to be high.
It's not at all sure, moreover, that the U.S. has the offensive capacity in the region for a quick and successful war. Nor is it clear that the tightening economic noose around Mr. Hussein's neck will not in the long run at least force him out of Kuwait. The economic strategy may take months to work, or to show that it won't. Until one or the other result is indisputable, a unilateral U.S. attack on Iraq would be disastrous.
As for what Mr. Hussein might do, if he remained in power in Iraq even after being forced out of Kuwait - a big if - it probably is unrealistic to hope that he would quietly mind his own business. But a good start has been made on international, including U.N., action toward collective security, which could become the brightest side of a dark situation; a U.S. attack on Iraq would end that hope. Americans and Israelis eager for war with Iraq may consider collective security measures - an international peacekeeping force, for example - inadequate to contain Saddam Hussein; but the achievements of the U.S. and its allies, including the Soviet Union, argue for trying them.
In the new world dawning at the end of the cold war, many approaches once deemed impractical might prove workable. What's now happening in the Middle East may be only the first example. A. M. Rosenthal is traveling.

HEADLINE: Seen Any Warbleers Lately

BYLINE: By Ken Emerson; Ken Emerson is Viewpoints editor of New York Newsday.

 BODY:
Chandler S. Robbins, a senior U.S. Fish and Wildlife biologist at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, is rattling through the refuge in Laurel, Md., when he brakes his Chevy on a one-lane bridge spanning a creek that is swollen with spring rain. From a drooping branch hangs a nest, and in it sits an olive-brown mite of a bird he quickly identifies as an Acadian flycatcher.
After Robbins gets out of the car, the bird flies off with a perturbed pip! - and no wonder. For through the bridge's girders Robbins pokes an extendible aluminum pole with the rear-view mirror from a child's bicycle affixed to its tip. A dentist could use the device to examine a giraffe's molars. Angling the mirror over the nest, Robbins sees that it's empty, still under construction. So, leaving the bird to its business, he continues on his. 
Six hours later, he has examined and tallied the contents of 16 wood thrush nests, three red-eyed vireo nests and one each belonging to an ovenbird and a Kentucky warbler. Some are empty, many contain eggs and a few hold just-hatched, dime-size, eraser-pink young. (One clutch of precocious wood thrush nestlings, literally early birds on this last weekend in May, has sprouted mole-gray pinfeathers.) None of these nests has been as conveniently close to a road as the flycatcher's. Yet lumbering through thickets and sloshing across streams in high rubber boots has been more exhilarating than exhausting. Robbins will be attending his 50th reunion at Harvard in a week. Even with hearing aids, he can no longer detect the high-frequency lisp of a blue-gray gnatcatcher or the urgent squeak of a blackpoll warbler. But there's still something boyish about him, and it's not just his bushy crew cut and the Boy Scout olive of his overshirt. He loves to tramp though the woods with an adolescent's abandon - albeit with a scientist's sense of purpose.
Robbins - known as Chan everywhere but in scholarly papers - is in the vanguard of biologists who are sounding an alarm that songbirds are imperiled in America, especially in what remains of the forests in the Northeast. ''There is a sickness in the woods,'' the biologist John Terborgh warns in his recent book, ''Where Have All the Birds Gone?''
The malady is not the same one Rachel Carson diagnosed in ''Silent Spring,'' her 1962 book (based largely on data compiled at Patuxent) that led eventually to the banning of DDT. Pesticides still present problems, but these pale beside a new danger -the rapid deforestation of Central and South America, where many birds spend the winter - and an old one that continues unabated: the commercial and residential development of North America, where these migrants rear their young. Moreover, new research suggests that suburbia poses a subtle and insidious threat to many songbirds by enabling predators and parasites to thrive at their expense.
''These birds are getting it on both ends of the line,'' Robbins says, ''in the breeding season and in the winter. The thing that's difficult to answer specifically about an individual species is where is the bottleneck? They're under pressure here, they're under pressure there. Which is worse?''
In 1965, Robbins and other Fish and Wildlife researchers organized the nationwide Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), expanded to include Canada, and the records of volunteer observers (some 4,000 participated this spring) have been accumulating ever since. The computer analysis to which these findings is subjected is arcane, but you don't need a Ph.D. in statistics to decode the bottom line.
Between 1978 and 1987, the number of wood thrushes breeding in the eastern United States and Canada fell at an annual rate of 4 percent. For rose-breasted grosbeaks, the yearly decline was 4.1 percent. North America's two species of cuckoo, the black-billed and yellow-billed, were down an annual average of 5.9 and 5 percent, respectively. The Tennessee warbler is minus 11.6 percent annually; the worm-eating warbler, minus 2 percent; the ovenbird, minus 1 percent.
These figures are not universally accepted, but if the U.S. Census Bureau is having difficulty counting 250 million or so people, imagine the impossibility of tallying accurately the 20 billion birds ''guess-timated'' to inhabit the continental United States every summer.
BBS data indicate that at least 21 species of songbirds that are dwindling in eastern North America fly to wintering grounds in the Neotropics: to Mexico, the Caribbean, Central and South America. (An additional dozen or so songbirds may be declining, but the falloff is not yet statistically significant.) Many migratory shorebirds are in trouble, as well as some migrant songbirds that nest in the West, but the Northeastern woods are the nursery and summer home of the greatest concentrations of Neotropical migrants. Some of these birds, the warblers and tanagers, are our most vividly colored; others, particularly the thrushes, are the most melodious singers. Without flycatchers, our woods would be even thicker with no-see-ums and other nuisances. Were these migrants to disappear altogether, not just the forests but our lives would be impoverished.
By now the deforestation of Central and South America, which is proceeding in some countries at an annual rate of 1 to 3.5 percent, has become a cause that is literally celebre. Everyone from Senator Sam Nunn to Madonna has jumped on the ''Don't Bungle the Jungle'' bandwagon. The pressures of population and economics are devastating Latin America and endangering, many scientists charge, the earth's entire atmosphere as well as the winter habitats of what it is presumptuous to call ''our'' birds, since they actually spend the greater portion of the year in the Neotropics.
Increasing numbers of American biologists are spending their winters in the Neotropics, too, trying to document the damage and to encourage local conservation efforts. Deforestation is their greatest concern, but not their only one. Many dangerous pesticides that have been outlawed in the United States, for instance, are still widely used in Latin America.
On that spring morning at Patuxent, Chan Robbins wore a T-shirt emblazoned with a toucan and the legend ''Belize'' - where he has conducted research for the past three years. Using satellite imagery to identify different habitats, he is comparing bird populations in agricultural and still-forested areas.
Radar scans of flocks of birds migrating across the Gulf of Mexico show a decrease in density, but those that live year-round in the tropics have been hit even harder, according to Robbins. The scarlet macaw, he says, seems to have all but disappeared: ''To see one you'd have to backpack for two or three days and hire a special guide.''
Among migrant songbirds, those that depend exclusively on undisturbed Neotropical forests, particularly those that winter in a circumscribed area, seem to be most at risk. These include the cerulean warbler and the Louisiana water thrush (despite its name, another warbler).
Yet suspicion is mounting that the attrition of Neotropical migrants cannot be attributed entirely to circumstances south of the border - no more than America's cocaine problem can be blamed altogether on Colombia and Peru. That is why Robbins, two Fish and Wildlife colleagues and two summer interns are scouring the woods in Maryland for bird nests. They are comparing the reproductive success rates of birds within the 4,700 acres of the Patuxent refuge to those that attempt to breed within the smaller woodland plots, or ''fragments,'' more characteristic of the densely settled Northeast. The conclusion that their evidence points to is that if it's bad for Neotropical migrants all over, fragmentation is especially injurious to their reproductive health.
''We're gradually building a public awareness,'' Robbins says. ''This whole business of fragmentation - 20 years ago that word was never used - it was wet woods or steep woods or whatever, but woods was woods. Size had no meaning. Now we know that it is extremely important.''
''Ooooh, disgusting!'' Barbara A. Dowell is surveying the wreckage of a wood thrush nest that has been knocked on its side but not quite dislodged from a sapling. On the ground lie one pale blue egg, wet and cold to the touch, a shattered shell containing an embryo and shards of a third egg whose contents have presumably been eaten by an unknown predator.
Dowell, who has been working at Patuxent for 12 years and with Robbins for most of them, is canvassing a 45-acre lot a few miles from the refuge. This fragment is all that remains of what may be the last virgin forest in Maryland. Development in this area, strategically and vulnerably midway between Washington and Baltimore, has been recent and massive. The housing clusters often bear ironically sylvan names like Twelve Oaks (even a Job Corps center is called Woodland).
While scores of oaks and tulip trees still tower in this plot, the leaves of the dogwoods that fill in the spaces between their immense trunks are withered and crumpled - by acid rain, says Dowell. More bird nests than in the refuge seem to have been struck by a blight, too. Since Dowell last checked, numerous wood thrush nests, as well as a Kentucky warbler's, have been despoiled by predators. Locating three cardinal nestlings in a tangle, she sniffs the musky, urinaceous scent of a fox whose den must be nearby and predicts that they're not long for this world, either.
Warblers, no less than wolves, need Lebensraum, but research suggests that a wood lot's size per se is not the only factor that deprives birds of their reproductive edge. It is also the easy access that smaller forests provide predators to the birds' eggs and young within.
These have always been tempting morsels. When Audubon painted blue jays, he portrayed them gobbling eggs. ''See how each is enjoying the fruits of his knavery,'' he wrote, ''sucking the egg which he has pilfered from the nest of some innocent dove or harmless partridge!'' Crows and grackles, as well as blue jays, feast upon eggs and nestlings, and so do raccoons, skunks, opossums and squirrels (not to mention cats). All of these creatures have fattened at the bird feeders and garbage cans of suburbia, where they prosper in greater densities than in deep forest. And when the woods aren't deep - they seldom are in America anymore - the birds that nest there are sitting ducks for opportunistic and increasing populations of predators.
That's the theory, at least, and scientists are still gathering evidence to support it. A question immediately arises, however. If predation is the culprit, why are so many other birds that migrate only as far as the southern states, or not at all, flourishing under the same suburban circumstances? Species such as the tufted titmouse, cardinal and mockingbird have even expanded their geographical ranges.
David S. Wilcove, now the senior biologist for the Wilderness Society, conducted a series of ingenious field experiments with artificial, cup-shaped wicker nests stocked with commercial quail eggs. He set them out in forests of varying sizes, on the ground and in saplings, and he also deposited eggs in makeshift nesting boxes mimicking the tree holes (or ''cavities'') in which birds such as woodpeckers, chickadees and titmice nest. The deeper the woods, his results showed, the less predation. Nests on the ground were looted more frequently than those in trees. And nests in cavities escaped scot-free. Unfortunately, the vast majority of Neotropical migrants construct open-cup nests, and many build them on the ground. Birds that don't migrate such distances tend to prefer cavities and other less accessible nesting sites. Thus, birds that stick closer to home year-round are more secure than Neotropical migrants, even without the feeding stations that enable many of them to survive the winter.
Chan Robbins and his colleagues have been counting bird nests in Maryland for three years, which is not long enough to reach definitive conclusions. But one thing is already obvious to him: ''In the small, isolated woodlands, we're not getting the Neotropical migrants anymore. . . . You just don't find warblers.''
It's a grotesque yet mesmerizing sight, a miniaturized ''Rosemary's Baby'' for real. On a bare branch about 20 feet up an oak tree, a big dingy cowbird fledgling is calling insistently for food. Its cries are answered by a warbler half its size, an adult ovenbird that alights on the branch with a caterpillar in its beak. Approaching timorously, the ovenbird tosses the tidbit down the fledgling's gullet and flies off in a flash, as if in fear that it, too, will be devoured. Twenty minutes later, and as many yards away, a diminutive ovenbird fledgling flutters about the undergrowth, cheeping to be fed, but to no apparent avail.
One usually thinks of parasites as tiny ticks and such, but the brown-headed cowbird is also a parasite, one that threatens many other birds almost as gravely as predators. Indeed, one warbler, the Kirtland's, would probably be extinct by now if Fish and Wildlife and other agencies didn't regularly trap and remove cowbirds from their nesting grounds in central Michigan.
Cowbirds have the nasty habit of depositing their eggs in smaller birds' nests. A young cowbird is large to start with and grows quickly, commanding most of the food brought by stepparents whose natural offspring often languish and die. ''Rowdy little buggers,'' Barbara Dowell calls young cowbirds. One researcher admits that when she encounters cowbird nestlings or eggs, she often casts aside scientific protocol and flings them to the ground.
When cowbirds were largely confined to the Great Plains and the company of bison, so was the havoc they wreaked. But with the felling of the forests and the introduction of mechanized harvesting that leaves behind plenty of grain for cowbirds to consume, their range has extended across the continent.
The open nests of Neotropical migrants are as inviting to these parasites as they are to predators. To make matters worse, most long-distance migrants lack the instinctual ability some short-distance migrants and stay-at-homes, including blue jays, catbirds and robins, have acquired after centuries of experience to recognize cowbird eggs and eject them from their nests.
Cowbirds still seem to be most pernicious in the Midwest - where one researcher concluded from an Illinois study that ''wood thrushes are doing nothing but raising cowbirds'' - and to prefer open country and suburbs to dense woods. That's why the encounter with the ovenbird and the parasite fledgling was particularly dismaying. It occurred deep within the Hawk Mountain Sanctuary in eastern Pennsylvania, where the research director, James C. Bednarz (who now works with a private consulting firm), and an intern were snaring ovenbirds.
Going Robbins one better, Bednarz and his colleagues were not only tallying nests but banding birds - ovenbirds and wood thrushes - within the sanctuary and in outlying forest fragments. The goal is to track individual birds over several years. Will they return to the same spot for several springs? How prolifically will they breed? Will they abandon a fragment in frustration?
Lugging mist nets and poles in an old golf bag, Bednarz was accompanied by Nancy R. Zawada, an urban park ranger from Staten Island. Whenever they heard an ovenbird's teacher-teacher-teacher song (Robert Frost's sonnet, ''The Oven Bird,'' hailed the ''singer everyone has heard''), they would unfurl and string up two 30-foot-long swathes of fine mesh. At the center, where the nets met, they stationed a wooden model of an ovenbird, nicknamed Oppenheimer (the wood thrush decoy is Wendell), and concealed a tape-recorder under leaves. All morning long the songs, live and on tape, volleyed back and forth, like an avian ''Dueling Banjos,'' but not until after noon did an ovenbird actually fly into the nets as it tried to drive its unbudging rival from its nesting territory.
Quickly disentangling the bird, Bednarz and Zawada took several measurements and suspended it, nestled in a navy-blue sock, from a pocket scale (19 grams). After she attached colored bands to each of its legs, Zawada blew gently on the feathers of the underbelly to part them and determine the sex (male, with swollen testes). And, just before releasing the bird, she plucked one of its 12 tail feathers (it's painless, she said, and a replacement soon grows in).
Zawada is conducting an experiment in the little-known field of ptilochronology. Certain bird feathers bear faint lateral bands that indicate 24 hours' growth, much as the rings in a tree trunk record a year's. Squint and wiggle the feather as if it were one of those magic pictures from a Cracker Jack box, and you can just make these bands out. The wider they are, the more daily growth and, presumably, general well-being a bird has enjoyed. By measuring them on birds netted in different habitats, Zawada is administering what amounts to a comparative stress test. Her hope is to determine whether birds are literally more ''stressed out'' in forest fragments than in thick woods.
But the woods atop Hawk Mountain were not very thick this year. In the spring, gypsy-moth caterpillars stripped the oak canopy bare, as they have so many other forests in the Northeast since the Eurasian moth was introduced to the United States in 1869. Several decades of widespread aerial spraying have put a stop neither to the devastation nor to the debate over the effects of such pesticidal programs. One study conducted in a New Jersey state forest indicated that birds declined in abundance by 55 percent after a single aerial spraying and took years to recover.
Gypsy moth infestations are usually periodic, not permanent. The tree trunks on Hawk Mountain (which has not been sprayed since 1969) were studded, as if by rusty nails, with dead caterpillars, and the ground was littered with their squishy remains. They had erupted in such numbers that they had exhausted their food supply and starved to death. The recommendation of many naturalists is to let nature - even if, as in the case of the gypsy moth, it's imported - take its course.
Robbins and many other biologists believe that what threatens bird life is not nature, but mankind, taking its course. Yet a great deal more research must be conducted and completed in both South and North America to determine the extent of the decline and its causes. ''We're dealing with huge numbers of birds and a large geographical area,'' Robbins says. ''Even when we say it's a scarce bird, there are a lot of them out there. How many cerulean warblers are there? Tens of thousands? Maybe 100,000? No one knows. They're not going to disappear all of a sudden.''
Although 9 out of 10 researchers, according to Paul Kerlinger, director of the Cape May Bird Observatory of the New Jersey Audubon Society, would agree that woodland birds are losing ground, some still harbor doubts. Richard T. Holmes, a biology professor at Dartmouth College who has been conducting studies in the White Mountains for 22 years, says he hasn't seen a widespread decline in New Hampshire and questions the Breeding Bird Survey data. However, even Holmes, who also works in the Neotropics, acknowledges, ''I don't think anybody has any good evidence that the Neotropics are important at this stage, but they will be eventually if enough deforestation occurs down there.''
''It could creep up on you,'' warns Jim Bednarz. ''If we wait for 10 years and the songbirds decline by 50 percent, it may be too late to recover.''
''We must strike a balance,'' cautions an article in Current Ornithology, ''between labeling every ephemeral downturn a major population decline (the 'Chicken Little Syndrome') and refusing to accept the evidence for population decline unless it satisfies impossibly rigorous statistical requirements for certainty (the 'Tobacco Lobby Syndrome').''
All the evidence about songbirds so far supports preserving as much forest as possible, in North America as well as the Neotropics. And in large, contiguous tracts rather than small, isolated parcels. What Bednarz calls ''Swiss cheese habitat'' is porous to predation. In order to protect the maximum amount of remaining woodland, the New Jersey Audubon Society is not alone in recommending development policies that promote cluster housing rather than individual lots. It also urges a halt to aerial spraying for gypsy moths and mosquitoes.
Still, the last lines of Frost's ''The Oven Bird'' echo ominously: ''The question that he frames in all but words/Is what to make of a diminished thing.''
''If I had children, I'd be worried,'' says Patuxent's Barbara Dowell. ''Not because people are going to become extinct like the birds, but because of the quality of their life. To me, a minimum quality of life is a wood thrush.''

TRUMP
Surviving at the Top.
By Donald J. Trump with Charles Leerhsen.
Illustrated. 236 pp. New York:
Random House. $21.95.
Toward the end of ''Trump: Surviving at the Top'' the reader actually feels something like pity for the hero. This brief, unlikely moment occurs when Donald J. Trump is describing his bizarre dealings with Leona Helmsley. Long ago, he explains, the middle-aged Mrs. Helmsley took an uncommon fancy to him. ''For some reason,'' Mr. Trump writes, ''even though I was not tremendously successful at that time, Leona always liked having me around. . . . I was always asked to be [at her parties] and was always given a seat, usually right near her.'' 
Mr. Trump has already alluded several times to his own sex appeal and has once claimed that ''I've never had any trouble in bed.'' The young and dashing Mr. Trump escorts a fashion model to one of Mrs. Helmsley's parties. Mrs. Helmsley flies into what appears to be a jealous rage. ''How dare you bring that tramp to one of my parties?'' she screams, in the presence of the other woman. ''At first I was shocked,'' Mr. Trump says, ''but then all the things people had been telling me about Leona and her Jekyll-and-Hyde personality started coming back to me.'' From then on Mrs. Helmsley, with her ''crazed personality,'' heaps all manner of abuse on Mr. Trump.
This rare passage in which Mr. Trump seems at the mercy of forces beyond his control ends quickly. The roles reverse when Mr. Trump steamrollers over Mrs. Helmsley in a deal, then fires off a few gratuitous insults of his own. Mr. Trump, once again, is the Conqueror.
Filled as it is with Mr. Trump's usual commercial sadomasochism, ''Trump: Surviving at the Top'' is already out of date. Mr. Trump can no longer afford to insult at will. He can no longer sow salt in the real estate of his enemies. We now know Mr. Trump's business, based as it was on rising property prices and foolish bankers, has collapsed. He is losing money. He is a virtual slave to external forces. With his debts possibly exceeding his assets by as much as $250 million, his bankers watch and advise his every move. He has had to agree, for example, not to spend more than $450,000 a month on his personal expenses. Yet he still insists, like a captured tyrant, that he is in charge.
Reading the scene between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Helmsley, I began to wonder if there isn't something in the Manhattan soil that drives those who wish to control it to distraction; it's not just Mrs. Helmsley who seems to have gone loopy. The book Mr. Trump has presided over (with the writing help of Charles Leerhsen, a senior writer at Newsweek) is full of petty, desperate and often laughable swipes at anyone who has ever dared to criticize Donald Trump. Of a Village Voice reporter, Mr. Trump says that the writer, ''whose last book was a major failure, is still trying to make his name at my expense.'' Of a recent article in Forbes magazine estimating (generously, it turns out) his net worth at a mere $500 million: ''Who can say what these one-of-a-kind assets are worth until they're put on the market? Certainly not some mediocre reporter from Forbes'' (whom Mr. Trump names). Of Garry Trudeau's widely loved ''Doonesbury'' cartoons lampooning Mr. Trump: ''Trudeau's wife, Jane Pauley, is much more talented than he is.''
Mr. Trump's relentless accumulation leads people often to mistake his motive for greed, when what drives the man seems to me to be more a pathological need for control. But control of what? Perhaps there was a time when he wanted to control his business; now he seems merely to want to control the opinion others hold of him. Mr. Trump has come to believe that if he nurtures his fame his business will follow. ''Success,'' he writes, ''so often, is just a matter of perception.'' That may explain why he goes berserk when a journalist tries to tinker with his image, but it still represents an odd and - it now seems - wrongheaded approach to commerce. The man whose first impulse after he buys a building is to change the facade has become nothing but a facade.
In ''Trump: The Art of the Deal,'' Mr. Trump celebrated his shrewdness; in ''Trump: Surviving at the Top,'' he celebrates his reputation. The book is a strained, sloppy exercise in facade restoration. Mr. Trump begins by gluing on himself the best tinsel and chrome that money can buy. There are several photographs in ''Trump: Surviving at the Top'' of Mr. Trump with celebrities (Hulk Hogan!) who don't even appear in the text. Mr. Trump devotes a chapter to his instant friendship with Mike Tyson without ever explaining how it began. The rest of the book is a blizzard of name-dropping. The index starts with ''Ali, Muhammad'' and ends with ''York, Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of.'' In between there are perhaps 10 names not recognizable to readers of People magazine. Under ''V'': ''Vanderbilt family'' and ''van Gogh, Vincent.'' Under ''O'': ''Onassis, Jackie.'' (Perhaps there's a new Trump board game in this: I give you a letter from Mr. Trump's index and you guess who is listed underneath. Pick the wrong name and you're foreclosed upon.) ''Pick the wrong name, and no matter what else you do, you'll never be a hit,'' says the author to explain why he called one of his casinos Trump. He explains a lot more than that.
Another of Mr. Trump's cheap bag of building tricks is simply to tell us repeatedly how widely loved and admired he is. Of a trip to Brazil -a country with which he has much in common, financially - he says only that ''I found Brazil to be a lovely, if economically troubled, country. And I was surprised and delighted that children came running up to me with pencils and paper yelling, 'Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump.' '' He walks down Fifth Avenue and ''about twenty-five perfect strangers wave and shout, 'Hi, Donald,' and 'How're you doing, Donald,' and 'Keep up the good work.' One thing this proves to me is that the average working man or woman is a lot better adjusted and more secure than the supposedly successful people who stare down at them from the penthouses.''
So says the penthouse dweller. And in his case, he's right. ''Trump: Survival at the Top'' is a portrait of an ego gone haywire. He saves the reviewer a great deal of anguish by making a brief foray into the nether regions of his mind. ''I'm not the same person that I was just a few years ago,'' he writes. ''The changes I've undergone . . . are what this book is about.'' In a chapter called ''The Survival Game,'' he suggestively offers a list of once wealthy men, some of whom committed suicide; they are, it seems, his bogy. He compares himself to Howard Hughes. ''As time goes on,'' he writes, ''I find myself thinking more and more about Howard Hughes and even, to some degree, identifying with him. Take, for example, his famous aversion to germs. While I'm certainly not as fanatical as he was, I've always had very strong feelings about cleanliness. I'm constantly washing my hands.''
But he's not exposing himself so much as he is shopping for new identities. Having tried Lady Macbeth on for size, he at last selects another equally implausible shell. He tells us, in so many words, that he has discovered the futility of the possessions he calls his trophies. The best-known of these is perhaps the yacht, now named the Trump Princess, purchased from the arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi (see ''Doonesbury'' for details). Mr. Trump devotes a chapter to the Princess identical in tone and content to the braggadocio in ''Trump: The Art of the Deal'': how brilliantly he haggled for it, how his boat is the biggest, how he made it better and so on.
Then he lobs in this revelation: ''But as much as I've enjoyed it until now, and as impressive as it's been to my casino customers, I think I'm giving up the game of who's got the best boat. . . . It's funny how the boat seemed more appropriate to my life in the past than to my future.'' It's even funnier that this decision comes at a time when he can no longer afford the boat. There's every reason to believe that self-denial is just one more gewgaw for the Trump facade, stuck on to distract us from the cheap construction. After all, the man has built a career gloating over his ability to fool others; ''fool'' comes second only to ''loser'' as Mr. Trump's favorite epithet. The truth more likely is that if his real estate recovers, he'll begin bragging more loudly than ever about his boat. But who then will listen? Only fools.

THE SUITCASE
By Sergei Dovlatov.
Translated by Antonina W. Bouis.
128 pp. New York: Grove Weidenfeld. $16.95.
The mark of a book's ability to move, instruct and entertain is the way in which it is read. To say one can't put a book down is not the highest form of praise. It intimates that the prose is dispensable, that there are no turns of phrase worth relishing. A better book is one the reader would love to gulp down in one sitting, but chooses instead to savor. Sergei Dovlatov's new collection of interrelated vignettes, ''The Suitcase,'' adroitly translated by Antonina W. Bouis, fits into this second category. I predict most readers will roar through the first two-thirds of this novel, then, upon realizing there are only a few chapters left, stop reading in an effort to stave off finishing it. The final chapters will be hoarded and cherished, doled out one at a time as a reward after a bad day. 
Like his previous works, ''The Suitcase'' verges on the autobiographical; the title story refers to the cheap plywood case Mr. Dovlatov brought to the United States when he emigrated from the Soviet Union. An inventory of its contents - eight articles of clothing that provide the chapter titles - serves as a springboard for Mr. Dovlatov's laconic, sometimes surreal reminiscences about the acquisition of each article. Mr. Dovlatov is a sly ironist; these stories are as much about love and friendship gone awry, about aborted dreams and helplessness, as they are about hats and shirts and belts.
''The Finnish Crepe Socks'' chronicles an ill-fated black market scheme to unload a shipment of Finnish socks on a Soviet public hungry for foreign merchandise, a scheme Mr. Dovlatov involves himself in to pay off the debts he's incurred trying to impress a girl. ''The Nomenklatura Half Boots'' deals with Mr. Dovlatov's short-lived career as an artist. At loose ends after a short stint with a factory newsletter, he had gone in search of work that posed ''fewer moral doubts.'' ''Friends with pull got me into . . . a decorative and applied arts studio. I became an apprentice stone carver. I decided to 'find myself' in monumental sculpture.'' His first job involved carving a relief depiction of a Soviet scientist for a new Metro station. The boots of the title are lifted from a certain Soviet eminence during the dedication ceremonies.
The novel is reminiscent of a Buster Keaton movie. In each chapter the image of the tall, grim Mr. Dovlatov suffering one Soviet indignity after the next is agonizingly hilarious. After the Finnish crepe socks scheme fails, leaving him with 240 pairs, ''Many things happened. . . . I paid off my debts. . . . Met the girl I eventually married. Went to the Baltic for a month. . . . Began my feeble literary attempts. Became a father. Got into trouble with the authorities. Lost my job. Spent a month in Kalyaevo Prison.
''And only one thing did not change: for 20 years I paraded around in pea-colored socks. I gave them to all my friends. Kept them for Christmas ornaments. Dusted with them. Stuck them into the cracks of window frames. And still the number of those lousy socks barely changed.''
The middle chapters of the book, particularly ''The Poplin Shirt'' -which depicts Mr. Dovlatov's marriage as ''twenty-five years of mutual isolation and indifference to real life'' - are etched with wistfulness. ''Fernand Leger's Jacket'' is a poignant story of a boyhood friendship. ''Andryusha was the son of an outstanding man. My father stood out only for his thinness.'' Leger's jacket is given to Mr. Dovlatov by Andryusha's mother after her husband, the ''outstanding man,'' has died.
''The jacket really was old. If Soviet posters are to be believed, the unemployed in America wear jackets like that.
''Cherkasova looked at me strangely and said, 'that jacket belonged to Fernand Leger. He was about your size.'
 
''I repeated in amazement, 'Leger? The Leger?'
'' 'Once we were very close. Then I was friends with his widow. I told her about you. Nadya went into the closet, took out the jacket, and handed it to me. She said that Fernand asked her to befriend all kinds of riffraff.' ''
Although Mr. Dovlatov's vision is wholly Russian, his voice has a brusque, straightforward American quality. The stereotypic Slavic excesses expected of a Russian writer are notably absent. His heart-rending humor is achieved through the clever juxtaposition of simple sentences, a deadpan delivery worthy of David Letterman and the employment of phrases that translate into tough, monosyllabic English words of Anglo-Saxon origin.
''In the Soviet Union I dressed so badly I was rebuked for it. I remember when the director of the Pushkin Preserve told me, 'Comrade Dovlatov, your trousers ruin the festive mood of our area.' '' Mr. Dovlatov has lived in the United States since 1978. One can only hope he has continued to dress as badly and has the marvelous stories to prove it. America can use a great satirist. This might just be our man.

THE BORDERLESS WORLD
Power and Strategy in the Interlinked Economy.
By Kenichi Ohmae.
223 pp. New York:
Harper Business/HarperCollins Publishers. $21.95.
Kenichi Ohmae - arguably Japan's most influential writer on public policy - is unfazed by what George Bush calls ''the vision thing.'' If he harbors any doubts about his formula for achieving greater wealth and personal freedom, none surface in ''The Borderless World.'' His certitude is rhetorically effective, but it ignores some of the obstacles to moving from the here and now to the there and then. 
Europe, Japan and the United States - the triad that Mr. Ohmae calls the Interlinked Economy, or ILE - are home to the richest fifth of the world's population, about a billion people who produce and consume nearly four-fifths of the global output of goods and services. Within the ILE the significance of national borders is being eclipsed by ever-increasing flows of international trade and investment. Despite protectionist barriers (or perhaps because of them), transplanted American and European companies account for some 10.9 percent of Japan's gross national product. Japanese auto makers have about 30 percent of the United States market. And American companies constitute roughly one-fifth of the total corporate capitalization of Europe.
Mr. Ohmae's compelling argument is that the further integration of the ILE is in everyone's interest. Absent import restrictions and xenophobic policies, the optimal location of production, both within and outside the ILE, would lower costs, increase output and raise living standards. Development of new technologies and products, such as integrated microchips, would be accelerated. Poorer countries with gross national products of less than $10,000 per head could hitch onto the ILE engine by abandoning protectionism and opening their doors to imports and foreign investment.
Were he a minimalist painter, Mr. Ohmae (who is the managing director of the McKinsey consulting firm in Japan) would draw nothing but praise. But in the untidy arena of international relations the kind of broad brushstrokes found in ''The Borderless World'' must be supplemented by blueprints. Mr. Ohmae focuses on the Japanese-American nexus while ignoring - save for a cryptic reference to ''the Gaullist French government'' - new protectionist barriers that will almost certainly be erected by the European Community when it moves toward greater integration in 1992. He fails to provide an argument for his assertion that speculation in foreign exchange is a cushion against inflation. And his hostility toward takeovers, leveraged buyouts and corporate restructurings - he misreads them as signs of ''the internal decay of capitalism'' - is neither supported nor shared by his more sophisticated McKinsey colleagues.
But Mr. Ohmae's virtues clearly outweigh his shortcomings. Having been accused of being an agent of the Japanese Government's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, he is unsparing in his criticisms of Tokyo. ''Japan,'' he writes, ''is a bureaucratic country, not a political one. The Diet [the Japanese parliament] plays a minor role compared with the powerful bureaucratic system.''
Nor does he stop with the Japanese bureaucracy: ''No country represents a single value system, and no effort to pretend that it does - or to act as if it does - is both credible and effective. In Japan, for example, Hokkaido may want to become the Switzerland of Asia and a hub for international air travel. Tokyo may want to go its own way. Osaka's interests may lie in becoming the capital of East Asia and not competing with Tokyo. . . . The rest of the population has legitimate doubts about just how far the health of these cities has any spillover benefits for them. . . . Regions pull in different directions.''
What is implied is that conflicts between the interests of governments and those of evolving marketplaces will ultimately be resolved by devolution - the breaking up of countries and the drastic reduction of state power. It's this sort of insight that makes Mr. Ohmae well worth reading.

LIES OF SILENCE
By Brian Moore.
197 pp. New York:
Nan A. Talese/
Doubleday. $18.95.
Nothing cheers a writer so little as well-intentioned commiseration for not having attained the vast readership admirers think one deserves. And yet there are certain authors whose gifts so exceed their renown that their situation inevitably inspires this sort of unhelpful puzzlement and indignation.
One such writer is Brian Moore, whose 16th novel, ''Lies of Silence,'' is characteristically first rate. The recipient of major awards in Canada and Britain, Mr. Moore has so far failed to achieve what the pollsters succinctly call ''name recognition'' in the United States, perhaps because his work ranges so widely, from intense novels of sensibility (''The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne'') to suspenseful, ingeniously plotted thrillers with moral and metaphysical themes (''Cold Heaven,'' ''The Color of Blood''). Perhaps the problem is that Mr. Moore's nationality involves multiple hyphenation -born in Belfast, he has spent much of his life in Canada and now resides in Southern California. Or the problem may even lie with the estimable qualities that are found in his diverse books. This is not, after all, an era of fevered acclaim for the quietly controlled, the intelligent, the spiritually minded and unassuming. 
Paradise for the reader, purgatory for the critic, the plot of ''Lies of Silence'' is one that only a spoiler would reveal - and risk ruining the surprises that detonate throughout the novel like cleverly hidden and elegantly designed incendiary devices. (The notion of ''unbearable suspense'' is, of course, a cliche, but I found that I kept briefly putting down the novel to postpone the moment when I had to face what might happen next.) Set in contemporary Northern Ireland, ''Lies of Silence'' centers on Michael Dillon, the manager of a grand old Belfast hotel, an establishment to which families traditionally come for graduation luncheons and where, on a morning just after the novel begins, a well-known Protestant rabble-rouser is scheduled to address a convention of the Canadian Orange Order. In Dillon's Belfast version of a normal life, the ''Troubles'' and the presence of British soldiers are a daily fact; body checks and bomb threats have come to seem routine: ''A queue of cars was waiting to be admitted to the hotel grounds. Security was tight, for the hotel had been bombed last year. The occupants of each car must get out and go into the adjoining hut for a body search, while the car itself was checked over by the outside guards.''
Dillon is one of those Irishmen one recognizes fondly from the work of Sean O'Faolain, Frank O'Connor and William Trevor; we know, even upon first meeting them, that these men are not destined for great happiness, that even the small pleasures life offers them will sadly come to nothing. As the novel opens, Dillon is tormenting himself over the (one might think) straightforward choice between his shrill, unstable wife and his loving mistress, a young BBC reporter whose imminent transfer to London triggers the first of the personal crises that set the plot in motion.
Although to Dillon these difficulties seem singularly oppressive, they strike us as neither exceptional nor uncommon until, in the course of one frightening night, he unwillingly becomes involved in a violent I.R.A. terrorist plot. Suddenly his domestic difficulties are both heightened and dwarfed by an almost impossible moral dilemma that transforms his private life into the sensational stuff of the evening news. The effect on Dillon is seismic, and soon there are aftershocks -a succession of ethical temptations and decisions that sends him fleeing to London and changes forever his notions of heroism, of the possibility of escape.
Graham Greene has called Brian Moore his ''favorite living novelist.'' Although the two writers are significantly different, Mr. Greene's remark does suggest the affection we often feel for those whose interests and virtues remind us warmly of our own. Like Mr. Greene, Mr. Moore often focuses on men (and in Mr. Moore's case, women) in situations of extreme crisis. Both write brilliantly about how various sorts of spiritual and historical struggles (crises of faith; political, moral, romantic crises) can overlap and complicate one another - and in the end turn out to be separate manifestations of a single human condition. Finally, both Graham Greene and Brian Moore write spare, swiftly plotted fiction that is capable of supporting considerable thematic weight.
So, too, ''Lies of Silence'' has immense tensile strength. One is struck by how austere its sentences are - and yet by how much the novel embraces, how much disturbance it generates without ever stooping to theatrics, how daringly it approaches and eludes the clutches of melodrama. It is possible to read this book purely for the pleasantly unsettling angst its dramatic plot induces. But it is more rewarding to pause and admire its flashes of depth and the nervy way in which Mr. Moore takes textbook-case ethical quandaries (the good of one versus the good of many, the right to a private life versus social responsibility) and uses the techniques of fiction to give them an agonizing, provocative spin. Certain scenes - Dillon's wife's conversation with a jumpy, teen-age I.R.A. volunteer and, later, his own confrontation with a manipulative Catholic priest - can be read as paradigms of how to create tension and surprise while remaining convincing and without contrivance.
Over his long career, Brian Moore has mastered the literary magic trick of making the weighty seem graceful, making the dense and complex seem effortless and unadorned. One hopes that ''Lies of Silence'' will inspire more readers to discover Mr. Moore's earlier work, to experience the range and agility of this fine writer's sleight of hand.
 
'ANY OF US COULD BE HOSTAGES'
''I wanted the book to read like a thriller, but to be something more,'' said Brian Moore of his latest novel, ''Lies of Silence.'' ''I didn't want to do a whole book about Northern Ireland, but I did want to talk about how often ordinary people are taken as hostages, their homes invaded - and the moral choices they're forced to make. I go back to Ireland often and no one ever talks about the hostages.''
Speaking by telephone recently from his home in Los Angeles, Mr. Moore compared life in Northern Ireland with the situation in Kuwait and Iraq. ''We're in a position now where any of us could be hostages,'' he observed, ''and that can create the dilemma of loyalty to family versus saving the lives of others.''
But, Mr. Moore added, both in his book and in real life, the hostages are not the only victims. ''The I.R.A. members who do these jobs are young, poorly educated and disillusioned. Imagine all your life being unemployed and discriminated against. These terrorist groups give them a sense of belonging. It's a way to be big with their peers. It's not that different from the street gangs in Los Angeles, the Crips or the Bloods.''
The parallel is especially clear, Mr. Moore pointed out, since neither the I.R.A. nor the American street gangs have much of a political agenda, beyond getting rid of their enemies. ''There is terrible job discrimination against Catholics in Northern Ireland,'' he said. ''It's like the black situation here; you have to address economic concerns before you can handle the rest of it.''
Yet despite the novel's political overtones, it is also, Mr. Moore said, ''a love story'' - one that raises its own troubling set of questions. ''What happens,'' Mr. Moore asked, ''when a woman gives up her career to marry, and it just isn't enough for her? She can't just pick it up five years later. And what happens when a man chooses a wife mainly for physical attractiveness rather than compatibility?''
There are not necessarily any clear answers to such questions, Mr. Moore said. But his books give him a chance to make readers think about their endless complexities.

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
Mercedes Gets Smoother by the Mile

BYLINE: By MARSHALL SCHUON

 BODY:
AT first glance, the car in the driveway looks like a new Mercedes. At second glance, it still looks that way. But this silver sedan has been a real nomad since it rolled out of a Florida dealer's showroom back in October 1984.
The car is a 1985 model, a four-door 380 SE, and there are 101,042 miles on the odometer. It would appear that not one of those miles did anything even remotely unkind to the vehicle, and the 380 well might strike a pose when Webster's decides to illustrate the page containing the word cream puff. 
It should be said that the 380 belongs to Mercedes-Benz of North America, and that the folks who run the company in Montvale, N.J., know exactly what they have on their hands and how to make the most of it. The car is so clean that it belongs in a museum, but they are trotting it out to prove what J. D. Power and Associates said last year in a study of vehicle dependability.
In its survey, the California consultancy firm found that owners of 5-year-old Mercedes vehicles cited the fewest and least severe problems during their latest year of ownership. Questions were asked about 89 specific problem areas, and answers were extrapolated into a rating of customer satisfaction.
An average index was set at 100, and a mere dozen makers were rated at that mark or better, with Mercedes scoring 149 to win. That is no great surprise, given the median $47,000 sticker of the company's products, but that very figure is the other reason I have been driving the car.
''There's a logical reason why we're doing this,'' said John Chuhran, a Mercedes spokesman. ''People may want to get into a Mercedes, but they might not have the financial means to get into a new one right away. So what we have done is give them all the features at a less expensive price.'' Sounds suspiciously like a used car, right? Right, but Mercedes has gone a bit farther, and there is now a factory warranty - shorter in duration but similar to the one issued with new cars - on vehicles dating back to 1980. Coverage is at the dealer's discretion and depends both on the automobile's condition and on its mileage.
For cars with less than 75,000 miles, there is a two-year guarantee, and a 12-month warranty is offered on cars showing 75,000 to 100,000 miles. Items covered are the powertrain, steering, suspension, cooling, fuel injection, electrical, brake and climate-control systems, and the buyer has full use of the company's roadside assistance plan.
Mercedes keeps close tabs on the prices fetched by used cars across the country, and Chuhran pointed to two recent studies that show Mercedes holding its value better than any other make. The company publishes average prices for used models every month, and the East Coast figure on the 380 SE in the driveway is $25,365. That is a bit less than the national average of $26,793, but it is still almost two-thirds of the car's $42,730 price when new.
What the money bought five years ago was a five-passenger sedan with a 3.8-liter V8 that fed 155 horsepower to the road through a four-speed automatic transmission. It was the gasoline version of the 300 SD diesel, and it was sold here only in the '84 and '85 model years.
Air bags didn't become standard Mercedes equipment until 1986, but there was big news for '85 with introduction of standard antilock brakes on five of the company's cars, including the 380 SE. Heated outside mirrors also were newly standard, as were the improved central locking and antitheft systems. And the car also was given standard power headrests.
Amazingly, everything on the silver car still works perfectly. The gray leather is crisp and beautiful as ever, and there is that giant black steering wheel with pebbled grain. There is the 160-m.p.h. speedometer and a sunroof that slides open without a murmur. There is a good big ashtray for the unrepentant, and the genuine wood trim still looks like polished plastic.
Like today's Mercedes, the 380 has an accelerator that resists your foot and is thus well behaved until you put your sole into it. At that point, and even with just 155 horsepower, the 3,740-pound car gets down and goes.
On the road, the ride remains solid and quiet, stiff but comfortable, and if there is a complaint, it is that fuel economy is a thirsty misnomer at 16 miles per gallon, city, and 18, highway. With a 23.8-gallon tank, though, the SE will go a long way between stops.
It has already gone a very long way indeed, and while no one is pretending that the 380 is a typical 100,000-mile Mercedes, Chuhran said he believes it's a nice demonstrator of durability. ''It gives you an idea of why we can offer the warranty,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Turning Humble Materials Into Salable Arts and Crafts

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
''I don't have a passion for handicrafts,'' admitted the organization's president, Clare Brett Smith, ''but I like what these handicrafts represent.''
She said she also likes the idea that many of the group's ventures use leftovers and scraps. ''It's a bit of New England traditional frugality - use it up and make it do,'' Mrs. Smith said.
The 13-year-old Aid to Artisans operates in 30 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Mrs. Smith said the organization has no grandiose expectations that a handicraft industry will bring prosperity to impoverished villagers. But, she said, the thousands of workers it has trained earn as they produce. 
''What they buy, they buy sensibly - cows or school clothes for their children,'' she said, adding that virtually all of the workers are women. ''They get their teeth fixed or put a new roof on the shed.''
United States Representative Nancy L. Johnson, a Republican of New Britain, said the group provided significant help to women by teaching them new skills and helping them acquire experience as entrepeneurs.
''What's remarkable about Aid to Artisans is it enables women to see their ordinary skills and the ordinary materials around them in a fresh way,'' said Representative Johnson. ''It literally empowers those women to create a new vision about economic power and economic success. Then it is on to the next product and the next market.''
The group's operation is a lean one, housed rent-free at Mrs. Smith's red-brick home, described by architects as ''collegiate Gothic.'' Her husband, Burges, a tennis-court builder, serves as treasurer and supplies business advice; volunteers provide the office help. With no showroom or glossy catalogue, Aid for Artisans displays its samples for buyers twice a year at the New York International Gift Fair, and the orders keep arriving.
The Smiths live surrounded by the crafts they have encouraged artisans to create - bronze statues from Ghana, terra cotta dragons from Indonesia, an embroidered bedspread from Bangladesh. A Pakastani wedding canopy covers the Smiths' pool table. They have wool rugs from Jordan and clay pots from Haiti. A seven-foot coffin from Ghana, shaped like a giant cacao pod, serves as a conversation piece in the dining room.
Aid to Artisans has attracted grants from some of the country's leading philanthropies, including the Ford, Rockefeller and MacArthur Foundations. The Federal Agency for International Development also has financed some activities, like a program in Honduras, where a single product, a clay cherub, has brought a small economic boom to scores of villagers.
The potential of the ornamental cherub first was recognized five years ago by Holland Millis, a product-development specialist for the organization. Honduran women make them at home, using clay dug from pastures outside the village of Yarumela. The figures became an almost instant success when 50,000 were ordered by Dansk and other importers. Mrs. Smith said that earnings from the cherubs or corn-husk flowers go a long way in Honduras, where a one-room adobe house can be built for $250.
 
'Whimsical Market'
Earlier operations to help the Honduran artisans had failed, said Margaret Kronhout, a project-development officer for the Agency for International Development who has served in Honduras for 15 years. ''The United States market for exported crafts is a special one, and it's a whimsical market,'' she said. ''Aid to Artisans succeeded, because it supplied critical support in designing products that would have real appeal.''
Aid to Artisans was established in 1977 by James Blout, after he retired from the World Crafts Council, where he was secretary general for a decade. From his home in Chestnut Hill, Mass., he continues to serve as chairman, publishes a newsletter and works to increase the group's membership. The 450 members help support the activities with contributions ranging from $25 to $5,000.
The organization hoped to stimulate more artisans in disadvantaged communities in the United States, said Mr. Blout, but for each American request for help, the organization receives 50 from abroad.
 
In Hugo's Wake
It gave early help to the Watermark Association of Artisans, a cooperative in Elizabeth City, N.C., which has grown into an association of 450 members, widely recognized as one of the most successful craft groups in the country. It also helped Afghan and Cambodian refugees living in northern Virginia to purchase sewing equipment. In the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo last year, Aid to Artisans gave financial help to basket weavers in coastal towns of South Carolina, where storms tore at local beaches and destroyed their dwindling supplies of sweetgrass.
It is also beginning to work with Hungarian crafters and displayed their embroidery and decorative red-felt pillows at the New York craft show in August. But Mr. Blout said the group's major impact continues to be in the third world.
 
Model of Help
In the craft field, buyers for stores jealously protect their sources of supply, he said, and artisans are also chary about sharing their experience. But Mrs. Smith and Mr. Blout said they want their organization to serve as a model and source of help.
Much of the organization's field work depends on specialists like Mr. Millis and Docey Lewis, a weaver and textile designer who lives in Washington, Conn., when she is not rushing off to Somalia or Jordan on an assignment for Aid to Artisans. Ms. Lewis, a member of the organization's board, works as a volunteer.
Mrs. Smith, trained as a photographer, is the organization's archivist. Legal and tax advice is provided by another volunteer, Tim Lyman, a lawyer in Hartford.
Aid to Artisans works as well as it does, Mrs. Smith said, because there is no hiring and firing to worry about, no promotions and no raises. ''We like to say we're nimble,'' said Mr. Lyman.

HEADLINE: Budget Cuts Are Hitting Home As Schools Open

BYLINE: By CHARLOTTE LIBOV

 BODY:

 
Reforms Are Threatened
Terry Cassidy, executive director of the Connecticut Association of Boards of Education, which represents 150 schoolboards, is also concerned.
''In my 12-year-history with the association,'' he said, ''I have never seen anything which approached the intensity of what's going on in the state now, in terms of budget cuts. You could call almost every school district and talk about budget problems.''
State Education Commissioner Gerald N. Tirozzi is so concerned that he is proposing a $152 million increase in grants to municipal school districts as part of his $1.5 billion state education budget for 1991-92.
Commissioner Tirozzi fears that the severe budget cuts could affect the state's newly adopted package of educational reforms, which include tougher teacher training. 
''The bottom line is if we're raising salaries and increasing class size but laying off beginning teachers, then there's something wrong,'' the Commissioner said.
In many communities, these rising salaries have become the favorite target of taxpayer groups. In 1986, the state poured $300 million into a program to raise teachers' salaries, and that, along with binding arbitration, has pushed the state's average teacher salary to $41,361, among the highest in the nation.
''This is part of a statewide, if not a nationwide pattern of cutting back on education,'' said the Norwalk School Superintendent, Ralph E. Sloan, ''and it is especially severe in Connecticut, where teachers' salaries went up substantially. This is part of the inevitable backlash. People say, 'teachers salaries are up, and what do we have to show for it.' ''
Tight budgets are the norm in both cities and towns, school officials throughout the state said. While this is not a new situation for urban school officials, some of their colleagues in Connecticut's wealthier suburbs are less accustomed to cutting budgets.
In Bridgeport, 30 teachers were laid off and textbook and supply accounts cut, said Richard W. Callahan, the school district's business director. School officials had requested nearly $94 million, an increase of $7.5 million from last year's budget, largely to cover negotiated salary increases, but the schools were allocated $92.6 million by the city, he said.
''The city is in very bad financial shape,'' Mr. Callahan said, ''so there have been a lot of cutbacks and layoffs throughout the city and the board of education.''
This is not as bad as it might seem, because over the past few years, substantial state aid has been funneled into the city, enabling Bridgeport to increase its teachers' salaries, buy supplies and undertake school repairs. But, Mr. Callahan said, ''We'll be in trouble'' if budget cuts continue.
In West Hartford, which has a tradition of offering a wide array of educational programs, the school year will begin without an official budget for the first time in recent memory. A second budget referendum will be held on Sept. 25. For now, school officials are using a $55 million school budget figure, but if that is cut further, it will mean teacher layoffs, said Assistant Superintendent Matthew Borrelli. The original budget proposal was $57.2 million.
As it is, the number of full-time kindergarten programs is down to three schools from 10, and the gifted and talented program is being trimmed. But the biggest change will be in high school athletics, where students will have to pay $15 a sport to participate. Previously, students were not charged.
''It was a difficult decision to make,'' Mr. Borrelli said, ''but the consensuswas that rather than eliminate sports, this would be a shared burden between the community and the schools.''
In Suffield, where residents rejected the town budget three times, about $1 million has been cut from the proposed $11.5 million school budget,Superintendent Bernard J. Ellis said.
''This is the worst year I've had in 23 years as a superintendent. I'd thought I'd seen them all, but this is a new experience,'' said Mr. Ellis.
The high school social worker and two vice principals have been eliminated in Suffield, along with the freshman sports program, ice hockey, and the gifted program in the elementary school. There will be no high school field trips ''unless parents raise the money themselves,'' Mr. Ellis said.
In Windsor, nearly $2.6 million was cut from the school system's $26 million budget request, which meant laying off 11 teachers and 20 teacher aides, said the district's business director, Allan Brockman.
''There is a three-page list of reductions,'' he said, ''running from reductions in textbooks, library books, reductions in maps and globes, reductions in capital maintenance, elimination of a day care program, right through pretty much every program in the district.''
For the first time in many years in Cheshire, no new school building projects will be brought before the voters, said Superintendent John J. Barnes.
''A lot of our proposed school projects were just eliminated and put off,'' he said. ''There are overcrowding problems here, but we failed to convince the public we need to have building additions.'' The town will continue to use portable classrooms at some of its elementary schools, he said.
 
Letting Things Go
In Madison, the town cut $1.1 million from the proposed $20.3 million school budget during ''the toughest year I can remember in 18 years,'' Assistant Superintendent Robert K. Wolfe said.
''We're proud of the fact that we've kept our plants in incredible physical condition,'' he said, ''but we're letting all kinds of things go. Painting, repainting, repaving of parking lots, you name it.''
In Norwalk, the town cut $1.5 million from the proposed $71.4 million school budget.
''We've wiped out our reading consultants,'' Superintendent Sloan said. ''We've reduced guidance counselors, we've reduced staffing at the high schools and we cut back on supplies, materials and maintenance.
''We're in a recession, for all practical purposes, and people are not willing to pay the level of taxes or face increases. Virtually every school system I know took a fair amount of budget cuts. We're all in the soup together.''
 
'A Lot of Wailing'
Wilton residents traditionally are generous in their support of school spending, but this year, for the first time in a decade, there was a referendum, and the proposed $22 million school budget was slashed by $75,000, said Superintendent David S. Clune.
''In the past, we'd get support, but now, there are a number of people in town, including retirees, who see their budgets increasing, and it's difficult for them,'' he said.
In Stamford, some 50 school employees, mostly experienced teachers, will be gone this fall, having taken advantage of an early retirement program whose savings helped the school board cut its proposed $99.8 million budget by $5.3 million, said Allen Grafton, an assistant to the superintendent.
''There was a lot of wailing and gnashing of teeth,'' he said, ''but by the time it got down to it, we survived. But this is the second year in a row we've reduced staff. We're down about 100 people in all. If this continues, you're really going to have an impact on the total educational program.''
 
A Bitter Fight
Perhaps nowhere in the state was the battle over a school budget fought more bitterly than in Region 14, which consists of the two small northwestern Connecticut towns of Bethlehem and Woodbury. There, the battle over the budget required a record seven referendums and escalated into allegations of threats and vandalism. ''It was nothing like I had ever seen before,'' Superintendent Paul Hinckley said.
''The voters were very upset,'' he said, ''which is probably an understatement, over the increase in teachers' salaries, and they were trying to send a message to us.
''Unfortunately, the children saw adults acting like children, with all the name calling that went on,'' he added.
The budget finally passed in August, after a $577,000 cut, which means seven teachers and an assistant principal will be eliminated, he said.
Still, Bethlehem First Selectman George C. Eggert, a school budget critic, maintains the school board's new $11.8 million budget is too fat.
''A lot of us, and I am one, feel that the money is not being well spent,'' Mr. Eggert said. ''There was an awful lot of waste and there still is. I think the schools are overstaffed and some of our teachers are earning too much money. Some deserve it, and some are deadwood.''
Mr. Hinckley is already thinking ahead to next spring when budget time rolls around again.
''I hope everyone comes back with a very positive attitude,'' he said. ''It's a new year, start off fresh, and put what's happened in the past behind us, and go ahead full steam on a new course. In the coming year, our major goal is going to be to pass the budget on the first try.''
First Selectman Eggert would like to do that too, but, he said, ''We'll be looking for a very frugal budget.''

HEADLINE: New Rules On Oil Tanks Intensify Fuel Battle

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:

 
Targets of Gas Companies' Campaign
The natural gas companies, however, while acknowledging that they are indeed trying to persuade customers to switch from oil to gas, say that the targets of their current campaign, which draws attention to the new regulations, are commercial and industrial users. Residents who do switch from oil to gas, they say, do so out of economic and environmental concerns.
The new regulations, scheduled to take effect on Tuesday, are ''just another nail in the coffin,'' said Paul Spatz, owner of the Grant Oil Company in Newark, which serves more than 2,500 oil customers in northern New Jersey. ''Every time a new problem arises, another customer yanks his tank out and converts to gas,'' he said.
But converting from oil to gas may create new problems for homeowners when they stop using their underground storage tanks, heating contractors and tank removal specialists say. 
By failing to regulate abandonment of the smaller tanks, they say, the new regulations perpetuate the current practice of allowing local officials to determine, often on an ad hoc basis, the methods used to close tanks that are no longer in use.
That practice, they say, has resulted in a hodgepodge of regulations that can cause problems for homeowners if abandonment of a tank is not properly completed. An improperly closed tank can corrode because of condensation, for example, and can leak at the bottom or collapse at the top if someone walks over it.
In addition, prospective home buyers, concerned with the potential for problems with an abandoned tank, might require a seller to have the tank removed as a condition of the sale.
''This could be the beginning of the end of our business,'' Mr. Spatz said, referring to the current convergence of factors facing the home heating oil industry. Oil merchants, he said, who have long been subject to price and supply factors beyond their control, are now faced with convincing an increasingly cautious public that oil heat will remain economical.
 
Concern Called Unwarranted
That task is made more difficult, Mr. Spatz said, by customers' heightened yet often unwarranted concern that an underground tank may be a source of problems in the future.
''The fact of the matter is that oil is a more efficient energy source with a higher B.T.U. output than gas,'' Mr. Spatz said. In addition, he said, it would take either many years or a huge jump in the price of oil for a homeowner to recoup the conversion costs, which average about $2,200.
Nevertheless, he said, gas industry advertisements highlighting concerns over underground tanks ''have struck fear in the hearts of homeowners.'' And the new regulations, he said, though not targeted at the smaller tanks, will only intensify that fear.
The regulations, which were mandated by the Legislature in 1986, apply to new and existing tanks with a capacity of 2,000 gallons or more. They require corrosion protection, continuous monitoring for corrosion and systems that guard against spills and overfilling. In addition, any such tank that is abandoned must be removed from the ground in accordance with strict standards set by the Department of Environmental Protection.
''If the abandoned oil tank isn't sealed and cleaned properly,'' said Robert Frezzo, vice president of Frezzo Oil Service Inc. in Union City, ''water can leak in, corrode the bottom, and the next thing you know you have contaminated soil.''
 
Corrosion Could Cause Cave-In
Another danger, he said, is that corrosion on the top of the tank may cause someone walking above the tank to fall through into the empty tank.
On the other hand, he said, if the tank is sealed too tightly, and is empty, it might eventually rise out of the ground in an area that has a high water table.
And finally, Mr. Frezzo said, an empty, improperly sealed tank may be accidentally filled with oil by a dealer who was unaware that the tank was abandoned. Computer-driven automatic filling schedules based upon ''degree days'' make that a distinct possibility, he said.
So even though cleaning and filling an abandoned tank is usually safe if done properly, he said, ''if this were a perfect world every underground tank would be ripped out.''
Though the new regulations require just that for large abandoned commercial tanks, they do not extend to the tens of thousands of smaller tanks in basements and under front lawns in towns across the state. The authority to determine what must be done with those tanks rests with local officials.
 
Disposal Required Sometimes
While most municipalities require contractors to clean, fill and seal abandoned tanks, some require that they be removed and disposed of.
''Anything larger than 550 gallons we want them to yank out,'' said Robert G. Michelin, a fire subcode official for Union City. Smaller tanks, he said, can be cleaned and filled. But in West New York, all tanks, regardless of size, must be removed. Ronald Franco, the township's fire inspector, said West New York also required the soil under the tank to be inspected and tested if it appeared to be contaminated.
''And if we find there's contamination,'' he said, ''we bring in the regional health commission.'' Contaminated soil, he said, would have to be removed and replaced with clean soil at the homeowner's expense.
Mr. Frezzo, who has customers in both towns, said that since there was no consistent policy in effect, prospective purchasers who discovered that there was an abandoned underground tank in a home they were considering buying often required the seller to have the tank removed, ''just to be on the safe side.''
 
Couple Convert to Gas
Robert and Patricia Auth of the township of Union in Union County, though not under such pressure, decided recently to do just that by having their abandoned oil tank removed.
''We figured we would take the thing out and then we wouldn't have to worry about it anymore,'' Mr. Auth said. The Auths converted from oil to gas two years ago and were concerned that Union officials might someday require them to remove the abandoned tank.
Anthony Noce, president of the Environmental Clean-Up and Protection Association, the Verona-based company that removed the Auths' tank, said business had increased recently as a result of concerns like the Auths' and those expressed by Mr. Frezzo.
Mr. Noce said, ''We're getting a lot of calls from real-estate people who can't put the sale through until the tank is cleaned or removed.''
He said that while most towns required that underground tanks be cleaned and filled rather than completely removed, even the cleaning and filling often required considerable work.
To clean a tank properly, he said, workers have to dig down to the tank, cut the top off and get inside the tank to make sure that all the oil is removed. When the tank is clean, it is filled with sand and then covered again with dirt.
 
Average Cost of $1,000
The cost of cleaning an average residential tank, he said, is $1,000 to $1,500. Removal, he said, can cost up to twice as much but is preferred because the soil under the tank can be tested for contamination, an option not available when the tank is only cleaned.
In any event, he said, a consistent statewide policy is preferable to the current practice of letting local officials determine standards because then contractors and homeowners will specifically know what their responsibilities are.
Kenneth Goldstein, chief of the Bureau of Underground Storage Tanks in the State Department of Environmental Protection, agreed that the lack of a uniform policy could lead to confusion.
''I would prefer to have some type of consistent, minimum standard,'' he said. ''But the Legislature decided that certain smaller homeowners' tanks should not be regulated. As a result, we're left with the possibility of 567 municipalities setting up their own requirements.''
Legislation sponsored by Assemblyman William E. Schluter, Republican of Pennington, would provide such guidelines. The bill, Mr. Schluter said, should it pass this year, allows for on-site abandonment if it can be proved that the empty tank will not pose a danger to ground water.
 
'Tanks Leak'
Mr. Goldstein, however, said that if the decision were left to him, all abandoned tanks, regardless of size, would have to be removed. ''Tanks leak,'' he said. ''Even small ones.'' And that sentiment, oil dealers say, has led to the advertising campaign now being waged by the natural gas industry.
Fred J. Sacco, executive vice president of the Fuel Merchants Association of New Jersey, a Springfield-based trade association, said that the natural gas companies had capitalized upon, and indeed encouraged, homeowners' fears about their underground tanks.
''You can clearly see how the government regulations have been a useful tool with respect to their advertising,'' Mr. Sacco said, referring to a recent gas industry advertising campaign that refers to large underground storage tanks as potential ''financial time bombs.''
''It's some pretty scary stuff,'' Mr. Sacco said, ''and they have used it to extend those fears to homeowners. It's clearly a scare tactic.''
 
Profit Set by State Agency
The fuel merchants' resentment is further heightened by the fact that gas companies, as public utilities, are entitled to a profit set by the state's Board of Public Utilities, that profit being determined after allowing for certain expenses.
James Divine, executive director of the Metropolitan Energy Council, a Norwood-based association of 750 fuel dealers in the New Jersey-New York-Connecticut area, said that as a result, gas companies had an unfair advantage over fuel dealers.
''Their advertising, being a cost of doing business, is built into their rate base,'' he said. As a result, he said, those costs are passed directly to customers. And that, he said, allows the gas companies to spend more than four times the amount that fuel dealers spend for advertising and still generate a profit.
As is the case with most public utilities, he said, the gas companies do not have to spend any of that money advertising against other gas companies. Fuel dealers on the other hand, he said, spend millions of dollars each a year just advertising against one another.
That, however, does not seem to trouble the gas industry.
 
'We're Not Shy About Advertising'
''We're not shy about advertising the benefits of natural gas,'' said Neil Brown, a spokesman for the Public Service Electric and Gas Company in Newark, one of the state's largest utilities. ''And we are not shy about pointing out some of the problems with oil heat,'' he said.
Mr. Brown acknowledged that some of the company's recent advertisements strongly addressed the safety aspects of underground tanks, but said that such advertising was limited to the industrial and commercial markets.
''I'm not aware of any advertising of that kind directed at the residential market,'' he said.
Responding to fuel dealers' contentions that customers ultimately pay for such advertising, Mr. Brown said that while such expenses were indeed included in the rate base, they must be approved by the Board of Public Utilities.
In addition, he said, ''It's a pretty sure bet that the advertising costs incurred by oil distributors eventually find their way into oil prices as well.''
In any event, it appears that the state's oil merchants are fighting an uphill battle. According to statistics compiled by the American Gas Association in Arlington, Va., there were approximately 105,000 oil-to-gas conversions nationwide in 1989; almost 17,000 of those were in New Jersey.

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY OPINION;
Cutting Down On Trash

BYLINE: By JUDY KEENAN; Judy Keenan is natural resources director of the League of Women Voters of New Jersey.

 BODY:
Logically, reducing the amount of garbage we generate should be primary, but legislation in this area is too often misguided because it is promulgated on a lack of knowledge, or disincentives. Two examples of this type of legislation are requiring the use of recycled newsprint with no understanding of the international market forces that drive the paper economy or the limited number of paper recycling mills, and higher taxation on single-use items, like disposable diapers or microwavable individual packaging, penalizing the consumer.
Recycling was sold initially as a moneymaker for municipalities. Now the market for newspapers has fizzled, and many towns are paying to take these recyclables away. 
True, recycling still reduces the money we have to spend to export materials to landfills, but that is an economic abstract that is difficult to sell to the public.
Recycling was the ''glamorous'' part of the solid-waste problem. We could all do it with not a lot of inconvenience and applaud our efforts. But recycling is losing its glamour. We're still left with hazardous household waste to dispose of, drop-off sites and centers are closing because they are in residential areas where neighbors object, and it's costing us money.
Incineration presents more controversy. We have scientists saying it is perfectly safe, and scientists saying it is lethal. Will six regional incinerators be any less detrimental than 18 smaller ones when we factor in the truck emissions going to the regional sites? Is the Warren County facility a good model or a good lesson? Once we burn, where will we put the ash?
Landfills are dwindling, and the states we export to are indicating a reluctance to continue taking our garbage. The Federal Government says we cannot dump sewage sludge in the ocean, so we have to dispose of it on land. Many fear that it will leach into our water supply. We cannot compost all our solid waste because of all the hazardous and nonbiodegradable products we use.
And so we come to source reduction. We can reduce solid wastesignificantly, but not without changes. As consumers, we would have to give up many conveniences we are accustomed to. Can we as a society forgo polystyrene cups, disposable diapers, one-use packaging?
The manufacturers and distributors of the products focus their research and development on marketing, firmly convinced that consumers want their products. Until we send a clear message demanding environmentally friendly products, all the talk about new product development will not coalesce into tangible results.
Source reduction should be an integral first step in the solid-waste hierarchy, but it can happen only when we are concerned enough to place our environment before our convenience. When we do that, environmentally friendly products will be invented out of economic necessity. Are the policy makers and the people willing to get to the source and take the first step together?

Inns Facing Tougher Times

BYLINE: By Kent Shaw

 BODY:
For Martin and Marcia Schuppert, buying the 180-year-old Waybury Inn last month - the one shown on the long-running Bob Newhart television show - was something of a dream come true.
Mrs. Schuppert's parents, Bud and Betty Greene, owned the inn for 12 years before selling it in 1980. And Mr. Schuppert, a life-long restaurateur, got his first job, as a teen-age busboy, in the 14-room hostelry tucked into a grove of maples on Route 125. 
As enthusiastic as the couple is, industry observers warn that keeping a country inn profitable may be a daunting job. Regional economic downturns, changing tourism habits and a weak real estate market are putting pressure on the Vermont hospitality industry.
''People have stopped going to inns in droves,'' said William Oates, a broker specializing in inn acquisition and operations. The Vermont Lodging and Restaurant Association recently reported level or declining occupancy rates and room and meal tax receipts around the state.
''We're in a precarious position,'' said Daniel Pudvah, the association's executive vice president. ''There's a lot of thinking that the worst part has yet to hit Vermont.''
Prices of Vermont inns, which tripled in the 80's, have leveled too, and brokers say more are on the market now than ever.
The Greens bought the Waybury Inn in 1968 for $98,500 and sold it in 1980 for $248,000; it sold for $775,000 in 1987 and $827,000 this summer.
Single-room rates, averaging about $60, have stayed steady for two years and Mr. Pudvah said travelers commonly switch inns for price differences of only a few dollars. At the same time, he said, inn owners are being pressured to offer more amenities.
Zeke Church, a consultant for Baron Resources Corporation of Avon, Conn., says that the company, which once targeted 100 New England inns for acquisition, has ceased looking for properties.
The ineptitude of the Newhart cast makes good comedy, but the reality is that successful inns are moving into the hands of well-trained professionals. Mr. Oates said his bi-monthly seminars draw, not the older couples he used to see, but 30-ish people, often with business degrees, seeking careers.
Sales of Vermont inns during the real estate boom of the 80's often were to couples who enjoyed spectacular capital gains on homes around New York or Boston. No longer, he said.
The Schupperts say they are ready to invest in improvements, and will begin offering ski and bicycling packages. They also plan to overhaul the inn's menu and make the 144-seat restaurant profitable on its own.

HEADLINE: Census Workers Remember Resistance and Lies

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
''The managing agent wouldn't know if there were three people in the apartment or one,'' said the worker, an unemployed manufacturing executive in her 30's who spoke on condition that only her first name, Judy, be used. ''Sometimes people are subletting without telling the people in the building.''
In the South Bronx, Ada B. Gonzalez, 50 years old, said she knocked at a single-family house where the owner appeared to be renting to two other families with several children. She was introducing herself to one of the families, she said, when the owner came out of a separate entrance and told her that only one family, his, lived in the house. 
''I couldn't put them down as just people,'' she said. ''I had to interview the families or he had to give me the information.''
Rough 1990 census figures released last week showed New York City with a population of 7,003,179, or 38,460 fewer residents than in 1980. The estimate confirmed the worst fears of city officials, who have charged that a count based on finding people and asking them questions cannot be accurate where thousands fear the Government, move frequently, do not speak English or will not cooperate for other reasons. A Million More Than Recorded? City officials believe that the city gained population during the 1980's, and said last week that they believe that New York has at least a million more people than the rough census figures show. Other cities across the country, like Houston, Philadelphia and Atlanta, have complained that they, too, were seriously undercounted.
Unwillingness to cooperate and the inability to find some residents are factors the Census Bureau took into account in its instructions to the more than 200,000 workers dispatched across the country in April to count people who failed to return their census forms by mail. The workers were required to make six attempts to contact a household. As a last resort, they were to obtain basic demographic characteristics from a reliable third party like a building superintendent or a neighbor.
But as the workers diligently conducted interviews and filled out census questionnaires, some said they often suspected the accuracy of the information they were given. In New York City, where enumerators had to visit more than one million households, sources frequently lied or simply did not know enough, the workers said.
Although common sense sometimes accounted for their skepticism, the workers said that many times they also had evidence that they were not getting correct answers. In the Bronx, Ms. Gonzalez said, she came across an apartment where an occupant conceded that 10 people shared the household but would provide data on only three. The others, the occupant said, were illegal aliens and feared deportation. They did not believe that the information would be kept confidential, and she could not find anybody who would vouch for their existence, she said. #7 Percent From Outside Sources In New York City, census-takers were forced to go to outside sources for data more often than in any other part of the country, Census Bureau officials said. As of July, about 7 percent of all occupied housing units counted were counted on the basis of data from someone other than an occupant, compared with a nationwide average of about 3 percent, the officials said.
The General Accounting Office reported in July that in some areas, like the southwest Bronx and northeast Manhattan, 10 to 14 percent of the count of households came from what it calls ''last resort information.''
''In the beginning, during the first six weeks, my crew leader wouldn't even accept last resort,'' said Judy. ''But I did a lot of them in the last two weeks of June, just because I had to do things quickly.''
Although it is illegal for a managing agent or doorman to refuse entrance to census workers, it happened to her at least once, Judy said.
The law provides for fines, but all that happened was that a census official sent a letter to the managing agent pointing out the law.
''It's not like they sent a marshal with me,'' she said.
Because it was late in the count, her boss told her to just get what she could from the managing agent, she said.
In written testimony to the House Subcommittee on Census and Population last month, Bureau Director Barbara Everitt Bryant acknowledged that information is less reliable from third parties. But she argued that the actual population count ''will not necessarily be jeopardized.''
Census-takers disagreed. Benjamin Flores, 42, whose census beat included the Williamsburg and Greenpoint sections of Brooklyn, said he filled out many forms from information from the offices of public housing buildings. But he said many tenants live in the buildings without the knowledge of these offices.
Mr. Flores said he was also skeptical of some of the information he obtained from neighbors.
''How correct can they be? Sometimes they are 100 percent correct and sometimes they're not,'' he said. ''I don't think we counted everybody. I really don't.''
The potential for inaccuracies was no less severe in more upscale neighborhoods. In Battery Park City, ''a good 50 percent'' of the information for thousands of units in the neighborhood came from doormen, said Lester Chang, manager of the South Manhattan district census office.
 
The Means of Last Resort
''It's not the best,'' he said.
Mr. Chang, whose district also included the Lower East Side, said his workers found less cooperation among the most affluent. ''The wealthy gave us the toughest problem,'' he said. ''The perception is that they don't need the count because they don't need the money. In the projects, people were cooperative but they shielded the second family in the unit.''
Workers said they used the last resort methodology more frequently in the later part of the canvassing, which ran between April and June. Many said they were up against deadlines and in retrospect believed they were not given adequate time to do the job.
''It's not impossible, but it'd take longer to perform the job,'' said Russell Jones, 26, a student at Fiorello H. LaGuardia Community College in Queens, who worked in the Bronx. ''They should do it in a whole year.'' City officials are now comparing the Census Bureau's count of housing units in New York City with their own list, which is derived from records from Consolidated Edison, the Housing Authority and the city's building and real property files, among others.
City officials, contending that even in units the that bureau counted it missed many people, said the extent of an undercount will be known only after the bureau completes a post-census survey to determine whether a statistical adjustment is needed.
John J. Connolly, assistant to Dr. Bryant, said the preliminary counts are subject to change. He said the bureau has continued to recanvass, looking for new housing developments and into neighborhoods where it suspects people might have been missed.
In addition, he said, 24 census district offices nationwide, including several in New York, will recheck areas where a high number of households were reported to have only one occupant on forms filled out by census-takers late in the enumeration.

HEADLINE: In Rising Debate on Poverty, The Question: Who Is Poor?

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 2

 BODY:
Though Ms. Carter thinks the answer is clear - ''I am poor,'' she said, without reservation - her situation illustrates some of the problems with the nation's method of calculating poverty. The measure is widely considered outdated, and in recent months Congress and the Bush Administration have begun steps that could lead to its revision.
 
Measurement Born in 60's
The current poverty line stems from a crude measure, fashioned in the 1960's, that simply multiplies a minimum food budget by three. The resulting figure has been raised every year to account for inflation, but it does not reflect things like changes in family spending patterns or regional differences in the cost of living.
Recognizing the problems with the current definitions, the Administration recently completed an internal study that outlines dozens of possibilities for refining the formula and says it is impossible to tell whether the number of people counted as poor would rise or fall as a result. 
While the debate about how much of the nation is poor might seem esoteric, it has important consequences. The poverty line helps govern eligibility for billions of dollars in benefit programs. It also helps guide assumptions about the nation's economic soundness and social fairness, which are particularly important if the country is heading into a recession.
''It matters because among other things it's one of the fundamental measures of the health and decency of our society,'' said Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, who is among those unhappy with the current measure. He said the country was ''flying blind,'' not knowing whether it was counting too many people or too few as poor.
While all definitions of poverty are subjective, any changes in the definition that would increase poverty rate could bring pressure for increased spending on social welfare programs. Those changes could also affect the nation's understanding of who the poor are. A modest increase in the poverty line, for instance, would significantly raise the number of elderly who are considered poor.
 
Political Implications
''It makes all kinds of difference who is poor as to how we react to it,'' said Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana, chairman of Congress's Joint Economic Committee, who added that the nation is underestimating the number of poor people.
The Administration study recognizes that any new poverty measurement would have political implications, cautioning that it must be ''at least as publicly acceptable as the present measures.'' The study was conducted as part of larger review of the quality of economic statistics, being led by Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers.
The report was presented to Mr. Boskin in August by a group that included representatives from seven Federal agencies.
The subgroup has since identified five aspects of the poverty line that it considers priorities for further research. No decision has been made over whether to finance the research, which is estimated to cost $2 million to $3 million.
The most recent figures from the Census Bureau, from 1988, estimated there were 31.7 million poor people in the United States, or 13 percent of the population.
A change in the poverty line would not necessarily change the number of people who receive Federal benefits, since the Government could alter the eligibility rules.
 
More Study Is Proposed
In June, Congress's Joint Economic Committee held hearings on the poverty line, and the House of Representatives has voted to give $600,000 to the National Academy of Sciences to study the issue. The proposal is now before the Senate.
Experts say that these steps, while modest, indicate more willingness to address the problems of the poverty line than at any time in at least the past decade.
While the interest arises in large part from the complaints of professional economists about technical aspects of the poverty measure, some say it is also part of a larger pattern of renewed interest in the problems of the poor.
''Increasingly, politicians, and I think the public as well, are coming to recognize that some people have been left behind,'' said Patricia Ruggles, an economist with the Joint Economic Committee and author of a book on the poverty line.
 
Any Changes Are Years Away
Nonetheless, it would be politically difficult for any Administration to change the definition of poverty, and members of the Congress and Administration say that even if such changes were made, they are several years away at the least.
The re-examination of the issue is occurring after a decade of Republican rule, in which economic fairness has been a major issue. Richard Schmalensee, a member of the Council of Economic Advisers, said that if large numbers of people were newly defined as poor, ''the other side will say, 'Aha, we told you the Administration was hiding the number of poor people.' ''
''And if you come up with a lower number,'' he continued, ''they'll say, 'See, the Administration is hiding the number even more.' ''
The current formula for estimating poverty has its quirky origins in the work of Mollie Orshanksy, then an obscure civil servant who began researching poverty in the early 1960's as part of her work for the Social Security Administration.
She took the Agriculture Department's cheapest recommended food plan and multiplied it by three, since research showed that the average family then spent a third of its income on food. Her resulting figures, which varied according to family size, were officially adopted in 1969. Since then, those original figures have simply been raised annually to account for inflation.
 
Charges of Overestimate
Among the reasons that some people think this method overestimates the extent of poverty in America is that it does not count as income the non-monetary benefits that many low-income people receive, like food stamps, subsidized housing, Medicaid or Medicare.
An experimental measurement by the Census Bureau that did count these benefits would have reduced the 1988 poverty rate from its official level of 13 percent to 10.5 percent.
While these criticisms suggest that there is less true poverty than reported, other critics argue that there is more.
Ms. Ruggles, the Congressional economist, said the current formula set the poverty line unrealistically low because it was based on outdated spending assumptions. While 30 years ago, the average American family spent a total of three times its food budget, she said, it now spends five times that amount, largely because of increases in the cost of housing and child care.
She argues that a formula based on housing rather than food would raise the poverty line about 50 percent.
Some critics argue that the eligibility rules for Government benefits implicitly recognize that the poverty line is too low. For example, families are eligible for food stamps if they earn less than 130 percent of the poverty line. Pregnant women and children younger than the age of six are eligible for Medicaid if their families earn less than 133 percent of the poverty line.
In addition, critics cite poll data that suggest most Americans intuitively would set the poverty line at a higher rate. A Gallup poll conducted in 1989 and released this summer by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Families USA Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group for the elderly, asked 3,511 Americans for their definition of poverty for a family of four. The average given was $15,017, rather than the official standard of $12,092.
Daniel H. Weinberg, Chief of the Census Bureau's Housing and Household Economic Statistics Division, said the five priorities recommended for Administration research are improving the evaluation of non-cash benefits, developing a new measure of spending needs, finding ways to account for tax burdens, reducing the underreporting of income and changing the adjustments for family size.
Ms. Carter, the Milwaukee widow, finds the definition of poverty less complex than the experts. She said that after paying for rent, groceries, utilities, a student loan and bus fare each month she has about $60 left. With this, she tries to buy clothes, medicine and entertainment for her children.
At the end of August, she was waiting for a paycheck in order to fill a prescription to treat her son's eye infection. ''Even if the prescription just cost a dollar,'' she said, ''I don't have the money.''

But her annual salary of $13,800 is more than the Government's official poverty line of $10,560 for a family of three, a figure some economists say is too low.

HEADLINE: Uninsured Drivers Create Other Kinds of Wreckage

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 2

 BODY:

 
Big Cities Hardest Hit
In 19 states the increase in these kinds of accidents ranged from more than 50 percent to 220 percent. The biggest problems occurred in major cities, officials said. In Los Angeles, uninsured drivers cause about one of every four accidents involving injury. In Philadelphia, Miami and Denver, the figure is one in three.
''This is an extremely serious situation all around the country,'' said David N. Levinson, Delaware's Commissioner of Insurance. ''Our opinion polls indicate that the folks are more upset about uninsured motorists than any other problem we asked about, including taxes.'' He said that one-third of the 540,000 vehicles in the state were not insured and that total claims involving uninsured drivers had increased from $200,000 in 1978 to $10 million in 1988, the latest year for which figures were available.
Many states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, require drivers to insure themselves against bodily injury caused by hit-and-run accidents or accidents with motorists who drive illegally without insurance. 
Experts say the growth in insurance premiums is at least partly responsible for the increase in the number of uninsured drivers. ''The number of uninsured vehicles increased faster in certain areas where insurance costs rose more quickly,'' said David L. Unnewehr, research director at the Insurance Research Council, a trade association that recently analyzed accident claim data involving uninsured drivers from 1976 to 1986.
 
New York Fares Well
Uninsured drivers in New York City caused 8.5 percent of all serious accidents in the lowest percentage of 15 cities studied by the council in 1986. ''New York's mandatory insurance law is enforced somewhat more than other states,'' Mr. Unnewehr said, ''but we didn't get real deep into the reasons why New York had a lower percentage than the other cities.'' His study found that the number of serious accidents caused by uninsured drivers in the state was half the national average, even though the number of those accidents almost tripled, to 6.3 percent in 1986 from 2.3 percent in 1976.
Other states that also saw at least a doubling in the rate of serious accidents caused by uninsured drivers were Idaho, North Carolina, Tennessee, Wyoming, Delaware, Georgia, Minnesota, Mississippi, North Dakota, Colorado and Utah.
The clamor over insurance rates has prompted Pennsylvania and a dozen other states to step up enforcement of their mandatory automobile insurance laws in the last 12 months.
 
Insurance Industry Blamed
But Mr. Levinson and consumer advocates say most of the new enforcement efforts are inadequate, and they accuse the insurance industry of blocking more stringent enforcement measures. They complain that the industry is content to collect the total cost of the nation's automobile insurance from a decreasing pool of customers as a way to keep administrative costs down and profits up.
''The industry would rather collect $750 from you, $750 from me and nothing from a deadbeat who doesn't want to carry insurance,'' said Mr. Levinson. ''The industry doesn't gain anything by collecting $500 from you, $500 from me and $500 from the other guy; it's $1,500 either way.''
Insurance industry spokesmen acknowledge that companies oppose mandatory auto insurance laws and some stringent enforcement measures proposed by the states, but they contend that the companies are taking the consumer's side in these matters. ''The industry does not want to be in the position of saying somebody must buy insurance before he feeds his children,'' said Shirley M. Nagelschmidt, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of American Insurers, a trade group.
Mr. Levinson complained that the insurance industry had fiercely opposed legislation in Delaware this spring that would have required automobile owners to paste color-coded stickers on windshields as proof they had paid for insurance. ''I have never seen a lobbying effort like it in my life,'' Mr. Levinson said of the defeated proposal.
Ms. Nagelschmidt said the industry had opposed the sticker legislation because the procedure would inconvenience consumers and increase costs. ''It smacks of a lot of paperwork,'' she said.
 
Human Side of Debate
There is a very human side to the debate.
''The minimum insurance costs $600, and that wasn't feasible,'' said a 23-year-old woman in San Francisco, who drives a 1978 Volvo without insurance or registration and spoke on the condition that she not be identified.
She works at a nonprofit civil rights organization as an intern, earning $8.50 an hour. This year she was fined $278 for driving without insurance or registration, but she did not have money to pay it. She said she continued to drive illegally, primarily because she does not feel safe using public transportation at night. If she caused an accident, she said, she would hope to cover the other party's expenses by selling what remained of her car, purchased two years ago for $2,000.
Last year, Joseph H. Wood, a 23-year-old resident of Philadelphia, said he bought a 1985 Nissan Stanza for $6,000. Insurance companies quoted premiums that ranged from $5,552 to $8,000 for a basic policy; he moved to a suburb, King of Prussia, where he was able to buy a policy for $2,593. ''It is outrageous,'' Mr. Wood said. Profile of Uninsured Industry surveys indicate that most people who do not buy automobile insurance are young, unmarried men, who face the highest insurance premiums of any group, and who tend to have low incomes and few assets. It is also the group with the highest rate of accidents. Half the uninsured vehicles are owned by people who are unemployed, employed part time, retired, students or homemakers, according to a 1988 study by the Insurance Research Council. One-third of uninsured drivers earn less than $5,000 a year, and another third of those drivers earn less than $15,000 a year.
A recent Temple University survey showed why Philadelphia has among the highest automobile insurance rates in the nation. Prof. Paul Seidenstat's economic students recently surveyed 310 Philadelphia residents by telephone; one-third said their cars had been stolen or vandalized in the last two years and nearly 60 percent said they knew people who drove without insurance.
Pennsylvania and a dozen other states are increasing efforts to enforce mandatory insurance laws or stabilize insurance prices, or both. On July 1, a new Pennsylvania law took effect that requires insurance companies to roll back rates by as much as 22 percent. It requires the mechanics who perform annual safety inspections to withhold windshield stickers from drivers who do not have insurance cards.
On June 1, Massachusetts opened a computer link between the State Registry of Motor Vehicles and insurance agents to deal with about 250,000 residents who make down payments on insurance policies to obtain registration and then cancel their policies immediately after obtaining their registration cards. Under the new system, the registry provides local police officials with a weekly list of vehicles that lack insurance. The police can issue citations for fines of as much as $5,000, and they can keep the fines as incentives for doing the work.
In New Jersey, Gov. Jim Florio announced this year that the state would make greater efforts to track down its estimated 600,000 uninsured drivers and to revoke their licenses and registrations. And in the last 12 months, half a dozen states have greatly increased penalties for driving without insurance. A driver without insurance in Hawaii, for example, faces a $1,000 fine for the first offense and a $3,000 fine for each subsequent offense.
But consumer advocates say that without affordable insurance premiums, mandatory insurance laws will not solve the problem. Even in Hawaii, where 7,020 welfare recipients receive free auto insurance under a state program, insurance officials said about 110,000 of the 600,000 automobiles in the state had no insurance in 1988.
 
Proposal to Cut Premiums
One consumer advocate, J. Robert Hunter of the National Insurance Consumer Organization, says there was a sure way to reduce insurance premiums and make everyone buy insurance: have insurance companies bid competitively to provide basic coverage for all the vehicles registered in a state, and then have the state collect premiums at the gasoline pump, in the form of a surcharge.
Apart from Hawaii's subsidy program, only California has come close to approving a law that would make insurance affordable for low-income families. State insurance officials in California estimate that 25 percent of the 16 million passenger cars in the state are uninsured and that perhaps half the automobiles in Los Angeles are uninsured.
The California legislation, which failed last spring, would have required insurers to offer a $180 no-frills policy as part of an insurance overhaul. The insurance industry and consumer groups supported the bill, but trial lawyers did not. They said the legislation, which was based on a no-fault system that would eliminate most litigation, would have infringed on people's right to compensation for pain and suffering.
The legislation is to be reintroduced next year. ''The only thing that will correct the uninsured motorist problem is putting the price of insurance down,'' said Richard J. Roth Jr., an assistant commissioner of the California Insurance Department.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
IRAQIS ARE LIMITING PURCHASE OF FOOD

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Sept. 2

 BODY:

 
Will Be Self-Sufficient
Nearly a month after the sanctions were imposed, Mr. Hadithi asserted that ''food is available and we are determined to live off our local products.''
Iraq has relied heavily on imports in the past, and the United States is counting on the sanctions to force concessions. But Mr. Hadithi said, ''We are determined to resist the embargo'' in which American warships are interdicting vessels sailing to or from Iraq with oil or other supplies.
In separate meetings with a handful of foreign journalists, Mr. Hadithi and Latif Nasif Jasim, the Minister of Information and Culture, reiterated Iraq's desire to avoid war, but they seemed to offer little hope of compromise. 
Western diplomats said early in the day that they expected an Air France plane to take several hundred more foreign women and children out of Iraq, but the flight was eventually canceled. The reason was not immediately clear.
On Saturday about 700 foreign women and children, who had been held here and in occupied Kuwait to deter a United States military attack, flew to Asia, Europe and the United States after their three flights had been delayed for about six hours.
They were the first of several thousand foreigners, including many Americans, to leave Iraq since President Saddam Hussein blocked their departure several weeks ago. Asked if there were plans for additional women and children to leave, Mr. Hadithi said: ''Women are free to leave; men are not.''
 
Antidote to Annihilation
The reason, Mr. Hadithi said, was that ''the American Administration is threatening Iraq with death and distruction.''
He offered no details on how the remaining women and children would be leaving the country. Because of the embargo, only Iraqi Airways is using Saddam International Airport here. It is flying two heavily booked flights a day to Amman, the capital of Jordan, Iraq's closest political and economic ally.
Iraq refuses to refer to the foreigners as hostages. Many of the women who left on Saturday night said the Iraqis had treated them politely while they were being detained. But the women said they had lived in terror, and worried now about the fate of husbands and fathers left behind.
Though the threat of war hangs over Baghdad, few soldiers are visible on the streets of the sprawling city of four million people on the banks of the Tigris River. Shops and offices are functioning, and some people interviewed on the streets insisted that they were not worried.
 
'We're Used to War'
''We're not afraid,'' said a pharmacist who looked in her mid-40's. ''We fought a war with Iran for eight years. We're used to war. We want peace, but we're used to war.''
Standing beside heaps of carrots, cucumbers and onions at a neighborhood vegetable stall, Mahdi Katim said: ''People know from experience that they can't just sit around and be afraid of war.
''Otherwise,'' he said, ''they'd go crazy. People just go on with their lives.''
Mr. Jasim, the Information Minister, said Iraq was looking for ''a signal'' from the United States, ''a guarantee that there will be no war.'' But he said Iraq was adamant on the question of Kuwait.
''We will never make a deal about Kuwait with Mr. Bush,'' Mr. Jasim said.
He complained that President Bush had not seriously considered proposals put forward by President Hussein.
Reasserting longstanding Iraqi claims, Mr. Hadithi said that Kuwait ''is part of this land,'' adding that it ''has come back to the motherland.''
 
Personal Attack on Bush
Mr. Jasim also charged that President Bush had personal investments in Saudia Arabian oil and had sent in American troops to drive up prices for his own profit.
''We challenge him to say no if this isn't true,'' he said.
Referring to Iraq's food supplies, Mr. Jasim said: ''Our condition is not very bad. It is good.''
''We can live on the simple things,'' he said. ''We only need bread and water, no more than that.''
According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, Iraq imports nearly all its sugar and cooking oil and most of its rice, corn and wheat. American officials said late last week that conditions had become severe enough that the Iraqi Government was limiting the quantities of food released to stores from stockpiles.
 
Heavy Rain, Iraqi Explains
But Mr. Hadithi said Iraq had increased its production of rice and wheat in recent years and that crops being harvested now had benefited from particularly heavy rain. He said the distribution of food under the program was being organized by local officials of the ruling Baath Party.
''We have a war-tested society and a war-tested economy,'' he said. ''So even if we have to eat mud, we can resist the pressure and not kneel down to any power.''
Owners of two grocery stores said they had been told that they would be required to limit purchases of rice, sugar, tea, cooking oil, baby food, detergent and hand soap.
Iraqis said some food items had become hard to find in shops lately, but they insisted that this was the result of hoarding.
 
Shopping for Baby Food
A woman said some kinds of European-made baby food were scarce. ''But if you go from one store to another,'' she said, ''you can find it.''
Another woman said she had encountered no shortages. ''The opposite is true,'' she said. ''I'm not hoarding and I don't really think about war. Iraqis will help each other and, God willing, our President will solve the problem.''
Several people said they felt that the United States did not understand Iraq's position. Among other things, one man said, there had been no reason to suspect that Iraq was preparing to invade Saudi Arabia after its takeover of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
''There's no way Iraq would ever take over Saudi Arabia,'' the man said. ''We're brothers. We live the same way. We wouldn't take them over.''

HEADLINE: Mideast War Fear Does Not Deter Soviet Jews From Going to Israel

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Sept. 2

 BODY:
Despite predictions here to the contrary, the Persian Gulf crisis seemed to have little if any effect on the immigrants' plans. Through the month, many Soviet Jews interviewed in Israel and in the Soviet Union said they were more concerned about the growing anti-Semitism at home than about the prospect of conflict in Israel.
 
'Only Problems' in Russia
''In Moscow, there was no future for us, only more problems,'' Oleg Kostavar, who moved here early this month, said soon after his arrival. ''But here, we can defend ourselves. We are not worried.'' 
Gad Ben-Ari, spokesman for the Jewish Agency, the large quasi-governmental organization with a central role in immigration matters, said, ''We can conclude that the predictions of immigration problems because of the security situation here, or because of hardships in the absorption process, did not come about.''
But in an interview today, Uri Gordon, who runs the agency's Department of Immigration and Absorption, suggested that the Persian Gulf crisis may damage the Soviet Jewish immigration program from another angle: fund-raising.
And it has helped spawn a controversial proposal here: While Israel asks American Jews to donate hundreds of millions of dollars to the absorption effort, even as the gulf crisis pinches the American economy, perhaps Israel should ask its own citizens to make individual contributions to the effort beyond what they pay in taxes.
 
Overseas Pleas Grow Louder
Israel's foreign fund-raising requests have dramatically grown over the last year. Last October, when 1,500 Soviet Jews moved here, the goal was to raise $100 million over a five-year period, almost all of it from American Jews.
By February, the number of immigrants had swelled to more than 5,000 a month, and so the fund-raising target was raised to $200 million a year for three years. Then in June, when 11,000 Soviet Jews arrived here, the target was changed again, to $300 million a year over the next two years.
Now, 150,000 to 250,000 Soviet Jews are expected to arrive here during each of the next several years, and Mr. Gordon said the Government estimates it would need $22 billion to absorb them - ''more than half of Israel's gross national product.''
As a result, he added: ''I very much hope that the fund-raising figure can be raised again. Every night, we are seeing four or five planes coming in from Budapest, Warsaw and other places.''
But now, with growing economic problems in the United States as a result of the gulf crisis, even the present forecasts may be thrown into doubt.
''The gulf crisis - this is a subject of trouble for us,'' Mr. Gordon said.
 
Self-Help Recommended
Partly as a result, Mr. Gordon has begun to raise a controversial and unpopular idea here: For the first time, the Government should ask Israelis to give.
In a proposal he offered to immigration and absorption ministers late last month, Mr. Gordon wrote: ''It must be understood that if we intend to absorb this wave of immigrants, we shall have to lower our collective standard of living. There is no choice but to place some of the absorption burden on Israel's citizens.''
He proposes tax increases and budget cuts. These ideas have been greeted with howls of complaint, even though there is broad support among Israelis for the increased Soviet immigration as a means of strengthening the nation. So far, Mr. Gordon said, no one in Government agrees with his idea that Israelis should be asked to give anything to help absorb the new immigrants.
As the fund requests to Americans continue to rise, he worries that American Jews might begin to grow resentful, knowing that they are being asked to dig deep into their pockets for a country whose own citizens are not being asked to give much.
''But people here tell me, 'We serve in the army. We give a lot,' '' Mr. Gordon said, shaking his head. ''I say charity has to begin at home.''

HEADLINE: Khmer Rouge Move Their Refugees

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ARANYAPRATHET, Thailand, Sept. 1

 BODY:
Thai officials have done little to hinder this informal repatriation, relief officials say, and in many cases have helped it. ''How can we stop Cambodians from returning home to their native land?'' a Thai officer said, admitting that Thais were tired of the 250,000 or so Cambodians, many displaced by the Vietnamese invasion of December 1978, who are living on Thai soil.
 
Similar Attempt in 1988
In late 1988, the Khmer Rouge tried to move 15,000 refugees under its control over the border into Cambodia, to take advantage of a gradual Vietnamese troop withdrawal, but concentrated shelling drove the refugees back. The vast bulk of Vietnamese troops left Cambodia 11 months ago, however, and the Khmer Rouge have made significant military gains since then. 
The two non-Communist factions of the Cambodian opposition coalition have also moved some 10,000 refugees each from United Nations-run camps over the border into their own ''liberated zones,'' the United Nations and relief officials say. But in large part because of their comparative weakness militarily, these non-Communist zones are just over the border, almost directly opposite their main camps inside Thailand, so it is easier to provide some food and shelter. Those who are wounded or become very ill have less far to go to reach main camp hospitals.
For example, the officials say, the faction of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, whose main camp is at Site B, has set up its camp, Tatum, directly opposite Site B in Siem Reap Province of Cambodia. ''There's not much medical care, but the numbers and the distances are not so big, so the Sihanoukists can take more care,'' a relief official said. ''Living conditions are pretty bad, nonetheless.''
The officials also criticize the Sihanoukist administration of Site B for some of the same practices long followed by the Khmer Rouge: the militarization of the camps, schools and justice and the recruitment of those as young as 12 years old for military training and portering of ammunition to troops inside Cambodia. Sihanouk spokesmen deny such practices, but senior relief officials and some Western diplomats say they do occur.
 
Corruption Called Rife
The officials say graft and corruption are rife in the camps, Site 2 and Sok Sann, of the other non-Communist faction, the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, led titularly by a former Prime Minister, Son Sann. There is a particularly large market in uniforms, medicine and weapons provided by the non-Communist countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the United States, which directly provides only nonlethal aid. But when forced recruitment from these camps became a problem, relief officials said, American Embassy officials were able to get the Liberation Front to stop it.
Even in the Khmer Rouge camps, the officials say, there is now more porousness and business activity. About 1,000 people every day leave both Site 8 and Site K to cut logs inside Cambodia or to mine for gemstones, to sell to Thai traders. The proceeds, the officials assume, go to the Khmer Rouge.
But the officials say the day-to-day life of those still living in the open, United-Nations run camps of the Khmer Rouge - Site 8, Site K and O Trao - is relatively placid. United Nations officials in particular praise the cooperation of the Khmer Rouge camp administrators, who in the last year have allowed more access to Western hospitals and even Thai television and videos.
But the officials acknowledge that these camps are showplaces, and that the life of the ''hidden'' camps is different. ''They have to play the game of show camps, so they play it,'' a senior relief official said. ''I don't think the leadership changes at all. The Khmer Rouge are very strong mentally and disciplined compared to the others. They try to find a way to sell themselves to the stupid Westerners. They show an accommodating, obedient face. But they persist in time, and they know all our faults, while we are allowed to know few of theirs.''
 
Treatment Is Discriminatory
Still, the official said, it is possible to know something of what goes on behind the curtain. ''Our people are in the camps eight or nine hourse a day, and finally people come and talk, and they tell similar stories.''
They tell of the division of people into those useful for the war and those who are not; those whose husbands or children are fighters and those who are not; those who are trusted and those who are not; those who are allowed to re-enter the world of the Westernized camps for treatment, and those who are not; and those who are treated like human beings and those who are not, used instead like pack animals to carry weapons, food and equipment.
Mysteries remain, of course, the officials say, and there is no question that the Khmer Rouge demand considerable allegiance from their fighters and their families, who make up the bulk of the refugees who have been moved inside Cambodia from the hidden, militarized camps to which the United Nations never had access.
All the Khmer Rouge's hidden camps around Site 8, containing between 30,000 and 50,000 people, have been shut down and moved into Cambodia, the officials say, as well as most of the hidden camps around O Trao, involving up to 20,000 more refugees. Late last year, the entire United Nations-run camp of Borai disappeared, its 4,500 inhabitants decamping one day for Cambodia.
 
Camp Population Declines
Recent head counts in the open camps - arranged by the United Nations with as short notice as possible to reduce the number of soldiers claiming residence and ration books for the free rice and fish - have also shown a decline in the official populations of Khmer Rouge camps. In O Trao, the numbers have gone from 19,520 in June to 11,500 now; in Site K, the numbers have fallen to 8,000 from 11,500; in Site 8, the main show camp, the numbers have remained essentially stable, with 37,000 counted this week compared with 37,900 in June.
Officials say the decline is due to two factors: the movement of thousands of residents, mostly relatives of soldiers, into Cambodia, and the elimination of the hidden camps, whose population lived close enough to swell the census of the open camps.
Many of those repatriated now live in three Khmer Rouge camps: Nong Phru, inside Cambodia directly south of Aranyaprathet; Samlot, near Site K in Battambang province, and Koh Kong, farther south in Koh Kong Province.
''These are among the most malarial regions in the world,'' a senior relief official said. ''For those who now live there, the situation is very bad, with little food, lots of malaria and no permission for most to be treated. The mortality of children is very high.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
A Summit Respite

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., Sept. 2

 BODY:
Administration officials said Mr. Bush's strategy is to avoid military engagement and wait for the worldwide trade embargo to bite deeply into Iraq's supplies of food and military equipment. In Baghdad, an Iraqi official acknowledged today that the country is starting to limit its purchases of staple foods.
 
A Break From Talk of War
Even though Mr. Bush did not put great hopes in the mission to the Middle East by the United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, Bush Administration aides welcomed it as offering a weeklong hiatus from talk of war.
Similarly, the White House seems to be calculating that the prospect of a summit meeting with Mr. Gorbachev will keep the world's attention focused on diplomacy for at least another week. The convening of the fall session of the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 17 should provide another breathing spell. 
This is not to say that Mr. Bush or Mr. Gorbachev view the trip to Helsinki merely as an elaborate photo opportunity.
Although Mr. Bush asked for the meeting and clearly has more at stake, the Soviet President also stands to benefit. The meeting will give Mr. Gorbachev a chance to respond to misgivings expressed by some Soviet officials about American military operations in the Gulf, and to remind a people distracted and strained by economic hardship that Soviet power remains critical in world affairs.
 
Arms Issues to Discuss
Mr. Bush said on Saturday that the two leaders had business to conduct on issues other than the gulf. Administration officials said they hoped the meeting will give a final impetus to a treaty on reducing conventional armed forces in Europe that both countries hope to sign in Paris this fall.
Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committtee, said today on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press'' that negotiations on the treaty had ''bogged down.''
''Not that we won't reach an agreement,'' he said. ''But it is becoming more and more difficult unless we get some guidance from the top.''
Indeed, there are goals in the Persian Gulf that Mr. Bush might be able to achieve in the discussions with Mr. Gorbachev. Mr. Nunn suggested, for example, that Mr. Bush press him to withdraw Soviet military advisers from Iraq.
The Soviet advisers have become a political irritant to Mr. Bush, with their presence drawing complaints from his conservative supporters. Mr. Nunn said a withdrawal of the advisers would also send ''a strong message to Saddam Hussein that the Soviets not only are cooperating, but they're going to help begin to deny him the ability to wage war.''
 
Keeping Expectations Low
One should not underestimate the ability of these two leaders to take dramatic and unexpected action. But Mr. Bush and his aides have gone out of their way to lower expectations that he and Mr. Gorbachev can make a significant breakthrough on the gulf crisis.
Administration officials said Mr. Bush is anxious to discourage any impression that the summit meeting is an attempt by the two nuclear superpowers to impose their own solution.
And there is little action the Soviet Union is likely to take now, they said, beyond the strong support it has already given Washington in a region where the two countries have historically been adversaries.
''The Soviets clearly are reluctant to commit military forces,'' one Administration official said. ''They are on the threshold of historic internal decisions, and I don't think they want to create any controversial foreign commitments.''
Mr. Bush has said he is not seeking out Mr. Gorbachev as a potential mediator in the Gulf crisis. But Administration officials said the Helsinki meeting would give Mr. Bush a chance to satisfy himself that there is no division between Washington and Moscow on the issue of the Persian Gulf. An 'Arab Solution'? ''They have been expressing high hopes about an Arab solution,'' one official said. ''That's fine if it means a solution based on U.N. resolutions. If it means an Arab solution based on something less, then we part company. Bush and Gorbachev can talk about that.''
There were conflicting signals from Moscow last week about its attitude toward the American military presence in the gulf.
Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr M. Belonogov complained there were no guarantees that the United States would withdraw its military after the immediate crisis ends. But Mr. Gorbachev said later that he supported the military deployment.
Bush Administration officials said they were confident that Mr. Gorbachev was expressing the true Soviet position, and they insisted that the Soviet statements were unrelated to Mr. Bush's request for the meeting.
But one official said, ''If some sort of joint statement is issued or common themes are enunciated, it will certainly show the Iraqis that they are deluding themselves if they think they can play Moscow off against Washington.''
 
Hoping to Stiffen Support
A senior official said the United States hoped that by denouncing Mr. Hussein and reiterating their support for the United Nations sanctions, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev will stiffen the resolve of any country that might be wavering in its commitment to the trade embargo against Iraq.
Mr. Bush and his advisers have been looking for dramatic ways to bolster the embargo, officials said. One way is by sending Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady abroad this week to seek aid for countries whose economies are suffering because of the embargo.
But Mr. Bush, who believes strongly in his own abilities as a diplomat and in the power of direct contacts among world leaders, also wanted to do something personal, officials said. With other business to discuss and the timing so favorable, a summit conference with Mr. Gorbachev seemed to offer that opportunity, they said.
The meeting will also give Mr. Bush a chance to explore ways in which he and Mr. Gorbachev can turn their newfound confluence of interests in the Middle East into a broader, long-range policy, officials said. They plan to talk, for example, about prospects for cooperation on Cambodia and Afghanistan.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Japan Sending Vehicles and Housing for Military Effort in Gulf

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 2

 BODY:

 
Sacrifice by Auto Makers
''The auto companies are very forthcoming and willing to suffer tremendous financial losses to cooperate with this scheme,'' Mr. Okamoto said.
The new details about Japan's shipments were offered by officials who said they were alarmed by what seems to be a growing impression among Americans that the Government of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has not done enough to aid the military efforts against Iraq.
After weeks of wrestling with the problem, Mr. Kaifu announced last week that Japan would send food, medical supplies and refrigeration equipment to the Middle East. He said Japan was also assembling a large financial aid package for Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and other countries hit hard economically by the outbreak of the Persian Gulf crisis. 
President Bush praised Japan for its contributions, but United States officials were privately more critical. Members of Congress, commentators and newspaper editorials have begun accusing Japan of shirking its responsibilities in the multinational effort against Iraq.
Mr. Okamoto said he felt that American distrust of Japanese efforts and motivations constituted the gravest turn in relations between the two countries in many years. He described past confrontations on trade as ''pseudo crises'' compared with what is happening today.
 
U.S. More Satisfied
The aid from Japan still falls short of the original American requests. But United States officials said today they had no choice but to accept Japan's contention that because of its Constitution, it cannot supply lethal or combat-related equipment to the Middle East.
It appears that Washington, after expressing disappointment at Japan's failure to provide direct military aid, is now increasingly satisfied that Tokyo is genuinely trying to supply as much material as possible to aid the military indirectly.
It is still possible that Japan's plans could go awry. Officials in Tokyo said they were worried about delays in obtaining specific budget approval and the possibility that ship and dock workers will refuse to transport or load materials bound for a war zone.
One hitch has already occurred. Japanese officials said they had run into difficulties in seeking approval from airlines to transport military-type equipment and vehicles. The items will therefore arrive in Saudi Arabia by ship.
 
Airlines Mindful of Hostages
Airline companies have objected to sending anything even remotely construed as military, in part because some of their flight crews have already been taken hostage in Iraq.
It is also proving difficult to get engineers to volunteer to go the war zone to service Japanese equipment, officials said. Citing its postwar Constitution, which bars Japan from taking part in any use of force except for self-defense, Tokyo says it cannot order non-military or military people to the front.
Nevertheless, Japanese officials say they are doing a lot. ''It is unfair that Japan's role is so downplayed in America's mind,'' Mr. Okamoto said. He added that Tokyo hopes to change that impression before Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady arrives later this week on a mission to secure more aid.
Mr. Okamoto cautioned that Japan could under no circumstances increase its $1 billion pledge, even if war breaks out.
 
What Tokyo Declined to Do
Mr. Kaifu originally had emphasized that only food, medical supplies and water could be sent from Japan or aboard Japanese vessels and planes. He said these restrictions were imposed by Japan's Constitution.
The Prime Minister also rejected what his aides said had been an American request for minesweepers, frigates, military tankers with mounted guns, or C-130 transport planes, and for a Japanese airlift or sealift of weaponry or ammunition.
In recent days, however, Japanese and American officials have said they feel Tokyo is making an effort not to define things too narrowly, and to include equipment that could definitely aid the military effort though not in a direct or conspicuous way.
A senior American official confirmed tonight, for instance, that Japan had quietly begun trading lists of equipment with the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington to determine which items could meet American military needs and still satisfy Japan's direct ban on military aid.
 
Checking Inventories
The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry has begun a survey of inventories at Japanese companies to determine what could be sent immediately or in the coming months.
Tokyo is encountering delays and difficulties in fulfilling other parts of its pledges, Japanese officials acknowledged. For instance, although Japan has pledged to make a direct monetary contribution to the stationing of armed forces of other countries in the Middle East, there is no legal entity to which it can write a check and send the money, they said.
For more than a week now, the Government and the giant airline it once controlled, Japan Air Lines, have been engaged in a behind-the-scene struggle over whether to send cargo planes full of supplies to American troops in Saudi Arabia. In heated meetings, the airline's executives resisted the Government's entreaties, declaring that it would carry only food, water and emergency medical gear to the troops.
Japan Air Lines was concerned that 23 of its own employees were among the hostages being held in Iraq, and it feared retailiation if the airline was publicly identified as airlifting supplies to the military buildup.
 
Controlling Corporate Giants
The dispute raises questions about Japan's renowned ability to quietly control the nation's corporate giants, moving government and industry in lockstep. The crisis in the the gulf could give rise to a new perception of the limits to Japanese power.
Industry here threw itself unquestioningly into the war effort in World War II, and in the process became a target of Allied bombs and later, public criticism.
This time, as one airline official put it, ''we had little interest in becoming Japan's surrogate air force.''
But that is exactly what Tokyo was seeking. By law and tradition, Japan's own air force is prohibited from flying abroad. Although the Japanese Defense Agency sought last week to reinterpret those laws to allow at least some limited Government action, its officials conceded that the military could not bring cargo to the Gulf even if it wanted to: Japan's ban on offensive weapons has prevented its forces from obtaining long-range planes with the capability to refuel in mid-flight.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Throughout the Middle East, Iraq's Challenge Redraws the Political Lines

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Sept. 1

 BODY:

 
The Design of a New Reality
But the abrupt Iraqi takeover of Kuwait shattered all this.
The invasion made clear the unbounded ambitions of Mr. Hussein, a hard man who entered politics as a teen-age gunman and whose propaganda projects him in the guise of near-mythic Middle Eastern conquerors from Nebuchadnezzar to Saladin.
Rallied by Egypt and Saudi Arabia, a dozen Arab countries - a bare majority of the 21-member Arab League - dropped the screen of decades of slogans and speechmaking to admit that their interests lay with the West. Many feared for the continued existence of their own narrowly based governments in the face of the Iraqi threat.
The notion of Arab brotherhood was shattered at the landmark Arab League summit meeting here last month; it split the Arab world by endorsing the presence of foreign troops in Saudi Arabia and the dispatch of Egyptian, Moroccan and Syrian forces to give it an Arab face. 
 
Crossing Borders and Ideological Lines
But the map of the Arab world is not merely one of nation-states. A swirl of traditions, ideas and emotions cross the artificial lines of the borders. Dynastic and tribal traditions hold sway in some countries, revolutionary ones in others.
There is a long political struggle between the old idea of Islam as the region's unifying force - an idea that dates to the wave of Arab conquests for the new religion in the seventh century -and the newer ideology of secular, Pan-Arab nationalism.
There is the fabulous oil wealth of the rulers of the gulf and the grinding poverty in much of the Arab world. And there is the issue of Israel and the Palestinians, the test by which Arab leaders try to demonstrate their legitimacy.
Here is how the map looks a month into the conflict:
Arrayed solidly against Iraq are Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria, Morocco and the oil shiekdoms of Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and the exile government of Kuwait; all have some military involvement. Lebanon, Djibouti and Somalia also voted for the Arab League resolution.
Uneasily tied to Iraq are Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization. Their respective leaders, King Hussein and Yasir Arafat, have been desperately trying to float peace proposals. Yemen, too, appears sympathetic to Iraq. But both Jordan and Yemen have said they would honor the United Nations embargo against Baghdad.
Algeria, Tunisia and Mauritania are on the sidelines, unlike Morocco, but they lean toward Iraq. Considerable popular sentiment sees Saddam Hussein as a kind of Robin Hood, and the leaders of these three North African countries have denounced the American military presence. The countries did not attend the meeting of the Arab League foreign ministers last week at which the dozen states lined up against Iraq demanded that it not only withdraw from Kuwait but pay war reparations.
 
Qaddafi, the Libyan Wild Card
Libya is, as usual, somewhat of a wild card. The mercurial Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, like King Hussein and Mr. Arafat, has been trying to come up with an initiative to give President Hussein a face-saving way out. He has criticized the taking of foreign hostages by Iraq, but today he said he would not obey the United Nations-imposed embargo on food shipments to Iraq.
Here are the interests of the major players, and the influences upon them:
For those countries allied against Iraq, the most important issue is self-preservation and fear or hatred of Saddam Hussein.
Egypt and Saudi Arabia, along with Jordan, had been major backers of Iraq during its eight-year war with Iran, seeing Mr. Hussein as a bulwark against Islamic fundamentalist revolution. Kuwait, too, had given billions of dollars of oil revenue to Iraq; its policies involved considerable risks with its own Shiite Muslim minority.
Egypt has been the Arab country most closely aligned with the United States, since Anwar el-Sadat concluded a separate peace with Israel in 1979. Egypt receives more than $2 billion a year in American foreign aid -the largest sum for any country except Israel - and cooperates with the United States in military and other areas.
Morocco, where King Hassan II is the chief Sunni Muslim religious figure, also has ties to the West. King Hassan has even served as a go-between with Israeli officials.
 
A Kingdom Feels the Threat
Saudi Arabia, which controls more than 40 percent of the world's oil supplies, is a kingdom in which strong orthodox Sunni Islam blends with a puritanical streak of fundamentalism as practiced by the Wahabi sect; most important Government offices are held by the many princes of the House of Saud. The Government has strong ties to the United States, but it has long preferred to keep them discreet.
The Saudis felt directly threatened both by Mr. Hussein's takeover of Kuwait and by his verbal attacks on the decadence and greed of oil-rich rulers. These attacks have struck an emotional chord among the vast number of poor people in the Arab world.
There was similar fear among the wealthy Persian Gulf sheikdoms, particularly in the United Arab Emirates, which Baghdad had singled out along with Kuwait for exceeding its oil production quota and thus lowering prices. The Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman are all providing installations for Western troops. Some had done this in the past but preferred to pretend they weren't there - for example Bahrain, where there is a United States naval headquarters and a ''secret'' airfield.
Syria presents one of the most remarkable changes in the political map. Long considered an implacable foe of the West and shunned as a harbor for terrorists, Syria is now sending a token detachment of troops to stand with the Americans in Saudi Arabia, a gesture that prompted a telephone call of thanks from President Bush to President Hafez al-Assad.
Mr. Assad, a crafty maneuverer in the shifting alliances of the Middle East, has long been a bitter rival of Saddam Hussein. At a stroke, he moved Syria from isolation within in the Arab world into the center of events.
''Like the rest of the Arab rulers, Assad fears the destabilizing effect of Saddam on the region as a whole,'' said a Western diplomat in Damascus. ''He is a threat to all regimes. He increases the risk of war and the risk of Israeli involvement. Saddam can polarize the Arab world. He is trying to appeal to Arab frustrations, Arab nationalism over the heads of the rulers.''
The Syrian and Iraqi rulers head rival branches of the Baath Party, which espousees a modern socialist, secular pan-Arab ideology. In practice the two leaders are nearly identical dictators who rule through their secret police, although Mr. Hussein is now regarded as more merciless.
 
Iraqi Appeals to Tradition
President Hussein's secularism appears to be waning. During the war against Iran he had himself pictured making his devotions on a prayer rug and lately he has called on Muslims to rise up against ''infidel'' American troops who he says are defiling Islamic shrines in Saudi Arabia. He recently had his genealogy traced, and it was announced that a diligent search of birth records in Takrit revealed that the President was a direct descendant of the Prophet Mohammed.
In Lebanon, as always a microcosm of the Middle East killing fields, the Government is under the thumb of Syria but a rump government of Maronite Catholic hard-liners has been plentifully supplied with arms by Iraq. These Lebanese, with long practice as smugglers, could be a major help to Iraq in puncturing the international blockade.
Of the few players linked to Iraq, Jordan is perhaps in the most complicated and difficult position.
 
A Nation's Weakness and a Ruler's Fear
Its King, Hussein, who has long had ties to the West, rules a weak buffer state and now finds himself trying to defend the Iraqi President, whom he has lauded as ''an Arab patriot.'' But his attempts to mediate with the United States and Britain have been received icily.
The King's major concern is to preserve his Hashemite dynasty, which in its Jordanian form is a Western-engineered monarchy with a relatively short history. His greatest fear is that Israel will expel Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and in so doing destabilize Jordan, which is already roughly 60 percent Palestinian. In Amman, portraits of Saddam Hussein are now taped side by side with the King in many shop windows.
The King's great-grandfather was the Sharif of the Hejaz, the guardian of Islam's holiest site in Mecca in what is now Saudi Arabia. That Sharif Hussein and his sons were enlisted by the legendary T. E. Lawrence, the British Army officer and writer better known as Lawrence of Arabia, to lead the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire in World War I. King Adapts an Old Honorific But they were ousted in 1926, amid charges of corruption, by the Islamic fundamentalist of the day, Ibn Saud, the founder of the current Saudi dynasty, who swept out of the desert with his Wahabi warriors. The British, meanwhile, were setting up Hashemite dynasties in Trans-Jordan and Iraq. The monarchy in Baghdad was overthrown in 1958.
About a week ago, King Hussein instructed his inner circle to address him as ''Sharif,'' and he now uses the title in official statements. This has raised eyebrows among diplomats, who speculate that the King hopes to return to his family's past glory.
The King was deeply shaken by an outbreak of rioting a year ago against government corruption, in which much of the protest was in Bedouin areas, his traditional stronghold. Since then, he has adopted the populist oratory of Saddam Hussein; in February, at a meeting of the Arab Cooperation Council in Amman, he made an impassioned plea against the decadence of the oil sheiks. He is said to be personally friendly with Saddam Hussein.
The P.L.O. chairman, Yasir Arafat, who had drifted toward Iraq as the emerging power in the Arab world, finds himself in an uncomfortable position. A large part of the frustrated mass of Palestinians in Jordan and in the Israeli-occupied territories have given emotional support to Iraq, but Mr. Arafat has alienated his financial base, which is in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other gulf countries.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
The Oilfield Lying Below the Iraq-Kuwait Dispute

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:

 
Percentages Set by Formula
Oil formations frequently run be neath political boundaries, whether they involve unfriendly leaseholders in West Texas or neighboring Arab states, and procedures have existed for years to settle disputes that arise. Typically, participants in the same field share both production costs and revenues, using a formula that sets percentages of ownership.
But Iraq refused to negotiate with Kuwait on such an agreement. So Ku wait produced oil from Rumaila with out any agreement, and then adopted a policy of producing far more oil than it was allowed under the quota system of the Organization of Petroleum Export ing Countries. That policy became an other sticking point in relations with Iraq, which contended that the over production depressed oil prices and revenues for all OPEC members.
Iraq had produced oil from the field before it went to war with Iran. Of a total of 615 wells in Iraq, 225 were in the Rumaila field, according to 1986 fig ures, the latest available, from John S. Herold Inc., an oil industry consulting firm in Greenwich, Conn. 
 
Field Mined During War
But during the Iran war Iraq mined its giant share of the Rumaila field to keep it from falling into Iranian hands, Western political experts say. Kuwait stepped up its total oil production, cap turing some of Iraq's customers and pumping millions of barrels from the Rumaila field. After the war with Iran ended in a cease-fire in 1988, Iraq re sumed drilling in Rumaila.
Iraq's dispute with Kuwait, has its roots in Britain's decision in 1899 to es tablish Kuwait as a British protector ate. The Kuwait royal family had ruled the area since 1756, but Iraq still con sidered it part of its southern province, The dispute flared again more than 30 years ago, shortly after oil was dis covered in 1953 in Iraqi territory in the huge Rumaila reservoir. After the Arab League of States established the Kuwait-Iraq border two miles north of the southern tip of the oilfield, Kuwait erected oil rigs on its own territory and drilled into the rich pool below. Kuwait has never disclosed how much Rumaila oil it has pumped. $2.4 Billion Claim by Iraq But President Saddam Hussein says Kuwait owes Iraq $2.4 billion for oil taken from the field. In addition to as serting that Kuwait owed Iraq for the oil it had produced, Mr. Hussein told an emergency meeting of the Arab League in May that excessive supplies of Kuwaiti oil in the world market in the last two years had undermined OPEC production quotas and de pressed world oil prices. He said that action cost Iraq $14 billion a year, or far more than Kuwait had lent Iraq during Iraq's confrontation with Iran.
His remarks to the Arab League's closed session were reported by the Middle East Economic Survey in an issue that reached American experts after the invasion of Kuwait.
Sounding the alarm over Iraq's mounting grievances against Kuwait, Mr. Hussein told the Arab League that ''we cannot tolerate this type of eco nomic warfare,'' and added, ''We have reached a state of affairs where we cannot take the pressure.''
 
Assertions Rejected
In a memorandum to the Arab League dated July 19, Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir al-Sabah, the Foreign Minister of Kuwait, rejected Mr. Hussein's as sertions about Kuwait's production from the Rumaila reserves. ''Kuwait has produced oil from wells within its territory south of the Arab League line and far enough away from the interna tional borders to conform with interna tional standards,'' he wrote in the memo.
The Kuwaiti royal family did not re spond to a request made Friday to a spokesman in Taif, Saudi Arabia, where the family is in exile, for com ment on Kuwait's production at the Rumaila field.
Kuwait's overall production in 1989, an average of 1.8 million barrels a day, exceeded its OPEC quota by 700,000 barrels. The Kuwaiti Government's hope was to force Mr. Hussein to the bargaining table, and then extract from him a border truce that included Rumaila drilling rights, as well as a non-aggression pact. Instead, Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait and drove its ruling family into exile.
 
'Economic Warfare'
Henry M. Schuler, director of the energy security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that, from the Iraqi viewpoint, the Kuwait Government was ''acting aggressively - it was eco nomic warfare.''
''Whether he's Hitler or not, he has some reason on his side,'' Mr. Schuler said of President Hussein. He added that American officials needed to ap preciate the economic and psychologi cal significance the Rumaila field holds for the Iraqis and why Kuwait's exploi tation of Rumaila, in addition to its high oil output in the 1980's, was an afront to the Iraqis.
''It's not just the emotional man in the street in the Arab world who finds the Iraq case appealing,'' he said. ''So do many of those who are thinking, in telligent people. If the Iraqi people feel they are the victims of aggression, and that their legitimate claims are being stifled now by American intervention, they will hang in there a lot longer than if that were not the case.''
Some Middle East experts dismiss Iraq's complaints about Kuwait's ac tivities in the Rumaila field. They say Mr. Hussein has voiced these and other charges to justify a long-held desire to plunder Kuwait's financial wealth and give his nearly landlocked country con trol of more than 200 miles of Persian Gulf coastline.
 
'Only a Smokescreen'
''The issue of oil taken from the Rumaila field is only a smokescreen to disguise Iraq's more ambitious inten tions,'' said Marvin Zonis, a professor of political economy at the University of Chicago's Graduate Business School. ''The Iraqis will claim anything to jus tify the incorporation of Kuwait.''
Some Iraqi officials have accused Kuwait in the past of using advanced drilling techniques developed by Amer ican oilfield specialists to siphon oil from the Rumaila field, a charge that American drillers deny, noting that the oil flows easily from the Rumaila field without any need for these techniques.
The Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, with headquarters in London, acquired American drilling expertise when it bought the Santa Fe International Cor poration in 1981 for $2.4 billion. Santa Fe, based in Alhambra, Calif., has separate divisions that specialize in oil field drilling and rig operations, pri marily in offshore areas around the world, as well as in exploration and production, mostly in the Gulf of Mexi co, Texas and Louisiana.
 
Six American Workers
John J. Mika, Santa Fe's vice presi dent of administration, said six Santa Fe employees, all Americans, were among the oil workers captured by Iraqi troops in the early moments of the Aug. 2 invasion. All of the men were believed taken to Baghdad, he added.
The Santa Fe employees worked on several rigs ''immediately adjacent'' to the Iraqi border, Mr. Mika said. He added that he was unaware of any well that might have utilized the ''slant'' drilling technique along the Iraqi bor der.
W. C. Goins, senior vice president of OGE Drilling Inc., a Houston company that provided oilfield supervisors and workers for Kuwait in the same area, said he was ''positive'' all of the wells his employees drilled and operated ran vertically down to the Rumaila pay zone. ''That field crosses the border in north Kuwait,'' he added. ''Iraqis were drilling on one side, and Kuwaitis on the other side.''
He said that Iraqi border guards would come over to the Kuwaiti oil wells occasionally and shared the rig workers' lunches - but under Kuwaiti law the workers were not allowed to drink the beer that the Iraqis brought with them, to the Iraqis' delight.
Now those lunches are a thing of the past. Of the 18 Americans employed by OGE in Kuwait, six have been missing since the invasion. At least two were ''taken to Baghdad right away,'' Mr. Goins said.

Return Of a Felon Who Once Was Mayor

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I., Aug. 30

 BODY:
First elected in 1974 at age 33, the tough, boyish-looking lawyer quickly settled union contracts for city workers and helped clean up crime-ridden neighborhoods, at times patrolling on a horse with mounted police officers. He developed an intensely loyal following.
But in 1984, even loyalists knew there was trouble. Given a suspended sentence in the assault by lighted cigarette, log and ashtray of a man he said was having an affair with his estranged wife, Mr. Cianci became a convicted felon and by law had to resign. Supporters wept when he announced he would step down. 
At the same time, a corruption scandal was beginning to break open. The Mayor, who said he was unaware of illicit activities, was never charged with any wrongdoing. But more than 30 city workers and contractors were indicted on charges ranging from conspiracy to fraud. Sixteen of those people went to jail.
Since 1985, Mr. Cianci has dominated the afternoon airwaves as host of a radio talk show on WHJJ-AM in East Providence, giving him a chance to express his views on issues like taxes and crime.
As for his own run-in with the law, Mr. Cianci dismisses it as ''ancient history.'' The assault, he says, ''was a mistake, and I have paid for it in a very public and a very private way.'' As for the corruption audit of his administration , Mr. Cianci testily instructs an inquirer to walk over to the Rhode Island Historical Society for ''that kind of information.'' The provision of the City Charter that requires a convicted felon to resign does not bar felons from running for office.
While his unfavorability rating hovers around 50 percent, polls show that 28 percent of the voters favor Mr. Cianci as the one to run the capital of Rhode Island, a state long known for scandals and shady politics.
Dubbed ''Rogues' Island'' in its early days as a colony, Rhode Island was infamous for offering haven to pirates. The state's scandals span in scope from open vote buying in the 1750's to the 1985 trial of Claus von Bulow, a Newport socialite who was acquitted after two trials on charges of trying to murder his wealthy wife.
In recent years, Providence has been the New England headquarters for organized crime.
But scandals aside, much of Mr. Cianci's appeal, voters say, is his reputation for having revitalized neighborhoods and cut urban crime during his previous tenure. During the 1980's, Providence, like many other Northeastern cities, underwent an economic renaissance.
''There is an experience quotient that has to be pegged against purity of soul,'' said Rosalind Rustigian, 38, who sold Mr. Cianci the oriental rugs that lie in his posh carriage house on the corner of Power and Benefit Streets.
But for Irwin N. Becker, a local resident, a victory by Mr. Cianci ''would be a great embarrassment'' for a city trying to attract business and respect.
''He ran city government into the ground,'' said Mr. Becker, executive director of Elmwood Neighborhood Housing Services, a neighborhood organization financed by the city.
''He spent a lot of money on the neighborhoods, but he'd throw money at the neighborhoods without a lot of policy,'' Mr. Becker added, referring to several community programs that were closed after a Federal audit.
Paul V. Jabour, a Democratic candidate for mayor, said, ''I think you dispel any support for Cianci if people want to look forward to the future.''
Yet Mr. Jabour and the other three candidates vying to win the Democratic primary know that Mr. Cianci will be a formidable candidate in the final campaign.

HEADLINE: As the Need for Harmony Grows, Labor Talks Lose Stridency

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 2

 BODY:
The float was that of the United Automobile Workers' Local 160, normally one of G.M.'s most militantly anti-management groups.
Meanwhile, at G.M. headquarters, company and union bargainers were debating a proposed three-year contract. G.M. has been chosen by the U.A.W. as the focus of its negotiation strategy. The current contract expires Sept. 14, after which the union could decide to strike the auto maker.
But the halls outside the negotiating rooms this year have been unusually free of the posturing by union leaders and executives that in years past conveyed a sense of impending crisis. The reason for the quiet: Union leaders say G.M. has made some very generous initial proposals. Both sides also say the triennial bargaining ritual has matured. 
''There is a greater need for labor and management cooperation; most people in those organizations recognize that,'' said Howard D. Samuel, president of the industrial union department of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''Unions can grow on that basis.''
There are several reasons why no one wants a strike. At one time, automaking, steelmaking, trucking and other components of the economy were virtual oligopolies. Labor contracts between companies and unions established labor costs across an entire industry. Today, nonunion and foreign companies are influential players, so costs depend on what those companies are doing, too.
Moreover, certain labor costs, like medical benefits and holidays, have become institutionalized and are not subject to much change in each new contract. Finally, gloomy predictions for the economy and employment help everyone focus on reaching an agreement.
 
Thinning of the Ranks
The past decade, to be sure, has produced its share of grief for organized labor. The Reagan Administration broke the air traffic controllers' union. Strikes against Eastern Airlines and Greyhound pushed the companies into bankruptcy instead of helping the workers' lot. The union movement lost hundreds of thousands of members.
But the Labor Department under President Bush has taken a more active interest in mediating impasses like the United Mine Workers strike against the Pittston Coal Group, Mr. Samuel said. And the rising tide of global economic competition has encouraged American companies and work forces to accommodate one another in the interest of survival.
Unions suddenly have a big stake in harmony. While union membership over all has increased in the past decade, according to the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the American work force has grown much faster. Thus, a smaller proportion of workers is being represented. The autoworkers' union has lost a third of its members, shrinking to less than a million from nearly 1.5 million. And the union has lost key organizing battles at Japanese plants in this country because many workers do not like the confrontations with management.
 
The Workplace Changes
At the same time, labor and management at many factories have been trying more and more to cooperate with one another in the interest of improving quality and productivity, and of lowering costs. Time clocks have been junked. Workers have agreed to do tasks outside their job descriptions. Foremen have ceded traditional prerogatives of authority to hourly workers.
Ultimately, the goal has been trust: Managers trusting hourly workers to strive for quality and productivity; hourly employees trusting managers to forgo feathering their nests with lavish pay and benefits, and to forgo the short-term profit gained by subcontracting work to nonunion or offshore companies.
In the auto industry, Big Three executives and union leaders this year are trying to find a way to guarantee job or income security for current hourly workers. The union believes G.M. is about to offer a version of lifetime employment for current workers, but the company will want increased flexibility to reassign workers and to close some plants. The company has been quiet about its plans.
Analysts have said global competition puts the pressure on G.M. - and on all United States companies facing worldwide competition - to maintain amicable, constructive relations with hourly workers. Without a skilled, motivated work force, modern manufacturing techniques do not work well.
That is why executives may be going out of their way to encourage good will by personal example, as in helping with a parade float.

HEADLINE: Strikebreakers and Other Threats

 BODY:
These threats challenge America's reputation for fairness as well as its aspirations. Many workers feel they're sliding helplessly down a slippery slope. Their struggle is a national concern.
Productivity in the U.S. is sluggish by historical standards and by comparison with America's major allies. That's why wages, relative to inflation, have stagnated since the early 1970's. If output per worker doesn't rise, neither can wages. This lackluster performance is due partly to bad management and weak corporate investment. 
But a key part of the problem is an influx of workers out of high school who are ill prepared to handle the demands of modern jobs. These unskilled, nonunion workers suffer a lifetime of meager earnings. And the earnings gap between skilled and unskilled workers is higher than ever.
More is at stake, however, than the plight of individuals. If poorly educated workers were better trained, everyone else would share the benefit of the extra productivity. Western European countries have established successful systems for training workers who lack a college education. The U.S. is alone in doing nearly nothing.
Union workers face a different peril. The percentage of American workers belonging to unions has fallen by half over the past two decades; it now hovers around 17 percent. Some of the forces behind the decline, like the tilting of economic production toward services and away from manufacturing, are beyond the control of public policy.
But part of organized labor's plight is firmly under Congressional control. Laws that restrict employer opposition to union organizing are weakly enforced and only light penalties are imposed. And employers have recently perfected techniques to unravel contracts by first inviting strikes, and then replacing strikers with permanent hires.
At risk is the fabric of collective bargaining that has been woven since the 1930's. This risk may not appear grave to those who view unions as little more than anti-competitive cartels. By artificially driving up wages and prices, unions eliminate jobs and exploit consumers. But they can also improve morale and productivity and set an enviable model for unorganized workers. Unions are about governance, empowering workers to voice discontent and protect themselves against capricious managers.
The precipitous decline of unions threatens to throw away the good along with the bad. The challenge for public policy is to encourage worker participation in workplace governance without encouraging anti-competitive wage hikes.
Revising Federal labor laws to re-balance power between employers and unions might be necessary; incentives for nonunion employers to incorporate more worker control might also be effective. None of this need threaten consumers if the economy remains open to foreign competitors. Low-cost imports put a firm brake on anti-competitive contracts.
American workers turn out more total goods and services than anyone else. For that reason, on this Labor Day, they deserve celebration. But the advantage is quickly eroding. For that reason, American workers also deserve careful nurturing.

HEADLINE: Immigration Bill Adds Few Skilled Workers;
Unskilled Also Needed

 BODY:
Working women, now subject to constant anguish over the near impossibility of finding adequate care for family members, would be in an even worse situation. Professional women with demanding schedules will be hardest hit, because institutional care, when available, often does not meet their needs. 
There are constant reports that women will be called upon to take on more highly skilled and professional jobs, but virtually no mention of who will provide the support services that allows them to work and have care for their children and elderly and handicapped family members. Other industries employing low-skilled labor will also be hard hit and will contract, eliminating jobs for American workers.
The Department of Labor has calculated that 42 percent to 44 percent of all applications for employer-sponsored immigration would be eliminated under the Senate bill. Most of the increase in requests for alien workers is for low-skilled and unskilled workers, even despite a minimum four-year wait for them.
Since there were 44,238 applications in fiscal year 1988, 58,242 in fiscal year 1989 and, it is estimated, 46,594 in fiscal year 1990, this means that many thousands of jobs would go unfilled each year, and American employers would have no way to fill them. Smaller businesses will be most severely affected, and perhaps forced to close.
Nearly all studies indicate that immigration is beneficial to our economy and that immigrants create jobs for Americans, rather than take them away. Our current policy is much too restrictive and hurts American workers.

HEADLINE: Metro Matters;
Labor Is Hoping Dinkins Support Pays Off Soon

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Today, Mr. Dinkins is again to march with other dignitaries at the head of the parade. Except for last month's angry confrontation with correction officers and their union, his relationship with labor leaders has remained amicable. Contract negotiations that are likely to intensify over the next few weeks, though, will not only determine the future of that relationship but will also further define Mr. Dinkins's mayoralty - perhaps even more sharply than his largely successful grappling with a vast budget gap did earlier this year.
His challenge is to balance the diminishing but enduring concern in some quarters that he will profligately reward organized labor against the enduring but perhaps diminishing expectation among some workers that they will fare better in bargaining with a friendly administration - even one that inherited huge deficits, imposed $800 million in additional taxes and faces demands that it hire more police officers. 
''There aren't major philosophical differences between the parties,'' said Eric J. Schmertz, Mr. Dinkins's Commissioner of Labor Relations. ''The question is what can be afforded in this economic environment. Certain expectations are not going to be realized.''
Money is undeniably the dominant theme. Subplots include competition for primacy among some labor leaders, a rivalry that might work to the Mayor's advantage.
Barry Feinstein, whose Local 237 of the teamsters represents about 10,000 city employees, has been maneuvering to set the contract pattern by settling before Stanley Hill's District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which represents 140,000 workers, and Sandra Feldman's United Federation of Teachers. The cost of wages and benefits in the first contract reached often becomes a model for subsequent settlements.
Ms. Feldman bargains separately with the city's Board of Education, which faces a teacher shortage. Contracts with the teamsters and most other unions expired June 30; contracts with District Council 37 and the teachers run out Sept. 30.
Mr. Feinstein, Mr. Hill and Ms. Feldman endorsed Mr. Dinkins last year. Now, they hope to win as much as they can for their members without embarrassing the Mayor whom they helped elect.
During his campaign, Mr. Dinkins joined private hospital workers in pressing for higher wages. He briefly considered trying to get some teeth extracted from the state's Taylor Law, which prohibits strikes by public employees. Later, he appointed Mr. Schmertz, a mediator whom former Mayor Edward I. Koch had opposed as pro-union.
But Mr. Dinkins also took steps to demonstrate his moderation. And some fiscal conservatives were confident that, regardless of his political debt to organized labor, he would be constrained by the city's deteriorating fiscal condition. Even before the election, he acknowledged as much himself. ''You can't bargain away what you don't have,'' Mr. Dinkins told one union audience.
Officially, what Mr. Dinkins put aside this year was enough to finance a 1.5 percent wage increase, which nobody considers realistic. Each additional percentage point would cost the city roughly $100 million, which means that merely keeping pace with inflation, estimated this year at about 6 percent, could require about $450 million more than the Mayor has allocated. That too now seems unrealistic.
The last round of bargaining, under Mr. Koch, mostly produced three-year contracts with annual pay increases of about 5 percent. Initial contract costs can be reduced by delaying larger raises until later years. Firm agreement on productivity gains, whose savings are sometimes illusory, might satisfy outside fiscal monitors. Workers disappointed by proposed raises might be mollified by an empathetic Mayor's offer of benefits and seemingly arcane work-rule revisions, whose price might not be reflected immediately.
''It may well be that I'll have to tell some of my friends they cannot have the things they want,'' Mr. Dinkins told potential contributors from Wall Street last year. ''But they'll take it from me.''
New Yorkers are about to find out how he meant that.

HEADLINE: Holiday Blends Summer Into Fall, but Who's Ready?

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: POINT PLEASANT BEACH, N.J., Sept. 2

 BODY:
Already, the light fell differently on the ocean, itself churning and crashing with the fierceness of the fall hurricane season. Bathing suits and sandals were on sale for 50 percent off. College-bound waitresses and lifeguards were in short supply. The Giants edged out the Yankees in conversation.
As fireworks exploded over the moonlit beach Saturday night while a local orchestra belted out Tchaikovsky's ''1812 Overture,'' concertgoers huddled under sandy blankets for warmth. 
All in all, people reported that the summer was good to them. Charlie Fernandez, a 22-year-old teacher, saw the Grand Canyon, and Katie Balsam, 16, went to Eastern Europe, helping to renovate a Protestant church in Poland and toting home 10 chunks of the Berlin Wall.
Brian D'Zio, 17, asked out Melissa Vitale, 15, right before she took a swing in the batting cages on the boardwalk here, and at first she was hysterical with laughter but then she said yes. Andy Koenig, a 26-year-old lifeguard, with a Playboy-bunny pendant dangling from his gold chain, had the kind of summer a lifeguard should have. ''There's this one girl who's pretty much head over heels for me,'' he said.
Jeffrey Warrick stubbed his first toe, uttered his first words (light, daddy, dog) and chased his first wave. In July, 6-year-old Ames Tebele caught his first fish, a 16-inch fluke, which was ''the biggest one of the day that day,'' his father, Eddie, pointed out.
 
A Timelessness
In many ways, this could have been any Labor Day weekend in recent history. There was a timelessness in the squeals of children playing dare with the ocean, in the inward contentment of older women doing the crossword in the shade and the skillfulness of teen-agers playing Skee Ball in the arcades.
But hints that this weekend marked the climax of the Summer of 1990 on the Jersey Shore, and not the Summer of '42, flashed across Point Pleasant Beach.
Among the dozens of advertisements and bulletins tugged across the sky by seaplanes were ''Tax Revolt Rally in Trenton'' and ''Sort It Out Before U Set It Out - Recycle.'' Stuffed Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles and Bart Simpson dolls, the cartoon characters of the season, were the preferred prizes in game booths. Jerry Longo, 6, of Wanaque, N.J., convinced his father to put a dollar on the diamond in a game of chance 10 times so he could win Donatello, his favorite turtle. ''We have a whole Ninja trunk at home,'' his mother said.
 
'No One's Spending Money'
Bottled water, condoms and suntan lotion (No. 15) were the best sellers at the Ocean Avenue Deli, reflecting concern about drinking water, AIDS and the sun's ultraviolet rays. Though no pollution soiled the beach this summer, business was anything but brisk.
''There are a lot of people around, but no one's spending money with the shape of the economy,'' said Patricia Minovich, the delicatessen owner, adding that after Monday she would cut her newspaper orders back by 75 percent.
If anything put a sobering spin on the weekend's overall frivolity, it was the continuing conflict in the Persian Gulf. The concert Saturday was dedicated to peace in the Middle East.
In the afternoon on Saturday, as the wind picked up and members of the Orchestra of St. Peter by the Sea fastened sheet music to their music stands with clothespins, the conductor, the Rev. Alphonse Stephenson, explained why he chose Beethoven's Fifth Symphony as the centerpiece of that night's concert.
The symphony's opening notes, ''bom, bom, bom, booooom,'' are similar to the ''dot, dot, dot, dash'' of Morse code, for the letter V, used to symbolize victory in World War II. ''Peace is the ultimate victory,'' he said.
Thousands of people assembled on the beach in front of the stage in lawn chairs and on blankets as the sky turned from pale blue to deep lavender. Among them were June and Tom Price of Oakhurst, N.J., who were there with a dozen friends between the ages of 56 and 75, surrounding a silver-plated ice bucket and candelabra.
 
A Call From Oman
A month ago Friday, the Prices' 32-year-old son, Michael, an aircraft commander in the Air Force, left for the Middle East. A few days ago, they received a call from Oman - a package of Band-Aids, powder and oatmeal cookies had reached him.
Toward the end of the concert, the orchestra ran through the military airs of the various armed forces. ''When I heard the Air Force music,'' Mrs. Price said, ''I just wanted him home.''
For 20-year-old Justin Carroll of Easton, Pa., who prowled the boardwalk with two friends, the Persian Gulf crisis had cast the summer in an uncomfortable edginess. As he heard of tens of thousands of men his age going to distant, hostile sands, he was reminded of childhood's ephemeral quality.
''I'm kind of worried,'' said Mr. Carroll, a student at Long Island University. ''What happens after the reserves all leave? Then all those innocent men getting drunk and having a good time might have to go, too, and for something as trivial as oil.''
''Canada won't take you, and I don't know if I want to go to Mexico,'' he added, ''but I have a passport and I'm ready to leave.''
 
A Time for Patriotism
But the my-country-right-or-wrong brand of patriotism was in full bloom elsewhere, making the holiday feel more like the Fourth of July than Labor Day.
At the concert, a cherry-picker rose slowly behind the orchestra as the ''1812 Overture'' began, directing a spotlight on an American flag whipping in the wind on the beach. Red-white-and-blue bunting hung over the stage, and while the musicians swung into ''God Bless America,'' ''Stars and Stripes Forever'' and ''When Johnny Comes Marching Home'' during the fireworks finale, a faint chorus from the concertgoers grew louder.
With an American flag emblazoned on her T-shirt, hidden beneath the stars and stripes of her sweater, Barbara Ryan, 46, of Point Pleasant Beach, declared: ''I'm patriotic, that's it. I can't think of any other place on this earth I'd rather be.'' She meant both America and Point Pleasant Beach, where she has lived since 1955.
As she does on every Labor Day, she privately looked forward to the departure of the tourists whom she and many other natives call ''bennies,'' since they are at once beneficial to the area's economy and benefit from the area's invaluable natural resource -the ocean.
The tourists cause Point Pleasant Beach's year-round population of 6,000 to swell to 50,000 in the summer, bringing gridlock traffic to its narrow streets. ''After this weekend, we'll get our town back,'' she whispered, so that none of the bennies could hear.

HEADLINE: In Race for Comptroller, Rivals With Same Foe

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SCHENECTADY, N.Y., Sept. 2

 BODY:

 
Regan Is the Target
Both candidates are aiming their rhetorical fire at the Republican incumbent, Edward V. Regan, who is seeking a fourth term in the November general election. They portray him as ineffectual in his role as the chief fiscal officer of the state and unprepared, in Ms. Bellamy's words, for the ''tough times'' that the state is facing in an economic downturn.
The tepid primary campaign has drawn little public attention so far, perhaps in part because the responsibilities of the comptroller do not appear to be particularly well understood by the average voter.
''This is not the kind of office you dream about holding someday when you're a kid,'' Mr. Spano conceded. 
But if money is important, the comptroller has an important job. The comptroller not only acts as the chief fiscal watchdog for the state but also is the sole trustee of the $47 billion of assets in New York's public employee pension fund, one of the largest in the world.
 
A Reluctance to Attack
Mr. Spano has been reluctant to attack Ms. Bellamy, perhaps because several top Democratic officials are known to have warned him that they do not want to see her hurt for her expected contest against Mr. Regan. These officials have also told Mr. Spano that such actions might jeopardize their willingness to support him in future bids for office.
Another reason the race has remained so genteel has been the dearth of broadcast advertising. Mr. Spano seems to have little money for it, and Ms. Bellamy is clearly guarding her war chest for the general campaign against Mr. Regan.
Ms. Bellamy, who is on leave from her job as an investment banker with Morgan Stanley & Company, has gathered about $700,000 in contributions so far, according to filings with the State Board of Elections. Mr. Spano has collected $160,000, but his debts already outstrip the $30,000 in cash he has on hand. With polls showing Ms. Bellamy with greater name recognition than Mr. Spano, she is likely to benefit from the low-key nature of the primary campaign.
The Spano campaign did receive one shot in the arm last week, in an endorsement by The Amsterdam News, one of the most widely read newspapers among blacks in the New York metropolitan area. Ms. Bellamy, who ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 1985 after two terms as Council president, has been perceived as having overwhelming support in New York City.
The Amsterdam News editorial said the newspaper had the ''deepest respect and admiration'' for Ms. Bellamy, but said Mr. Spano had come down ''on the side of right and the N.A.A.C.P.'' during the controversy over desegregation in Yonkers.
 
Fiscal Experience
Ms. Bellamy, who is 48 years old, served as a state senator and Council president during New York City's fiscal crisis in the mid-1970's, experiences she stresses when she describes herself as someone who has ''been there'' in tough economic times.
Mr. Spano, 54, emphasizes his management and administrative skills as the Westchester County Clerk over the last eight years, as well as his background as a public-school teacher.
Both candidates say they favor establishing an official board, as opposed to the advisory panel now in place, to help decide on how to invest state pension funds. Both have also called for moves toward divesting the state's holdings of stocks in companies linked to South Africa.
Regardless of who wins, one important question is how fervently Gov. Mario M. Cuomo will work to help the Democratic nominee try to topple Mr. Regan.
Some state lawmakers have wondered whether Mr. Cuomo secretly prefers having a Republican comptroller to use as a foil against Democrats pushing him to increase spending for a variety of programs. Mr. Cuomo often invoked Mr. Regan's fiscal cautions this past year during a protracted struggle over the state budget, and he told reporters that Mr. Regan ''does not have a dishonest bone in his body.''
 
Other Questions
There are also questions about whether Mr. Cuomo, who is not noted for having a forgiving nature, has yet come to overlook the fact that Ms. Bellamy supported Mayor Edward I. Koch when he ran for governor in the 1982 Democratic primary against Mr. Cuomo.
Mr. Cuomo dismisses these questions as nonsense and says he is eager to see Democrats in top positions all over Albany.
There is also a theory afoot that many voters have simply become accustomed to the idea of a comptroller and a governor coming from opposing political parties; for example, Nelson A. Rockefeller, a Republican, had Arthur Levitt, a Democrat, looking over his shoulder as the Comptroller during Mr. Rockefeller's entire 15-year tenure as Governor.
Both Mr. Spano and Ms. Bellamy dismiss this concept, saying criticism of a Democratic governor from a fellow Democrat would carry more weight than criticism from a Republican, especially the incumbent Comptroller. Mr. Regan has been ''a flyweight, not a counterweight,'' said Jon Lukomnik, Ms. Bellamy's campaign manager.
 
Main Ammunition
The main ammunition for the Democratic nominee is expected to be the criticism Mr. Regan has received from many quarters, including the State Commission on Government Integrity, for systematically soliciting campaign contributions from Wall Street firms and others that do business with his office.
But that strategy could cut two ways. In response to reporters' questions after the half-hour television debate here Thursday, Ms. Bellamy found herself defending her own aggressive fund raising, including her acceptance of $38,000 from Carl C. Icahn, the corporate raider. That is the largest contribution to any statewide candidate this year.
''The issue is not taking the money,'' Ms. Bellamy said. ''The issue is the quid pro quo. And anybody who knows Carol Bellamy knows that's not the way I do business.''
Mr. Spano, meanwhile, said he ''might have a problem'' with accepting large contributions from people who do business with the comptroller's office. But, he added, appearing somewhat downcast, ''No one has offered me a large donation, so I don't have to face that problem.''

HEADLINE: New Jersey Spending Law Alarms Cities

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOBOKEN, N.J.

 BODY:
Other costs newly covered are those for liability insurance, recycling, water supply systems, police vehicles, equipment for 911 telephone emergency systems and mandated state and Federal programs.
 
Cuts in Services Anticipated
Local officials fear that the state's lumping of these costs into the portion of a municipal budget that can grow by only 5 percent will force cuts in other areas of the budget. Because the law is so new, few officials have started looking for savings yet. But they fear cuts are inevitable. 
Here in Hoboken, for instance, about $25 million of its $40 million budget for 1990 is exempt from the 5 percent ceiling. For the 1991 budget, Hoboken will have only about $7.7 million in exemptions, said Edwin J. Chius, Hoboken's Business Administrator.
Like his counterparts around the state, Mr. Chius is just starting to look for savings to comply with the new law. Most likely, he said, they will come from the Police and Fire Departments, which consume about 62 percent of Hoboken's budget.
''We'll lay some off if we have to,'' he said.
When the Governor signed the law on Aug. 20, he said it would help control homeowners' property taxes and put ''discipline and accountability back into the government vocabulary.'' The measure goes into effect Jan. 1, the same day that New Jersey's 567 municipalities begin their new budget year.
 
New Budgets in Doubt
Budget preparation has just started in most communities, and officials say they are still immersed in studying the fine points of the toughened ceiling law and thus unable to speculate, except broadly, about its impact.
Generally, they say, any property tax savings will most likely come at the expense of existing services, like police, fire and public works, unless the state increases aid to municipalities.
''If additional money is not forthcoming, it could have a catastrophic impact on health and welfare services,'' said William G. Dressel, assistant executive director of the New Jersey League of Municipalities, a lobbying group for the 567 municipalities. He foresaw ''a hue and cry not only from town officials, but the tax-paying public, because essential government services will have to be curtailed.''
Mr. Dressel and other league officials plan to meet with the Governor on Sept. 4 and appeal for more state aid and the restoration of some of the exemptions lost under the ceiling law.
 
Local Official Nettled
The Governor's second justification for the broader law - the need for local fiscal accountability - has rankled officials. Mr. Florio, a Democrat, signed the measure in Manchester, a retirement community in Ocean County, as the state intensified an investigation into fiscal mismanagement by a Republican administration. Local officials say the Governor's choice of Manchester as the bill-signing setting was unfair.
''It makes every town look like its fiscally imprudent,'' said James Davy, Town Manager in West Milford and president of the New Jersey Municipal Management Association, a group of town administrators. ''A cap law would not have prevented the type of fiscal impropriety that occurred there.''
Mr. Davy and other local officials complained bitterly about state policies and mandates that either reduce local revenues or force spending increases exceeding the ceiling law's 5 percent limit.
Former Gov. Thomas H. Kean siphoned off for state use millions in utility tax revenues once earmarked for municipalities, and Governor Florio has continued the policy, they say. Millions more in local school aid has been withheld by the state government in the last decade. Municipal costs for state health benefits have just gone up 25 percent, and the cost of pension plans for town workers has risen 20 percent, officials complain.
 
Garbage Costs Outpace Inflation
In the late 1980's the state shut regional landfills in North Jersey and ordered household garbage generated by about half the state's population shipped out of state, sending local taxes for garbage disposal soaring.
West Milford's annual garbage disposal budget has grown from $150,000 to $2 million in five years because of the state policy, Mr. Davy said. Dozens of other towns have had similar increases. Under the state's series of laws restricting local spending, first imposed in 1976, garbage costs were exempt from the 5 percent ceiling, but no longer.
''Items like garbage were outside the cap for good reason - they exceeded the inflationary index,'' said Borough Administrator Nicholas C. Saros in Ramsey, where the garbage disposal budget has jumped from $300,000 to $1.3 million since 1985. ''Nobody in the state has ever given us any long-range planning on what garbage costs will be.''
In neighboring Wyckoff, Borough Administrator Robert Shannon, has asked department heads to start examining their mandatory budget costs and their discretionary programs, like leaf collection, staffing for the Police and Public Works Departments, recreation, ballfield maintenance and activities for the elderly.
''I've asked them what discretionary programs can be affected without affecting quality of life,'' Mr. Shannon said.

HEADLINE: Johnson & Johnson Looks Abroad

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J.

 BODY:

 
Scrambling to Sell More
And as harried national health planners crack down on drug prices around the world, profits are squeezed and the companies must scramble to sell more.
The increasing attention to globalization in the industry can be traced at Johnson & Johnson through Hismanal, a non-sedating antihistamine that is the company's fastest-growing drug in the United States. The drug, discovered and developed at Janssen Pharmaceutica, the company's unit in Belgium, is now sold in 116 countries.
In the past, Johnson & Johnson often chose to license a drug to companies overseas in return for royalties that could be rather thin. In Japan, for example, Hismanal was licensed to the Mochida Pharmaceutical Company in 1985. But licensing drugs and the consequent diluting of profits is no longer the way to go. ''Today we would keep Hismanal,'' said Robert N. Wilson, a Johnson & Johnson vice chairman who heads the pharmaceuticals-diagnostics division. 
 
Joint Venture in Japan
Indeed, the company has chosen to sell new products through its own growing sales force abroad. Building a presence in Japan, Johnson & Johnson has acquired a majority stake in a joint venture with the Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Company, the ninth-largest Japanese drug company, to sell a half-dozen drugs now awaiting approval by the Japanese Government. The joint-venture company, Janssen-Kyowa, will have 300 to 350 salespeople by the end of the year, Mr. Wilson said, and will grow even bigger as new products are approved for sale there, to 500 to 1,000 salespeople. Johnson & Johnson has also added about 400 pharmaceutical salespeople in Europe in the last two years and more than 350 in the United States.
With its increasingly international sales force, the company is pushing new products through regulatory pipelines and into pharmacies in every major market faster than ever before.
Johnson & Johnson divides its global business into three parts: one-third is prescription products like Hismanal and oral contraceptives; about 40 percent is in consumer products like Tylenol and baby shampoo, and the rest is professional products sold mainly to hospitals. Half of the $9.8 billion in total sales in 1989 and 60 percent of the $1.5 billion in pretax profits were generated outside the United States. Worldwide sales were $5.66 billion in the first half of 1990, up 17.1 percent from the corresponding period a year ago. Pretax earnings were $902 million, down four-tenths of a percent, reflecting a write-off of $140 million on assets and operations in Latin America, primarily because of economic turmoil in Argentina.
 
No. 8 in Pharmaceuticals
Pharmaceuticals is Johnson & Johnson's most profitable and fastest-growing business. It is already the eighth-largest pharmaceutical company in the world, with $2.7 billion in drug sales last year.
Scientists at Johnson & Johnson's Belgian and American research laboratories are developing products the company hopes will help it break into the lucrative antibiotic and cardiovascular markets. Sixteen percent of drug revenues - or about $430 million - was plowed into pharmaceutical research and development last year. Johnson & Johnson has also joined with Merck & Company, the world leader in pharmaceutical sales, in a 50-50 venture to develop over-the-counter versions of Merck drugs.
The company's pharmaceutical research is divided equally between its Belgium-based Janssen unit and its Robert Wood Johnson Pharmaceutical Institute in the United States. Janssen, which was acquired in 1961, is a research powerhouse that has discovered 75 new drugs, perhaps more than any other pharmaceutical discovery group, since it was founded in 1953 by Dr. Paul A. Janssen.
 
Pressure to Roll Out Products
But the double-digit increases in the drug industry's research spending are intensifying the pressure to realize prompt returns by rolling out new products worldwide. ''Competing overseas makes the difference in reaching the break-even point on the financial curve,'' said Harvey E. Bale Jr., a senior vice president with the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, a trade group.
A breakthrough drug can cost at least $200 million and take 12 years to reach the market. Competing research companies, meanwhile, are quicker than ever in finding ways to improve important new drugs and grab a piece of the action.
''With computers and chemistry, scientists can go around patents much faster now,'' Mr. Larsen said. ''Within a year or two, you usually have somebody else right on your heels.''
At Merck, research is maintained in all the major therapeutic fields. ''When a breakthrough comes in science,'' said Dr. P. Roy Vagelos, Merck's chairman, ''you have to be ready to jump on it.''
 
Rankings in Three Markets
Although most major health-care companies are sharpening their global tactics, Johnson & Johnson is one of a handful big enough to sell its own products throughout the $130 billion worldwide pharmaeutical market. Merck was the only company to make the top 10 in drug sales last year in all three major markets: North America, Europe and Japan.
Johnson & Johnson was fifth in North America last year and 13th in Europe, and is coming up rapidly in Japan, where until recently its products were licensed out to Japanese companies.
The accelerating pace of global competition was one reason Merck cited when it recently announced a joint venture with E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company. They plan to build on Du Pont's drug research and Merck's development and marketing prowess in Europe and the United States.
 
Growth of Mergers
As the race speeds up, mergers and acquisitions have multiplied. Rhone-Poulenc S.A., a French chemical company, merged with the Rorer Group Inc. Hoffmann-La Roche, a unit of Swiss-based Roche Holdings Ltd., is buying control of Genentech Inc., a South San Francisco-based biotechnology company, for $2.1 billion. Beecham P.L.C. of Britain merged last year with the SmithKline Beckman Corporation, based in Philadelphia, to form SmithKline Beecham P.L.C. And the Bristol-Myers Company merged with the Squibb Corporation to become the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, second largest in world drug sales.
European companies will be increasingly looking for ways to expand in the United States as falling European trade barriers open their home markets to products from countries with lower production costs, like Greece, said Mary Jo Veverka, a vice president with the consulting firm Booz, Allen & Hamilton Inc.
''Globalization in pharmaceuticals is just beginning,'' said Norman C. Selby, a partner with McKinsey & Company, the management consulting firm. But he warns that medium-size American drug companies like the Schering-Plough Corporation and the Warner-Lambert Company's Parke-Davis Group may be swallowed up if they cannot grow big enough in global markets.

HEADLINE: Steel Unit Of USX For Sale

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH

 BODY:

 
Weakness in the Industry
But Mr. Corry said he did not expect such a sale to occur soon because of weakness in the industry.
From interviews with associates and institutional investors in touch with him since the high-pitched proxy battle with Mr. Icahn, Mr. Corry appears more than willing to do away with the steel division of a company known during most of its history as United States Steel.
These people say USX would probably sell the division to a large steel producer abroad or spin off the company in a public offering, retaining at most a small stake. The company would keep its vast oil-industry holdings. 
Analysts say that, besides British Steel, another possible purchaser is the Pohang Iron and Steel Company of South Korea, which operates a venture with USX in Pittsburg, Calif. Pohang officials have declined to comment on the matter, as did those of British Steel.
 
Divestiture Called Disruptive
When USX was fighting Mr. Icahn's proposal, Mr. Corry called a divestiture unecessary, disruptive and filled with negative tax implications.
Until the end of the year, USX has the benefit of millions of dollars in tax-loss carry-forwards from the days in which the company lost money in its steel business. The company is allowed to use past losses to reduce its tax liabililty.
Mr. Corry wanted the benefits to help reduce the tax liability of the entire corporation. But the benefit expires at the end of the year; after that, a sale of the steel division would not have an adverse tax impact.
Still, some analysts and investors wonder why the company is considering selling the steel operation. After the depression in the steel industry in the early 1980's, USX has been one of the nation's premier steel producers, leading the industry in profitability and efficiency.
In the second quarter, USX led the industry with operating profits of $28 a ton. The Inland Steel Company, with the next-best record, had an operating profit of $24 a ton, and the Bethlehem Steel Company, the nation's second-largest producer, posted $13.
After losing hundreds of millions of dollars during the downturn in the steel industry between 1982 and 1986, USX's steel business, after being slimmed down, went on to become the company's primary profit maker in 1988, providing $501 million in operating earnings, compared with $475 million from USX's energy businesses.
 
Concerns Over Outlook
But executives within USX question how long that can continue, saying that steel is a capital-intensive business requiring huge financial resources to remain competitive. Moreover, competition is intensifying from steel-producing countries that are working to develop technologies to cut production costs and operate in ways that are less environmentally hazardous.
USX's divesting itself of the steel division would greatly alter the competitive dynamics of the industry. If sold in a public offering, the steel unit could not then rely on the company's Marathon Oil or Texas Oil and Gas operations to provide cash when conditions in the steel industry worsened.
On the other hand, a sale to one of the foreign giants of the industry, with huge resources, would give the steel division significantly more financial muscle than its domestic competitors have.
Associates within USX said Mr. Corry thinks the steel operation will bring a better price when market conditions within the industry improve. Reflecting a downturn in the automotive and construction industries, steel prices have sagged since 1988, the industry's banner year. Flat-rolled sheet steel, a mainstay that goes into everything from appliances to automobiles, is now selling for about $360 a ton, compared with $410 a year ago.
Although efficiency has improved and costs have been cut, profits have fallen for the first half of the year throughout the industry.
''Right now, Chuck doesn't feel any strong pressure to do anything about the status of the steel business,'' said a USX executive, who insisted on anonymity. ''But when the conditions in the industry improve, which he expects to happen next year, look for something then.''
Mr. Corry did not discuss a sale during Mr. Icahn's challenge because ''he thought the timing was wrong,'' said Christopher Plummer, an analyst with the WEFA Group, an economic forecasting firm in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. ''The market was still heading downward during the Icahn situation. And USX would not be in the best position to sell assets.''
In his first year as chairman, Mr. Corry has been much less likely than his predecessor, David M. Roderick, to discuss the company with reporters. The longtime USX executive, 57 years old, was the chief architect of the company's turnaround in the mid-1980's and has long advocated bolstering the energy holdings.
The disposal of USX's steel business would complete a transformation that began in 1982, when the company bought the Marathon Oil Company. Four years later, USX bought the Texas Oil and Gas Corporation.
 
Moving Ahead After Icahn
With the battle against Mr. Icahn now behind him, Mr. Corry is concentrating on building the energy side of USX, saying that Marathon will be the centerpiece.
Although management prevailed in thwarting Mr. Icahn's proposal, executives within USX said the proxy battle made it clear that sympathy had grown for the central premise advocated by the New York investor: that the value of the company's stock would increase if USX were split and shares were issued in two separate companies.
''A spinoff would help to illuminate the values of the two parts,'' said Martin D. Sass, head of M. D. Sass Investors Service Inc., a money management firm that owns 647,000 shares of USX.
Mr. Icahn, who owns 33.9 million shares, declined to be interviewed for this article.
 
Contract Talks Set for Fall
USX, which now has a lower-cost labor contract than most of its competitors, faces what could be a difficult round of contract negotiations this fall. Most of the large steelmakers signed new contracts with the United Steel Workers a year ago -settlements that USX management says are too costly.
The United Steel Workers, whose agreement with USX expires in January, will soon begin fighting for an accord similar to those won at Bethlehem, Inland, Armco Inc. and the LTV Corporation.
''But once the contract talks are over and the market improves,'' said an institutional investor who insisted on not being identified, ''USX will begin to complete its transformation.''

HEADLINE: Uphill Test Is Predicted For the Dollar

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The dollar rallied some from its lows at the end of last week and closed on Friday at 1.5755 marks and 143.80 Japanese yen. But much of the buying was in a thin market and was done to prepare for the long Labor Day weekend; the gains could be quickly undone this week. And the rally still left the currency well below the levels before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
The first event that could move the dollar will be the testimony of Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, before the House Banking Committee on Sept. 13 and before the Joint Economic Committee on Sept. 19, when his topic will be the nation's economic outlook. 
Traders, portfolio managers, analysts and economists around the world will be listening for any hint of how the chairman wants the Fed to deal with its choices, which include easing interest rates to head off or soften a recession, standing pat, or raising rates to counter the inflationary shock from the oil-price increase. Higher rates would support the dollar.
But the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the American military response have created the biggest problems -and unknowns - for the dollar.
The jump in oil prices and the rise in military costs for American forces in the Persian Gulf have undermined hopes for a significant cut in the Federal budget deficit. At the same time, the costs have raised the estimates of the deficit for fiscal year 1991 substantially, pushing it toward the $300 billion range when counting the cost of the savings and loan bailout.
 
Difficult Budget Talks
The talks between the Bush Administration and Congress on the deficit have already been difficult, despite the President's decision to consider some tax increases. With higher oil prices, one possibility for a tax, an energy tax, seems less likely. And with the economy slowing or even entering a recession, tax increases will be very hard to get through Congress.
When the budget negotiations begin anew this month, the financial markets may be greatly disappointed. ''The thing that could precipitate a sharper drop of the dollar is if people lose confidence in American economic policy,'' said Nicholas Sargen, director of bond research at Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York.
Some jolts are also likely from abroad. After Oct. 3, the Bundesbank is expected by many analysts to be faced with annual inflation in the 3 percent range. The betting is that interest rates will be pushed higher, helping to slow the economy to fight inflation, to keep the mark strong and to attract foreign investment to help raise the capital that East Germany needs.
At the same time, the Japanese central bank, the Bank of Japan, will consider its next move on interest rates. It raised its official discount rate to 6 percent, from 5.25 percent, on Thursday, after interest rates in the markets rose to more than 8 percent.
In September, the bank will receive data on capital investment and the second-quarter gross domestic product, which it will weigh in deciding whether interest rates will have to be pushed higher. The expectation now is that they will move again.
 
Decline in Value
The moves would widen the differential in interest rates between the dollar and the foreign currencies, which will diminish the value of the dollar by attracting investors to the mark and the yen.
The dollar could get a lift from one unexpected area. Investors could still choose the dollar as a safe harbor if full-scale fighting broke out in the Persian Gulf. So far in the crisis, investors have fled to other currencies as havens. In fact, the dollar is weaker than before the invasion on Aug. 2.
 
Strong Start in 1988
In 1988, the dollar came into the autumn strong, bulging beyond the ceilings set for it by the United States and its economic allies in the Group of Seven. But concerns about the Government's inability to deal with the Federal budget deficit and uncertainty about George Bush, who was elected President that fall, pushed the dollar down by 4.3 percent against the mark and by 7.9 percent against the Japanese currency.
In 1989, the dollar again rallied in the summer and came into the fall with gusto. But at the meeting of the International Monetary Fund, the United States and its allies made clear that they thought the dollar was too strong. The West Germans raised interest rates, which weakened the dollar by diverting investors to the mark. Then American and foreign stocks dropped suddenly on Oct. 13, bringing the dollar lower.
The Berlin wall fell and Eastern Europe began opening up, attracting capital to Europe and weakening the dollar even further. By year's end, the dollar was down by 14.2 percent against the mark, although it managed to hold against the yen, dropping by only 1 percent.
The fall of 1986 was an exception, as the central banks moved to support the dollar because they thought it was falling too far too fast.
Now the autumn of 1990 is at hand, and the question is whether it will prove the exception or the rule.

HEADLINE: Washington's Mood Worries Detroit

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 2

 BODY:
Rising oil prices make passage of stricter fuel-economy standards more likely, although not inevitable, according to auto makers. The mere discussion of the idea worries them. For several years, American auto companies have relied heavily on the fat profit margins on full-size cars to buttress their dwindling earnings.
''Any time people get emotional, you can get a knee-jerk reaction that isn't thought through,'' said Joel Pitcoff, a sales and marketing analyst for the Ford Motor Company.
Japanese auto makers oppose the bill as well, but for a different reason. The bill proposes a gradual percentage increase in each company's fuel-mileage average. Since Japanese-made autos are already more fuel efficient than those of American companies, raising their fuel-economy levels by a set percentage would force them to attain a higher standard than their American competitors. 
The Persian Gulf crisis has also rekindled a longstanding public debate over who should bear the responsibility for reducing imports of oil.
Conservation and environmental groups supporting the Senate bill, which is sponsored by Richard H. Bryan, a Nevada Democrat, favor tightening efficiency standards for cars, which they believe will force auto makers to develop various energy-saving technologies. Fuel conservation was being urged by these groups even before the Iraq crisis as a way to alleviate global warming.
They point out that the current rules on fuel economy have not forced anyone to do without big or powerful cars, as some auto makers had predicted when the corporate-average fuel-economy standard was developed after the energy crisis in the early 1970's.
 
Opposition From the Auto Makers
The auto makers, with support from Administration officials, oppose a tighter Federal fuel-economy standard. Last month, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins introduced a ''short-term strategy'' for stabilizing oil markets by raising domestic production and encouraging conservation. He suggested that the Government should not bog down stabilization efforts by trying to revise the fuel-economy standard and other issues that are bound to involve lengthy debates.
For their part, auto makers contend that further big gains in energy efficiency are not possible without limiting the selection of cars that Americans have grown accustomed to having.
Yet, as long as gasoline remains relatively cheap and readily available, they argue, drivers will not buy highly efficient vehicles in great number. Indeed, fuel is now so cheap on a historical basis, when adjusted for inflation, that even the recent run-up in prices is not financially significant for most drivers, they say.
''Fuel prices have gone up only 15 to 20 cents a gallon, and the principal effect of that on car buying is short term,'' said George Eads, chief economist for the General Motors Corporation.
But analysts agree that much higher prices or a fuel shortage would sharply reduce sales of big cars.
Auto makers argue that if the nation wants to be less reliant on foreign oil, lawmakers should pass some type of energy tax to raise the price of fuel, which would in turn stimulate consumer demand for fuel-efficient vehicles. The industry has no consensus on precisely what type of regulation it wants, but an energy tax is not likely to win wide support in Washington.
The Chrysler Corporation and Ford support a tax specifically on gasoline, although Ford stipulates that the proceeds should be used to reduce the Federal budget deficit. G.M. has opposed a gasoline tax but favors a broader tax on all forms of energy. G.M. and Ford are both against increasing the corporate-average fuel- economy standard. Lee A. Iacocca, the chairman of Chrysler, is not, but he says an increase to 40 miles a gallon is too great.
Auto executives dismiss the argument sometimes advanced by conservation groups that the auto makers possess energy-saving technology but refuse to put it on the market because of the high cost of doing so.
''Everyone thinks there's something on the shelf we're withholding,'' said Edward Mertz, vice president in charge of G.M.'s Buick division. ''The problem is plain old physics. We would have to take cars out of production'' if fuel-efficiency requirements became too stringent.
 
Two-Ton Buick Roadmaster
Mr. Mertz was speaking on Tuesday in Novi, Mich., at the introduction of Buick's 1991 models. Among the new cars scheduled to appear in the coming year is the Buick Roadmaster, a two-ton behemoth that is bigger and heavier than most cars Buick has built in the last two decades.
The average fuel efficiency of new domestic cars increased sharply between 1980 and 1988, but has declined slightly in the last two years as consumers have chosen bigger cars. To improve fuel efficiency without sacrificing power or comfort, auto makers say, they must overcome many technical hurdles caused by the potential fuel-efficiency, safety and clean-air regulations, which are costly and often conflict with one another.
For example, safety devices like airbags are required by law but add weight and reduce fuel efficiency. Two-stroke engines generate more horsepower for their weight than four-stroke engines now in use in cars. But their emissions will not meet standards included in a proposed clean-air act now pending in Congress.
Martin Zimmerman, Ford's chief economist, said the cost of meeting higher fuel-efficiency standards, clean-air rules and other Federal regulations at the same time would be much more expensive than if the standards were met separately.
 
Not Enough Engineers
Richard Donnelly, the head of G.M.'s engine division, said he could not find enough engineers and scientists with the necessary skills to work on the various regulatory projects.
Still, many weapons remain in the industry's fuel-efficiency arsenal. G.M. says the average fuel efficiency of its cars has improved 130 percent since the mid-1970's, and Mr. Mertz of Buick believes the improvements will continue, albeit at a reduced pace, as engineers take pounds off various components by developing lighter materials.
Thomas Kowaleski, a Chrysler spokesman, said the auto maker produces about 300,000 four-cylinder engines a year but could triple that number if the demand increased. ''We're working on projects like the two-stroke engine, but we want to make sure technology is perfected before we introduce it,'' he said.
''No one wants to have trouble merging on interstates,'' he said, referring to the problems that many cars had in the early 1970's when clean-air requirements led to engines that did not work well or provide much acceleration.
Much of the theoretical basis for Senator Bryan's bill - which assumes that auto makers can come up with technical answers for problems of efficiency without radically changing how cars perform - comes from Deborah Bleviss, executive director of the International Institute for Energy Conservation.
 
'No One Wonderful Technology'
Ms. Bleviss, a physicist by training, argued in a book published in 1988 that technologies like two-stroke engines, lighter-weight materials, electronic engine controls and continously variable transmission - a high-efficiency replacement for automatic transmission - hold great promise.
''There's no one wonderful technology'' that would enable auto makers to average 40 miles a gallon, she said. ''When Detroit says the two-stroke engine can't meet emissions requirements, you have to take that with a grain of salt. It's in Detroit's interest to say that.''
But Ms. Bleviss said a stringent fuel-economy standard must be accompanied by other laws to dampen demand for fuel, as well as by Government-sponsored research to help with the burden of developing new technologies. Rather than an energy tax, she said, she leaned toward auto registration fees on a sliding scale based on the vehicle, and sales taxes that provide an incentive for fuel efficiency.
David Cole, a professor at the University of Michigan in charge of transportation studies, says auto makers would have trouble ''technically and financially'' in meeting a 40-mile-a-gallon standard.
''With energy ridiculously cheap, there are still questions as to whether customers would accept vehicles that would satisfy this law,'' Mr. Cole said. ''They just might decide to get themselves new politicians.''

HEADLINE: Savings Units' Boards Hurt by U.S. Suits

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 2

 BODY:
''It is almost impossible to find new directors,'' said Brian Smith, executive vice president of the United States League of Savings Institutions, the industry's largest trade group.
''The first line of defense is the quality of directors and managers,'' he said. ''And to the extent it is more difficult to get sophisticated business judgment on the board of an institution, you can have a perverse return to the very condition regulators are concerned about - domination by a single chairman of the board or group of officials whose actions go unchecked.''
Federal regulators disagree that their actions will have a negative impact on the industry. They say they are simply pursuing every channel they can to reduce the cost of the savings and loan rescue, and that holding directors accountable will lead to stronger management. 
Armed with vast new powers from the savings and loan bailout law, regulators can impose civil penalties of up to $1 million a day covering periods in which directors and officers are deemed to have violated banking laws. While the regulators say their new-found toughness is meant to fulfill their responsibilities to recover the maximum amount of money lost by failed institutions because of mismanagement, they add that it also serves to put directors on notice that they must take their responsibilities seriously.
''I want to be sure that everyone who bears responsibility for losses are paying what they ought to pay,'' said Mark I. Rosen, Deputy General Counsel for the F.D.I.C.
F.D.I.C. officials say they have recovered $300 million this year from failed financial institutions.
The agency will soon file its most notable case, a $200 million negligence suit against Neil Bush, the President's son, for his role in the $1 billion collapse of the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association in Denver.
 
Worries Over Insurance
The Federal litigation is worrying insurance industry officials, who say the regulators' actions could drive them out of the business of underwriting director and officer liability policies. Moreover, they say that the price of the policies, particularly for smaller banks, is soaring, and that a growing number either cannot get coverage or cannot afford it.
But these officials are primarily concerned that the Government is looking to the insurance industry as a source of capital to pay some of the cost of the savings and loan rescue.
''Everyone wants to reduce the loss and is looking for all of the assets they can recover, so they say, 'Why not go after the insurance industry?' '' said Richard Cartland, president of Executive Risk Management Associates, a unit of the Aetna Life and Casualty Company that specializes in director and officer liability insurance. ''But we are not a utility that can be used as a backup to the deposit insurance funds.''
It is primarily the insurance companies that end up paying the most in successful suits brought by the F.D.I.C. In one case this year, the agency won a $70 million settlement from an insurance company.
 
A Different Era
Being a director of a bank or savings and loan association in the climate of stable interest rates and modest inflation of the 1960's was once an easy task that required a modicum of attention at monthly board meetings. Most outside directors came from the ranks of local business executives and boards were largely rubber stamps for the decisions of management.
''Often, when I would go on bank closings, I would talk to directors and they would say, 'Gosh, I didn't even attend the meetings. I just voted the way we were supposed to vote,' '' said one regulator who insisted on not being identified.
But inflation and interest rates began to gyrate in the mid-1970's, just as the Government removed many of the restrictions on banks' activities. The complexities of banking caught many in management by surprise. Not only did entire institutions turn sour, but so did the lives of many of their outside directors.
 
One Director's Story
Richard O. Jacobs, a lawyer with Riden, Earle & Kiefner in St. Petersburg, Fla., is perhaps typical.
As part of a team of local business executives who founded the Park Bank of Florida in the Tampa Bay area in the late 1970's, Mr. Jacobs was a director who watched the institution grow into a $500 million bank, one of the state's largest.
He said he trusted the management, knew them and had little indication that anything was wrong until early 1986, when the bank began to collapse from bad real estate loans. In the end, the failure created a $300 million loss for the F.D.I.C., and Mr. Jacobs, along with the other directors, was eventually sued by the agency for $30 million.
Mr. Jacobs said his personal loss from the failure and ensuing litigation was $3 million, that legal fees in just the F.D.I.C.'s case totaled $2 million and would have been double that had the bank's insurance company not agreed to settle.
 
A New Reality
The new powers given to regulators last year by the savings and loan bailout legislation are slowly making banking officials adjust to new realities. Though the agencies do not impose stiff penalties often, simply having the authority has intimidated many in the industry, some bankers said, making many directors wonder if it is worth the risk of serving on boards.
Regulators and banking industry experts counter that there is a way for bank directors to protect themselves: become more involved in the workings of the bank, spend more time reviewing the organization's operations, object publicly when problems arise and even resign or inform regulators of the problems.
 
An Educational Campaign
The industry has begun an aggressive educational campaign, warning directors that they need to spend more time familiarizing themselves with the banking business.
Mr. Jacobs has proposed that directors be required to pass a test demonstrating that they understand banking, and Representative Chalmers P. Wylie, Republican of Ohio, introduced legislation earlier this summer that would require the regulatory agencies to establish mandatory educational programs for bank directors.
But many experts agree that much depends on the willingness of the insurance industry to continue underwriting director and officer policies. The industry is concerned because the regulators have sought to hold insurance companies liable for damages even when their policies have stated that cases brought by regulators are not covered.

''Because of the Labor Day holiday in New York, many people don't know what sort of attitude to take to the market,'' said Daniel Marull, a trader at Sanyo Securities here. ''We had good volume for the past four days, but it will be very weak today.'' 
The Nikkei index of 225 issues gained 60.55 points, or less than one-half a percent, to end the morning session at 26,038.92. In the first 10 minutes of trading, the index rose 121.30 points, to 26,099.67. The Nikkei in gained 308.41 points on Friday.
In other trading, the dollar opened lower against the yen, the Swiss franc and the British pound, but unchanged against the West German mark. Dealers expected quiet trading because the New York markets are closed for the Labor Day holiday.
The dollar opened at 143.40 yen and 1.5760 marks after closing at 143.75 and 1.5760, respectively, in New York on Friday. The dollar had ended trading here on Friday at 144.50 yen and 1.5635 marks.
Dealers here are focusing on how the United States Federal Reserve and the West German Bundesbank will react to last week's three-quarters of a percent rise in the Bank of Japan's discount rate, to 6 percent.
Some dealers said they expect the Fed to ease its Federal funds rate this week. The Bundesbank's regular council meeting is scheduled to be held on Thursday.

HEADLINE: 'Micro Bankers' Help The Poor Make Money

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:

 
Looking for Investors
Its founder and chairman, Anthony Stevens, a Harvard business school graduate, said he hoped Micro Enterprise could turn a small profit in a couple of years.
To do that, Mr. Stevens said, the company must prove it can make money by lending to grass-roots entrepreneurs - the seamstress who cannot afford a sewing machine or the fence builder who needs shovels.
''We're stepping into it fairly carefully at this point, but it is considerably more than a hobby,'' said Mr. Stevens, who is on leave from Citicorp, where he was vice president of the private banking division. ''This is, for me, the most important thing in my life.'' 
Mr. Stevens is handling much of the work himself at no pay.
 
Other Micro Banks
Nonprofit micro banks have had success making loans that traditional banks might consider too risky. In Chicago, the Full Circle Fund, had 100 percent repayment on the 24 loans it granted in the last 18 months. In Canada, the First People's Fund said it had not had a default on any of its 120 loans since 1987. The fund serves three Indian reservations in Ontario. In North Carolina, Arkansas and South Dakota, similar projects appear to be working. And on the Cherokee Nation reservation in Tahlequah, Okla., officials are also starting a micro-lending agency.
But some experts say there is little evidence that such a bank can make money.
''It's only in the realm of hope right now,'' said Jeffrey Ashe, a micro-lending expert in Boston who is planning micro banks in New Hampshire, Vermont and Massachusetts. ''You've got to have some social vision for doing this. This is not the best way to make money - making thousands of tiny loans.''
Scores of micro banks have had success bolstering the economies of villages in poor countries throughout the third world.
But ''it's very easy to pick a success story and say this is the answer,'' said David Fredrick, a specialist on Bangladesh at the State Department's Agency for International Development. ''That's not to say it's not a good thing, but its relative utility in the U.S. might not be that important.''
 
Bank Started With a $6 Loan
Like many micro banks, Micro Enterprise is modeled after the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, which was begun 13 years ago with a $6 loan from the founder's pocket. It now lends more than $6 million a month.
Like the Grameen Bank, Micro Enterprise is starting small, seeking a 1 percent return on its original investment of about $30,000. Mr. Stevens said he believed the bank could attract additional investors once it shows itself to be a profitable enterprise.
If the bank can attract 300 borrowers and a return of about $150 in interest for each $1,200 loan, Mr. Stevens said the company could afford a 2 to 3 percent default rate and still turn a small profit.
Micro Enterprise is trying to keep overhead to a minimum. The company operates out of rent-free offices in a law firm. Advertising is primarily word of mouth. For every 300 borrowers, the company plans to hire a loan officer who will be paid about $20,000 a year. The company predicts it will issue 25 more loans by this winter, bringing to 27 the number of loans in its portfolio. Eventually, it hopes to accept deposits.
 
Use of Peer Pressure
Central to Micro Enterprise is an element common to all micro-lending agencies - peer pressure. While loans are made to individual entrepreneurs, each person is in a group of four or five who are in line for similar loans. If one person fails to pay on time, loans for the whole group are jeopardized.
''We tried doing individual loans for micro projects, but it was a disaster,'' said Gerald Sherman, executive director of the Circle Banking Project of the Lakota Fund, which serves the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in Kyle, S.D. ''We had a 100 percent delinquency at one point with the individual loans. Now it's about 1 percent.''
In addition to help from their lending groups, borrowers at Micro Enterprise receive training in budgeting, finance and marketing. Of 100 people who sought loans last year, Mr. Stevens said, only five completed the three-month series of courses. Those who do not complete the courses cannot receive loans.
''We think that even very small people should have access to capital,'' said Mr. Stevens, whose tiny company has three other partners. ''If they're willing to put in the effort, that's the equity - their willingness to come in and learn and commit their time and emotional energy.''
 
Loans vs. Welfare
Some critics, however, say group lending programs alone will not provide enough help for the poor.
''Are we creating working poor who are going to be self-employed and not be much better off than they were on welfare?'' asked Coralee Smith Kern, the editor of Cottage Connection, a newsletter for small-business owners.
The critics note that welfare at least provides medical care.
Alex Counts, who spent a year studying with Muhammad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank, agrees that medical care is important. ''But,'' he said, ''I think you need to ask the question: Does it make no difference if someone is working in a fledgling business just above poverty but still has the dignity of owning one's own business?''

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
Hopes Fade as Output Of Oil Lags in China

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HONG KONG

 BODY:

 
'Severest Financial Crisis'
''All of the energy industry, including oil, is facing the severest financial crisis in the history of Communist China,'' said David G. Fridley, a research associate who covers China's energy industry at the East-West Center in Honolulu. Mr. Fridley estimates that every Chinese oilfield is running a financial deficit and in 1989 those losses totaled 3.9 billion yuan, or $830 million, a 3,000-fold increase since 1986.
Part of the industry's poor showing has to do with China's domestic oil prices, which have been so low that there is hardly any money to pay for oil development. Mr. Fridley said that adjusted real prices had dropped to about $2.05 a barrel, from a base price in 1980 of $9.14.
When China opened its economy to Western companies nearly a dozen years ago it was hoping foreigners would help tap its supposedly huge oil reserves. American oil companies were among the first commercial adventurers in China, and not only did they come with enthusiasm but also with patience, a willingness to take risks and deep pocketbooks. #33 Contracts Signed According to the United States-China Business Council, American oil companies have so far signed 33 contracts worth $1.09 billion, or about a quarter of all American contractual investments in China. 
While eager for such funds, Chinese leaders were also caught in a battle between pride and practicality. Many realized that exploration and development could best be done with foreign help, but they also thought that as a matter of national honor the foreign role should be tightly circumscribed. The result was that while foreign companies were allowed to offer technical services, they were confined mainly to offshore sites, where exploration is expensive, if they wanted to drill themselves.
The Government had high hopes for offshore drilling, but there now appears little likelihood of meeting its goals, which called for increasing oil production fivefold from 1990 to 1992, to 36.5 million barrels. The Government also opened parts of southern mainland China to foreign exploration, but Western oil companies have expressed little interest in those areas.
''Foreign euphoria for China's offshore potential has evaporated somewhat because there has been no significant find,'' said a Western oil executive who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. ''China is not in the same league as Saudi Arabia, Iraq or Iran.''
 
Opening of Areas Awaited
Most oil companies are waiting for China to open new areas, particularly in the western hinterlands of Xinjiang Province. Geological formations in the Tarim Basin, a huge desert where the temperature rises above 120 degrees, suggest oil reserves that could be in the billions of barrels. The Chinese are already extracting oil from the Karamay fields in Xinjiang, and they recently completed drilling 24 exploratory wells in a promising area of the Tarim Basin, according to the official China Petroleum News.
So far, despite the financial pressures, Chinese leaders have not welcomed foreign risk capital to Xinjiang. For a small number of companies, the waiting has been ameliorated by modest discoveries of oil.
For instance, the Amoco Corporation is negotiating a production contract for a fairly sizable oilfield it discovered in 1987, and although it will have to descend 1,000 feet to extract the oil, the company is enthusiastic enough to have signed another contract last month to explore another site.
 
New Consortium Formed
And this month, Chevron and Texaco will start production under a consortium they have formed with an Italian concern, AGIP, and a Chinese partner. In a few months, they expect to be filling 20,000 barrels a day, which is expected to grow to 60,000 by 1992. By comparison, China's largest oilfield, at Daqing, produces more than a million barrels a day.
''For us, it's not significant, but for the Chinese it is,'' said Edward C. Chow, manager of Chevron's Beijing office. The new production will be the first major well operated by a foreign consortium in the South China Sea.
''That's the game we play,'' he added. ''But in order for the Chinese to retain the interest of the international petroleum industry, they need to open up more areas for foreigners.''
Some companies have successfully pursued other directions in the energy business. ARCO and its partners have discovered significant natural gas reserves near Hainan Island in the south, and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group is evaluating the feasibility of building a large refinery in southern China.
 
Overtures Generally Resisted
But the Chinese have generally resisted overtures from foreigners to help extend the life of the country's existing oilfields, notably at Daqing. The virtue of self-reliance is often still referred to as the ''spirit of Daqing,'' from a campaign in the 1960's when the Chinese insisted upon devloping the large oilfield on their own.
The result is that China's oil production has leveled off. After nearly a decade of steady incremental increases, Chinese officials say oil production this year is expected to remain flat, at about 2.8 million barrels a day.
''The mature fields are basically showing a mature phase,'' said a Western oil specialist who insisted upon anonymity. ''It's a plateau situation that may last for a while.''
 
Heavy Reliance on Coal
China relies heavily on coal, and oil represents only about 18 percent of its energy consumption, according to statistics of the British Petroleum Company. Moreover, China is still a net exporter of crude oil and for the most part is likely to be insulated from an oil crisis stemming from events in the Middle East, Chinese oil executives said.
But as China's economy expands and as it raises its capacity to refine oil, China's imports of crude oil will rise. Many industry specialists believe that if such a trend is allowed to continue, China could become a net importer by the mid- to late-1990's.
''Financial and economic pressure is what's going to lead them to say, 'O.K., guys, come in and help us develop the Western oilfields,' '' said Mr. Fridley of the East-West Center.
 
Exports Down 5.9 Percent
The statistics are already sending out a warning. Exports of crude oil for the first half of this year dropped by 5.9 percent from the comparable period last year, to 418,000 barrels a day, while imports from overseas to non-producing areas rose 140 percent, to 77,000 barrels a day, according to Chinese statistics.
''We all see China importing oil in the latter 1990's because there will be a lack of oil,'' said Donald Clift, manager of the Beijing office of British Petroleum, which has invested more than $150 million in oil exploration in China.
''Even if you started right now, there isn't time enough to get everything going by the mid-1990's,'' he added. ''The dilemma China will find itself in is that if its economy is going to continue to grow, even at a modest rate, there needs to be an increasing amount of imports. The question is: Can it afford oil imports? Can it not afford them?''

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
Polish Arms Makers Adjust to Peace

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOLECHOWO, Poland

 BODY:
The economic forces that pushed Pressta into new lines of business are buffeting the world's arms industry, particularly companies in Eastern Europe that earned hundreds of millions of dollars in the 1980's selling to the countries of the Warsaw Pact and to combatants of various political stripes. Polish officials now disclose that their customers even included members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Those markets have largely collapsed. Despite the military moves in the Persian Gulf, the number of nations that are buying weapons has dropped significantly. In addition, the reshaping of the superpowers' military strategy in Europe - from an offensive to a defensive posture - has created surpluses of weapons both in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. 
 
Tough Times for Arms Sales
''Forget about what is happening now with Iraq,'' said Samuel Cummings, the president of Interarms, a company that arranges weapons deals from offices in Britain and Alexandria, Va.. ''It is a terrible time for the arms business, East and West.'' For instance, Mr. Cummings estimates that Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union have 40,000 surplus tanks.
The public stances taken by the countries on this issue reflect their differing viewpoints. In Czechoslovakia, for example, the Government of President Vaclav Havel says its decision to withdraw from the arms business was a matter of morality. But here in Poland, officials see it as a straightforward example of the sort of market economics they are trying to foster.
Figures for tank production in Poland illustrate how much the world's geopolitics has shifted. The Bumar-Labedy factory, which makes all of Poland's tanks, has trimmed its output from 250 annually in 1986 to 100 this year; only 30 are expected to be produced in 1991.
Separately, officials at the Ministry of Trade disclosed that it was now unclear whether Poland would ever manufacture large quantities of a jet fighter-trainer, the I-22, which had been intended to raise hard currency through sales to third world nations.
 
Exports Decline
The latest Government estimates predict that Poland will realize only 55 to 57 percent of a projected $2 billion in military sales to the West for the years 1986 to 1990. Exports to the Soviet Union and Eastern European neighbors will be off 25 percent for the same period, the Government said.
Ryszard Jankowski, the director of the Bumar-Labedy tank factory in the southern region of Silesia, said his company was struggling to remake itself. Bumar has produced civilian products like heavy construction cranes for years, but the bulk of its profits came from the sale of tanks.
Mr. Jankowski estimated that tank purchases by the Polish Army had shrunk to one-fourth the levels of 1986. A Polish official disclosed that the factory had dozens of unsold T-72 tanks, and he said the problem had persisted even after the asking price was sliced to less than $1 million, from $1.3 million.
''Our exports have radically decreased,'' Mr. Jankowski said. ''This year, it's mostly the production of spare parts and a few sub-systems. There is much lower demand among the post-Socialist countries.''
He added, ''The Germans, for example, won't be buying anything; soon they'll have Leopards,'' a reference to the West German battle tank.
Mr. Jankowski said his company now uses a glossy English-language brochure to promote sales of the T-72 tank. Earlier versions were written only in Russian. He declined to identify any of the countries to which he is marketing the tanks, but told a visiting reporter: ''If you can find a good customer, we can discuss the commission.''
 
Salaries of $100 a Month
The 9,500 workers at Bumar-Labedy are feeling the pinch. Just a few years ago, they were among the highest paid in Poland. Now, they earn the national average, a little more than $100 a month. Mr. Jankowski said 1,000 jobs had been eliminated through attrition, but he added he hoped to forestall further layoffs by generating new civilian business.
Mr. Jankowski said the company wanted to expand civilian lines, like the production of construction cranes, as well as develop new ideas, such as a cooperative venture with the Soviet truck maker Kamaz or the possible manufacture of a West German-designed tractor under license.
In its best years, Mr. Jankowski said, the factory earned tens of millions of dollars. Until now, he insisted, it has received no Government subsidies. Mr. Jankowski said the tank production lines would be kept open, even at a loss, because Poland must retain the ability to make its own weapons.
The conflict in the Middle East offers no respite for the Polish arms industry. Poland's Parliament recently passed laws barring military sales to any nation involved in a war or terrorism. Even before the United Nations voted to impose an economic embargo of Baghdad, Iraq had been added to the list of countries.
 
Iraq Had Been a Customer
Iraq had been a leading customer for Poland, buying hundreds of millions of dollars in arms. Many of Baghdad's most sophisticated Soviet-designed tanks, the T-72's, were made in Poland.
Stanislaw Amanowicz, a senior official in the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations, said 30 to 50 percent of the country's annual earnings from the arms trade had come from Baghdad, which had paid for $500 million in past purchases with oil deliveries. Those shipments have been halted by the United Nations sanctions.
Under the Communist Government, Poland pursued what could be called an eclectic policy that seemed more motivated by profits than ideology. A Polish official disclosed in a recent interview that Polish-made tanks were secretly sent to both Iran and Iraq during their eight-year war.
Jan Majewski, the Deputy Foreign Minister, said none were sent directly to Teheran, but added that ''I wouldn't exclude such a possibility'' of their having been transferred from other countries to Iran.
It was disclosed during the Iran-contra investigations that Poland secretly sold weapons to the Nicaraguan rebels, backed by the United States, that were fighting to overthrow the Sandinista Government.
Mr. Majewski said he was startled recently by a list of countries to which Polish manufacturers sold military equipment in 1989, the last year of Communist rule. It included Western countries like Britain, Finland, Austria and Belgium, he said.

HEADLINE: Congress Returning to Its Tasks With No Sign of Budget Accord

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 3

 BODY:
Hundreds of thousands of furlough notices have been sent to employees of Federal agencies planning for automatic cuts if Congress does not meet its mandated deficit targets, and many members predict that Congress will have to return for its first post-election session since 1982.
In The Times/CBS News Poll, only 31 percent of the 1,422 adults interviewed by telephone from Aug. 16 to 19 said there was a serious effort to reduce the deficit; 59 percent said there was not, an increase of five percentage points from the previous survey in May.
 
Blame for Lack of Progress
Aside from the 35 percent who blamed Congressional leadership for the lack of progress, 7 percent blamed the President and 14 percent blamed both the leadership and the President.
The survey also found that 44 percent did not approve of the way Congress handled its job, and significant numbers said they believed that many lawmakers were financially corrupt. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. 
Representative Thomas S. Foley of Washington, the House Speaker, and Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader, said the finger-pointing at Congress was taking place because Presidents, by the nature of their office, are better able to rally public support, especially at times of international crisis.
But in interviews over the weekend, both leaders insisted that the turmoil over the gulf and the economy would complicate, but should not cripple, the budget negotiations.
Cuts in military spending for the fiscal year 1991 may not be as deep as planned, they said, because of the Middle East mobilization. Even so, with the reduced tensions among superpowers, there was still plenty of room to trim the military budget over the next five years, they said.
''The Middle East is a new and central reality, and it will affect the budget talks to some degree,'' Mr. Foley said. ''But it would be a mistake for us to abandon all efforts to deal with the deficit now.''
 
'Heightened Sense of Urgency'
Mr. Mitchell said the Middle East hostilities had created ''a heightened sense of urgency'' about the budget. But he added, ''I don't want to minimize the difficulties.''
Senator Jim Sasser, a Tennessee Democrat who is chairman of the Budget Committee, said the Middle East crisis ''certainly gives the opponents of any reduction in defense spending a psychological leg up.''
The Democratic leaders are already seeking to pre-empt such moves.
''It's obvious that the Administration will use the crisis to minimize any reduction in defense spending,'' Mr. Mitchell said. While some additional spending will be required, he said the Middle East hostilities ''confirm the view that the Administration is placing too much emphasis on strategic and nuclear weapons.''
Still, Democrats and Republicans have remained solidly behind Mr. Bush's gulf initiatives, and the public backs that position. So much so, in fact, that 43 percent said in the Times/CBS News Poll that they would pay higher taxes to help protect Saudi Arabia and resist Iraqi aggression.
 
Hearings on Gulf Crisis
The House returns from its recess on Wednesday and the Senate comes back on Sept. 10. But hearings on the gulf begin this week, with testimony from Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, and budget talks are to resume Friday at Andrews Air Force Base south of Washington and are scheduled to run through the weekend.
Mr. Bush has the authority to protect the gulf operations from automatic budget cuts that are set to occur Oct. 15 under the budget-balancing law, according to Administration and Congressional budget officials.
But Congressional and Administration officials said a budget agreement was critical. ''Federal employees are now starting to show up and say, 'What about these furlough notices?' '' Mr. Sasser said. ''They're very concerned.''
''I see us going back right after the election,'' said Representative John P. Murtha, a Pennsylvania Democrat and chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, of the prospect of a lame duck session. ''We'll work right up to Christmas trying to get this whole thing resolved.''
A post-election session would also allow the Senate to join the House in doing what most of its members were afraid to do, especially before Election Day: vote itself a pay rise.
The Times/CBS News Poll found that 70 percent said they would be less likely to vote for their member of Congress if he or she voted for a raise. Forty-two percent said they would be less likely to vote for a member who received contributions from a savings-and-loan institution, and 46 percent said they would be less likely to vote for a member who opposed capital punishment.
 
Issues Before the Senate
The Senate has the added business of a possible confirmation battle over Judge David H. Souter, the Supreme Court nominee, in hearings that are scheduled to begin Sept. 14, and ethics committee investigations of six senators accused of improperly using their offices to help political or financial supporters.
Most people have not yet formed an opinion of Judge Souter, the Times/ CBS survey says. The majority, 70 percent, said they had not heard enough about Judge Souter to have an opinion; 12 percent had a favorable view; 5 percent unfavorable, and 13 percent were undecided.
The survey, conducted several weeks after the reprimands of Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachussetts, and Senator Dave Durenberger, Republican of Minnesota, on charges of ethical misconduct, found a rising concern about lawmakers' ethical behavior.
Forty-six percent said that in the last 10 years, the standards of ethics in government had got worse; 33 percent gave that response in a January 1989 survey. In addition, more than 40 percent say they believed that at least half the members of the House and Senate were financially corrupt. Seventeen percent said most members are financially corrupt, 25 percent said about half, 40 percent said some and 10 percent said hardly any.
Although most people have a higher regard for their own lawmakers than they do of Congress at large, 16 percent said they believed that their own representative in the House is financially corrupt, while 62 percent said not corrupt. Nineteen percent said at least one senator from their own state was corrupt, while 62 said that was not the case.
 
Discontent Over Congress
The survey also showed continuing public discontent over the general performance of Congress. Forty-four percent of those surveyed said they did not approve of the way Congress handled its job, while 40 percent did approve. Sixty percent approved of the way their own representative handled his or her job and 21 percent did not approve.
But 40 percent said a new person should get a chance to represent their district in Congress, and 43 percent said their representative deserved to be re-elected.
Before the election, however, Congress will somehow have to do its business under the cloud of turmoil in the Middle East, an unstable economy and uncertain relations with the White House.
''This Congress has reached the point where it could in September accomplish enough that it would be a reasonably average Congress in terms of outputs of legislation and dealing with major problems,'' said Norman Ornstein, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. ''Or it could be the least productive in modern memory.''
 
How the Survey Was Conducted
The New York Times/CBS News Poll was based on telephone interviews conducted from Aug. 16 to Aug.19 with 1,422 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. The numbers were then screened to limit calls to residences.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of residential telephone lines and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the re-sults based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
The percentages reported are the particular results most likely to match what would be obtained by seeking out all adult Americans. Other possible percent=ages are progressively less likely the more they differ from the reported results.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for either Democrats or Republicans or independents it is plus or minus five percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
Evacuation of Hostages Is Stalled As Iraqis Prohibit Foreign Flights

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Sept. 3

 BODY:
The weekend flights proceeded after President Saddam Hussein announced last week that foreign women and children were free to leave. Thousands of Western men remain in Iraq and Kuwait - detained as hostages, in hiding, or keeping a low profile - as Iraq's confrontation with Western and other nations continues over its Aug. 2 seizure of Kuwait, With security and living conditions reportedly worsening in Kuwait, Western and Asian diplomats were pressing today for the evacuation of several thousand foreign women and children still unable to leave the Iraqi-occupied country.
Besides having to negotiate transportation for American, European and Japanese women and children, the diplomats face the daunting task of locating people who are in hiding in a ghostly city, sliced into sub-sectors by military checkpoints, and patrolled by squads of soldiers.
Western diplomats and people arriving in Baghdad in the last few days from Kuwait after a 14-hour bus ride through the desert have reported that soldiers are searching house to house for weapons and foreigners.
''At first it was sort of detention by convenience,'' one diplomat said. ''If it was easy to round them up, they did it. Many were rounded up on the streets or at oil sites. Now it seems to be more systematic.'' 
Twenty-two Westerners, including eight Americans, arrived today in Amman, Jordan, on a regularly scheduled flight from Iraq, and 120 Bulgarians were able to leave by road.
''I'm happy to be out,'' Norma Moon, a Briton, told Reuters in Amman. ''Life is normal in Baghdad, but everybody is a bit tense because no one knows what will happen next. It all depends on the Americans.''
Explaining Iraq's refusal to let foreign flights land here, Naji al-Hadithi, the director general of the Iraqi Information Ministry, said the Government had decided not to allow any foreign aircraft to fly into Iraq, but it was prepared to charter planes for that purpose from Iraqi Airways.
Some diplomats said they believed that the move was an attempt by Iraq to weaken, at least symbolically, United Nations sanctions by forcing other nations to temporarily restore landing rights to Iraqi Airways planes.
''We are not interested in having an Iraqi Airways flight to our capital,'' a European envoy said. ''We don't want to pay that price.''
''There is nothing political about this,'' Mr. Hadithi said, ''It is just a commercial thing.''
Because of the sanctions, he said, ''we have planes we have grounded here, and we are facing competition from other airlines.''
''So,'' he said, ''these people can go on Iraqi Airways.'' If the women and children prefer to take buses through the desert to Jordan, Mr. Hadithi said, that was also possible.
 
Envoys Working Tirelessly
Diplomats from the United tates, Europe and Japan have created two task forces that have been working nearly around the clock to take advantage of President Hussein's pledge of freedom for women and children.
Iraqi officials are requiring the women to obtain exit visas in a process that takes up to 36 hours.
On Saturday night, as more than 300 women and children were checking in for a chartered Lufthansa flight, the Government announced that the flight had been canceled. Diplomats protested, and within 40 minutes the flight had been restored.
In meetings tonight, the diplomats discussed chartering planes to fly the women and children directly out of Kuwait or alternatively from Kuwait to Baghdad and then on to Amman, Jordan, for connections to the United States, Europe and Asia. Another proposal being given serious consideration is running a convoy of buses from Kuwait to Baghdad, though some diplomats feel that it would be inhumane to cause women and children to endure the long desert trek.
The road convoys, however, may be arranged faster than flights. ''It may be a question of how desperate we are to move these people,'' one envoy said.
If the choice is to fly out the foreigners, it now appears that they could travel first to Amman, the only capital that is still receiving Iraqi flights while King Hussein's Government ponders whether to fully carry out the trade sanctions.
Two Iraqi flights carried women and children on Saturday night and Sunday morning to Europe and the United States, and in exchange they were allowed to head back to Baghdad today with Iraqi citizens who had been stranded because the embargo stopped Iraqi flights and other airlines would not accept Iraqi Airways tickets. Iraq hoped that it might get more of its people home this way.
Diplomats estimate there are as many as 11,000 foreigners hiding in Kuwait, perhaps as many as 3,000 of them women and children.
 
Food Better Than Sanitation
Diplomats say they believe those in hiding have adequate supplies of food, at least for now. But they said sanitation was deteriorating. Many shops are closed, making it hard to buy such things as soap and toilet paper, and many of the foreigners have now been cooped up in apartments and houses, afraid to step out onto the streets, for a month.
''The city is dying,'' one envoy said. ''Food is not the problem. It's living conditions in general.''
The diplomats said that with the departures Saturday and Sunday of the 700 Western women and children, and a few men who were reportedly in ill health, most of the foreigners that Iraq is willing to release have left.
One of their gravest concerns in evacuating the women and children from Kuwait is that they will expose husbands and fathers to capture.
''We don't want the men being scooped up,'' an envoy said.
Iraq has threatened to hang anyone found sheltering foreigners, and Kuwaiti guerrillas, trying to drive out the Iraqi Army, have been spreading the word that they will shoot anyone who turns over a foreigner to Baghdad's forces.
Diplomats say that heavy firefights with small arms and automatic weapons are being reported almost every night.
Until a little more than a week ago, the embassies in Kuwait were occupied almost fully with the task of keeping in touch with the nationals in hiding, offering encouragement and in some cases, sanctuary. Some embassies divided their citizens into small groups of 8 to 12 and designated leaders whom the others would use as their liaison with the embassy. The groups telephoned each other when soldiers approached.
The Americans and other Westerners learned an important and surprising thing about the Iraqi soldiers: they would knock on doors, but not kick them in. ''If you didn't answer the door,'' a European woman from Kuwait said the other day, ''they would just go away.''
Iraq ordered the embassies closed, and to force out reluctant diplomats, shut off water and electricity and reduced telephone service.
 
Purifying Water
At the United States Embassy, Ambassador W. Nathaniel Howell, seven other diplomats and more than 20 other Americans told reporters on Saturday that they had begun breaking up and burning embassy tables and chairs to make fires to boil swimming pool water for drinking. They smoked a turkey and sun-dried fruit and vegetables to keep them from spoiling without refrigeration.
How long the diplomats can hold out is not clear, but when the American, British and other diplomats finally run out of food and supplies and have to leave the embassies, there will be another flashpoint in the crisis.
Mr. Hussein's Government says that since the diplomats ignored the order to vacate the embassies, they no longer have diplomatic status and will be taken into custody as if they were ordinary citizens of countries applying pressure on Iraq.
Many of the Americans and other foreigners in hiding have had frightening experiences.
Three American businessmen who had been in Kuwait only a few days before the invasion trapped them turned to a Lebanese businessman they had just met for shelter.
With soldiers all over the streets, the Lebanese man picked them up at their hotel in his car. But he soon ran out of gasoline. While the three Americans waited in the car at the side of the road with Iraqi tanks rumbling past, their friend went scavenging for gas.
After they had been in his apartment for a few days, Iraqi soldiers knocked on the door. The Lebanese man hurried his guests into a walk-in closet and went to greet the soldiers. He managed to steer them away but decided to move the Americans to the home of a friend.
Last Sunday, one of the Americans, an insulin-dependent diabetic, left Iraq through the intercession of the Rev. Jesse Jackson. The two other men are still hiding out. The Lebanese, in the meantime, had decided to abandon his apartment and business, and fled across the desert to Saudi Arabia.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
Gulf Price Tag for Egypt: $2 Billion Loss to Economy

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Sept. 3

 BODY:
Egypt could get some short-term relief if the United States decides to go ahead with reported plans to cancel Cairo's $7.1 billion military debt. Payments due this year amount to about $660 million.
 
Bush Favorably Inclined
''My gut instinct is to do that,'' President Bush said at a news conference Saturday when asked about reports that he would ask Congress to forgive Egypt's military debt as a gesture of appreciation for its work in rallying Arab support for the American military effort against Iraq. On Friday, the United States made a $163 million cash grant to Egypt to help with its latest payment. 
If Egypt were not able to keep up the payments on the military-aid debt, provisions of American law would force the cutoff of the $2.3 billion a year in foreign aid it gives Egypt, its most important ally in the Arab world. This is the largest single foreign aid payment except for Israel.
Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, indicated here today that Congress might look favorably on any Administration request to forgive the military debt.
''I believe given the leadership of Mubarak, we should cooperate with his needs,'' said Mr. Pell, who is part of a delegation of 36 Senators and Representatives who visited Saudi Arabia and met with the Egyptian President in his summer headquarters at the Ras el-Tien Palace in Alexandria.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Atef Sedki welcomed the White House plan to forgive military debts, but warned that the country's 55 million people, the vast majority of them poor, would inevitably have to carry added burdens. Egypt already has an unmanageable foreign debt of $50 billion, the subject of protracted wrangling with the International Monetary Fund. Even before the gulf crisis, Egypt had barely enough foreign exchange for needed wheat purchases.
 
Effect on Canal Revenue
In talks with the visiting Japanese Foreign Minister last week, President Hosni Mubarak spoke of a loss at least $2 billion in the next year. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Butros Ghali, used the same number in an interview Sunday with Le Journal de Dimanche, an Egyptian newspaper.
Mr. Ghali said that reduced Suez Canal revenue, caused by a drop in shipping as a result of the United Nations embargo on trade with Iraq, could cost Egypt $400 million.
Canal shipping revenue could also be affected by a recent increase in rates announced by Lloyd's Insurance for oil tankers heading toward gulf states. In 1988, the latest year for which figures are available, the Suez Canal brought Egypt $1.3 billion.
In addition, a drop in tourism caused by fears of unrest in the region, could mean a $500 million drop in revenue in the next year.
 
Family Support System Undercut
The most significant blow, both in numbers and in its human impact, is the loss of wages by the more than a million Egyptian workers - some educated, many of them menial laborers - who were working in Iraq and Kuwait. The immediate loss was estimated by Egyptian officials at $1.1 billion a year.
And the effect is greater than the raw numbers. Each expatriate worker supported six or more relatives at home and was a repository of hopes for the future, building a modest stake of money and goods.
And in the street economies critical to the Middle East, there is a further effect. In Egypt, a quasi-official market in which hundreds of millions of dollars a year are exchanged outside the formal banking system is fed by the remittances of the expatriate workers. This market is critical to Egyptian businessmen seeking to purchase badly needed imports, who go outside the official banking system to get a more advantageous currency exchange rate.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
Lawmakers Touring Persian Gulf Stressing Sanctions Over Combat

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 3

 BODY:

 
'Indefinite Time Frame'
Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, said that from what the legislators had seen, ''we're doing precisely the right strategy.''
''But the American people must be prepared for an indefinite time frame,'' Mr. Cohen added.
Other recent visitors to Saudi Arabia have made the same point, including Senator Sam Nunn, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. 
The military's immediate mission ''is to deter aggression and defend if aggression takes place against Saudi Arabia,'' Mr. Nunn said Sunday on the NBC news program ''Meet the Press.''
''I keep reading articles where they are about to acquire the capability of having a massive ground attack,'' Mr. Nunn said. ''That's simply not what the military has been given in terms of instructions.''
''We've just had the embargo engaged for about 10 days or two weeks,'' he said, ''and the question of whether the embargo is going to work or not will depend a whole lot on whether we can mitigate the downside effects on a lot of countries in the world.''
In telephone interviews on Sunday from Jidda, the Saudi port where the legislators, traveling in two groups, met with members of the Kuwaiti government in exile, there was a familiar response: back up the economic sanctions with greater military involvement from other countries.
''The success of this rests on the continued ability to make this a world-against-Saddam Hussein situation,'' said Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, the House majority leader,who headed a 22-member delegation to Saudi Arabia and other gulf countries.
 
Experts on the Run
The lawmakers gleaned their impressions from a whirlwind tour. The 14-member Senate delegation, for example, was briefed on Saturday by the American field commander, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, before flying by helicopter to the desert encampments of the Army's 101st Airborne Division and the Seventh Marine Brigade.
Then, after meeting the Emir of Bahrain on Sunday, the Senators were whisked to the battleship Wisconsin in the Persian Gulf and rushed back for a two-hour meeting with King Fahd in Riyadh, followed by the Kuwaitis.
The House members, who flew back to Washington after the meeting with Mr. Mubarak, announced upon arriving that much higher manpower levels were needed in the gulf.
Mr. Gephardt and the House Republican leader, Robert H. Michel of Illinois, called upon other nations, ''particularly our NATO allies,'' to make ''more significant contributions through the dispatch of additional troops.''
They also strongly endorsed higher levels of military spending in light of the buildup. ''We pledge to do our part in providing necessary funds,'' they said in a joint statement.
While the explicit goals of the United States and its Arab allies are to use the blockade to force President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, several lawmakers said an equally strong undercurrent of opinion suggests that war may be inevitable.
From discussions they had with officials ranging from American generals to members of the Saudi ruling family, ''the two unspoken sentences at the end of every paragraph seemed to say that only force will move Saddam Hussein,'' said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York.

HEADLINE: Another Wake-Up Call: Save Energy

 BODY:
Mr. Bush's attitude may mirror the public's own complacency. But that doesn't excuse it. The notion that the public should not in any way be inconvenienced by this crisis is naive and irresponsible. If Saddam Hussein is doing Americans any favor at all, it's to remind them that Washington desperately needs a coherent policy aimed at making the country more energy-efficient - beginning with higher energy taxes. 
The Bush Administration has merely been nibbling around the edges of such a policy. In an interview last week, Energy Secretary James Watkins confessed that the Administration was not yet ready to address tough questions such as whether the Government should press for higher auto mileage standards, nuclear power, energy taxes and new oil exploration in environmentally sensitive areas. He suggested instead that drivers put more air in their cars' tires - a handy tip, but hardly a strategy.
Congress also flounders. The Senate will shortly take up a bill that would mandate a 50 percent increase in fuel economy by the year 2001. Improving gas mileage would certainly help, and even Detroit concedes that modest gains are feasible. But the companies argue that as long as gas is cheap, consumers will demand bigger cars, and that to require Detroit (and Japan) to make only smaller cars would put them at war with their customers.
How cheap is gasoline in America? Very. Adjusted for inflation, fuel prices just before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait were the lowest they'd been in 40 years. The result is that when buyers are asked what they most want in a car, fuel economy, once near the top of the list, is near the bottom.
An energy tax adding, say, 25 to 50 cents to the price of a gallon of gasoline would provide therapy the country needs. The 1970's oil crises proved that higher prices promote energy efficiencies. The experience of other countries is also persuasive. Gasoline prices in most industrial nations are two to four times those in the U.S.; those nations' per capita fuel use is one-fourth to one-half what it is here.
Such a tax would have other desirable consequences. It would help reduce the Federal budget deficit. It would curb air pollution, including the greenhouse gases that threaten to warm the earth's atmosphere. And it would make alternative fuels more competitive.
Obviously, an energy tax can only be part of a more comprehensive strategy. But it's a good place to begin. Saddam Hussein has made the case for it. When will Mr. Bush?

HEADLINE: Immigrants Look Outside New York for Better Life

BYLINE: By KAREN De WITT

 BODY:
''There is fear,'' said Clarence Davis, whose said his business, Clarence Davis Realty in the East Flatbush area of Brooklyn, has increased 60 percent in the last three years as a result of the migration. ''I'm talking within the community. There are a certain number of youngsters who make their living selling drugs. They frighten the hard-working people. They don't want to be with that element. That is the reason many people decide to migrate.''
 
Continuation of Trend
Through much of Brooklyn, where many of the city's 900,000 to one million people of Caribbean descent live, real-estate agents specialize in relocation. In eight blocks on Church Avenue in East Flatbush there are six such companies. Mr. Davis said his business was booming. 
Dr. Joseph Salvo, deputy director of the Department of City Planning, said that from 1975 to 1980, the last period for which figures are available, 27,000 people of Caribbean descent left New York City and 60,000 moved from the Caribbean to the city.
Of those who left, the vast majority went to California, Florida and Texas. Others moved upstate and to New Jersey and Connecticut. Given that pattern, Dr. Salvo said, he expected the trend to continue in the 90's.
Caribbean groups, in which demographers include people from Barbados, Haiti, Jamaica, Martinique and Trinidad and Tobago, bolster that forecast.
Caribbean people say changes in United States immigration laws have made it easier for families of poorer people to enter the United States.
 
Crackdown in Jamaica
''Now you're getting the lowest of the low rural people,'' said F. Donnie Forde of Caribbean-American Media Studies Inc., a study organization in Brooklyn. ''They're the ones making trouble. They have no education and are trying to make it to the top by illegal means.''
An anthropologist at New York University, Constance Sutton, said of the new immigrants, ''They violate so many of the orientations of the West Indians, who don't want to get entrapped and pulled down by the illegal economy, by violence.''
In the mid-80's, the police in Jamaica cracked down on violent gangs in the slums of Kingston. Many gang members fled to the United States, where they formed new gangs. The gang members who moved to Brooklyn and Harlem altered the reputation of the Caribbean community, which had been known as hard working and law abiding, said some people of Caribbean descent.
When some officials use phrases like ''Jamaican posses,'' they stigmatize and stereotype a larger group, some people from the Caribbean contend.
Veronica Matthews, a nurse who immigrated to New York from Guyana with her husband, Walter, and four children five years ago, said many people did not know the difference between a Jamaican and a Guyanese accent.
''So we don't like people to say we're West Indian,'' she said. ''I tell people I'm a Guyanese, from South America.''
 
'Then There Are the Drugs'
''The community has changed,'' said Julietta Dyer, a nurse who immigrated from Trinidad and Tobago 23 years ago. ''It's much larger now, and some of the people - well, let's just say that once an elderly person could speak to you and correct you. That's not the case any more.''
Mrs. Dyer said the pace of city life was too fast and ''then there are the drugs.''
''I have a home here,'' she added. ''But my other children live in California and Chicago. And within the last four or five years there has been a lot of migration away from here.''
For many residents the migration represents a move from the streets and neighborhoods that Caribbean once proudly moved into.
''We used the term 'buy house,' which was really symbolic of establishing a toehold in this society,'' Paule Marshall said. ''That was my parents' generation. People that began coming here from 1900 to 1925. Their behavior is very much in keeping with other immigrant groups, seeking for a better life.''
 
To Move to Orlando
Until the changes in the immigration law in 1960's, Mr. Forde said, an immigrant from the Caribbean had to have $2,000 before immigrating to the United States. For Caribbean people, saving that amount indicated initiative and ambition, he added.
Mrs. Matthews and her family, confronted by a growing drug trade in their community, they have purchased land to build a house near Orlando, Fla., and plan to relocate in a year.
''I really don't have anything against New York,'' Mrs. Matthews said. ''You can really work and you can really make something of yourself. It's the drugs everywhere you turn. It's the drugs. Going and coming from work, you're afraid.
''My kids come here so innocent. They say, 'Mommy, I see this person selling this crack at school.' I say, 'Put your head straight and don't look.'
''I love this city. I love New York, all the different types of people here. But what is the sense of being here if you can't enjoy it? Now you look on TV everyday, and there is so much shooting, so much blood. I just can't get accustomed to this.''

HEADLINE: Growing Fiscal Problems Put Squeeze on Social Programs in Many States

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Sept. 3

 BODY:
''We probably have over 35 states who are in what I would say are degrees of fiscal difficulty, and I believe that human services, social programs, are clearly feeling the pinch in most of those states,'' said Gerald Miller, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers. ''There's no question the next couple of years will be much tougher, and the outlook is that those with the least ability to lobby the legislature will be hurt the most.''
Despite the political risks of raising taxes, legislators in the past year adopted $7.6 billion in tax increases, totaling 2.8 percent of state spending. It was the largest percentage increase since 1983.
Even with the new taxes, more than half the states surveyed by the Center for the Study of the States reported that revenue increases are equal to or lower than the inflation rate. The Albany-based center, established in May, is part of the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institure of Government, a research arm of the State University of New York. 
 
Less Revenue and Growing Costs
No organization analyzes the spending in all 50 states, but experts say most states face a common problem. Tax revenue rose at a smaller rate than anticipated, and the states faced growing, politically untouchable or federally mandated costs in programs like education, Medicaid and prisons, which make up the bulk of the budget. That left only a relatively small number of social services susceptible to cuts.
The states have tried to resolve the problem in various ways.
At one extreme was California, which led the nation in the tax revolt of the late 1970's and this year resorted to some of the nation's toughest cuts in education and social services.
Despite an overall budget increase of 12.8 percent, California was facing a $3.6 billion budget shortage this year, an increase of 200,000 new students, a 14 percent annual increase in its prison population and welfare rolls that are growing three times as fast as that in the general population.
 
Tax Increase and Budget Cuts
To remedy the shortage, the state approved $843 million in additional taxes and fees and $2.7 billion in cuts. The cuts included the elimination of $284 million in cost-of-living adjustments for welfare recipients, the aged, the blind and the disabled and $708 million in reduced funds for counties.
One agency affected is the San Fernando Valley Community Mental Health Center, which provides services to about 4,400 patients a year.
The director, Dr. Ian Hunter, said the cuts would force him to close a 23-bed residential program for homeless people who are mentally ill, an outpatient program for the homeless mentally ill, a 12-bed residential house for people in immediate crisis, the only Spanish-language outpatient program in the San Fernando Valley and several other programs.
''All of the patients we're seeing now are severely mentally ill,'' he said. ''We're seeing the hardest core, severely and chronically mentally ill, people who can't function without support. Without medication and therapy they're going to end up on the streets, in the courts, in emergency rooms, all the places that are much more expensive to maintain.''
 
Ashamed of His State
Dr. Hunter said the two other outpatient mental-health providers in the valley, which has about 2.5 million people, closed last year.
''This is the first time I've felt really ashamed to be associated with this state,'' he said.
Wholesale cuts in social programs were rare, however, and several states facing tight budgets had considerable success in avoiding program cuts.
In North Carolina, despite one of the most difficult budget years in memory, the Legislature avoided cuts and added to several social programs by stretching out some major construction programs and deferring efforts to make some major educational changes.
''We have enough problems in North Carolina right now without cutting back more on human services,'' said Bob Geolas, special assistant to Joe Mavretic, the Speaker of North Carolina's House of Representatives, who has been a longtime advocate of spending for social needs.
 
Competition Between Programs
Tight budgets have increased competition between different types of programs, experts say, and welfare programs are often the big losers.
A study by Ronald K. Snell, fiscal affairs director of the National Conference of State Legislatures, found that from 1976 to 1987 state spending for Medicaid sharply increased as a share of state personal income and was matched almost equally by a drop in spending on welfare programs, primarily Aid to Families With Dependent Children.
Last year state spending for Medicaid, half of which consists of nursing home care for the elderly, grew by 25 percent, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Spending for the dependent children program grew by 4.8 percent when applications for such aid were soaring in many states. Critics say the failure to keep pace with inflation is a quiet budget cut that continues to sap the recipients' purchasing power.
In Michigan, for example, from 1983 to 1987 Aid for Families With Dependent Children paid at about 60 percent of the poverty level. This year it pays at 56 percent of the poverty level. In Illinois, the average grant for such programs has lost from 45 to 50 percent of its buying power over the last decade.
 
Decline in Buying Power
Nationwide, from 1970 to 1990 the median state payment for the dependent children's program, adjusted for inflation, has fallen by almost 40 percent.
In many states tight budgets have affected services even though specific programs have not been cut. In South Florida, for example, lawyers for the poor have sued the state on the ground that personnel cuts are denying adequate service to food stamp recipients.
Legal Services of Greater Miami has been in litigation with the state since 1985 over this issue, and the state has twice approved consent decrees agreeing to provide services in an orderly, timely fashion.
According to Miriam Harmatz, staff attorney for Legal Services of Greater Miami, the system is so overloaded that people seeking food stamps face delays of up to two months in having their applications processed.
 
Priority on Unmet Needs
''Things improved slightly in 1988,'' she said, ''but since then over 150 positions in this district alone have been lost at a time when there's been an approximately 15 percent increase in the number of applicants.''
The current priority in many states involves efforts to address unmet needs that have developed in the last decade as Federal programs have withered away and problems like drug abuse and AIDS have added to the states' concerns.
In Mississippi, the state approved a landmark package of educational changes that include related social programs like dropout prevention, school nurses and literacy programs for parents to teach children. But the state failed to provide money for the program, and it is now in limbo.
In Georgia, officials scrambled to address the needs of abused and neglected children. The state says that reports of child abuse doubled from 1983 to 1988, to nearly 40,000 cases, but the number of caseworkers increased only to 502 from 369.
 
Program Freeze in Georgia
The Georgia Legislature passed a measure increasing the number of caseworkers to 667. But a worsening state budget picture led officials to freeze all new programs before the new workers were hired.
And last month Gov. Joe Frank Harris announced $332 million in budget cuts that will force the state's Department of Human Resources to cut an additional $29 million from its budget.
In Minnesota, legislators cut several health and mental health programs for children and rejected most proposals for new initiatives.
That sort of slow squeeze, along with continued tax increases, is what most states are likely to see over the coming years.
''I think we're going to see tax increases and program cuts, but I don't think the cuts will be draconian,'' said Mr. Miller of the state budget officers association. ''Instead, it will be more of a slow grinding down in programs so that they don't keep up with inflation or with additional demands.''

HEADLINE: Big Science; Is It Worth the Price?;
Small-Scale Science Feels the Pinch From Big Projects

SERIES: A periodic look at the impact of the largest new research projects.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
Moreover, they warn, the financial pinch will probably worsen as pressures mount to trim the Federal deficit and as bills pile up for a new generation of big science projects costing more than $160 billion.
In dozens of interviews, experts in and out of Government said small-scale research was ''squeezed,'' ''in crisis'' and ''dying.'' And though traditionally wary of faulting the projects of peers, top science administrators as well as small-scale researchers are increasingly pointing to big instruments as villains.
''While attention and resources are being absorbed by visions of glory with projects costing billions, the infrastructure of science and technology in this country is on the brink of disaster,'' Dr. James A. Krumhansl, a Cornell University physicist, recently warned Congress.
In an editorial entitled ''The Funding Crisis,'' Dr. Daniel E. Koshland Jr., editor of the journal Science, recently said the health of small-scale research was jeopardized by financial neglect. 
''What the nation and the world really need,'' he wrote, ''is a major expansion of investigator-initiated science, because that historically has been the source of great discoveries that have opened new fields.'' In another editorial, Dr. Koshland called for across-the-board cuts of about $1 billion a year in big-science funds, saying the surplus could be used to ''bolster young investigators.''
Many big projects are in the initial stages of planning or construction, with payments now being made that will grow significantly in the course of the 1990's and beyond. Their construction costs are put at more than $60 billion and their operations at more than $100 billion. The projects, which include giant telescopes, atom smashers and planetary probes, aim at answering some of science's most esoteric and fundamental questions.
Experts say that without extraordinary measures to reverse budgetary trends, small projects will probably lose ground to their big brethren. The main reason is that modest endeavors have little or no glitter, and none of the political constituencies that protect big projects from budget pressures in the nation's capital.
Yet by nearly any measure - intellectual merit, economic payoff or sheer excitement among bright young investigators - small science is more important than its big cousin. Past successes include the transistor, the laser and antibiotics.
And small science continues to dazzle. Of 10 Nobel Prizes in Physics during the 1980's, one related to pure theory, three to big projects and six to small-scale endeavors. The ratio is even more pronounced with Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physiology or Medicine, virtually all of which flow from small research ventures.
 
Fears About the Future
Moreover, in terms of sheer numbers, small-scale research is the career of choice among the vast majority of American scientists, probably because it is more accessible and requires less investment by way of scientific instrumentation.
Even so, experts say the field is already squeezed financially, heightening fears about the future.
''It's a serious problem,'' said Erich Bloch, the outgoing director of the National Science Foundation, the Government's main agency for the support of basic science. ''There have been declines in certain areas. And for other ones the increases, in constant dollars, have not been sufficient to cover the increased cost of doing research. There is a squeeze being felt by a number of researchers.'' Dr. Richard S. Nicholson, executive director of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the nation's oldest and largest general science society, said his group had started a project to investigate small-science woes, adding that the problem of poor financing had been exacerbated by a rising number of bureaucratic burdens.
''There's a really high level of discouragement and distress in the science community,'' he said. ''If you go around and talk to this country's top scientists, they're about to bag it.''
Dr. Robert L. Park, a physicist at the University of Maryland who directs the Washington office of the American Physical Society, said the economic repercussions of recent trends could be devastating.
''All the stuff at the heart of our economy is getting cut, while the things that are irrelevant, the space stations, are getting funded,'' he said. ''It's a crazy situation because the things that matter are so cheap. A half billion dollars would have us swimming in money.''
 
'A Crisis Situation'
This year for the first time, the Administration's proposed budget for the largest big science project of all - the $37 billion space station - exceeds that of the entire National Science Foundation. The 1991 request for the station is $2.5 billion and for the foundation $2.4 billion. Scheduled to be lofted piecemeal in the mid-to-late 1990's, the station is eventually expected to cost at least $120 billion, including its five-year construction period and operation over three decades.
Dr. Robert B. Hallock, a physicist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, recently helped form a group of low-temperature physicists to lobby in behalf of small science.
''We consider it a crisis situation,'' he said. ''I know many first-class researchers who have lost their money, and many people who have had level funding for five years at a time when inflation has doubled the cost of doing research.''
Most troubling, Dr. Hallock said, was that bright young scientists are leaving university careers because of tight funds.
''That's terrifying,'' he said. ''It means there are discoveries that won't be made and future generations of scientists that won't be trained. That has the potential to be a disaster for the nation.''
 
The Pressures
More Scientists, Rising Costs
The rise of extremely large projects is but one of several pressures on researchers conducting small-scale projects. Most fundamental is the sheer growth in the number of American scientists, which has fueled competition for scarce Federal dollars. Between 1978 and 1988, the most recent year available, the number of practicing scientists and engineers in the United States nearly doubled to 4.6 million.
On one level, that rise indicates health and vitality, but it has also caused consternation as grant applications have soared and the chances of getting a grant have fallen. This phenomenon haunts the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the Air Force and the Veterans Administration, according to a recent study by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment.
Another problem is that the cost of research is going up rapidly as demands rise for increased laboratory safety and environmental protection, as universities charge more for research overhead costs and as scientists seek the newest kinds of equipment, which is usually expensive. The result is that the scientific inflation rate far exceeds that of the civilian economy. Mr. Bloch of the National Science Foundation estimated that the cost of setting up a new investigator in physics or chemistry has roughly tripled in the last decade, to $300,000.
Finally, the Federal financing of small science has been lackluster at best, with many areas holding steady in the last decade or declining, the latter being especially true in recent years. The Federal budget for basic research rose modestly in the 1980's, going in constant 1990 dollars from $7.3 billion in 1980 to $10.7 billion in 1989, according to the National Science Foundation. But that rise included such things as growing military research as well as the Government's largest spate of big science projects ever. These efforts, dozens in all, included the $110 million Stanford Linear Collider at Stanford University, the $681 million Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor at Princeton University and the recently launched $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.
In the same period, many areas of small science suffered. An example is condensed-matter physics, one of the hottest areas of science. Its studies of such esoteric phenomena as photon and electron transport have yielded advances in computer chips, tiny semiconductor lasers, the liquid crystals of computer displays, optic devices, composite materials of extraordinary strength and so on.
A large part of its Federal financing comes from civilian agencies that support materials science and engineering. Yet these funds dropped 22 percent from 1976 to 1987, going from $728 million to $562 million in constant 1982 dollars, according to a recent report by condensed-matter physicists at the American Physical Society. The report said funds had been essentially level or declining in several fields related to condensed-matter physics, even as these budgets have had to support a growing number of big facilities and machines.
''The crisis has become so severe that it threatens the viability of the field,'' the report concluded.
Another example is space science. During the 1980's, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration began a number of costly big-science probes and spacecraft, even as its financing of university scientists in many cases remained flat or declined. For instance, its budget for research and analysis in planetary exploration rose from $70 million in 1980 to $79 million in 1990 in constant 1990 dollars. But that increase suddenly disappeared when NASA officials cut the 1990 budget by more than $8 million for various reasons, including to pay cost overruns on spacecraft programs and to speed work on the $500 million Mars Observer spacecraft, which is to be launched in 1992.
''I'm hurting and other groups I know are hurting,'' said Dr. Robert M. Walker, director of the McDonnell Center for the Space Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis.
Even at Federal agencies that made sizable budgetary gains in the past decade, small science sometimes fared poorly. The basic research budget for the National Institutes of Health, the Government's main sponsor of biomedical research, rose more than 50 percent between 1980 and 1989, from $2.6 billion to $4.1 billion. Even so, the number of grants awarded for new research projects and continuing ones has recently dropped sharply, from 6,446 in 1987 to an estimated 4,633 in 1990.
''From our point of view this is really an emergency situation,'' Dr. Thomas Kelley, a virologist from Johns Hopkins University, told a recent meeting on biomedical finances held by the National Academy of Sciences, a private group that advises the Federal Government. Researchers blame the cutbacks on a rise in targeted funds for specific projects like AIDS, diabetes, cancer and the $3 billion project to map the complete human genetic structure.
The dilemma is similar at the National Science Foundation. Between 1980 and 1989 the foundation's basic research budget rose from $1.27 billion to $1.78 billion in constant 1990 dollars. But amid that increase, the foundation embarked on a series of new programs in addition to its more traditional financing of small science, including engineering research centers, big interdisciplinary projects and some large instruments.
The result is that the foundation's budgets for most small ventures in mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering, biology and computer science have recently fallen, after inflation, below their 1988 levels, according to a study by the Association of American Universities. Over the decade the situation is not much better.
''The situation is growing increasingly desperate,'' said Dr. Daniel Kleppner, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who recently published a satire in Physics Today on the difficulty of getting Federal funds to pay for a $10,000 research laser.
Dr. Steven M. Younger, a physicist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, put it more bluntly, saying, ''The foundation of university science is dying.''
 
Lost Opportunities
Diamond Coatings, Backwater Settings
Behind the numbers is a drama of lost opportunities. One example is the emerging field of thin films of synthetic diamond, an advance that has opened a new era for electronics, optics, machine tools, chemical processing and military technology. The films radically improve the quality of the objects they coat, making tools and bearings last longer, lenses and windows resist scratches and loudspeakers give truer sound reproduction.
A panel of the National Research Council, a prestigious scientific group that advises the Federal Government, recently called diamond coatings ''one of the most important technological developments in the past decade'' and urged that research forge ahead to solve underlying problems that could frustrate its rapid development.
Despite such endorsements, the field is a Federal backwater, receiving about $5 million a year, according to Dr. Roy, who does such research at Penn State. ''The Federal money is simply not there,'' he said. ''We need to support a dozen universities at a critical level.'' More than 10 American companies are conducting serious research in the area, including General Electric, which recently announced it had created an advanced form of diamond with an enhanced ability to transmit heat and light.
In Japan, Dr. Roy said, the field is believed to receive about $150 million a year from government and industry. ''They're going gangbusters,'' he said. ''Already in 1984, Japan had 40 major efforts going. Today it's more like 100. It's a concerted effort.''
A surprising example of the pinch on small science comes from the emerging field of superconducting materials that work at high temperatures. These promise to revolutionize electric devices by making them far more efficient. Despite its intellectual allure, and a sizable amount of subsequent Federal financing, the endeavor has recently been hampered by budget reductions. Even Nobel laureates have felt the squeeze.
''Every worker in the field of the basic science of superconductivity in this country is experiencing repeated and severe funding cuts,'' Dr. Philip W. Anderson, a Nobel laureate in physics at Princeton University, told Congress earlier this year.
Another example involves a single researcher with a bright idea. It is electro-osmosis to clean hazardous waste sites. In theory, an electric current can cause contaminated fluids to flow into a holding reservoir, where they can be easily removed. Although lab tests are promising, and two Federal agencies have given grant applications on the work exceptionally high marks, no money has been forthcoming.
''I've got brilliant students working on it,'' said Dr. Ronald F. Probstein, Ford Professor of Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''We've tried to get money for years. But we end up nowhere. It's sad. There's been a breakdown in the support of basic research.''
 
The Outlook
Battling Visions Of Grandeur
Experts say the budget crunch, barring a sudden reversal of Federal trends, will only get worse as the Government struggles to pay for the $160 billion in big science projects it plans for the 1990's and beyond.
''They have the potential to absolutely destroy the backbone of small science,'' said Dr. Paul G. Gassman, a chemist at the University of Minnesota and president of the American Chemical Society.
The problem starts when the Administration plans its request, said Dr. Park, who helps track the Federal budget for the American Physical Society. The bigger would-be projects, by virtue of influential investigators conjuring visions of grandeur, have usually been able to mount a lobbying campaign within agencies. ''There's no way for small science to do that,'' Dr. Park observed, noting that it is far more fragmented.
And even when the executive branch tries to do right by small science, as when the Reagan and Bush Administrations asked for large increases in the budget of the National Science Foundation, Congress often finds other needs more pressing, giving the foundation smaller rises than requested.
''The foundation is caught in the politics of scarcity,'' said John C. Crowley, an analyst at the Association of American Universities. ''The budget requests have been very good. If they had been funded, you would not be hearing squeals from the system.''
On Capitol Hill, the science foundation competes with big projects and other interests. For instance, the House appropriations subcommittee that oversees the foundation's budget also controls that for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Veterans Affairs and NASA, which has the lion's share of the Government's big science projects. In Congress as elsewhere, big-project lobbies usually have good access to power brokers while their small rivals go relatively unrepresented.
''We're part of the bottom line,'' said Mr. Bloch of the science foundation. ''There's only so much money. It's very important to set priorities so we preserve the infrastructure first and look at the big projects secondarily.''
 
Fueling the engine of invention
Although advocates predict great things from an array of big projects, many scientists say that the most productive discoveries come from small teams working in relatively modest labs. Such teams produced Nobel-prize-winning work in X-ray crystallography, growth hormones and superconductivity. In fact, such 'small science' has won most of the Nobel Prizes awarded in recent years.
 
X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY
Beams of radiation, above, reveal the structure of complex molecules like strands of proteins. The molecules are crystallized and exposed to x-rays, allowing scientists to determine their structure. The technology has been crucial to the development of new drugs, pesticides and other useful chemicals.
 
GROWTH HORMONE
Fundamental new insights into cell growth and diversification followed the discovery of a chemical called nerve growth factor, below. It influences the maturation of embryonic nerve cells into the mature nervous system.
 
SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
High temperature superconductivity, right, in which electricity flows with no loss to resistence, could vastly raise efficiency in electronic devices and produce many other benefits. At right, the magnetic field produced by a block of superconducting material levitates a magnet.
 
 
The Series So Far
The series began on May 27 with an overview of several projects that supporters believe will herald a new age of discovery, but that critics fear will starve scarce Federal funds for smaller, more practical projects. An article on May 29 about the Superconducting Supercollider was followed on June 5 by a report on a project to decipher the entire human genetic code.. The space station Freedom was examined on June 10, and an article on June 19 discussed the Earth Observing System, which will study the global environment from space.

HEADLINE: Global Warming Research Is Backed

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 3

 BODY:
Scientists say atmospheric buildups of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons and other gases - mostly from the burning of oil, coal and other fossil fuels - could cause a disastrous warming of the Earth's temperature.
The Bush Administration argues that there is still too much scientific uncertainty to warrant expensive steps, such as a proposed worldwide ceiling on carbon dioxide emissions.
The research council's Committee on Alternative Energy Research and Development Strategies, led by David L. Morrison of the IIT Research Institute in Chicago, was asked to consider what policy steps should be taken if the Government decides to take action on global warming. 
 
Statement by the Secretary
The panel said that funds in the Energy Department's current research budget should be shifted to earmark about $300 million a year for projects to improve energy efficiency and encouraging adoption of technology that would cut ''greenhouse'' gas emissions.
These steps ''would make sense for other reasons even in the absence of concerns about global climate change,'' the panel said.
To get the money, the scientists said the Energy Department could reduce spending on research into fusion power, fossil energy and other projects.
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins welcomed the report in a statement, but said the department's current research projects should not be cut.
''Although we agree with the priorities highlighted by this study, we believe that these priorities should not be met at the expense of other programs promising substantial, long-term environmental and energy security benefits,'' he said.
The committee did not make a precise cost estimate for what it called an insurance strategy for advanced research into renewable energy, conservation, nuclear energy and a range of other new ideas.
''These alternative technologies would be developed to the level necessary to understand their costs and impacts if concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and climate change heighten,'' it said.

But management says that retailing may now make a comeback. The recent downturn in the real estate market in the Northeast has encouraged Alexander's to look for growth on its retailing end.
In addition, in mid-August Mr. Roth announced his interest in buying a controlling stake in Alexander's, which would end his tug-of-war with Mr. Trump, whose financial status has weakened in recent months. Such a move could give the board more latitude for adding stores to cater to growing number of shoppers in the lower to middle incomes that Mr. Farkas sees as an emerging market. 
The board has already moved to expand the retail group. In April, Alexander's opened its first new store in a decade, in the Bronx. And, Mr. Farkas says, it may be receptive to opening other stores.
Yet some retailing specialists say Alexander's, which has 12 stores in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, has passed its prime. ''Alexander's hasn't attracted a wide enough audience, either because of a lack of content or presentation or because of its ambience,'' said James Posner, a New York retailing consultant.
Still, Mr. Farkas, one of four sons of the store's founder, George Farkas, said the chain is in the enviable position of being ''the lone survivor of a group of middle-market retailers in the New York area.'' Gone are S. Klein, Korvettes, Mays, Lane's and Ohrbach's, chains which he said prospered until the 1970's by catering to the ethnic groups that were emerging then - ''the Italians, Jews and Irish.''
 
'Vibrant' Market Seen
Although many of those customers have since moved away from the area or have improved their incomes out of the middle market, he said, other groups of immigrants have replaced them, presenting an attractive opportunity for Alexander's. ''Our market is alive, well and vibrant,'' Mr. Farkas said. For the first time in recent years, the company may be able to take advantage of that position. The most promising development to top executives was a financial statement released in the middle of last month by Vornado Inc., a real estate concern owned by Mr. Roth's development company, Interstate Properties.
Vornado said it would buy an additional $15 million in Alexander's common stock, or as much as 25 percent. That would give a controlling interest to Vornado, whose current 27.8 percent stake makes it the chain's largest shareholder. Among other properties, Mr. Roth has several strip shopping centers in New Jersey.
 
Stock Price Has Fallen
Although Mr. Roth has declined to comment, his associates say the drop in Alexander's stock price gives him an opportunity to get a bargain. The stock closed on Friday at $30.625 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, only 12.5 cents above its low for the last year and far below its high of $57.375 earlier this year.
Mr. Roth may also be capitalizing on a weakened Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump, who also declined to comment about plans for his Alexander's stock, has been put on a short leash by bankers since his near-default last month on some bonds. Analysts say he is in no position to buy more Alexander's shares.
The investors were drawn separately to Alexander's by its real estate holdings, and in particular by the land value of its flagship store at 59th Street and Lexington Avenue in Manhattan. They hoped to develop the property into a multiuse high-rise building.
But they disagreed on how much retail space it should include. Mr. Roth reportedly wanted more retail space than Mr. Trump. They also argued over who would be entitled to make the critical decisions regarding their joint effort.
Retailing executives speculate that if Mr. Roth gains control, he would develop the store into a high-rise office and apartment complex with a retail component - not necessarily including an Alexander's store.
Mr. Trump and Mr. Roth have tried to capitalize on Alexander's assets. Most of its net profit last year of $21 million, on sales of $463 million, came from the sale of the sites of three of its stores.
The differences between the investors have caused Alexander's board to move cautiously in expanding the company's retail side. Alexander's reticent strategy has left it vulnerable to discounters and to the aggressive price cutting of such traditional retailers as Macy's, Abraham & Straus and Stern's.
Alexander's lost $2.46 million in its third fiscal quarter, which ended on May 5, compared with a loss of $3 million the year before. Its sales for the period rose by 7.1 percent, to $98.2 million. For the first nine months, it has lost $1.46 million, on net income of $19.1 million.
The value of Alexander's stock -and of Mr. Roth's and Mr. Trump's holdings - has also declined. Executives at the company agree that if it were not for the fallen stock price, both would have sold their shares because of their inability to follow through in developing the flagship store.
 
Investment Bank Hired
The investors even hired Morgan Stanley & Company a few months ago to explore ways to maximize value to shareholders. The investment bank has said that an option would be to sell the company. No bidders have emerged.
Alexander's family management, representing only about 4 percent of the stock after selling shares to Mr. Trump and Mr. Roth, has taken steps in the last 18 months to sharpen the company's retailing focus. It has stopped its costly promotional price- cutting on electronics because of the difficulty in competing with discounters and has instead concentrated on apparel - it has long imported lesser-known brands - home furnishings and ''more lucrative soft goods,'' Mr. Farkas said. It has also introduced automotive accessories.
The company also opened the Bronx store, taking over a site vacated by the defunct TSS-Seedman's retail chain. The store, Alexander's third in the Bronx, has had ''a very strong customer response,'' Mr. Farkas said, prompting the company to look for locations in downtown Brooklyn and in Jersey City. Mr. Farkas envisions opening a store every year.
 
The Lone Survivor
He thinks that Alexander's, as the sole survivor of the retail chains that catered to low- and middle-income shoppers, has captured the middle market.
''As the department store moved upscale, we find ourselves now only with small competitors, such as the Century 21 department store chain, and Conway's in Manhattan and Wertheimer's in Brooklyn,'' Mr. Farkas said. ''I think this is a very expandable business. We have a strong and loyal following.''
But one retailing consultant views the middle market differently. ''They were the original off-price merchant in the New York area, but now there are so many of them,'' said David J. Rachman, professor of marketing at Baruch College of the City University of New York.
''They were swept away by Marshalls, Filene's Basement stores and chains like Labels for Less,'' he added. ''Their real estate is much more valuable than their retailing potential.''

HEADLINE: Borrowing Is Resumed By Mexico

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Rather than the bank loans that were obtained in the 1970's and 1980's with few requirements attached, state-owned companies are floating bond issues today for projects like oil exploration, which should, in theory, generate enough revenue to repay the debt. They are the first bond issues floated by Mexican state enterprises in nearly a decade.
The biggest new borrower so far, Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, is also the state's most profitable enterprise, a circumstance that should help to insure repayment of the bonds when they come due in seven or eight years. But in recent years, most of Pemex's operating earnings, more than $6 billion in 1989 alone, have been drained off by the Mexican Government, with its budget deficit. 
A similar pattern has befallen the telephone company and some other state enterprises. The Government's tendency to appropriate the earnings of state companies raises the possibility that it might, in some future cash shortage, absorb money earmarked to pay off the new bonds.
 
Danger Is Acknowledged
Mr. Ortiz and others acknowledge the danger, but they argue that the drain is not likely to continue. For one thing, they note, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has cut Government spending sharply, reducing the need to drain money from state enterprises. The Government deficit, in fact, has dropped to 6 percent of gross domestic product - a measure of the value of all of the goods and services produced within the country - from 12 percent in 1988, according to Government data.
In addition, the telephone company and several other big state enterprises are being sold, and this privatization process means the Government can no longer latch on to their earnings easily. Finally, the prospectuses accompanying the new bond issues specify that the money is to be invested in income-producing projects and that the income is to be earmarked for debt repayment.
That, at least, is the case with Pemex, the biggest new borrower, says Francisco Rojas, the company's director general. The problem is that Pemex is not up for sale, leaving it vulnerable to future drafts on its income. And Pemex's old debt of $15 billion represents a big chunk of Mexico's $48.5 billion in bank debt.
 
A Reluctance to Borrow
Nevertheless, Pemex's reluctance to borrow more than it can safely repay is a big reason that the oil company is resisting pressure from the United States to increase oil production during the Middle East crisis, Mr. Rojas said in an interview.
Pemex will limit spending on exploration and production to slightly more than $2 billion a year for the next year or two, or just enough to satisfy rising domestic demand and increase exports slightly, Mr. Rojas said. Sixty percent of this spending is to come from operations and only 40 percent from foreign bond issues.
Putting this procedure in place, Pemex is floating $1 billion in bond issues this year in Japan, Europe and the United States, Mr. Rojas said, and similar bond issues are to be floated in 1991. Pemex, however, will not try again to raise $6 billion for exploration and production as it did in 1981, when oil prices were also high. Most of the $6 billion was borrowed.
''We are not going to borrow massive amounts, as we did a decade ago, to try to rapidly increase production,'' Mr. Rojas said. ''We don't want our economy to be heavily dependent on oil revenue only to have the oil price drop.''
 
Effect of Oil Prices
The oil-price drop in the early 1980's left Mexico without enough money to meet its foreign debt payments, and this was the main cause of the repayment crisis that endures to this day.
The caution in Pemex's new borrowing has helped to reduce the annual interest rate that Mexico must pay to float bonds. The most recent issues have returned a yield of 11.5 percent, compared with 17 percent when the process started last year.
''We don't have a target yet for how much we hope to raise from these bond issues,'' Mr. Ortiz said. ''We are still testing the market.''
Mexico's return to the world's bond market is so recent that the two American bond rating agencies -Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation -have not yet assigned a rating to the bonds. But the 11.5 percent yield assigned to the issues indicates that the markets consider the risk of Mexico's new debt to be similar to that of the bonds of Venezuela or Hungary, market experts said. Moody's rates the bonds of these two countries as Ba-1 or Ba-3, just below investment grade.
 
Reopened Bond Markets
Three other factors have also reopened international bond markets to Mexico at relatively low interest rates, bankers and economists say. One has been the Salinas Administration's spending cutback. The second has been the privatization program, intended to provide $20 billion or more to the Government. This money is to be used, in part, to repay foreign debt.
The privatization program, in turn, was an important reason that Mexico's commercial bank lenders agreed to a new debt plan that sharply reduced debt repayment for the next six or seven years.
The repayment plan, in effect, frees money that can be used to make payments on the new bond issues. The $48.5 billion in outstanding commercial bank loans has been converted into $42.5 billion in long-term United States Treasury issues, and payment of the remaining principal has been postponed. Interest payments have fallen to $3 billion a year from $4 billion, and as part of the debt agreement Mexico's bank lenders extended $1 billion in new credits to help with interest payments.
The World Bank has also made $2.4 billion in loans to Mexico this year, part of it earmarked for interest payments on old debt.
The upshot is that foreign debt repayment will fall to 2 percent of gross domestic product in 1990, from 4.5 percent last year and nearly 7 percent in 1988, the Government estimates. And the great hope is that the Mexican economy will be a lot richer - mostly through a much larger manufacturing sector - when the nation resumes repayment of principal on the old foreign debt, in addition to repayment of the bond issues now being floated and the World Bank loans.

HEADLINE: Credit Markets;
Move by Fed To Cut Rates Is Expected

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
''In the usual terms of growth versus inflation, the arguments for and against an easing of U.S. monetary poliy are nearly balanced,'' Marcos Jones, an economist at the Deutsche Bank Capital Corporation, wrote in a weekly letter to clients.
''But the potential impact of credit-related difficulties in the economy has grown to uncomfortable proportions, giving even the central bank a stake in a modest bout of reflation,'' he continued. ''So long as it can avoid a disorderly decline in the dollar, we expect the Federal Reserve to ease policy in the first half of this month.''
Fed officials have strongly suggested that before making their move they would prefer a stabilization of the Middle East situation, which in August generated one of the sharpest selloffs on record in world financial markets. But analysts said the Fed may not have that luxury. 
''We are coming close to the point where the Fed will have to move even though the market is not quite as stable as it might like,'' said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank. ''The key thing is to prevent a recession, and lower interest rates will help you do that.''
 
Job Data Awaited
In the next two weeks, the most likely occasion to prompt a Fed move seems to be the release of August employment data, which is expected on Friday. Economists do not anticipate a repeat of the July performance, when, excluding census workers, nonfarm payroll employment actually declined. But the forecasts do not envisage strong growth.
Excluding the census workers, estimates of the rise in payroll employment in August range from a low of 20,000 workers to a high of 125,000. A number in that range would not be indicative of a healthy, rebounding economy, analysts said.
''The August gain, all of which probably occurred in the private service-producing sector, reflects the effects of a five-week sample period and a modest bounceback from the sharp declines in July, rather than an improvement in underlying economic fundamentals,'' Brian Jones, an economist at Salomon Brothers, noted in the firm's weekly Comments on Credit.
 
Looking at the Numbers
Gary Schlossberg, a vice president and senior economist at the Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco, said, ''If the economic numbers are really weak, the Fed may be inclined to ease even if oil prices are moving higher.''
An easing move by the Fed and a further reduction in tensions in the Middle East would be warmly welcomed in the corporate bond market, where new issues have become rare since the onset of the Persian Gulf crisis.
Excluding mortgage-backed and asset-backed financings, only 26 offerings of nonconvertible debt, totaling $4.1 billion, were made last month, according to figures from the Securities Data Corporation.
August is not normally a high-volume month, but the decline is stunning: in August of last year, 69 deals totaling $10.4 billion were offered.
''Apparently, corporate treasurers are not yet convinced that the latest rise in bond yields will last for long,'' said John Lonski, a senior economist at Moody's Investors Service.
 
No Increased Borrowing
But, he continued, ''the disappearance of new corporate bond sales has not been balanced by increased borrowing elsewhere - nonfinancial company commercial paper outstanding continues to contract.''
Taken in tandem, Mr. Lonski said the declines ''may be consistent with an overall drop in corporate borrowing that would be consistent with forecasts of the slowest economy since the 1982 recession.''
The corporate bond calendar is virtually empty for the remainder of this holiday-shortened week, but corporate finance specialists said a large backlog of issues is ready to come to market.
''Between now and the middle of October, you are going to see a lot of utilities, finance companies and foreign borrowers in the market,'' said one investment banker. ''But there is not likely to be a heavy run of industrial paper; they don't like rates at these levels, and for the time being, they don't need the money.''

Merging of Roles Seen in Retailing

BYLINE: By Isadore Barmash

 BODY:
Q. Is dual distribution still valid in these turbulent times for retailing?
A. Yes, more than ever. The industry volatility makes it more difficult for producers to find distribution channels, so they have to create their own. So more and more producers are going direct to the consumer. Not just us, but Liz Claiborne, Ralph Lauren, Phillips-Van Heusen, Florsheim shoes. In the 1960's and 1970's, we all concentrated on opening doors, meaning finding as many individual stores to sell to as we could. We still want to do that, but we also want to protect ourselves by having our own stores, too. 
Q. Are your stores primarily a pipeline for your own goods?
A. No. The key to the failure of many supplier-owned stores was that they were used to absorb the production errors of the owner-manufacturer. But those stores and all others must stand on their own and be able to compete. It is true that about 80 percent of what we sell in our stores is produced by us. But only between 15 percent to 18 percent of what we manufacture is sold through our stores; the bulk by far goes to other retailers. The answer to the question is that while we sell a lot of our own goods through our stores, everything they sell, our goods and others', has to be attractive and appealing so that our stores can be viable in the marketplace. But we take great pains to insure that our independent retail accounts have a product that is profitable and viable for them.
Q. Are there other advantages to having your own stores?
A. They keep us close to the consumer and give us market feedback. They make for more efficient production planning because our stores buy early, which helps us to better plan our manufacturing cycles. Our stores, too, can function as model showcases for our regular retail accounts. And having our own stores gives us an opportunity to launch and test new brands.
Q. Will a related trend, of retailers buying manufacturing plants, grow?
A. No matter what we call it, dual distribution or verticalization, I suspect that both trends will grow. Forward verticalization relates to producers who open or buy stores. Backward verticalization means retailers who buy, open or operate manufacturing plants, like the Limited's ownership of Mast Industries. The goal in both is the same: protecting the distribution channels and providing better service.
Q. Will you continue your retail expansion in the rest of 1990?
A. No, we are standing pat this year. Frankly, this is a year when we want to do better with what we've got. We have expanded a lot in recent years. Now we want a payback to that expansion. Next year, we may resume our new-store-opening program.
Q. Is there a fundamental change brewing in the clothes American men are buying?
A. We are not sure, but we are researching the matter. This 18-month lag in men's clothing sales is the longest down cycle since the recession years of 1973-74. Before those years, to spur demand we had a fashion-lapel change and the introduction of double-knits. Lately, we have been suffering from a lag in wardrobe replacement and higher prices created by rising wool costs. But we are optimistic for spring 1991 when there will be some fashion and silhouette changes and new, lighter fabric colors to replace the dark shades we have had in the last few years. Fabric prices, too, have stabilized. We ourselves will present four new fashion approaches in the Hart Schaffner & Marx line that we think will help to end the cycle.

Prime Rate Funds Difficult to Price

BYLINE: By Anise C. Wallace

 BODY:
Because these closed-end mutual funds invest in short-term floating-rate bank loans, their daily value, like that of a money market fund, is supposed to remain constant. But at some of these prime funds, the net asset values - or the prices investors pay to buy new shares - have begun to fluctuate. The value of the $670 million Van Kampen Merritt Prime Rate Income Trust, for instance, has risen slightly above $10 a share because some of its loans have appreciated in value, said Jeffrey W. Maillet, the fund's portfolio manager.
But on occasion the net asset value of the $1.1 billion Pilgrim Prime Rate Trust has dropped slightly below $10 for two reasons, a spokesman for the Pilgrim Group said. Pilgrim executives wrote down a $5 million loan to the Amdura Corporation in March after the company filed for bankruptcy protection. At the same time, the firm changed its accounting method, but executives would not discuss the reason for the change. 
This year, the five prime rate funds have been among the fastest growing of all funds and their investment returns have been the highest of all closed-end bond funds, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc. For example, after shutting the doors to new business last winter, executives for the $1.7 billion Eaton Vance Prime Rate Reserves Fund in Boston reopened the fund to investors on July 31 and promptly raised an additional $100 million in one week.
At the end of July, according to Lipper, the five funds had $5.5 billion in assets. The current yield was 10 percent for Van Kampen Merritt; 9.98 percent for the Merrill Lynch Prime Fund Inc.; 9.86 percent for the Pilgrim fund; 9.78 percent for Eaton Vance, and 9.75 percent for the Allstate Prime Income Trust.
As the name implies, the goal of these funds is a yield that matches the prime lending rate, the benchmark rate that banks charge their highest-rated customers, currently at 10 percent. But to earn such a high yield after fees and expenses, the fund managers invest in bank loans to many low-rated, heavily indebted companies like Black & Decker, Hospital Corporation of America and Stone Container.
Executives concede that pricing the loans can be a problem. James B. Hawkes, president of the $1.7 billion Eaton Vance fund, compared the task to pricing real estate every day. ''The concept of a price today and a price tomorrow is not a helpful concept,'' he said. ''They don't trade every day.''
Nevertheless, because these funds sell shares daily to the public, the Securities and Exchange Commission has warned them to monitor the pricing of these loans carefully. So the funds have had to improvise. Executives of Van Kampen Merritt, for instance, use the services of a Wall Street firm that trades bank loans to price the 70 loans in their fund. ''We wanted an arms-length procedure that is similar to pricing securities,'' Mr. Maillet said.
Executives at Eaton Vance and Allstate, however, calculate the daily values themselves by analyzing interest rates and other so-called ''highly leveraged transactions,'' executives of these firms say. And unless a company has defaulted on a loan, Merrill Lynch carries the loan at its face value, said Gregg Durett, a vice president.
As in any market, of course, changes in supply and demand determine these loan prices. And even in this thinly traded market some loans command a premium while others sell at a discount. These days, some loans made to RJR Nabisco Inc. at the time of the 1989 leveraged buyout are considered ''cool'' and are less attractively priced than others, Mr. Snyder of the Loan Pricing Corporation said. ''Hot'' bank loans - those in high demand - include Gulfstream Aerospace, he said.
Because some funds' holdings are substantial, any discrepancies between a loan's market value and the price a fund uses to calculate its net asset value could be significant. For instance, Merrill Lynch has about $90 million invested in a short-term loan to Scotsman Manufacturing, which makes commercial prefabricated buildings. And Eaton Vance has $125 million, or about 7 percent of its portfolio, in one of the cool loans to RJR.
Because of their unusually strict policy on redemptions, though, it is unlikely that these fund managers will have to liquidate loans at market prices. But the price investors pay to buy new shares in these funds may not be exactly accurate.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
A Crisis Builds At Jordan Sites Housing Asians

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Sept. 4

 BODY:
[In Baghdad, the large-scale evacuation of Western and Japanese women and children stranded in Iraq and Kuwait resumed. Page A15.]
Officials have said the number of refugees arriving in Jordan could reach upwards of a million people within a week or two, perhaps more if war breaks out between Iraq and the United States-led multinational force in the Persian Gulf. The problem was left to Jordan for three weeks after the invasion of Kuwait. But in recent days United Nations officials, spurred on by private agencies like the International Committee of the Red Cross, have concluded that what confronts them is a vast human drama. 
With more than 100,000 Asians already enduring scorching heat and squalor in camps that dot the desert between the Iraqi border and Amman, the officials' problem is to cope with the already appalling conditions before events in Iraq take a turn for the worse, sending a still larger human torrent across the frontier.
To end the crisis, officials here must airlift the refugees out. One approach to that took shape with plans for a Soviet AN-124 aircraft, described as the world's largest commercial jet, to take nearly 500 Bangladeshi citizens from Amman to Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. The Soviet plane has been chartered with money donated by the European Community to make 10 trips to Dhaka.
 
Other Flights Arranged
United Nations officials said another 45 charter flights, some of them using other aircraft chartered from the Soviet airline Aeroflot, have been set for the next two to three weeks, at a total cost, together with the AN-124 flights, of $7 million. Many of these flights will carry Sri Lankans, whose Government, like that of Bangladesh, has said it cannot afford to charter aircraft of its own.
United Nations officials say that other nations, including Pakistan, Thailand and the Philippines, are following the example of India, which began taking some of its citizens out of Amman on chartered aircraft last week.
But when the United Nations charter flights now planned are completed, only about 15,000 of the refugees will have been taken home. The officials said no other flights could be chartered until ''donor nations'' - meaning mainly the United States, other Western countries and Japan - contributed the $50 million cost of getting the first 100,000 refugees home. Many more might well arrive here, pushing the costs of the airlift alone to hundreds of millions of dollars, before the costs of caring for the refugees are included.
Time, too, is a factor. The 110-degree heat of the Jordanian desert plummets at night, health conditions in the camps are appalling and food and water scarcities and other frictions, some of them ethnic, have already lead to fights. In recent days, there have also been reports that refugees have been beaten by Jordanian Army guards.
 
Food Airlifted From Italy
Efforts to lower the tensions by bringing in relief supplies gained momentum today when 120 tons of food arrived by air from Italy, along with 1,000 more tents, 500 of them from the United States. But a huge backlog persists.
Relief officials have also been looking at the possibility of chartering ships. Rolf Gemmy, a United Nations expert on mass migrations, told reporters that vessels at the port of Aqaba that have been idled by economic sanctions against Iraq could be used to ship some of the Asians home, but that increased insurance costs because of the war risks, together with other anxieties, were causing problems in negotiations with the shipowners.
As they struggled to fashion solutions to these and other problems, the relief officials confronted another difficulty: tensions and rivalries among themselves. Even before Prince Hassan took over the news conference today with his attack on the west, United Nations and Jordanian officials had traded barely disguised accusations about who was responsible for waiting utnil last Tuesday, 25 days after the Kuwait invasion, before starting to build the first barely equipped refugee camps in the desert.
Prince Hassan, who has been in charge of day-to-day running of Jordan for much of the past month while his brother, King Hussein, has been touring Europe and the Arab world in search of a diplomatic solution to the crisis, left no doubt where he placed the blame. In his statement to reporters, the Prince said that while attention had been focusing on the Western military buildup, ''a human tragedy of the widest dimension has received but scant attention.''
 
'Downtrodden of the Earth'
After a passing reference to the Western hostages in Iraq, the Prince implied that there were chauvinistic or racial reasons for the inattention. ''As the downtrodden of the earth, the plight of these persons, mostly nationals of the countries of the Indian subcontinent and of the Philippines and Thailand, has evoked only the faintest of responses from the world community, and from a world press more interested in war scenarios than humanitarian relief,'' he said.
The Prince concluded his appearance by abruptly announcing, in effect, that he wanted Mr. Essaafi, the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator, superseded or fired. By saying he planned to ask Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar to put someone in charge of coordinating aid to the refugees - Mr. Essaafi's current role -Prince Hassan appeared to be saying Jordan lacked confidence in the United Nations operation.

HEADLINE: Political Conflict Is Renewed Over Drilling in Arctic Refuge

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE, Alaska, Aug. 31

 BODY:
This kind of debate is not limited to Alaska. The Government has said it will try to mediate a dispute in Santa Barbara, Calif., over transporting crude oil. And oil industry executives are pushing, with no apparent success, for a reconsideration of President Bush's decision in June to bar new drilling off the coasts of California, Florida and other states.
But nowhere is the debate taking as sharp a focus as in this pristine, desolate region 250 miles north of the Arctic Circle.
''We are the nation's wilderness and we are also the nation's major source of energy,'' said Alaska's Governor, Steve Cowper, a Democrat who favors drilling in the refuge. ''This is a metaphor for the energy debate.'' 
The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge covers 19 million acres in the northeastern corner of Alaska, an area almost the size of Maine. It is a landscape virtually untouched by man in a state whose majestic wilderness, especially after the Exxon Valdez spill, is a powerful symbol of what is at risk when oil production or transportation go wrong.
The drilling debate centers on the section of the refuge that runs along the Beaufort Sea at the eastern end of the North Slope. The coastal plain, covering 1.5 million acres, or an area the size of Delaware, is a flat, virtually featureless tundra near the water, with gently rolling hills a few miles inland. It is 65 miles east of the Prudhoe Bay oilfield and the other fields of Alaska's North Slope.
The Eskimo village of Kaktovik, which like many settlements above the Arctic Circle has a satellite dish to receive television signals but is without running water, lies just outside the boundary of the refuge at the edge of the Beaufort Sea. But there are no roads within or leading to the refuge. Only a few hundred outsiders, including oil-company employees and tourists, fly into the coastal plain each year. Barren Desert or Sacred Place? The trade-offs among energy, environment and economy are clearly delineated here. To Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, the coastal plain of the refuge is ''nothing but a frozen, barren desert'' containing oil that would contribute to national security by adding to domestic reserves.
To Representative Morris K. Udall, the Arizona Democrat who is a leading opponent of drilling, the area is ''a sacred place'' that should never be given over to oil rigs and pipelines.
To Archie Brower, a village leader in Kaktovik, oil development here means jobs to keep young people from leaving and money to prop up a local economy that is as fragile as the local ecosystem.
To Karen Jettmar, the assistant director of the Wilderness Society in Alaska, the refuge is ''a little island of protection in a sea of oil development.''
 
Amount of Oil Highly Uncertain
In 1987, after a five-year study, the Interior Department called the coastal plain of the refuge ''the nation's best single opportunity to increase significantly domestic oil production.'' While no one will know for certain whether there is any recoverable oil at all unless exploratory drilling is permitted, Government and industry estimates of the amount of oil in the region are as high as nine billion barrels, nearly as much as was in the Prudhoe Bay field before the pipeline opened in 1977.
The nine-billion-barrel figure, however, is by all accounts optimistic. The Interior Department study said the average of all estimates it had considered was 3.2 billion barrels.
In the eyes of the oil industry and its supporters, drilling in the refuge is particularly important now because production in the North Slope fields peaked last year at just under two million barrels a day, or about a quarter of all domestically produced oil and about an eighth of all oil consumed in the United States, and is expected to decline to less than half that within a decade. It would take at least six years to begin producing oil from the wildlife refuge.
 
Called a Turnpike in a Park
Oil-industry executives say that drilling in the refuge can be done in an environmentally sensitive way. Environmentalists contend that there are risks to wildlife, particularly the migrating caribou, and that no one yet knows the long-term effects of industrial development on the tundra. There is always the risk of a major spill from a pipeline or a production plant.
Moreover, environmentalists say that allowing oil development in the refuge is the equivalent of placing a stretch of the New Jersey Turnpike in a national park. No matter how carefully it is done, it will carry too high an esthetic price.
Both sides of the debate say the chances of a bill authorizing oil exploration will depend to a large extent on the course of events in the Middle East, from which the United States imports about 2.3 million barrels a day, at the low end of the estimate.
 
Intensely Negative Public Image
Environmental considerations aside, the oil industry's public image is still intensely negative. Some consumers and politicians have accused many companies of cashing in on the crisis in the Middle East by raising gasoline prices excessively, a charge the companies all deny.
The coastal plain has long been in a kind of legislative limbo. It has not been formally designated a protected wilderness area, as the rest of the refuge has. But no drilling is allowed pending the completion of extensive research by the Government and Congressional approval.
The Reagan Administration completed its research in 1987, when the Interior Department submitted a report to Congress concluding that the coastal area could be developed without significant impact on the environment. The report, which is being challenged in court by environmental groups, recommended that the Government begin selling oil-drilling leases in the region. The Bush Administration adopted the same position and is now seeking Congressional authorization.
 
Chance of Success Put at 19%
The 1987 report said there was a 19 percent chance of finding oil that would be economically feasible to recover, odds that are considered extremely favorable in an industry used to a success rate in exploration of no better than 5 percent.
All the big oil companies have done seismic and geological work in the region. The Chevron Corporation drilled an exploratory well on private land at the edge of the area several years ago. The results from the well are a corporate secret, but Chevron is among the companies most aggressively lobbying for the area to be opened.
For those who do not have access to sophisticated technical research, there is more immediate evidence right on the tundra: outcroppings of rock laced with oil, and spots where oil is seeping out of the ground. In addition, the coastal plain of the refuge is situated between confirmed oil finds. Besides the activity in the North Slope area to the west, the Canadian side of the Beaufort Sea to the east has been the scene of drilling activity in recent years, and some oil has been shipped out.
The oil companies with the most interest in the refuge are Chevron and those that have already invested heavily in the North Slope, including ARCO and the British Petroleum Company, which operate the Prudhoe Bay field jointly, and the Exxon Corporation, which has a big ownership stake in the North Slope fields.
 
A Big Find Would Be Economical
Any significant find would be highly economical because of the area's proximity to the 800-mile Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which transports crude from Prudhoe Bay and the rest of the North Slope south to Valdez to be loaded on tankers.
Industry executives say their 13 years of operating experience on the North Slope has proven that oil production, including the pipelines and roads that now crisscross the tundra, has not affected the caribou herds, waterfowl or any of the other animals in the region.
They also say that virtually every move they make on the tundra is heavily regulated.
''The environmental standards being applied in the oilfield are exemplary,'' said Scott Ronzio, an environmental scientist with ARCO.
But environmentalists are not giving up the fight. They say they see no evidence that the nation's concern with maintaining its remaining wilderness has ebbed significantly since the Valdez accident.
''There is a need to protect the land not just for wildlife and human recreation, but just to have it there,'' Ms. Jettmar of the Wilderness Society said.

HEADLINE: Soviet Army Wives Demonstrate in Germany

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BURG, East Germany, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Townspeople said the women marched onto a main street, attracting German television news cameras. But no action was taken against them, and at week's end soldiers and wives said there had been no official retaliation.
 
Pent-Up Frustration
Though the women said the protest was specifically against the prospect of moving into temporary housing in winter, some also said the eruption represented ''pent-up frustration at the hasty withdrawal.'' 
''Look at the Americans and British, their soldiers are withdrawing in an orderly way,'' said one young wife of a warrant officer. ''We're just being driven out with our children in the middle of winter, with nowhere to stay.''
The unit in Burg is part of a unilateral withdrawal announced by Moscow last year, and not part of the general withdrawal of Soviet forces expected after German unification. Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev agreed at a summit meeting in July that the Soviet forces, estimated at 360,000 men and 200,000 dependents, could withdraw over a four-year transition period.
 
Goodbye to Chocolate-Land
But the protest reflected a broader anxiety in the Soviet military about the transfer of the vast force in East Germany back to a homeland suffering from shortages and a lack of ready military housing. The difficulty of the move was reportedly the main reason Mr. Gorbachev sought to phase the withdrawal, and why West Germany agreed to build tens of thousands of new military housing units in the Soviet Union.
''There is uncertainty down to the last soldier,'' said Rainer Eppelmann, the East German Minister of Defense and Disarmament. ''They have to say goodbye to chocolate-land, and they face the prospect of returning to an impoverished homeland.''
Mr. Eppelmann reflected a widespread German assumption that the Soviet women were angered at leaving in part because as the wives of officers, which most of them are, they were earning up to 1,000 German marks a month (about $645 at current exchange rates) since the currencies of East and West Germany were merged on July 1. Soviet troops in East Germany were maintained by East Germany, and West Germany agreed to assume the responsibility after currency union.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
Excerpts From Baker Testimony on U.S. and Gulf

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 4

 BODY:
While the rules of the road developed during the cold war did in the end preserve peace - East-West in Europe - the task now is to build an enduring peace that is global in its scope and not limited just to Europe and not rooted in confrontation and tension. If we are to build a stable and more comprehensive peace, we must respond to the defining moments of this new era, recognizing the emerging dangers that are lurking before us.
We are entering an era in which ethnic and sectarian identities could easily breed new violence and new conflict. It is an era in which new hostilities and threats could erupt as misguided leaders are tempted to assert regional dominance before the ground rules of a new order can be accepted. 
Accordingly, Mr. Chairman, we face a simple choice. Do we want to live in a world where aggression is made less likely because it is met with a powerful response from the international community, a world where civilized rules of conduct apply? Or are we willing to live in a world where aggression can go unchecked, where aggression succeeds because we somehow cannot muster the collective will to challenge it?
Sadly, Saddam Hussein's attack on Kuwait will not be the last act of aggression that international society will face. So long as ruthless aggressors remain, the reality of international life is such - is that such predatory designs are going to emerge from time to time.
 
Design of a New Order
But the current crisis is the first opportunity to limit such dangers, to reinforce the standards for civilized behavior found in the United Nations Charter, and to help shape a more peaceful international order built on the promise of recent trends in Europe and elsewhere.
So it's our view, Mr. Chairman, that we must seize this opportunity to solidify the ground rules of the new order.
Second, from a strategic standpoint we must show that intimidation and force are not successful ways of doing business in the volatile Middle East or, for that matter, anywhere else.
The combination of unresolved regional conflicts, turbulent social and political changes, weapons of mass destruction and much of the world's energy supplies makes the Middle East particularly combustible. No one is immune from conflicts in the Middle East. And no one can feel safe when the danger of war escalating in the Middle East is so high.
If we want to encourage peaceful change, and to preserve the security of all of our friends in the area, we are going to have to remain a reliable partner for peace. We must help demonstrate that Saddam Hussein's violent way is an anachronism rather than the wave of the future.
Third, and perhaps most obviously, what is at stake economically is the dependence of the world on access to the energy resources of the Persian Gulf. The effects on our economy and our people, as I mentioned, are already being felt.
But this is not about increases in the price of a gallon of gas at the local service station. It is not just a narrow question of the flow of oil from Kuwait and Iraq. It is rather about a dictator who, acting alone and unchallenged, could strangle the global economic order, determining by fiat whether we all enter a recession or even the darkness of a depression.
 
Peril of World Recession
A sustained oil price spiral similar to what happened in 1973 and again in 1979 could easily cause higher inflation and interest rates worldwide, sending all of us into a sustained recessionary slide.
The burden could become particularly great for the new democracies of Eastern Europe, threatening to undo the democratic revolutions of 1989. It would also be painfully felt in the poorer countries of Central America, South Asia and Africa, threatening those who are now embracing market-oriented reforms and striving to improve living standards for their impoverished millions.
Once the present danger passes, however, we cannot let its lessons go unheeded. We have a responsibility, I think, to assure the American people that a decade from now their sons and daughters will not be put in jeopardy because we failed to work toward long-run solutions to the problems of the gulf.
The historic international consensus that we've built can become a solid foundation for successfully meeting our immediate objectives and for building a safer future. It can foster a future gulf environment that will protect our interests and help us avoid having to make this kind of massive diplomatic and military effort again.
In the long run, we seek a stable gulf in which the nations of that region and their peoples can live in peace and can live free of the fear of coercion. We seek a region in which change can occur and legitimate security concerns can be preserved, and preserved peacefully.
And we seek a region, Mr. Chairman, in which energy supplies flow freely. We will need to work together with Governments in the gulf and outside of it to build a more durable order.
We will want to insure that our friends in the area have the means to deter aggression and defend themselves, making it less necessary to send American men and women to help them. And we will work with the rest of the regional and international communityto prevent further Iraqi expansionism as well as Iraqi efforts to acquire and produce weapons of mass destruction.

U.S. Officials Begin Tour to Seek Financial Backing for Gulf Force

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 4

 BODY:

 
A Critical Need
But the officials said the United States was anxious to obtain French and British endorsement of the principle of financial as well as political ''burden sharing'' in the crisis before seeking contributions from Japan, West Germany and other Western allies.
Officials speaking to reporters on Mr. Brady's flight from Washington to Paris said a critical need was to get commitments for $10 billion or more to provide aid to Turkey, Jordan and Egypt, The Associated Press reported. An official traveling with Mr. Brady said other third world countries, including the Eastern Europe nations and countries like Brazil and the Philippines, would probably receive economic help, A.P. said. 
At the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Brussels today, the United States also asked its allies to lend ships and aircraft to help transport troops and equipment to the Gulf region. NATO officials said Britain, Italy and Portugal immediately offered help.
 
Aid for the Needy
For the moment, though, the European Community is concentrating on an aid package for countries badly hit by the gulf crisis, notably Egypt, Jordan and Turkey but also poorer nations that have been hurt by the increased world price of oil. Community foreign ministers are to meet Friday in Rome to discuss the plan.
Egypt has been hurt by the loss of remittances from Egyptians working in Iraq, Jordan by the loss of trade with Iraq and the burden of fleeing refugees, and Turkey by the loss of income from an Iraqi oil pipeline that crosses its territory and has been closed. The community is expected to offer up to $1 billion in aid to each.
As Mr. Brady arrived, France said today that it favored sending emergency medical and food aid to Iraq under the auspices of the United Nations. Mr. Dumas said emergency aid was contemplated in Security Council resolutions ordering the trade embargo against Iraq. Baghdad has warned that foreign hostages in Iraq will be hurt by any shortages resulting from the embargo.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
Hostage Evacuation Flights Resume From Iraqi Capital

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Sept. 4

 BODY:

 
Evacuation Is Resumed
''We're moving again,'' said a Western diplomat who for the last several days has been working with colleagues to arrange transportation for the foreigners and to obtain authorization for their movement from Iraq.
For more than a week, the task of getting the women and children to freedom has at times overshadowed other aspects of the Persian Gulf crisis as the confrontation between the United States and Iraq simmered at a tense stalemate.
Worsening security and living conditions in Kuwait are creating a sense of urgency among the diplomats. As many as 11,000 foreigners from Western countries and Japan are believed to be stuck in Kuwait, most of them hiding in fear of being rounded up by Iraqi security forces. 
About 1,400 of these are American women and children. Two hundred are British and there are several hundred other foreign women and children.
 
Norway Evacuating Embassy
This evening, Norway announced that it was ''temporarily evacuating'' its embassy in Kuwait because the situation had become intolerable.
Norway and about 20 other countries refused an Iraqi order 12 days ago to close their embassies in Kuwait, because they felt that doing so would be a tacit acceptance of the takeover by President Hussein.
Iraq cut off the electricity and water to the embassies, limited their telephone service, surrounded them with troops and said that the diplomats were subject to being detained if they left the embassy grounds.
Peter Raeder, the charge d'affaires of the Norwegian Embassy here in Baghdad, said in an interview tonight that he would appeal to Iraq on Wednesday ''to let the diplomats in our mission go safely from Kuwait and not be molested or troubled in any way.'' #11 Living in Embassy Three Norwegian diplomats, including Ambassador Hans Wilhelm Langva, and eight staff members are living in the embassy, Mr. Raeder said. He said they would probably try to leave on Thursday.
East Germany closed its embassy in Kuwait two days ago, and its diplomats were permitted to enter the East German Embassy in Baghdad.
Some diplomats said they believed that the Norwegian decision could be the beginning of the end of the diplomatic resistance in Kuwait and that several other nations might give up the struggle in the next few days.
''The European Economic Community countries are meeting to discuss whether to leave,'' one diplomat said.
 
Burning the Furniture
Some diplomats say they think it is unlikely that the United States Embassy in Kuwait, with eight diplomats and about 20 Americans who have sought asylum, can hold out for much more than a week. By last weekend, the Americans there were breaking up embassy desks and chairs for firewood to boil swimming pool water for drinking.
President Saddam Hussein announced early in the crisis that foreign men, women and children, would be detained in Iraq in the hope that their presence would deter President Bush from ordering an attack by American troops gathering in Saudi Arabia.
 
A Question on Television
Then, 12 days ago, during a televised meeting with the President, a woman among the hostages, whom the Iraqis describe as guests, asked Mr. Hussein if he would consider releasing the women and children. Within a few hours, Mr. Hussein announced that the women could go. He also said foreign citizens of Iraqi origin, including men, were free to leave.
But the other male foreigners, among them husbands and fathers of the women and children allowed to leave, Iraq said, would have to stay in the country, many of them quartered at strategic military and industrial installations, ''as long as this crisis continues.''
The last of the charters to leave today was a Boeing 707 carrying 28 Americans, most of them Iraqi-born American citizens, plus more than 80 Britons and other Europeans, and 18 citizens of Commonwealth countries. It took off for Amman from Saddam Hussein International Airport at about 11:30 P.M., more than four hours behind schedule. [The Americans and Britons, together with Irish and Australian citizens, then headed to London, Reuters reported from Amman.] One of the Iraqi-born Americans who was flying out, Matti Matti, a 67-year-old Chicago businessman, hugged relatives in the vast chrome and marble terminal and said he had feared he might get caught in a war.
''Of course I was scared,'' he said. ''But I was also thinking that maybe nothing would happen.''
He said the relatives he was leaving behind were ''very much worried'' about the prospect of war.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
For Asians, Gulf Is Fickle Godmother

BYLINE: By SANJOY HAZARIKA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Sept. 4

 BODY:
Many in Kuwait and Iraq, especially ordinary workers, are returning virtually destitute to their homes, unable to draw on savings that are locked in Kuwaiti banks. Their new unemployment is likely to create major social and economic problems in South Asia because their earnings often supported large families.
 
Supporting 11 Back Home
A Bangladesh newspaper, Dialogue, estimated that each Bangladeshi in the Middle East supports about 11 people back home, compared with 3 people for every Indian employed there or about 7 for each Pakistani or Sri Lankan. Many families ''whose bread-earners are in Kuwait and Iraq are already desperate,'' the paper said. 
Every day, special flights evacuate hundreds of Indians and Pakistanis who were stranded in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Sri Lanka, battered by ethnic unrest, says it is unable to afford a large-scale evacuation and has told its nationals to stay where they are and not to panic.
''Our people don't want to stay on, we have nothing to offer them back home, and we are not in a position to evacuate them,'' said a senior Sri Lankan diplomat here.
The remittances from the Middle East converted scores of impoverished villages and towns across South Asia into little enclaves of prosperity with gleaming new houses of marble, brick and cement replacing mud and thatch huts.
 
Property Prices Soar
Television sets, washing machines, videos, air conditioners and brand new cars announce the new-found wealth of the ''gulf-returned,'' as those who lived and worked in the Middle East were known. An Indian living in Kuwait or Dubai was regarded as a prize catch on the marriage market.
Property prices soared, pushing up the cost of living all around, especially in the state of Kerala in southern India, from which about 700,000 people have gone to work in the Middle East.
While Pakistan and Bangladesh are sending troops to Saudi Arabia to oppose President Hussein, India has criticized the invasion as well as its neighbors for the decision to send troops and the United States for its role in the crisis. While calling for a pullout of Iraqi troops, New Delhi has refused to use harsh words against Iraq.
External Affairs Minister Inder Gujral, who has visited Baghdad and Kuwait since the invasion, explained India's quandary in a television interview on Sunday night: ''Strong words would have put my own people in jeopardy.''
 
Blow to Exchange Reserves
The Middle East, especially Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Oman, have seen the principal concentrations of Indians and Pakistanis, mostly laborers like poor carpenters and masons, seeking to fashion a new life for themselves. The disruption of their lives means that foreign remittances, which are crucial for South Asia's foreign exchange reserves, will be slashed.
There has been, however, an initial burst of new savings in Indian banks by some Indians in the Middle East seeking to secure their money. According to one estimate, they have sent back more than $400 million since the crisis began.
The Pakistani Government has announced an initial payment of 6,000 rupees, about $290, to each earning member of a Pakistani family who has returned home from Kuwait or Iraq. The goal is to encourage them to become self-reliant.
''It is a major loss to us,'' a senior Pakistani official in Islamabad said in a telephone interview. ''Pakistanis in the Middle East send $2 billion back home, and of this figure, 15 percent came from Iraq and Kuwait.''

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
Soviets Suggest Conference Combining Issues of Mideast

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 4

 BODY:

 
Longtime Source of Contention
The Kremlin's proposal for an international conference was long a cold-war bone of contention, with Israel maintaining strict opposition to such a forum as a means of addressing the Palestinian question.
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has been denounced by the United States for saying that consideration of a military retreat from Kuwait must be contingent upon an Israeli withdrawal from territory occupied in previous Middle East wars.
In his speech, Mr. Shevardnadze gave no indication whether President Mikhail S. Gorbachev might pursue this point at his summit meeting with President Bush in Helsinki on Sunday.
''Presumably, Israel's agreement to its convocation could exert a positive influence on the overall situation in the Middle East and on efforts to defuse the crisis,'' Mr. Shevardnadze said, renewing the proposal for an international meeting on the Middle East. 
''For its part, the Soviet Union would not leave without response an Israeli move along these lines and might take a fresh look at the issue of Soviet-Israeli relations,'' he said, apparently referring to the question of restoring Moscow's diplomatic links with Israel. Relations were severed after the 1967 war in the Middle East.
 
Support for U.N. Effort
The move to link the conference proposal to the Kuwait crisis was something of a surprise, coming as it did only five days before the one-day Helsinki summit meeting, which is expected to emphasize Moscow-Washington agreement over how best to press Mr. Hussein to retreat from Kuwait.
Mr. Shevardnadze stressed that the Soviet Union felt ''duty bound'' by the United Nations Security Council resolutions condemning Iraq and pressing for a diplomatic settlement.
''Even hypothetically we should not acquiesce in any option that would fall short of restoring the sovereignty, territorial integrity and legitimate Government of Kuwait,'' he said, urging political approaches to ''remove the military presence of other countries.''
In the last week, a few Soviet officials have departed from the Kremlin's quiet tolerance of the Bush Administration's military buildup in Saudi Arabia, saying the buildup could continue after the crisis and jeopardize Soviet-American progress in disarmament.
But Mr. Gorbachev has made a point of saying before the summit meeting that the White House moved at the invitation of Saudi Arabia and in conformity with the United Nations Charter, and that there has been no flagging in Soviet-American cooperation.
 
List of 'Interlocking Problems'
Mr. Shevardnadze said the ''complex interlocking problems'' included ''the Arab-Israeli conflict, the fate of the Palestinians and the tragedy in Lebanon,'' all of them aggravated by ''critically high'' amounts of arms.
''Quite a few extraregional states, including the great powers, have contributed to that situation,'' he said.
''After one more look at the situation we still have come to the same conclusion,'' he said, saying that the Gorbachev Government feels the need to increase pressure for an international conference on the Middle East ''without deferring for a subsequent period'' the United Nations' efforts to bring about a comprehensive settlement.
Diplomatic efforts ''unquestionably'' deserve priority in tackling the Kuwait crisis, Mr. Shevardnadze said, while adding: ''The course at a peaceful settlement should in no way imply that the aggressor has nothing to fear.''
Predicting that the summit meeting in Helsinki would ''mark a major milestone on the road toward resolving the crisis,'' Mr. Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union was convinced that the sanctions against Iraq would work.
 
Baker Cool to Conference
WASHINGTON, Sept. 4 (Special to The New York Times) - In an interview with NBC News, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d appeared today to dismiss the proposal by Mr. Shevardnadze to convene an international conference.
Mr. Baker said that an ''extraordinary degree of international consensus'' already existed for dealing with Iraq and that considering all the actions taken by the United Nations so far ''we almost have an international conference.''
In what seemed to be a polite way of dismissing Mr. Shevardnadze's proposal, the Secretary said, ''We would like to see a little bit more of what the Soviets have in mind.''
 
Shevardnadze Arrives for Talks
TOKYO, Sept. 4 (Special to The New York Times) - Foreign Minister Shevardnadze arrived here tonight to begin three days of talks that Tokyo hopes will thaw decades of frigid relations before next year, when President Gorbachev becomes the first Soviet leader to visit Japan.
Both Japanese and Soviet officials here played down the likelihood of any major progress on the one issue that has kept Japanese money and technology out of Mr. Gorbachev's reach: the continuing dispute over four northern islands that the Soviet Union claimed in the last days of World War II. But the tempo of discussions about the islands has accelerated recently.
On Monday Ivan Frolov, a Politburo member and chief editor of the newspaper Pravda, said Mr. Gorbachev would bring with him ''something historic'' in his visit to Tokyo, scheduled for next spring. But Japanese officials say there has been little indication that the Soviets have any inclination to return the islands.

HEADLINE: Conservation, Not Nuclear, Will Stop Oil Binge

 BODY:
Also, in the 45-year history of atomic energy, nobody has found a way to dispose of nuclear waste safely. About 20,000 metric tons of nuclear waste sits today in heavily guarded spent-fuel pools around the country awaiting a national repository site. In the same Aug. 19 edition (Week in Review), you report that New York State couldn't find a place to dispose of the low-level nuclear waste it produces, ''enough low-level waste,'' you say, ''to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool every year.'' 
By the time you have factored in all the hidden costs - the Three Mile Island cleanup, for example, cost $4 billion; Federal subsidies over 30 years totaled $40 billion; a national waste repository could cost $20 billion -atomic energy has turned into an atomic boondoggle.
Fortunately, we do have a low-cost resource available to reduce our excessive reliance on desert despots: conservation.
Thirty percent of all the oil used in the United States goes to power automobiles. In a May 22, 1989, editorial you argued that increasing the standards for automobile fuel efficiency by even one mile a gallon would save 420,000 barrels of gasoline per day. And, applying existing technologies more broadly could enable new cars to average 45 miles per gallon, which would reduce demand for oil by 6.5 million barrels a day, or 50 percent more than the daily output of both Iraq and Kuwait before Saddam Hussein's armies invaded. We could take other important steps to reduce our oil appetite and protect the environment. Federal legislation of the kind shunned by the Reagan and Bush Administrations could encourage better home insulation, efficient lighting and weatherization, not to mention mass transit. Investments in community and home conservation programs should be included in utility rate bases so that local power companies will be motivated to ''sell'' not only electricity, but also conservation.
A barrel of energy saved is as cost-effective as a barrel produced - and environmentally preferable. This country needs a conservation program that works.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Taxpayers Don't Want an Explanation, but Relief

 BODY:
The Florio budget includes $33 million more in state funds for several Bergen County school districts. This was a discriminatory move, prompted by the Governor's need to win legislative backing for his new school funding formula, and but for this, we would not have needed a sales tax on paper products.
As for the Governor's new school-funding formula, I don't argue against more funds for the state's 30 neediest school districts, but it is questionable if several hundred other districts can spend the funds properly. Would it not have been wiser to set aside a sum to pay for special programs, such as nutrition and early-childhood education, in particular school districts? 
In last year's gubernatorial campaign, Jim Florio said he would not raise taxes because he felt confident an audit of state government operations would show areas of fat that could be trimmed. Now it appears his staff hopes to save only $100 million, and that is not even sure. In addition, why is the Governor having only 11 of 19 departments audited?
His popularity is plummeting not only because of massive tax increases, but also because the people of New Jersey feel betrayed by a Governor who was unprepared for a fiscal crunch, did not review the alternatives in an orderly manner before raising taxes and then reneged on his promise to conduct an audit.
Mr. Florio's popularity among New Jerseyans dropped to its lowest after his appearance on prime-time television last week to ''explain'' his economic policy. That's because taxpayers are not looking for an explanation. They are looking for relief from an unwarranted financial burden. And they are not willing to wait 10 years to get it.

HEADLINE: Hey, America, Lighten Up a Little

BYLINE: The following was adapted from an unsigned editorial that appeared in the July 28 issue of The Economist.

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
America attracts such bile partly because it is more self-critical than other nations. Hypocrisy is often in the eye of the beholder: how dare a European look down his nose at a country to whose universities his brightest fellow-citizens flock? Foreign criticism often attacks American habits that the critics happily adopt a few years later: from refrigerators and Elvis Presley to negative campaigning and aerobics. To criticize America is to criticize what the future holds in store.
Misgivings about the direction in which some of America's ''culture'' is heading arise precisely because the American way today tends to be the way of the world tomorrow. By culture, we mean not painting and music, but way of living. The worry is about what might be called a ''decadent Puritanism'' within America: an odd combination of ducking responsibility and telling everyone else what to do. 
The decadence lies in too readily blaming others for problems, rather than accepting responsibility oneself. America's litigiousness is virtually banishing the concept of bad luck: a hotel refuses to allow an able-bodied guest to swim in its shallow rooftop pool because there is no lifeguard on duty. A drunken driver can sue his host for allowing him to get drunk.
If a prominent citizen becomes an alcoholic or is caught indulging some illegal appetite, he all too often claims he is a victim, not a fool. The habit of pleading insanity as an excuse for a crime is spreading. Increasingly, too, people are blaming their genes and finding sympathetic (and often foolish) scientific support. The exaggerated claims by a few scientists that they have found ''genes for alcoholism,'' or aggression, are well couched to prevent people taking the rap for their own actions.
To allow legal redress for negligence, or to seek to rehabilitate rather than punish victims - these are worthy aims. But fair redress is not always appropriate; sometimes the buck must simply stop. Just as an over-padded welfare state breeds a habit of blaming and expecting help from government, so America's legalism breeds the shifting of burdens onto someone else. It saps initiative from the economy quite as effectively as the state-sponsored variety.
Another facet of this phenomenon is the warped idea that the problem with America's underclass is a lack of self-esteem, and that the answer to poor educational performance is to teach more self-esteem. Bunk. The characteristic that in the past drove generations of immigrants from the underclass to prosperity was not self-esteem, it was self-discipline. The reason that Japanese schoolchildren - and the children of Asian immigrants in America - learn so much more than their American counterparts is discipline, not self-esteem.
To see how far such evasiveness has caught on, look at the new abundance of euphemism. Prisons have become ''rehabilitative correctional facilities,'' housewives are ''homemakers,'' deaf people are ''hearing impaired,'' a cerebral palsy society tells journalists never to use the word ''suffer'' about those with that ''disease'' (forbidden), ''affliction'' (forbidden), condition (allowed). Jargon cannot alter reality. How refreshing to hear a politician who favors both abortion and the death penalty described bluntly as ''pro-death.''
Take race. There are few countries anywhere on earth in which people are generally less prejudiced about color than Americans, stereotypes of the Old South and Bensonhurst notwithstanding. Yet there are few countries where the issue looms so large; where pressure groups are so quick to take offense at a careless remark or where words are made to carry such a weight of meaning. ''Black'' is fast following ''Negro'' into the lexicon of the forbidden, to be replaced by ''African-American'' in the never-ending search for a label without overtones. Some universities, egged on by their students, have recently imposed disgraceful restrictions on free speech rather than let bigots speak out on campus and be judged for what they are.
As for Puritanism, America's search for fairness has begun to conflict with its famous tolerance for new peoples, new ideas and new technologies. A conformist tyranny of the majority, an intolerance of any eccentricity, is creeping into America, the West Coast in particular. An increasingly Puritanical approach to art, married to a paranoid suspicion of child abuse, has made a photographer who takes pictures of parents with their children naked on the beach into a target for the F.B.I.
Add to that sort of thing the ruthless prudishness of the television networks about anything except gratuitous violence, and the gradual assertion of ''correct'' ways of thinking about such things as smoking and affirmative action. It all adds up to a culture of conformity that would rather bore than shock.
A television scriptwriter recently admitted that he put cigarettes into the hands only of baddies. A whole industry of pressure groups has arisen to persuade TV producers to push ''correct'' ideas on their (fictional) programs: smoking is bad for you; concern for the homeless is right; plastic bags are bad for the environment. All true, and all admirable. But fiction is fiction, not cautionary tales.
As Americans get ever richer, they seem to grow more risk-averse, so that they become paranoid about hazardous waste in their district, obsessed with their cholesterol levels, and ready to spend large premiums for organic vegetables. It being a free world, they are welcome to do so, even if the risks from hazardous waste are exaggerated or the risks from natural carcinogens in organic vegetables greater than from pesticides. But must they become killjoys in the process?
None of these things is confined to America, but - like everything else - they breed faster and more lushly in America. And now the infection has spread to politicians, who have discovered that a quick way to television prominence is to take outraged offense at every imagined slight. Careers can collapse because of a single ''gaffe'' that does not pass some ideological litmus test. Television seems to have done its best to drive humor out of politics. Can you imagine Lyndon Johnson getting away with half of his witticisms today? If we are all to enjoy the 21st century, America must lighten up a bit.

HEADLINE: Cuomo's Campaign: Crime? Taxes? Look Elsewhere

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

DATELINE: ALBANY, Sept. 4

 BODY:
Many political analysts say Mr. Cuomo, who is frequently mentioned as a possible Presidential contender, is well advised to handle such issues gingerly during this year's gubernatorial campaign.
''It's an incumbent's strategy,'' said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie. ''If you're running well and your challenger's not, keep the intensity of the campaign low.''
A low-key campaign that addresses broad national themes, like Social Security tax cuts, makes sense for Mr. Cuomo from a national perspective as well, political analysts say. 
''How he handles issues like savings and loans and the Moynihan Social Security tax cut plan, all that gets watched here,'' said Mike McCurry, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee in Washington. In contrast, Mr. McCurry said, the Governor's handling of local issues, like New York State taxes, do not receive much attention outside the state.
 
Lessons in Other States
For a longtime incumbent like Mr. Cuomo, the need to distance himself from the state's problems is well illustrated by the fate of several other Northeastern governors.
In Connecticut, Vermont and Massachusetts, the incumbent Governors - William A. O'Neill, Madeleine Kunin and Michael S. Dukakis - all declined to seek re-election this year, at least in part because their popularity declined together with the regional economy.
Even aides to Mr. Cuomo acknowledge privately that crime and economics are issues that a strong opponent could use against the Governor. During Mr. Cuomo's tenure the state built a record number of prison cells, yet during the same period instances of violent crime rose by 20 percent. And while the state's income tax rates have fallen since Mr. Cuomo took office almost eight years ago, state taxes have grown steadily as a proportion of New Yorkers' incomes - from $7.20 of every $100 earned by state residents in 1983 to $7.70 last year.
Polls taken in recent weeks by the Marist Institute show that New Yorkers now rank the economy as the most important issue facing state government, with crime and drugs next. Those polls also show that Mr. Cuomo's approval ratings, while high for a Governor in office eight years, have fallen significantly from four years ago.
But Mr. Cuomo's Republican challenger, Pierre A. Rinfret, a political novice, has been unable to make his attacks stick, even on issues on which the Governor is considered most vulnerable. The effect has been to give Mr. Cuomo almost total control over how the issues of the campaign are cast.
 
Controlling the Spotlight
Typical of Mr. Cuomo's low-intensity style in this campaign are his earliest commercials. One radio advertisement discusses highway safety improvements during Mr. Cuomo's tenure -14,000 miles of road have been repaired since he took office - and urges motorist to drive carefully. A television commercial that took to the air last month does not even mention Mr. Cuomo's campaign or discuss his eight years in office. Instead it focuses on the proposed $1.9 billion environmental bond issue that voters will be asked to approve in November.
The commercials stand in stark contrast to the Governor's early commercials during the 1986 campaign. In those, he discussed his economic record and boasted of the number of jobs created during his first term.
Mr. Cuomo insists that he is spending campaign funds on advertisments for the environmental bond act because it is a worthy cause - and one potentially in trouble - not because the promotion fits into some overarching political strategy.
But others are skeptical. Environmentalists, some of whom have been the Governor's most outspoken critics, say the bond issue represents Mr. Cuomo's effort to link himself with a cause that tends to win support across party lines. And political strategists note that the commercials seem to elevate the Governor above the political fray, a move that has come to represent the peak of political savvy.
 
Focusing on Others
''What he's doing is a public service, but it's also good politics,'' said Hank Morris, a political consultant.
In his many swings across the state this summer - swings that have not been labeled campaign events but that have clearly had that purpose - Mr. Cuomo has not entirely avoided vexing issues like crime and the economy. Indeed, he has often introduced the subjects himself. But he has minimized discussion of his own actions and has focused on that of others.
Speaking recently in Schenectady, for example, Mr. Cuomo said he sympathized with other government officials in ''this time of reduced revenues.''
''Sixteen states are already in recession, 37 states are in big trouble,'' he said. ''The United States Government is suffering economically. That's why the President had to give up his pledge. He didn't want to. He didn't want to change his mind about taxes, but the economy was in such bad shape.''
In case the Schenectady audience was still tempted to concentrate on the Governor's responsibility for the state's economic problems or its high taxes, Mr. Cuomo directed their attention to the State Legislature. ''Every year the budget is higher than the Governor asked for,'' he said. ''Over the last eight years it's been $1.1 billion more than I asked for.''
 
Spreading the Blame
On crime and drugs, Mr. Cuomo has pressed recently for a Federal campaign to put anti-drug programming on prime-time television.
''How about giving us an hour every night, a half hour every night, prime time, where you get everybody in the country at the same time and say, 'We're going to talk to you about drugs.' '' Mr. Cuomo said to a group of police chiefs recently. ''All right, you can't talk the networks into it; they all want to make a profit. So raise $5 billion in tax money. You're going to do $500 billion to bail out the savings and loans.''
Political strategists say the Governor's technique of spreading the blame for New York State's problems is one that is likely to work well because, in the end, most voters do not expect Mr. Cuomo to solve the problems of a sagging economy or a soaring crime rate anyway. What they do demand from him is that he offer the reassurance that he is concerned about the situation and has it under control. And creating the perception of caring and control is, most political strategists agree, what Governor Cuomo does best.
''When Mario Cuomo talks about these things, you feel that something is being done,'' said David Garth, a political consultant. ''That is perception, and it's part of his gift.'' Even if Mr. Cuomo leaves vague just how he plans to solve the problems, Mr. Garth said, ''he gives, when he talks, the promise of performance.''

HEADLINE: 2 Contenders at Hartford Debate Claim an Edge in Ability

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Sept. 4

 BODY:
The hourlong debate, which was taped here for broadcast on Connecticut Public Television, marked one of the few moments of complete even-handedness in what has been through the spring and summer a wildly out-of-balance race. Until today, Mr. Morrison, a far better-financed and better-known candidate who also has the backing of the party, had displayed an almost complete disregard for Mr. Cibes as a threat.
For one hour, however, they were simply two men in suits who want to be governor, apparently equal before the eye of the camera.
On topics including education, crime and how the state can the business climate to attract jobs, Mr. Cibes repeatedly returned to what he described as a stone wall that cannot be broken through without dramatic change - the tax system. 
The 8 percent sales tax and 13.8 percent corporate tax are already among the highest in the nation and cannot be raised much further, he argued. With a shortfall in revenues that could approach $800 million next spring, or more than 10 percent of the total state budget of just over $7 billion, the question the next governor will have to face is what to save and how to save it.
''The people want someone who is willing to make hard choices,'' Mr. Cibes said. ''It's the hard truth that we need to undertake tax reform.''
Mr. Morrison said the main difference in perspective that he would bring to the budget problems is that new taxes would be a last resort, and not a first strike. He said he would impose an immediate hiring freeze and work to increase efficiency in spending, so that revenues will go further. ''We will squeeze the dollars in Hartford harder,'' he said.
As for sparks, only on the question of the candidates' experience and perspectives on government in the 80's was there anything close to acrimony. Mr. Morrison repeatedly tried to link Mr. Cibes, a longtime confidant and campaign adviser to Gov. William A. O'Neill, with what Mr. Morrison described as the failed policies of the last few years under the O'Neill administration.
 
Role in Raising Taxes
He said Mr. Cibes, whose political experence has all been in Connecticut, including 12 years in the General Assembly, did not understand Washington or the ways in which aid for the state might be used by a governor with connections.
He reminded viewers that Mr. Cibes, as co-chairman of the Assembly Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, was the ''architect and engineer'' of the record tax increases last year. The increases, including raising the sales tax from 7.5 to 8 percent, aroused animosty among residents, and according to opinion polls were a major reason for Mr. O'Neill's steep decline in popularity. Mr. O'Neill stopped his drive for re-election in March.
Mr. Cibes, who said he was not apologetic about the increases because they saved important services and education grants to towns, said Mr. Morrison was out of touch with the state.
He also tried to link Mr. Morrison, a former legal-assistance lawyer to the poor who has represented the Third Congressional District since 1983, with Government decisions to cut back local and state aid, policies that Mr. Cibes said had battered Connecticut and worsened the economy. ''You really don't have enough experience about what has been going on in this state over the last 10 years,'' Mr. Cibes said.
Another point concerned whether Mr. Cibes's tax plan would mean increases or cuts. Mr. Cibes said the main point was that cutting the corporate and sales taxes was an immediate priority to try and keep businesses in the state. The trade-off is the income tax, which he said would raise the bottom-line tax payment for a family earning $100,000 about 1.5 percent, or $1,500.
Mr. Morrison, who has proposed a referendum on the income tax before action in Hartford, said the major point was that most people would pay more and that they would have no choice about it.

HEADLINE: New York Post Owner Issues Ultimatum on Costs

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
Mr. Kalikow's representatives asked the unions for $27 million in annual savings, said someone at the meeting who spoke on condition that he not be identified, but a statement by Richard T. Nasti, the paper's general manager, released late yesterday put the figure at $25 million.
''This is a bitter pill for the unions,'' said Theodore H. Kheel, a lawyer who is an unpaid adviser to the Allied Printing Trades Council, an umbrella organization that includes the 10 unions at The Post, The Daily News and The New York Times.
 
Unions Aren't Blamed
At yesterday's meeting, Mr. Kalikow's representives presented union leaders with a plan for savings from each union, though they said that Mr. Kalikow was willing to negotiate on how the savings could be achieved. 
Mr. Kheel said the only positive note was that Mr. Kalikow had not blamed union excesses for the paper's financial situation and had indicated that he was flexible as to how the savings might be created.
But the savings could mean a combination of reduced overtime and salaries, reduced staffing requirements and layoffs for the paper's approximately 1,000 unionized employess.
A spokesman for Mr. Kalikow said he was not available for comment.
Union officials said they did not want to discuss specifics of what Mr. Kalikow had proposed until consulting with their members.
Mr. Kalikow's demand is reminiscent of a similar ultimatum in February 1988 when Rupert Murdoch, then the paper's owner, demanded $24 million in savings that he said were necessary before he could sell the paper to Mr. Kalikow. Unions gave Mr. Murdoch most of what he asked, and Mr. Kalikow acquired the paper for about $37 million.
Mr. Kalikow's representatives said he had invested about $120 million in the paper. At the time that he sold it, Mr. Murdoch said he had lost about $150 million during his 11 years as owner of The Post.
For unions, Mr. Kalikow's demands create a difficult problem that goes beyond the potential loss of jobs and wages at The Post.
Union leaders said they were concerned that The News and The Times, which have also been financially damaged by the slowdown in the regional economy, would seek any concessions granted at The Post.
 
Books to Be Examined
Spokesmen at both The Times and The News declined to comment yesterday.
In the statement, Mr. Nasti said union leaders would be allowed to examine The Post's books.
About 10 days ago, Mr. Kalikow arranged for the resignation of Valerie B. Salembier, the paper's president, in order to save money.
Both union leaders and representatives of Mr. Kalikow described yesterday's meeting as cordial and frank, without the bitterness that has characterized the unions' stalled negotiations with The News, which have been under way since January.
''This is a case of rational people sitting down and doing what must be done to preserve jobs and keep the paper running,'' Mr. Nasti said in his statement.

Chain letter indeed! It's a joke that in 1990 people still fall for them. And a stellar cast had fallen for this one. Leafing through the stack of letters, I was amazed by the eclectic assortment of correspondence. Barry Slotnick, the lawyer, sent along a slightly risque poem about Mary and how she ended up with a little lamb. The comedian Jackie Mason, not wanting a jinx two weeks before his show opened in Los Angeles, responded: ''Oy vey! I am so nauseous that I got this &*a&%N chain letter, but I am not taking any chances.''
Then there were effusive epistles from Oliver Stone, the Oscar-winning director; Depeche Mode, the rock band; Tom Smothers and Dick Martin, the comedians, and such corporate honchos as the chief executive of Lord & Taylor and the chairman of Macy's. No wonder the mail's late. 
Four days have come and gone. Have I won the lottery? No. Have I been brushed with bad luck? No. And I can't say I'm waiting for it to happen. But on the way home from work yesterday, I found myself crossing the street to avoid a black cat. Just in case. ALAN W. PETRUCELLI
Conversation overheard by Suzanne Gran in Bloomingdale country. The speakers, two women of a certain age, exiting from a movie theater.
Woman One: ''The way they talk now! I've never heard such language!''
Woman Two: ''Dirty doesn't bother me. Dirty I can take. It's the way he treated his brother.''
Herewith, positively the last words on those strange sentences created to use the entire alphabet in as few words as possible, and used primarily for checking typewriter keys.
The following pair - submitted by Daniel K. Weiller, Jane Hannauer and Lucille Sutton, among others - use proper names, which some spoilsports insist is cheating. On the other hand, the sentences weigh in at 29 and 28 letters respectively, which is commendable indeed. Without further ado: ''Quick, wafting zephyrs vex bold Jim.'' ''Waltz, nymph, for quick jigs vex Bud.'' Somehow we're still fond of brown foxes jumping over lazy dogs.

Dear Diary:
Hiking resolutely toward the Wednesday Greenmarket in Union Square, I'm passing the offices of Calet, Hirsch & Spector on Park Avenue South. (An unemployed copywriter, I'm especially alert when passing large ad agencies). A handsome woman stands looking out from behind the glass doors. She acknowledges me and I do a double take, because she is clad in the unmistakable uniform of a doorman.
I screech to a halt and put my Pro Walkers in reverse. I meet her eye and inquire, through the glass, ''Door Person?'' Without missing a beat she nods yes and a lovely smile lights her face.
I walk on toward the fresh vegetables, marveling that yet another barrier has fallen. JAMIE SCOTT

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Harder Times, Softer Politics

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
In the 26 years from 1947 to 1973, the authors point out, average family incomes rose by 111 percent. But in the last 16 years, they have edged up just 9 percent. And even this marginal increase has come at considerable effort. Virtually the entire gain is attributable to the entry of middle-class housewives into the paid labor force. 
That is only part of the bad news. Since the 19th century, the ''trickle-down'' of wealth from sucessful businesses had had a leveling effect: A disproportionate share of the gains from American economic growth ended up in the pockets of workers. But since the mid-1970's trickle-up has replaced trickle-down. In 1973 the poorest 40 percent of families took home 17 percent of income, while the richest 20 percent pocketed 41 percent. By 1988 the share of the poorest 40 percent had slipped to 15 percent, while the share of the top fifth had grown to 44 percent.
The ground lost, the two economists note, has been almost entirely at the expense of the young. The typical family with a head in the 25- to 34-year-old bracket earned 2 percent less in 1987 than in 1973. And among the young, the poorly educated bore the brunt: The one family in six whose primary breadwinner did not finish high school earned a stunning 29 percent less.
Lagging incomes translate into lagging living standards. Since 1973 the percentage of families owning homes has slipped for every age group under 55. Those in the 25 to 29 group have been most dramatically hit, with the percentage of homeowners slipping to 35 from 44. Young workers are also much more likely to fall between the cracks in the health insurance system. In one 28-month period spanning 1985 through 1987, 28 percent of Americans were covered for less than the full 28 months. Among 18- to 24-year-olds, however, 52 percent suffered from interruptions in coverage.
Why has this economic malaise had so little political impact? More specifically, why was President Reagan not touched by high mortgage rates, exploding college tuition costs and a lack of affordable day care? And why has President Bush, a leader known for keeping one finger on the public pulse at all times, resisted a cut in payroll taxes while pushing for a cut in the levy on capital gains?
One answer is that the best organized group of lower- and middle-income Americans, retirees over 65, have been bought off with Medicare and fatter Social Security checks. Another is that the labor movement represents a shrinking proportion of workers. And in the process of downsizing, the image of unions has changed: Once seen as the defender of the working class, they must now compete for influence with other, equally well-financed interest groups.
Frank Levy, an economist at the University of Maryland, offers an entirely different explanation: Eroding living standards have indeed had a political impact, but popular frustrations have been deflected in unexpected directions.
Voters may not blame the President. But they apparently do blame state and local governments, which have had an increasingly difficult time raising taxes to pay for badly needed local services. By the same token, unfocused economic frustrations may also play a large part in the public's anger over ''unfair'' competition from Japan and other rapidly developing export economies.
Ironically, the hard-pressed middle class may well be the biggest beneficiary from access to cheap imported clothes, shoes, appliances and autos. But then, irony is nothing new to the American political system, which for better or worse has always been successful in fragmenting and diffusing class interests.

New Valid Logic President Wants More Market Share

BYLINE: BY Lawrence M. Fisher

 BODY:
''Running a $200 million company amid the rapidly evolving electronic design automation market demands a balance between long-range and day-to-day management activities that is best achieved through the traditional C.E.O. and C.O.O. structure,'' said W. Douglas Hajjar, Valid's chairman and chief executive officer.
Despite its growth, Valid is substantially smaller than the market leader in electronic design automation, the Mentor Graphics Corporation of Beaverton, Ore. But Mr. Klaus said he would try to increase Valid's share of the market. He said Valid was in stronger shape than its relative market share would indicate.
''I didn't want to go to a company where I had to do a total turnaround,'' Mr. Klaus said. ''I wanted a company with a base to build on, not a shell.''
He noted that Valid has strong new products, a large customer base and solid finances. ''Valid is extremely well positioned,'' he said.
Mr. Klaus was previously with Sytek Inc., Mountain View, Calif., a maker of computer networking products that was acquired by the Hughes Aircraft Company last year. He joined Sytek in 1983 as vice president for marketing and sales, and was president and chief executive officer at the time of the merger.
Prior to Sytek, Mr. Klaus spent three years at the Amdahl Corporation as a vice president, and 13 years at the Control Data Corporation in a variety of sales, marketing and operations positions.
Mr. Klaus holds a bachelor of science degree in mathematics from California State University at Northridge. He and his wife, Julie, have two children.

HEADLINE: ARCO to Offer New Fuel Type

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 4

 BODY:
ARCO introduced the first in August 1989 in the Los Angeles area, a replacement for regular leaded gas. The company has been studying other kinds of low-emission gasolines.
Some analysts said the gasoline price increases stemming from the Persian Gulf crisis make the timing of ARCO's move bold because it will mean even higher prices.
''ARCO is doing this because they expect the price sensitivity is either subsiding or was never as high as some people feared in the backwash of the Iraqi crisis,'' said Scott Jones, a former economist at ARCO who is now president of AUS Consultants in West Conshohocken, Pa.

HEADLINE: Purchasers Report Slip in Economy

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:

 
Still Growing
''The manufacturing sector and the overall economy are very weak; there is no question about that,'' said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the asssociation's survey committee. ''But the index is consistent with real economic growth of 1.3 percent for 1990.''
The gross national product, measuring the total value of the nation's goods and services, expanded at an annual rate of 1.5 percent from January through June, the Commerce Department has reported. 
The Middle East crisis made some components of the Purchasing Managers' Index seem overly strong. But even without this stimulus, the overall index would have signaled a still-intact economy, Mr. Bretz said. Some other economists agreed.
''Mostly the American economy is moving sideways, neither expanding nor contracting,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities. ''What is keeping a lot of industries going are exports.''
The export stimulus was clearly not as vigorous as it was earlier in the summer. An index measuring export orders fell to 53 in August from 57 in July and 56.5 in June. Although the index had weakened, a 53 level meant that more than half of the purchasing executives said export orders had risen last month.
 
Production Index Plunges
Another big component of the Purchasing Managers' Index, a gauge of factory production, also fell sharply, to 48.5, from 52.1 in July, 53.9 in June and 56.3 in May. That was the lowest reading since January, when the index fell to 45.4.
The below-50 level meant that a majority of the 300 companies in the survey reduced production in August, and they might do so again in September. The new-orders index was 46.4 in August, essentially unchanged from 46.2 in July and well below the nearly 55 level in May and June.
The Middle East crisis skewed survey components dealing with inflation, order delivery time and inventories. Prices were higher than they would otherwise have been, order delivery time longer and inventories larger, Mr. Bretz said.
The price index jumped to 58.2 in August from 50.9 in July and June. The rise came mostly because of price increases for petrochemicals, plastics and other petroleum-based commodities and for items like aluminum, copper and nickel, whose production requires huge amounts of electricity. Oil is often used to generate electricity.
The order-delivery-time index also rose smartly, to 51.1 in August from 47.3 in July. This increase meant that a majority of the purchasing managers reported that delivery time had lengthened. Normally, delivery delays mean the economy is strong and companies are inundated with new orders.
But last month, the stretched-out delivery times reflected nervousness among purchasing managers, Mr. Bretz said. They ordered more supplies than needed, fearing the Middle East crisis might cause shortages.
The stockpiling that resulted from the extra ordering also pushed up inventories. The index measuring inventory levels rose to 44.1 in August from 39.3 in July. Nevertheless, the less-than-50 reading meant more companies were shrinking inventories than expanding them.

HEADLINE: U.S. Reports 0.4% July Gain In Construction Spending

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 4

 BODY:
Analysts had said the weakness in the construction industry was a result of consumer caution, high interest rates, stringent lending requirements and overbuilding in some areas.
 
May and June Data Revised
Construction spending had not risen since a four-tenths of a percent increase in March. It fell nine-tenths of a percent in both May and June and 1.9 percent in April. 
The latest report showed that May and June were weaker than first reported. The Commerce Department had initially said that spending in May was down three-tenths of a percent and was unchanged in June.
Residential spending in July fell four-tenths of a percent, to $190.5 billion, its fourth consecutive drop, including a 3.4 percent loss in June.
Single-family spending was down 1.3 percent, to $110.2 billion, for its fourth straight decline, including a 1.6 percent drop in June. Apartment construction fell 1.6 percent, to $18.4 billion, for its third straight drop, including a 3.6 percent decline in June.
''The new-structure component will continue to move down, certainly through the end of the year,'' said David Seiders, the chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders. He said the report showed a strong performance only in additions and alterations.
''This is what we usually see in down cycles,'' he said. ''People just add on to houses.''
Nonresidential spending rose 2.5 percent in July, to $107.5 billion, after a 1.8 percent gain the previous month.
''The only truly bright spot is the industrial component,'' which was up 9.3 percent in July, Mr. Seiders said.
The other two big nonresidential components - office buildings and other commercial construction such as shopping centers - remained weak, Mr. Seiders said.
Government spending edged down two-tenths of a percent, to $108.6 billion, after rising seven-tenths of a percent the previous month.
Over all, construction spending in July was 3.1 percent aboveJuly 1989's $429.0 billion.

HEADLINE: Program Buying Trims Dow's Loss to 0.99

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Volume on the exchange slumped to 92.9 million shares, the slowest since Dec. 26, 1989, when it was 76.7 million shares. The year's slowest day until yesterday had been Friday's 96.5 million.
In an indication that the market as a whole was weaker than Dow shares, 814 stocks on the New York Stock Exchange fell, with 82 hitting new lows, while 673 advanced, with five reaching new highs.
 
Heavy Program Buying
Birinyi Associates, which monitors program trading, said that heavy program buying, particularly in the last half-hour, lifted the Dow 6.70 points. One two-minute buying flurry just before the close raised the Dow nearly 8 points, Birinyi said. 
The possibility of armed conflict continued to be ''the major uncertainty'' in the Middle East, said Francis H. Schott, chief economist of the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, although, he added, ''oil-price concerns seem to have abated a bit.''
''The overall political question,'' he said, ''remains unresolved whether the Iraqis will be forced out of Kuwait without armed conflict and how it can be done.''
 
Focus on the Fed
At the same time, he said, ''There continues to be major concern about Federal Reserve policy because the conflict in the Middle East has interfered with the normal process of easing in which the Federal Reserve would normally be engaged.''
The two factors - ''the uncertainty about the Middle East and the delay in easier Federal Reserve policy'' -are depressing the market, he said.
Crude oil for delivery in October rose $1.80 a barrel yesterday, to $29.12, which pushed bond prices down and lifted yields on long-term Treasury bonds to 9.01 percent.
 
Employment Data Awaited
New economic data released yesterday, including a weaker-than-expected purchasing managers index, showed that the economy was faltering. But Wall Street is not expected to pay much attention to such statistics until Friday, when August employment data are released.
Dr. Schott forecast the numbers would show that the economy was weak enough to suggest that the Federal Reserve would ease monetary policy ''sometime this month.''
Taking their cue from the decline in stocks in Tokyo and most of Europe, traders in New York sold off shares in the first 20 minutes yesterday, depressing the market 27 points. After several unsuccessful attempts to gain ground, stocks rallied around 1 P.M. and improved from then on.
Changes in Dow stocks were small: Alcoa rose 7/8, to 65 1/4; Procter & Gamble 5/8, to 77 5/8, and I.B.M. 5/8, to 102 1/2.
 
Transportations Fall
With the rise in crude oil, the Dow transportation index fell 5.36, to 896.08, but Delta Air Lines was the only stock in the index to fall as much as a point, slipping 1, to 55 3/4. UAL, still unable to make headway on financing for a union buyout, hit a new low of 89 1/2 before ending at 91 3/4, down 1/4.
The big disappointment of the day was Pinnacle West Capital, the utility company, which plunged 3 3/4, to 12 3/8, in heavy trading after Pacificorp, another utility, gave up a 10-month takeover battle in exchange for a 30-year agreement to exchange power.
Among the insurance stocks, Progressive rose 3 3/8, to 52 7/8, a new high, although analysts said there did not appear to be news to account for it. General Re rose 1 3/4, to 75 3/4, after Michael A. Smith of Shearson, Lehman Brothers recommended it. Marsh & McLennan rose 1 1/4, to 71 1/2.
 
Big Rise for Adobe
Adobe Systems, the software producer, rose 3 1/8 on the Nasdaq, to 28 1/8, in heavy trading after it agreed to license Apple Computer to use its Postscript software and printer technology. Apple was unchanged, at 37.
Nike, the athletic shoe maker, rose 3 1/8, to 68 5/8. Fred Anschel of Dean Witter Reynolds, had recommended the stock two weeks ago, when Alice Ruth of Montgomery Securities had turned cool on the stock because of recession fears.
The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index rose 0.53, to 323.09; the Nasdaq composite rose 0.46, to 381.67, and the Amex market value index fell 0.65, to 322.74.

HEADLINE: Productivity Data Revised

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 4

 BODY:
In the first quarter, the department reported that productivity fell 1.9 percent. 
Analysts, while agreeing that the increase was positive, said that it mainly reflected the fact that fewer people had jobs. As companies shed staff, they eliminate the least efficient jobs first, raising productivity figures.
The new figures, closely watched by industry and government, are considered an important measure of the efficiency of the American economy and the ability of its workers to compete with their counterparts overseas.
The department said that manufacturing productivity increased at a seasonally adjusted rate of 4 percent. Long-lasting durable goods manufacturing was up 7.3 percent while non-durable goods fell 1.4 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mixed in New York After Advancing Overseas

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
''We're trying to decide whether it's a reversal of direction or what, and we just don't know,'' said Robert Ryan, chief foreign exchange dealer with the Bank of New York Company.
The dollar has slumped in recent weeks because of pessimism about the United States economy and the effect the Persian Gulf crisis could have on it. 
 
Jobless Report Awaited
Dealers said the markets were looking toward the scheduled release Friday of the Labor Department's employment figures for August. The markets expect the report to confirm that the economy is slowing down and to reinforce arguments that United States interest rates must come down.
Many economists say that the United States economy is headed into a recession and that the Federal Reserve will move to encourage lower rates. But such a move would be a negative for the dollar, which is supported by higher interest rates and has struggled lately to compete against currencies of nations with higher rates.
The dollar fell to 143.40 Japanese yen in New York, compared with 143.79 late Friday. United States financial markets were closed Monday in observance of the Labor Day holiday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar rose to 144.05 yen, from 143.55 at Monday's close. Later, in London, it was quoted at 143.55 yen.
 
The Pound Declines
The British pound fell to $1.8810, from $1.8905 late Friday.
The dollar also strengthened against the German currency, rising to 1.58115 marks, from 1.5755 on Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's prices, included: 1.3135 Swiss francs, up from 1.30835; 5.2965 French francs, up from 5.2865; 1,179.00 Italian lire, up from 1,170.00, and 1.16075 Canadian dollars, up from 1.15625.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Precious Metals Shunned After Last Week's Decline

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold futures settled $1 to $1.40 higher on the Commodity Exchange, with the contract for delivery in September up $1.40, to $383.70 an ounce. Silver futures ended 4.1 cents to 5.4 cents lower, with September at $4.719 an ounce.
Light sweet crude oil jumped $1.80 a barrel for the near-month contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid reports the United States Navy had stopped and boarded a tea-laden Iraqi-flag freighter in the Gulf of Oman as part of the trade blockade against Iraq. 
Any sign of rising tension in the Middle East is likely to prompt an increase in crude oil prices and in inflation fears, a situation that is ordinarily bullish for gold.
But after gold prices dropped last week from more than $415 to less than $385 an ounce, investors have become leery about buying the metal, said Fredric Tordella, president of the MTB Banking Corporation, a New York-based dealer of precious metals and foreign currency.
He said the market's Aug. 27 plunge of $26.70, its steepest decline in seven years, ''really shook a lot of people up - not only their pocketbooks but their faith in the metals market and how it's going to react to the current situation.''
Anne Orton, a vice president of the precious metals and currency dealer Deak International Inc., agreed that last week's big drop ''took a lot of steam out of the market.''
Soybean futures, meanwhile, surged on the Chicago Board of Trade, rebounding from levels that some analysts had viewed as excessively low after a weeklong decline.
But wheat futures retreated for the sixth consecutive session and hit new life-of-contract lows across the board, reflecting abundant supplies worldwide. Corn futures were mostly higher.
The corn and soybean crops moved rapidly toward maturity last week, according to the Agriculture Department's weekly crop-progress report, which was released after the close.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
BAKER WARNS U.S. TO HAVE PATIENCE ON IRAQ EMBARGO

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:

 
'We Will Review Our Options'
President Bush told 30 members of Congress during a closed White House meeting that if the sanctions do not work, ''We will review our options,'' his spokesman said.
The comment seemed to convey a threat to turn to the use of offensive military force against Iraq. But Administration officials said Mr. Bush was seeking to address Congressional concerns about goods being shipped to and from Iraq despite the embargo. They said the options he had in mind focused on ways to plug those gaps.
In the Persian Gulf today, the Defense Department announced that the Navy had released an Iraqi cargo ship that the crew of an American guided-missile frigate boarded and seized on Tuesday. It was the first Iraqi vessel seized by American forces imposing the blockade. 
 
Soviet Suggestion Rejected
It was not clear why the ship, the Zanoobia, was released. But the Pentagon said the Navy was watching the vessel ''until its ultimate destination has been determined.''
The State Department said tonight that it was checking unconfirmed reports that an American citizen had been shot and wounded in Kuwait City. The Department said in a written statement that it had checked with hospitals in the Kuwaiti capital and that none said they had any knowledge of the man. The Department declined to release the man's name, but said it had spoken with his family. Administration officials said they had no way of determining the truth of the report, which they had received earlier today. The source of the report was not known.
As the Sunday meeting with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev approached, the White House went out of its way to praise overall Soviet actions during the gulf crisis. But it responded coolly to Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze's call on Tuesday for an international conference on the Middle East and brushed off any suggestion that the Helsinki talks could produce a mediator's role for Mr. Gorbachev in the Persian Gulf.
Mr. Bush's meeting in the White House was with members of House and Senate delegations who had recently returned from visits to Saudi Arabia, where they inspected American forces who are deployed in the desert in an avowed effort to deter an expansion of the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.
 
Some Gaps in Embargo
Marlin Fitzwater, Mr. Bush's spokesman, quoted Mr. Bush as telling the lawmakers that his principal weapon against President Hussein was the economic embargo of Iraq. He quoted Mr. Bush as saying: ''We must keep pressure on Iraq and convince Saddam Hussein that time is against him. The sanctions must succeed. If not, we will review our options.''
Mr. Fitzwater declined to elaborate on the President's remarks. But another Administration official, who insisted on not being identified, said Mr. Bush was not hinting at offensive military force, but was responding to concerns expressed by some Congressmen that there were gaps in the embargo, including air shipments of food and other supplies into Iraq.
''What he was saying was that in terms of how we can strengthen the application of the sanctions, there are all kinds of options,'' the official said. ''We can undertake stricter enforcement measures. We can hit the countries that are violating the actions by trying to impose penalties. Those could involve denying landing rights to their aircraft or bringing the violators into the public eye by naming them, which we've avoided doing so far.''
The question of how long it would take for the economic sanctions against Iraq to take effect, and beyond that how long American forces would remain in the Middle East, took the fore today, one day after Congress returned to work and lawmakers came home from trips to the Middle East.
 
Crippling Effect on Iraq
During his testimony today Mr. Baker declined to answer repeated questions about both issues. Instead, he appealed to the public to stand behind Mr. Bush.
Mr. Baker said the Administration was ''very optimistic'' that economic sacntions ''can begin to have some real bite rather soon.''
But a Government analyst, who insisted on not being identified, suggested that it would be a long time before the embargo has the kind of crippling effect on the Iraqi economy that the Administration is seeking.
''Short of a conflict breaking out, I don't see a quick end game,'' the analyst said. ''We're talking about months, maybe stretching into a year or more, for the sanctions to have an impact.''
 
Public Support for Bush's Plan
The analyst said most of the focus around the world had been on the bans on food imports and oil exports, but noted that Iraq imports three-quarters of its manufactured goods and 20 percent of its labor force.
Still, he said: ''Does everything shut down at once? No. They'll make arrangements.''
The question of public support during a protracted struggle has been of major concern to policymakers since the gulf operation began, officials said. To keep that support going, Mr. Bush has given three speeches on the issue so far and nine news conferences. The White House announced today that he will address a joint meeting of Congress on Tuesday at 9 P.M., Eastern time.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader, said he also believed that public support would continue.
 
Air-Blockade Proposal
''If the American people understand what is at stake in this case and why we're there, why it's important that we be there, they will support the effort,'' Mr. Gephardt said. But a few of the lawmakers who met with Mr. Bush and who questioned Mr. Baker expressed reservations about some aspects of the military operation and the embargo against Iraq.
For example, Senator John Glenn, Democrat of Ohio, said the United States should begin to block air shipments into Iraq. So far the United States and its allies in the region have only blockaded naval traffic into and out of Iraq, acting under the authority of the United Nations Security Council.
Mr. Baker said the Administration might consider an air blockade if the United Nations' committee on sanctions does not find a way to stop such shipments into Iraq. But he raised it only as a vague possibility and Mr. Fitzwater said Mr. Bush had no plans to expand the military blockade to include aircraft.
 
Hussein Suggestion Dismissed
Mr. Baker and Mr. Fitzwater responded coolly to the Soviet suggestion made by Mr. Shevardnadze on Tuesday that an international conference be convened on the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and other Middle East disputes, including the Israeli occupation of the West Bank.
They suggested that it was merely a new version of an old Soviet proposal that the United States has frequently rejected. Mr. Baker said Washington continued to believe that an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue is the proper way to begin the Middle East peace process.
He said that President Hussein had suggested that the Israeli-Palestinian issue should be linked to the Kuwaiti invasion, adding, ''We, as you know, have minimum low regard for those suggestions.''
Mr. Fitzwater said the Bush Administration did not believe that Moscow was trying to begin a mediation effort in the gulf crisis, despite today's unexpected visit to the Soviet Union by Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq. And he made it plain that Mr. Bush would not welcome such a plan.
 
Soviet-Arab Ties and Policy
''We do not feel that's beneficial,'' he said.
Another Administration official said Moscow's talk about a Middle East conference and its discussions with Mr. Aziz reflected a central fact that while the United States and the Soviet Union have cooperated in the gulf to a large degree, their interests and policies are not identical.
''They have a stake in the gulf that is separate from our stake,'' the official said. ''There's basic agreement on preventing aggression, basic agreement on getting Hussein out of Kuwait. But beyond that there are different policies.''
He continued: ''They have a close relationship with certain Arab clientele that requires them to maintain a balance in their policy. At the same time that Gorbachev is putting strong words out and imposing sanctions, he's also trying to show some flexibility toward the Saddam regime.''

HEADLINE: MEDICARE'S WOES FOUND WORSENING

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Not surprisingly, increases in payments to physicians have been growing at rates well above that of general inflation under Medicare's system of basing payments on customary charges. In the fiscal year ending this month, the amount will grow an estimated 13.2 percent, up from a 10.9 percent rise in the previous year. While payments to hospitals were placed under limits to help rescue the program in 1983 and freezes on physician fees have occasionally been imposed, systematic attempts to limit payments to physicians are only now about to be tried. Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, sent to Congress last Friday a preliminary outline for a national schedule of Medicare fees to physicians, which is to take effect in January 1992.
Another problem is the weakening economy. Medicare payments to doctors are financed from general tax revenues, with an assist from monthly premiums paid by the elderly. The program pays hospitals with money from a tax on payrolls, and this fund is expected to begin to decline in the middle of this decade as its revenues no longer keep up with Medicare's growing costs. If the economy deteriorates more and employment rates drop, tax revenues could fall even further behind Medicare's needs. 
 
The Surge in Outlays
All in all, Medicare outlays are 27 times the $4 billion of 1966, the first year of operation, and are projected to reach $320.8 billion in the year 2000, according to a 1987 Government estimate that assumed moderate inflation rates.
Gail R. Wilensky, the Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, said the agency's trust fund for hospitals is expected ''to go belly up around 2005.'' But Government actuaries say the fund could run out of money as early as 1999, depending on trends that include the state of the economy, inflation rates and the number of Medicare beneficiaries.
Yet Americans' expectations of Medicare seem to be rising. Consumer advocates and spokesmen for the elderly, like John Rother, legislative director of the American Association of Retired Persons, say the program does not cover some of their most urgent needs, like Alzheimer's disease and other long-term illnesses, as well as medical checkups, dental work, eyeglasses, hearing aids and prescription drugs.
At the same time, doctors and hospitals say they are becoming increasingly disillusioned with the program. Indeed, some doctors are beginning to talk of refusing to accept Medicare patients, citing the growing burden of paperwork and restrictions on fees and on the treatments they will be reimbursed for. For example, a new law that took effect last weekend makes the doctor, instead of the patient, responsible for handling the often confusing paperwork that Medicare requires before it pays.
 
'The Hassle Factor'
And on Jan. 1, a new requirement will limit the added fees that doctors can charge patients to 25 percent of the amount that Medicare pays; there is currently no limit.
Also, experts say the schedules being drawn of what Medicare will pay for a doctor's services may be a step toward more restrictions that will slow the growth in payments to doctors.
''If the hassle factor continues, the reduction in reimbursement continues, finally the doctor gets to the point where he says I don't need this anymore,'' said Dr. James S. Todd, executive vice president of the American Medical Association.
Marilyn Moon, a senior research associate with the Urban Institute, said there was some concern about Medicare following in the path of the Medicaid program for the poor. Many doctors and hospitals now avoid accepting Medicaid patients.
Then again, Ms. Moon noted, elderly patients provide most of the business for most physicians, except in a few specialties, and therefore it would be difficult to turn away such patients.
As for hospitals, 62 percent of them will lose money on Medicare patients this year, said Carol McCarthy, president of the American Hospital Association. Executives of hospitals, which received 55 percent of Medicare spending in 1989, say that like physicians, their institutions must make up the losses through higher fees to private health plans. But employers, who pay a large share of private health insurance, have begun to challenge this shifting of costs and demand discounts from providers of medical care.
 
Money-Saving Strategies
Some experts, like Carolyne K. Davis, a former Medicare Administrator, think Medicare can survive without drastic changes. They say the program can be kept afloat through money-saving strategies, like those used by private health plans, that direct patients to hospitals and doctors selected on the basis of quality of care and cost. They say that eliminating unneeded medical procedures could yield large savings.
But critics like Deborah Steelman, who was an adviser in President Bush's election campaign and heads an advisory council on Social Security and health policy, say the Government program will have to be at least partly dismantled, forcing the elderly to finance even more of their own health bills than they now do.
Medicare already absorbs about 18 percent of the nation's spending on health care, and such expenditures are growing faster than any other part of the economy - about 10 percent each year. Even if the Bush Administration succeeds with its proposal to cut $5.6 billion from the program in 1991, Medicare's budget would still increase to $110.4 billion.
Payments to hospitals - $60 billion in 1989 - are financed by a 1.45 percent tax on employees' wages and a matching amount paid by employers. Most of the payments to physicians ($43 billion this year) come from general tax revenues, with about 27 percent of the total contributed by the $28.60 monthly premiums paid by enrollees. (About $5 billion goes for equipment like wheelchairs, limited home care and administering the program.) ''Either we are going to have to change the financing or change something about what we pay for and how much,'' said Ms. Wilensky, the Medicare Administrator.
 
Would Have Affluent Pay More
Some experts say affluent elderly Americans should pay more of their health costs, freeing Government money to keep the program going. Dr. Todd of the American Medical Association said the elderly should pay Medicare premiums on a scale reflecting their assets.
''But Congress is going to be shy about doing anything that arouses the elderly constituencies,'' said Theodore Marmor, a professor of public policy at Yale University. Many members of Congress were embarrassed last year when elderly voters revolted against a surtax on Medicare premiums for catastrophic illnesses, and the new law was repealed. The more affluent elderly would have paid the highest tax.
Ms. Steelman proposes transferring part of what is covered by Medicare to a new form of Government-regulated private insurance that would be purchased by people during their working years and would cover all medical costs up to, say, $25,000. The money saved by Medicare would be used to pay all costs for the elderly that exceed $25,000, including long-term care and prescription drugs, which are not covered now.
Ms. Steelman conceded that her approach was ''futuristic.'' She said the Government should test her plan with volunteers to see how it works and whether company health plans would participate. Her proposal will be included, along with alternatives, in a report to the President and Congress early next year, Ms. Steelman said.
Dr. Todd called for ''a fundamental change that would first determine the level of health care to which everyone should have access and then decide how to pay for it.'' Noting that ''one-third of Medicare dollars are spent on patients in the last six months of their lives, and a fair amount of it futilely,'' he said that both the medical association and Government health officials are looking at proposals for standards that could ''eliminate care that is unlikely to be beneficial.''
 
Payroll Tax Rise Sought
The medical association also favors an increase of four-tenths of a percent in the payroll tax, and tax incentives to encourage savings for retirement ''so that the individual would have accumulated enough to provide for care for both acute and chronic illnesses.''
Ms. Davis, now a health-care adviser with Ernst & Young, the consulting firm, noted that the trust fund had overcome earlier threats to its survival. ''In 1982,'' she said, ''it looked like the hospital trust fund would be bankrupt by the period between 1986 and 1990.'' The shortage eased after a radical change in Medicare's method of paying hospitals.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sept. 6 about the financial squeeze on Medicare misstated the limits on physicians' charges to Medicare patients. Since 1987, Medicare has limited what a doctor may charge for each service to an amount based on that doctor's 1984 charges, plus a specified annual increase.

HEADLINE: Seoul Rejects North's Plan to End Hostilities

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Sept. 5

 BODY:
There were even jokes and bantering about the weather and a general recognition in comments by both sides that they seem to understand the rationale for each other's positions.
At the morning session in a huge conference hall at the Hotel Intercontinental, a modern luxury hotel on the south side of the Han River, for example, Prime Minister Yon Hyong Muk of North Korea said he recognized that mutual distrust ''stems from the perception that each side is trying to swallow up the other politically and militarily.''
In what struck some listeners as an unusually even-handed appraisal, Mr. Yon said North Korea believed that Seoul and the United States would attack, but he recognized that Seoul was also suspicious that North Korea would attack the South and try to spread Communism. 
''We have to talk heart to heart to eradicate distrust,'' he said. He then presented a nine-point plan for military disarmament, including withdrawal of 43,000 American troops and a ban on American nuclear weapons as a prelude to an overall reduction in troop forces by both sides.
Repeating long reiterated positions, Mr. Yon also called on Seoul to take three immediate steps to build confidence and to make the talks a success this week. Those were to abandon South Korea's bid to enter the United Nations as a separate country, stop joint military exercises with the United States, and release three South Koreans jailed in the last year for unauthorized visits to North Korea.
There were no formal responses to those proposals in the sessions, but Seoul officials made it clear the demands were unacceptable. A senior South Korean official said they would be an infringement on the sovereignty of South Korea and its right to conduct an independent foreign policy.
But South Korean officials said they were delighted that North Korea took the talks seriously enough to outline the proposals, which could now be the basis of future discussions.
Prime Minister Kang Young Hoon of South Korea, in his presentation, outlined a less-sweeping set of proposals to upgrade cultural contacts, family exchanges and to begin joint economic ventures to build confidence and pave the way for future military discussions.
 
'New Kind of Rapport'
But North Korea sees such less-important exchanges as coming at the end of long negotiations on troop levels and arms.
Both Prime Ministers also sounded the theme that it was time for 70 million people on the Korean peninsula to recognize the end of cold-war assumptions elsewhere in the world and bring a reconciliation in one of the last remaining trouble spots that is a relic of East-West tensions.
''The world weather vane has shifted drastically,'' Prime Minister Kang of South Korea said. ''A new kind of rapport, coexistence and cooperation is blowing hard, knocking down ideological and political barriers around the globe. The common wish and hope of our compatriots is that our divided people will be reunited.''
Mr. Kang said that ''if both societies open up to each other, engage in exchanges and cooperation'' and take other limited steps, ''conditions for political integration will ripen.''
North Korea also called for a three-phase reduction of troop strength by North and South.

HEADLINE: Rights Observers Reportedly Ousted in Yugoslavia

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Sept. 5

 BODY:
She said the three had been kept several hours at a local police station, and then ordered to leave the country within 24 hours. A report from the Helsinki federation offices in Vienna said Miss von Kohl and the others had ''persona non grata'' stamped in their passports, a detail explicitly denied by the Serbian government.
The Serbian authorities have taken an increasingly hard stand against critics of their handling of the crisis in Kosovo, an autonomous province within Serbia where the population is overwhelmingly Albanian and Muslim. 
The conflict between the majority Albanians and the Serbian government in Belgrade deepened in July when the Serbian republic suspended the authority of Kosovo's legislature and took complete control of the region.
Opposition by Albanian groups has stiffened and this week culminated in a general strike that has effectively shut down the economy of the province. But the Serbian government, led by President Slobodan Milosevic, has refused to have any discussions with leaders of the Albanian opposition groups, who it says are campaigning to break away from Serbia.
As nationalist feeling mounts in Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's six republics, any challenge to the Serbian cause - particularly in the long-sensitive region of Kosovo - has been taken by Serbian nationalists both in the Government and in the newly formed opposition as an affront to the nation's dignity and honor.
Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, were in Kosovo's capital, Pristina, last week when the police, using tear gas and clubs, dispersed an unauthorized but peaceful demonstration by Albanians protesting the suspension of their local government and press. In the violence that followed, 21 people were reported injured, including 7 policemen.
Shocked by the police reaction, Mr. Dole called the Serbian Government's tactics ''Stalinist'' and suggested that he would recommend steering United States aid away from the Serbian republic as long as rights abuses continue.
Last Friday, Aleksandar Prlja, the Serbian spokesman for foreign affairs, accused Mr. Dole and his delegation of helping the cause of Albanian separatists. Mr. Prlja called Mr. Dole ''a known Albanian lobbyist in the Senate and an explicit anti-Serb politician in the United States.''
In an interview today, Mr. Prlja said any steps to deny aid to Serbia would spell the dissolution of Yugoslavia. ''That would be the end of Yugoslavia,'' he said. ''No Yugoslav Government could accept that.''

Thatcher Prepares for Costly and Patient Struggle

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
But she said last weekend that sanctions should be given ''a few months'' to work, a formula used again today by one of her top aides. ''If the sanctions policy is consistently applied over time, it could be effective,'' he said. ''I don't think military action is inevitable.'' 
 
Help for Three Nations
At a news conference here today, Mr. Brady said neither the British nor the French had been asked to provide a specific amount to help offset American military expenses. The British have sent ships, planes and about 2,000 military personnel to the gulf to help enforce the United States-led blockade of Iraq, and the French have also sent forces to the region.
Mr. Brady said the money he and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d were now trying to persuade American allies in Europe, the Middle East and Asia to provide included an unspecified amount for the rest of this year that was intended mainly to help Jordan, Egypt and Turkey deal with refugees and economic disruption.
Both French officials and Mrs. Thatcher gave their support, Mr. Brady said. ''She was tremendously supportive and indicated that the plan we outlined to her was one with which she agreed,'' he said. ''There was a commitment to funds in that plan and she promised Britain would do its bit.''
Britain, France, Sweden, West Germany, Spain and Japan have all already announced plans to send money, food, tents and the like, particularly to Jordan, which is being overwhelmed by tens of thousands of refugees from various countries.
 
Brady Leaves for Korea
Mr. Brady did not say how much money the United States wanted for burden-sharing in 1991. American officials said that besides humanitarian aid, the money was needed partly to offset United States military costs and partly to help international agencies like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank deal with the economic effects of the crisis.
Mr. Brady left London for Korea today and is expected to go on to Japan from there. Mr. Baker's itinerary this week includes Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, and he is to consult West Germany, Italy and other NATO allies in Brussels on the burden-sharing plan after the meeting between President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union in Helsinki on Sunday.
Mrs. Thatcher's inner circle is convinced that British public opinion will support a long-range military strategy in the gulf, her aides say, and the Prime Minister expects to see bipartisan approval of the Government's actions in the House of Commons on Thursday.
 
Briton Boycotted in Jordan
AMMAN, Jordan, Sept. 5 (Reuters) - Dozens of Jordanian journalists walked out of a news conference given today by the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, protesting what they called London's aggressive policy against Jordan and Iraq.
The journalists stalked out of the hall amid applause from colleagues after one read a statement accusing Britain of a ''strategy to humiliate the Arabs and keep them slaves.''
The statement also accused Britain of ignoring Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, southern Lebanon and the Golan Heights.
Responding to the walkout, Mr. Hurd said ''one sad consequence'' of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was that ''world attention is no longer focused on the Palestinian problem.''
''Britain and the world have not forgotten that there was occupation of the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem and the need for a solution that took into consideration Palestinian self-determination and Israel's right to security,'' he said.

Excerpts From Iraqi Statement Declaring War of 'Right Against Wrong'

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
It is now your turn, Arabs, to save all humanity and not just save yourselves, and to show the principles and meanings of the message of Islam, of which you are all believers and of which you are all leaders.
It is now your turn to save humanity from the unjust powers who are corrupt and exploit us and are so proud of their positions, and these are led by the United States of America.
Foremost among these Arabs in response to the initiative for the victory of Iraq are the people of the Palestinian intifada, the people of the stones who are fighting the Zionists in their own land, for the occupation is always injust and therefore weak. For in Yemen, Tunis and Libya and Sudan and Mauritania, these are all believers who believe in the Arab world and in Islam. And they know where the truth lies for this will be extended to believers outside the Arab and Islamic world and therefore, this battle will take a human aspect. 
As for the naval and air troops of the United States and all that have accompanied them, it will not - never frighten our rulers, or leadership, or even our people, instead, it will just make us believe more in the route that we have chosen for the victory of our people and of our nation and of humanity. It will never frighten us, the use of their modern weapons or their high technology because we believe in our principles for social justice and the rejection of injustice and weakness.
 
Fighting U.S. Presence
The slogan of believers is, never to turn back. We are sure of victory and we will never let it go of our hands. And through our struggle, many heads will be lost, for God has written this in his holy books. Dear brothers, dear Arabs, dear Muslims everywhere, Fahd and Hosni, who have always been known to be injust and corrupt, have increased their injustice and their evil according to what they're doing to their peoples.
For, as we know out of a story from the Holy Koran, the rulers, the corrupt rulers, have always been ousted by their people for it is a right on all of us to carry out the holy jihad, the holy war of Islam, to liberate the holy shrines of Islam. While the ruler of Saudi Arabia called himself the custodian of the two holy shrines, while in fact he is an agent, for he has given away his land to the foreigners.
We call upon all Arabs, each according to his potentials and capabilities within the teachings of Allah and according to the Muslim holy war of jihad, to fight this U.S. presence of non-believers and to fight the stance taken by the Arab agents who have followed these foreigners. And we hail the people of Saudi Arabia who are being fooled by their rulers, as well as the people of dear Egypt, as well as all the people of the Arab nations who are not of the same position as their leaders, and they believe in their pride and their sovereignity over their land. We call on them to revolt against their traitors, their rulers, and to fight foreign presence in the holy lands. And we support them, and more important, that God is with them.
Dear brothers, the children of Iraq will prove, I repeat that the deprived children of Iraq - they are deprived of their milk - they will prove to all the greedy people of the West that children are more capable and stronger. And those who have betrayed their people and their land and their religion, they will be embarrassed to find the children of Iraq struggling and resisting the deprivation of milk. . . .
Dear brothers, you may have known, according to the date I have mentioned previously, that these foreigners are depriving the people of Iraq from food and medicine. And you also know who tried to let the people of Iraq die of hunger. And you also know that this took place at the time of the Nazis, and this is inhumane for it cut out medicine from a whole population and a whole population suffered from this deprivation.
And as you may know, the children in Iraq are dying because of a foolish decision taken by certain people. The children of Iraq are dying because they're being deprived of their milk and their food and their medicine. And this was adopted by the United States of America and they were always backed and supported by the Zionists, for they have always encouraged them to do so. They are backed by Zionist media and Zionist finances.
 
Call for Holy War
And you will not ever forget their evil actions against Arabs and against Iraqis who are supported by all Muslims in the whole world, when all humanity will wake up from its deep sleep and know where the truth lies. The children of Iraq before its people - I repeat, the children of Iraq before its people refuse that we borrow milk for them from the non-believers and the evil and their - the girls of Iraq will suffer and sacrifice for their case.
The land of Iraq will always respond to its people, for it has never let its people down. It was always - the land of Iraq has always offered help to any fighter, to any believer throughout history. They will be capable of defeating any foreign intervention, even if they stay as they are, or even if more troops are added to them, for Iraqis, as you all know, you will never imagine the will of the Iraqi people, for it is not convenient for believers to be frightened away from such numbers or such troops.
And this is a recitation from the Holy Koran calling for holy jihad. How then, if we know that the number of Iraqi volunteers who've offered themselves and sacrificed themselves for the sake of the principles of their nations is more than 5 million Iraqis, who are all willing to participate - and this is in addition to the 1 million Iraqi armed forces - for if the non-believers want to fight us they must know that they should be more than this number, for they might even be 12 million, at least.
But as you know, dear brothers, the air forces cannot ever carry out a battle in land despite its modern technology. And this is the law of all the traditional wars that have taken place throughout history. And the last power that fought this were the people of Vietnam and the Americans have transferred southern Vietnam to a U.S. base for their own good to fight the North Vietnam.
They turned it into a comfortable base for their soldiers and they are doing the same thing in the holy lands of Najd and Hijaz in Saudi Arabia, as you probably know.
How, therefore, if they face Iraq under different circumstances and conditions - for the people of Vietnam, like the people of Iraq, have a strong will and can live up to any of these battles. For at the level of the Arab rulers, and Arab sheikhs, and the Muslim people, who are all believers and sons of the Islamic nations, they all stand foremost among the poor nations who are exploited by the Americans and others. And before all of this, God is with them and backing them.
They will regret their involvement and they will be badly defeated if they ever start a military battle.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
Hussein Hardens Line, Saying Sanctions Deprive Children of Milk

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Sept. 5

 BODY:
''The children of Iraq are dying,'' he said, ''because they're being deprived of their milk and their food and their medicine,''
 
An Issue With Emotional Appeal
Mr. Hussein has chosen the emotional issue of denying children their milk as a main theme of his campaign against the trade sanctions, and this line appeared to reach a peak in the message tonight.
Western diplomats said they had heard no reports of people dying of starvation, and say they have seen no evidence of critical shortages of food and medicine four weeks after the sanctions were imposed.
Diplomats who monitor the economy here said milk is still widely available. A woman shopping in an neighborhood grocery store this week said the sanctions had yet to begin affecting her family. 
''There are certain kinds of European baby's milk and foods that you can't find in every store,'' she said, ''but if you keep looking, you will find it.''
 
Concerted Compaign
The Government has been orchestrating street demonstrations of small children and mothers protesting the blockage of milk and medical shipments to Iraq. In Jordan, supporters of the Iraqi leader have paid for big newspaper advertisements to appeal for contributions to buy milk for Iraq's children.
A few more Western women and children who had been detained in Kuwait and Iraq continued to leave Iraq in a small trickle, while thousands of others awaited permission to leave.
An Iraqi Airways jet chartered by the French took 145 Westerners, including 10 Americans, to Jordan, airport officials said. Earlier, two scheduled Iraqi Airways flights took 14 Westerners, including 6 Americans, to Jordan.
The Iraqi Goverment also released messages purportedly from seven hostages, including an American. The hostages who sent the messages were ''at a vital installation,'' the official Iraqi press agency said, but did not indicate where. Diplomatic Solution? Of late, the Iraqi leader had toned down his public statements, and diplomats analyzing the crisis said they believed he sincerely hoped that a diplomatic opening might be found. Washington has also turned down the volume and sharpness of its statements.
There had been hopes here that talks in Amman, Jordan, between Javier Perez de Cuellar, the Secretary General of the United Nations, and Tariq Aziz, the Foreign Minister of Iraq, might lead to a breakthrough.
But two days of meetings ended inconclusively last Friday and Saturday. Iraqi officials have been unwilling to discuss what took place in the meetings but they seem disappointed.
''The meetings were negative,'' said Naji al-Hadithi, Iraq's director general of information. ''The crisis is not something that can easily be solved in one or two meetings.''
King Hussein of Jordan arrived in Baghdad today and went straight into talks with President Hussein, the Iraqi press agency reported. The King has been traveling in the Middle East and Europe, trying to develop a consensus on a plan by which Iraq would pull out of Kuwait, which it seized on Aug. 2, in exchange for a mutual withdrawal of American troops from Saudi Arabia.
The Iraqi agency reported that the President met the Jordanian King at the airport. It was King Hussein's second trip to Baghdad since the invasion of Kuwait. His last visit was on Aug. 13, a day before he went to the United States for a meeting with President Bush.

EAST BLOC TO SELL MASKS TO SAUDIS

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SOFIA, Bulgaria, Sept. 1

 BODY:

 
Offers of Cheap Oil
''They are trying to tempt us with cheap oil, with business for Hungary, with offers to buy all sorts of things,'' Mr. Jeszenszky said in Budapest, adding that Hungary was among the first countries to cut economic relations with Baghdad. ''We'll do our best to get in line with the other East European countries.''
The Western diplomats said they did not know whether the Soviet Union had agreed to sell chemical-weapons protection equipment for Saudi Arabia or whether it played any role in helping to arrange the deal being worked out with the East European countries. 
An official at a Bulgarian arms export company, Kintex, said American diplomats had approached the company for the first time two weeks ago to discuss such a purchase. Once identified by Western inteligence agencies as a major arms supplier to terrorist organizations, Kintex has in the last month sought to recast itself as an above-board arms trading company.
Bulgarian Government officials said they were uncertain whether the United States was buying the equipment for Saudi Arabia or simply arranging the transaction for the Saudi Government, which has no diplomatic ties with Bulgaria.
 
U.S.-Soviet Cooperation
The Kintex official said he thought that the United States and the Soviet Union were cooperating in the transactions. ''Our information is that they're playing this game together,'' he said, adding that the company has also been approached by private Western arms dealers scrambling to purchase chemical-weapons protection and cleanup devices to sell to Saudi Arabia.
''The idea, as we understand it, is to help provide equipment for the needs of the Saudi civilian population,'' a senior Bulgarian official said. ''The object is civil defense.''
''The dimensions of the deal are quite large,'' the Bulgarian official said, but he refused to elaborate because no final agreement has yet been struck. Saudi Arabia has a population of about 17 million.
Western diplomats said that the armed forces of Saudi Arabia and the the United States and other forces there were adequately equipped with protective gear for chemical weapons.
The Bulgarian official denied that oil shipments from Saudi Arabia were a factor in the deal, but he underscored Bulgaria's interest in renewing diplomatic ties with the Saudi Government.
 
Sanctions Strain East Europeans
Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria have been especially hard pressed as a result of the United Nations sanctions against Iraq, which has been a significant oil supplier to these countries.
Bulgaria signed a four-year deal with Iraq in July under which the Iraquis were supposed to supply $1.2 billion in oil to pay off debts to Bulgaria that they incurred during their war with Iran. The Bulgarians counted on the oil to make up for price increases and cutbacks in Soviet oil deliveries.
The country is already feeling the pinch of oil-supply disruptions. Six-hour gasoline lines are the rule throughout Bulgaria, and hourlong electricity cuts have been introduced in the capital, Sofia, to conserve fuel.
Bulgaria has already applied to the United Nations for economic aid predicated on hardships caused by the sanctions.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
Japanese and Soviets Issue Rare Joint Appeal on Gulf

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 5

 BODY:

 
Arms Suppliers Faulted
''Part of the cause of the current crisis can be placed with those countries that supplied arms to Iraq, which includes the Soviet Union,'' Mr. Nakayama said. ''As the country with the most influence over Iraq, we want you to use that influence to bring about the liberation of hostages of all countries,'' he told his Soviet counterpart, according to a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry.
Mr Shevardnadze said that Moscow's influence over Mr. Hussein was ''limited'' and added that the Soviet Union was acting to put the United Nations sanctions against Iraq ''into complete effect.'' 
Both Japanese and American officials have been carefully watching Mr. Shevardnadze's words here for clues about what the Soviet position will be when Mr. Gorbachev meets President Bush in Helsinki, Finland, on Sunday. But Mr. Shevardnadze said nothing to suggest that the Soviets had new initiatives to bring to the summit meeting. He made no comment on statements by Secretary of State James A Baker 3d, who said on Tuesday that American troops would be remaining in the gulf for a long time.
The central Soviet-Japanese issue, which is expected to be raised on Thursday when Mr. Shevardnadze and Mr. Nakayama meet, is the dispute over the ownership of four islands that the Soviet Union took in the closing days of World War II.
 
A Quid Pro Quo Wanted
Japan has held out the return of the islands as a prerequisite for economic aid and investment in the battered Soviet economy. The Soviets have so far refused to budge, although the tempo of discussions about the islands has considerably accelerated in recent months. A growing number of Japanese officials are expressing alarm that Tokyo could be left behind in the new era of East-West collaboration if no progress is made.
In recent weeks, some Soviet officials, including Boris N. Yeltsin, the President of the Russian republic, have talked about demilitarizing the islands, which are now used as a base for Soviet troops and aircraft.
Mr. Shevardnadze said today that he was willing to talk about troop reductions, but only in the broader context of Asian-Pacific security issues. So far, Japanese officials have been publicly cool to the idea, for fear that it might lead to reducations in the 60,000 American troops stationed in Japan.
Mr. Shevardnadze also proposed a series of exchanges between the Soviet and Japanese military forces, but Japanese officials said such activities would be premature.
 
Free Exercise of Diplomacy
In the joint statement, the two Foreign Ministers demanded that all restrictions on diplomatic activities in Kuwait be lifted. They also expressed ''grave concern about the conditions of the foreigners detained in Iraq and Kuwait in contravention of the obligation that arises from international law and the norms of human rights.''
Mr. Shevardnadze said that while Soviet women and children have been evaculated from Baghdad, a number of economic experts remained. He did not term them hostages, but left their status in Iraq unclear.
Mr. Shevardnadze will meet with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and have an audience with Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko before he leaves Japan on Friday.

HEADLINE: Crisis of Drugs Remains Top Priority, Bush Says

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
But his comments were met with skepticism from some lawmakers, who said the Administration's drug strategy was not providing adequate support for treatment and education programs, and was focused too heavily on casual drug users rather than addicts.
 
Criticism on Strategy
''The strategy remains just what it was on Day 1, a nicely packaged pile of paper that lacks true commitment,'' said Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of the House Select Committee on Narcotics. ''The Administration's anti-drug strategy has not been responsive to the concerns of inner-city and other chronic drug abusers, whose drug abuse is fueling the crisis.'' 
A year after President Bush gave a nationally televised speech to unveil his drug strategy, the results of the Administration's $10-billion-a-year war on drugs are mixed.
Casual use of illegal drugs appears to be sharply declining, and recent studies have suggested that the nation's cocaine epidemic has peaked. Figures made public last week by the National Institute on Drug Abuse showed that hospital emergency room visits related to cocaine use have dropped by nearly a quarter since last fall.
At the same time, hospital reports of deaths linked to the cocaine and heroin have continued to increase, an indication that drug addiction may be growing even as casual drug use declines. Federal researchers say the number of drug-related slayings could set a record this year.
''I think a prudent and cautious judgment on our present circumstances would be that the drug problem - in general, nationwide - is no longer getting worse,'' William J. Bennett, the national drug policy director, said at today's news conference. ''In some significant areas it is getting better.
On Capitol Hill, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Delaware Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today released his own evaluation of the Bush drug strategy. It said that ''some things appear to be working quite well, others appear to be ineffective, still others may be counterproductive.''
The report, prepared by the committee's Democratic staff, praised President Bush and Mr. Bennett for ''helping to shape the nation's attitudes'' on drug abuse and said their leadership played a ''key role in combating casual drug use, which appears to be plummeting.''
Yet Mr. Biden renewed his criticism that the Administration had put too little money into drug treatment, had failed to recognize the need for drug education programs and was not offering sufficient economic incentives to Latin American nations to encourage them to curb cocaine production.
''Anyone who lives in one our major cities - or a rural town - can tell you, the war on drugs is far from won,'' the report said. ''And on some fronts, we appear to be further behind than we were a year ago today.''
Representative John Conyers Jr., a Democrat who represents Detroit, said, ''Drug czar Bennett and President Bush cannot deny that we are losing the drug war in our inner cities.''
Mr. Conyers, chairman of the House Government Operations Committee, said the Adminstration's drug strategy was focused too heavily on law enforcement and had failed to address problems in low-income urban areas.
''We will never win this war on drugs until we rethink and refocus the priorities of the drug strategy,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Drug War Underlines Fickleness Of Public

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
Why? Clearly one possibility can be dispensed with. Not even those who believe there are some hopeful signs suggest that the drug scourge has vanished.
The answer is more in the public mind than on the nation's streets. A review of the entire episode teaches a great deal about the alliance of Presidents and news directors, as well as something about the pitfalls of policy by polling public opinion. 
''I can tell you exactly why it happened,'' said Robert Lichter, of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, a private, nonpartisan group that monitors television coverage of Washington. Mr. Lichter said the waxing and waning of attention is an illustration of how a President, with the help of the press corps, can shape the national agenda, at least temporarily.
In the summer of 1989, concern about the drug problem was on the rise. In July, 22 percent of the public said drugs were the nation's most important problem, already a high number.
Robert Bezilla, a poll taker long affiliated with the Gallup organization who has studied the rise of the drug issue, noted that it emerged at a quiescent moment, before the appearance of either of today's most prominent fears, recession at home and war in the Persian Gulf.
In mid-August of 1989, the White House let it be known the President would address the issue in a speech on prime-time television. Journalists responded. Mr. Lichter said that in the last two weeks of August and the first few days of September the three network news programs each ran an average of nearly three stories a night about drugs, as against fewer than one a night before the President set plans for his speech.
Then, a year ago today, Mr. Bush gave his speech declaring a war on drugs. It was the only prime-time television talk to the nation he has given. For the next week, the network news programs each averaged four stories a night about drugs, Mr. Lichter said.
''There was this tremendous upsurge in media coverage associated with Bush's speech and that drove the issue way up in the public consciousness,'' Mr. Lichter said. That was when The New York Times/CBS News poll found 64 percent of the public put drugs at the top of the agenda.
''Then it went away,'' Mr. Lichter said. ''Other issues came in. The media stopped covering it, and the public stopped thinking about it as much.''
Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan, said part of the reason the media stopped paying attention was because Cabinet members were not speaking out about the crisis in their areas of authority, for instance the way hospitals were overwhelmed by the victims of drug violence.
So what purpose did this temporary surge in interest serve? In his speech last year Mr. Bush said one of his first missions as President would be ''to keep the national focus on our offensive against drugs.''
The White House is sensitive to criticism that Mr. Bush expressed concern about a problem and then wandered off. So on the first anniversary of that speech Mr. Bush held a news conference today to say that curbing drug use remained the nation's top priority, even if ''other subjects preoccupy all of us these days.''
But in recent politics there always seems to be another subject to preoccupy the public. Who even talks about the Berlin Wall or Tiananmen Square any more? Getting the public's attention, particularly on a subject that the polls show is already gnawing at people, is no real trick for a President, even a President who lacks a knack for the bully pulpit part of his job. The trick is holding that attention.

HEADLINE: ACID RAIN REPORT CONFIRMS CONCERN

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:

 
Major Conclusions
In its final draft report, made public today, the study group found that scientific evidence ''clearly demonstrated'' these conclusions:
* Aquatic life is being damaged by acid rain in about 10 percent of eastern lakes and streams. But much of the damage is probably caused when snow melts in the spring, pouring concentrated amounts of acid water into the streams.
* Visibility is being reduced in the eastern United States and in some metropolitan areas of the West.
* Acid rain is contributing to the erosion and corrosion of stone and metal structures. 
* Acid rain is reducing the ability of red spruce trees at high altitudes to withstand the stress caused by cold temperatures.
The study group, made up of representatives from government agencies, also found evidence of a number of other effects, including the probability that the pollutants that cause acid rain may be causing respiratory illness and other health effects in humans.
While the group found that ''the majority of North American forests are healthy,'' its computer projections also found that acid rain may produce nutrient deficiencies that would lead to forest decline in the decades ahead.It also found that acid rain may be contributing to the decline of sugar maples in some areas of eastern Canada, although the maple problem is related to ''localized soil nutrient deficiencies.''
 
Key Sources of Emissions
The report confirmed that emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, many of them originating at coal-fired power plants in the Midwest, are, as scientists have long believed, the source of acid precipitation - acidic rain, snow, fog and dry particles. Ozone, a pollutant formed in the lower atmosphere when volatile chemicals from auto exhausts and other sources react with sunlight, also contributes to the damage attributed to acid rain, the report said.
At a news briefing today, members of the study group said that the findings provide a firmer basis for policy making. But they conceded that the study, which cost $537 million to prepare, left a number of important questions unanswered, including the economic cost of acid rain damage.
James R. Mahoney, director of the program, said that the findings were surrounded by ''considerable uncertainty.''
But he also said that the work of the program ''significantly reduced the scientific uncertainties about acidic deposition processes and effects.'' ''Many, but not all, of the scientific consensus views reported in the early 1980's have been supported by more recent studies,'' he said, ''but the more extreme views in both directions expressed by some individual scientists and in some of the media have been rendered unlikely to be correct.''
Dr. Mahoney said that energy conservation should be first of the list of permanent measures to be taken to resolve the long-term problem of acid rain.
 
Reactions Are Mixed
Industry groups said the report showed that damage from acid rain was less than feared and that there was no need to rush into expensive control measures.
Thomas R. Kuhn, president of the Edison Electric Institute, an association of privately owned electric utilities, said, ''The most compelling results of the study point out that damage from acid rain is much less than we feared in the late 1970's and early 1980's.''
Environmentalists said the report included little that was new and made little difference in terms of policy.
David Hawkins, a lawyer and air pollution expert for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that ''President Bush was wise not to wait'' for the report to formulate an acid rain proposal.
''Little comes out of it that we didn't know before we started,'' he added.
Among the unanswered questions, Mr. Hawkins said, are the long-term effects on forests and the details of health risks.
''Our reaction is that this is a very expensive exercise in documenting the obvious,'' he said.
The final report will be made public in the next few months after the public has a chance to comment on the draft.
Eileen B. Claussen, the E.P.A. representative on the panel, said that while the report had not definitively cleared up all the issues, it underscored the need for the acid rain control legislation proposed by President Bush. That legislation would cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons, nearly half of current levels.

HEADLINE: Where's Their Fair Share?

 BODY:
So far, with the exception of Britain, France and Saudi Arabia, the nations arrayed against Iraq have offered practically nothing.
The forces gathering against Iraq are called a united military effort. So far, they consist essentially of some 100,000 soldiers and sailors from the United States, 2,000 from Egypt and 7,000 from all our European allies. And the American taxpayer has been picking up almost all the cost, with significant help only from the Saudis plus a modest recent pledge of $1 billion by Japan. 
Senator Sam Nunn, no alarmist, now estimates that the gulf crisis could cost $50 billion over the next 12 months for military operations and economic aid to victimized states. That's twice the Bush Administration estimate; it sounds more prudent. There is no way Americans can be expected to shoulder so much of that burden.
West Europeans and Japan rely on gulf oil even more than the U.S. does. That's the practical reason to insist that they meet their responsibilities. There's also a principled reason. They all profess their determination to resist Iraq's aggression.
The arguments some Europeans and Japanese make for vacillating are almost as repellent as the vacillation. For instance, some of their leaders say they feel awkward about giving money for U.S. military operations because that will make Americans look like mercenaries.
Yes? Well, better to look like mercenaries than like sideline soldiers or deadbeats, eager for us to protect their oil with our blood. Let them send more of their own forces. That goes for the British, French and Egyptians as well.
The Germans and the Japanese beg off on the grounds that their Constitutions forbid military action beyond their borders. That's understandable. But it should not traduce their constitutional consciences to dispatch minesweepers or doctors or transport ships and planes - or cash. With American lives on the line, this kind of hair-splitting sounds cynical.
In recent days, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Secretary of State James Baker have been asking members of the European Community to shoulder specific financial responsibilities, notably to help shield the new democracies of Eastern Europe and refugees in Jordan. And brave Turkey desperately needs trade and aid help to offset its sacrifice. The American officials also are asking help to offset the costs of keeping forces in Europe. These requests are necessary, and just. The European Community foreign ministers meet in Rome tomorrow to discuss these matters. If they want aggression to be defeated, energy prices and supplies kept secure and a voice in matters of war and peace, they will have to stop playing games and start paying their share.

HEADLINE: Yes, We Can Retool As Cold War Ends

 BODY:
Thousands of smaller defense contractors, vital for regional economies, may be the most fertile ground for diversification. A survey of small to mid-size Ohio-based defense contractors shows most of their contracts averaged one year or less. And many small shops are set up to service one or two larger contractors.
The Pentagon can help break down barriers between the defense and commercial marketplaces. Obviously, fighter aircraft and commercial transports are entirely different animals. But what about electronics and computer chips, where defense and commercial customers increasingly use the same technology?
The Defense Science Board disclosed that standard commercial microchips were 5 to 10 years ahead of those the Pentagon buys and just as rugged. If the Defense Department could fill more of its needs by buying products off the shelf, companies could use the same technology, products and work forces for orders in both markets, according to Norman Augustine, chief executive officer of Martin Marietta.
Agencies like the Commerce and Labor Department could point out areas of emerging technology, export opportunities and contracting possibilities with other Federal agencies.
We all have a stake in the post-cold war era. Let's not simply leave our future in the hands of a few company officials.

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
Forget About Gulfo

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Here are four graphs on burden-sharing from a two-decade supporter of the Mansfield Amendment: 1. Money: The $8-a-barrel rise in oil prices since the invasion, combined with the two-million-barrel-a-day increase in production by the emirates and the Saudis, means added profit to them of $3 billion a month, a third of that from the U.S. alone. That windfall should be for protection, not profiteering; all money generated by the blockade of Iraqi-Kuwaiti oil should be escrowed in the Overthrow-Saddam Fund. 2. Arab participation: The states to benefit most from the realignment of the Arab world are Egypt, our ally, and Syria, our bedfellow. Cairo should put 50,000 soldiers in Saudi Arabia soon if it wants to assume Arab leadership; Damascus should mass its 4,000 tanks on its Iraqi border to force Mr. Hussein to split his forces. 3. European troops: Turkey, a NATO member, has a long border with Iraq. NATO forces should be moved quickly from facing the Soviets to NATO's southern flank to face its new military-economic threat. Ships, planes and French tokenism are not enough; unless NATO nations are willing to put soldiers on the new front line, the U.S. will speed its NATO drawdown. 4. Soviet double-gaming: Mr. Bush should tell Mr. Gorbachev to choose sides. A thousand Russians are even now teaching Iraqi troops how to use the most modern Soviet equipment to kill Americans; not only should they be withdrawn forthwith, but the largest army in the world should participate actively in the world police action. 
How's that for burden-sharing? To the extent that freeloaders defect, beg off and goldbrick, we can grumble and retaliate - but not lay down the burden. That is because our vital national interest lies in keeping a proven aggressor and poison-gasser from becoming a nuclear power.
Now we can address a trio of optimistic assumptions that afflict the self-negotiators of C.C.I.: 1. Saddam Hussein can be persuaded to leave Kuwait. If only we give him a fig leaf - like knocking over the Kuwaiti rulers, with a permanent payoff from Kuwaiti oil profits - doves hope he will be a reasonable fellow.
But he has burned his bridges in giving back his Iranian waterway conquest. Without Kuwait, he has no gulf outlet; this is not only a matter of ''face,'' but plain power and money. He won't budge. 2. A blockade will make him reasonable. He put his people through eight years of privation in war with Iran for no gain and remains in power. As we starve Iraq, he will starve our hostages on TV; the crueler side will win, and that is not our side. 3. Patient squeezing will get him to close his poison-gas plants and stop building nuclear bombs.
This notion, at the base of every C.C.I. editorialist's proposed deal, elevates wishful thinking to world-class self-delusion. Why on earth should he give up the fearsome power that has made him the most dangerous man in the world? When has a despot bent on dominance ever voluntarily emasculated his source of terror?
Incredibly, Secretary of State Baker encourages daydreams of a tamed Saddam Hussein by proposing an open-ended sojourn - a Gulfo, or regional Persian Gulf organization patterned on NATO - to ''contain'' rather than defeat the Iraqi dictator. Westerners would sail about in airconditioned warships while neighborhood troops would patrol his borders for decades.
The Gulfo notion is as divorced from reality as the Concerned Isolationists' dream that peaceful squeezing will cause the aggressor to regurgitate Kuwait and disarm.
Gulfo is being advanced to conjure a vision of a deal that fails to deal with Mr. Hussein's nuclear buildup -a false promise of ''all sharing the burden'' of containment forever.
The typesetter rightly recognized this as wimpish mush. Either the Butcher of Baghdad will be defeated, or he will give new meaning to ''the nuclear club.''

HEADLINE: Boat Club: A Haven in a Wave of Condos

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

 BODY:
Inside the yacht club's rusty gates, there are no more yachts to speak of. Old boats litter the boatyard, with weeds grazing on their wooden hulls, and the ranks of fishermen who still fish have dwindled. Much of the hard work around the clubhouse is done by the Coke machine, which dispenses Budweisers.
Even at the end of Clasons Point, a place largely hidden from the violence and decay of neighborhoods just across the Bronx River, the club has never fashioned itself as an island. If its members have kept a distance, they say, it has been through their vision of the club as a good, quiet place in a stormy world.
But as though after a rain, pastel-colored condominiums have sprouted along the last stretch of Soundview Avenue. And where the avenue ends at the Point Yacht Club, members have begun to fear for its survival. 
''We're being surrounded,'' said Arthur Seifert, who has spent all of his 64 years in the area, the last 20 of them as a member of the club. ''The condominiums have changed everything.''
The powerful Manhattan real-estate developers building Shorehaven, as their condominium venture is called, describe it as the largest nonsubsidized residential development in Bronx memory. Stepping carefully around fears that 1,158 new middle-income neighbors might overwhelm a community ensconced in old bungalows and beached houseboats, the developers have drawn local politicians strongly behind them. And for the moment, with about 200 of the condo units built, spokesmen for Shorehaven say they have no designs on the city-owned land that the Point Yacht Club leases month to month.
As waterfront property, the land cannot be sold. But the club, which inherited the site from a homesteader who received the title for his service in the Spanish-American War, pays only $450 a month in rent.
 
Assurances and Fears
At auction, the lease might command 10 times that amount. And despite assurances that the land's use is not now in debate, club members fear that once it is - perhaps after Shorehaven fills with new homeowners -the value of their investment might not register on the scales of a city more desperate each year for cash.
''You know how when they give a toy to a little kid and he loves it more than anything?'' said Felix Hernandez, the club's rear commodore. ''That's how I feel about this place.'' Mano, as Mr. Hernandez is known, does not have the look of a sentimental man. Large and round, with the leathery skin of a life in the sun, he spends off-hours driving cleaning machinery over Orchard Beach for the Parks Department. Around the club he is described as a Hemingwayesque figure, presumably because he is one of the few older men who still venture out to sea.
But legends swirl around other club members, particularly when they sit down to sip refreshments by the clubhouse pool table or the shaded benches outside.
 
A 52-Pound Lobster
Among them is Billy J. Pajer, a fisherman turned building maintenance man whose best fish story involves the capture of a 52-pound lobster and its eventual sale to a Cuban restaurateur on the Seventh Avenue IRT. There is Mr. Seifert, a sometime adventurer, knickknack collector and backyard inventor who once imported a 1909 Swedish trolley car to Brooklyn, where it rolled about a mile. And there is the Point Yacht Club's commodore, Anibal (Tex) Texeira, whose three decades as a New York City homicide detective hold tales like the time he went undercover as a psychiatric patient in Bellevue Hospital to catch a murderer.
Among the honorary members is Ramond Masa, 42, a crusader for the rights of the disabled. Better known as Megaman, Mr. Masa, who comes by the club to water-ski, has sought to inspire other paraplegics like himself with such actions as dangling in his wheelchair from the Brooklyn Bridge, samurai swords in hand.
''We don't get normal people,'' Mr. Pajer said.
To such men, there is no confusing the club's essence with the sum of its battered parts. As their eyes wander the grounds, they pass over the old tires, the rusty oil drums, the weeds dotted with weathered bits of plastic. Instead, they are drawn toward the horizon, fixing on the slate-blue clubhouse, the picnic tables or the few small fishing craft still bobbing off the end of their dock.
 
'A Lot of Character'
Not so long ago, they recalled, theirs was but one of half a dozen yacht clubs in the area. They were nice places but not fancy, the collective memory holds, the kind of clubs where everyone knew each other.
''I tell you it had a lot of character,'' Mr. Seifert, who is also a historian, said of the area. ''It was almost like Coney Island.''
By most accounts, Clasons Point saw its best days after World War I. At the end of a trolley line, the Clasons Point amusement park, the site of what was at least momentarily the world's biggest swimming pool, was still going strong. Bootleggers favored the creeks running out of the point, and its casinos, Gilligan's and Kane's, were frequented by such gangster notables as Pretty Boy Floyd and Legs Diamond, Mr. Seifert has written.
But through the Depression and the next World War, decay was quick. Shipbuilding petered out along the waterfront, boatyards closed and the abandoned lots grew over with weeds. In the 1950's and 60's, a local doctor built the Shorehaven Beach Club into a favorite weekend retreat of middle-class Jewish families from the Bronx, but by the 1970's it too was fighting weeds.
Even before a consortium of Manhattan developers received approval three years ago to build condominiums on the beach club's old site, Clasons Point and the Point Yacht Club had already started to change.
In nearby Harding Park, Hispanic families had begun to move in alongside the European immigrants who had lived there for years. Down the point, the park alongside the club swarmed each night with drug users, prostitutes and other unwelcome revelers, the police said.
 
New Recruits for Club
The club, its membership dominated by names like Smitty or Jasinski, found itself under some pressure from local politicians to integrate. It found Mr. Texeira when he helped to fix a small legal problem for a friend of the then-commodore. And along with Joe Rodriguez, a decorated Bronx firefighter, Mr. Texeira found new recruits by the handful.
The 48 members, who now include 35 Puerto Ricans and two women, elected Mr. Texeira commodore last year. With carpenters, electricians and plumbers among them, the members say they could easily muster the funds and expertise to overhaul the club - if they had more security than a month-to-month lease.
''I know it's an eyesore,'' said Mr. Texeira, a tough-talking man who says he lives in fear of lawyers who have stopped by from time to time on behalf of the Shorehaven development. ''If we had a lease, we could really bring this place up.''
Still, most members see some blessings mixed with Shorehaven's negative points - a new park for Clasons Point, more police patrols, economic betterment for the borough. They just wish they could be around to enjoy it, they say.
''What's nicer than a flag and a boat?'' Mr. Seifert asked as he stood one afternoon on the club's dock, an old barge that some tug-captain friends hauled up years ago in exchange for bottles of whisky and steak dinners. ''They just don't appreciate what we are.''

HEADLINE: No End to Rising Subway Crime; It May Get Worse, Chief Asserts

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Contributing to the rise in subway crime, he said, are the many juvenile repeat offenders, who often commit crimes within days of being released.
 
Juveniles Heavily Involved
More than 25 percent of all subway robberies are committed by juveniles, like the gang of youths who the police said killed Brian Watkins of Provo, Utah, on Sunday night when he tried to stop them from beating and robbing his parents at the 53d Street subway station in Manhattan.
In the first six months of 1990, the number of reported felony crimes committed in the subways rose 17 percent, to 8,977 felonies, compared with 7,663 in the first half of 1989. Transit police officials attribute the increase to a sharp rise in robberies, which jumped 22 percent, to 4,518 reported incidents in the first half of 1990, compared with 3,714 in the same period last year. 
''The numbers are not going down and will probably not go down for a while,'' said Chief Bratton, who succeeded Vincent Del Castillo, who resigned under pressure because of rising crime. ''These kids have no sense of the results of their actions. They fail to understand that if you stab someone, the person might die. These kids live for the minute and don't have value systems like the rest of society.''
 
Preventive Actions Taken
Mr. Bratton said that in the last five months he started a number of programs to deter subway crime, like conducting sweeps to arrest fare evaders; putting more officers in plainclothes to foil robbers; giving experienced officers incentives to stay on patrol duty, where they are needed most, and working with the Family Court to insure that repeat subway offenders serve time in jail.
But critics of the transit police said those efforts would not be effective until there were more transit officers in the subways who were committed to enforcing the law and ferreting out crime.
The present force is short 500 officers, and many of the officers would prefer to be on the New York City Police force.

HEADLINE: Rinfret Proposes Cutting Spending and Taxes to Bridge Gaps

BYLINE: By FRANK LYNN

 BODY:
''He's going to Florio New York,'' Mr. Rinfret said of Mr. Cuomo, referring to Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey, whose tax increases just after he took office in January have touched off a taxpayer rebellion.
 
Fiscal Steps
Mr. Rinfret's proposed these fiscal steps:
* Freezing state spending next year, an action that would mean no pay increases for state workers.
* Reducing the state work force by 20 percent through attrition.
* Placing a lid on state school aid. Mr. Rinfret said the state's problems in education reflected ''a teaching problem, not a problem of money.'' 
* Eliminating the $150 million excellence in teaching program and replacing it with a $50 million program of school excellence incentive awards.
* Performing a ''complete overhaul'' of Medicaid, including transferring 240,000 welfare recipients of the state-run health insurance program to private insurance carriers.
Mr. Rinfret tackled a sensitive legislative pork barrel item when he said that he would ''gut'' the $120,000 budget line that enables legislators to give grants to favorite organizations and programs within their districts.
 
Tax Cuts Over 4 Years
On the tax side of the ledger, Mr. Rinfret pledged a $5.5 billion tax-reduction package over four years. His tax proposals included these:
* An accelerated phase-in of state income tax reductions, reducing the state's top income tax rate to 7 percent by 1992, a year sooner than Mr. Cuomo would.
* An exemption of $150 in clothing purchases from the state and city sales tax.
* A reduction in local property taxes through a five-year elimination of the local contribution to Medicaid.
* An elimination of the gross receipts taxes on utilities that are passed on to consumers.
* A three-year reduction in the 15 percent business tax surcharge.
* A change in state estate taxes to conform with the more liberal Federal allowances.
 
Issue of School Aid
Mr. Rinfret's plan comes after Mr. Cuomo and the State Legislature approved a $1.8 billion tax-increase package this year. A $1 billion package of tax and fee increases was approved last year, when a tax cut also went into effect .
Most of the programs that he would freeze or change and the taxes he would cut have been approved by his fellow Republicans in the State Senate majority. But his campaign manager, Assemblyman John Faso of Kinderhook, acknowledged that even Republican legislators would resist a ban on any more state school aid. Long Island Republicans, including the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino of Oyster Bay. are particularly strong supporters of school aid.
But Mr. Rinfret left himself an escape hatch when he said his proposals ''were not set in concrete'' except for a no-tax-increase pledge for next year. ''That is set in concrete,'' he said. Mr. Rinfret, who acknowledged that he had been ''ambivalent'' about the proposed $1.9 billion environmental bond issue being promoted by the Governor, said in response to a question in Manhattan that he would vote against it in November. ''Can we afford this when the state is broke?'' he asked.
State Comptroller Edward V. Regan, the only Republican elected statewide in 1986, announced his opposition to the bond issue on Tuesday - putting the two leading Republican candidates at odds not only with Democrats but also with the Republican State Senate leadership, which favored the borrowing, subject to voter approval.
 
'Simplistic in the Extreme'
Mr. Rinfret said his staff and Republican legislative aides had been working on the fiscal package for two months and insisted that he was not engaged in the fiscal gimmickry that he has accused the Governor of. ''I wouldn't be so stupid,'' he said.
But some legislative aides questioned how politically realistic some of the Mr. Rinfret's proposals were. The Governor's press secretary, Gary Fryer, called the package ''simplistic in the extreme.'' Addressing the proposed cuts in the 120,000-member state work force, Mr. Fryer said there had been effectively a freeze on state employees during the Cuomo administration except for prisons, parole and probation and the state police. He added that 70 percent of state spending went back to localities so that any major cuts would drive up local taxes.
Mr. Rinfret said he could finance these tax reductions by leveling off state spending that would in turn encourage economic growth. ''We're saying no more increases, stop the growth in spending,'' he declared at a news conference.
Mr. Rinfret said several times that the Governor had ''stolen'' funds from pension systems and other reserves to balance his current budget and that such one-time revenues would leave a $1.5 billion gap in the state budget next year even before anticipated increases in welfare, Medicaid and capital spending that would widen the gap to a minimum of $2.5 billion.

HEADLINE: Dukakis Orders Further Cuts As State Tax Collections Fall

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BOSTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
That prompted Mr. Dukakis to order his Cabinet to make cuts of about 4 percent of executive branch spending.
 
Cuts Called 'Absolutely Essential'
''I hope this will be the last time I have to ask my Cabinet secretaries to make these reductions,'' he said, ''but given the uncertainty, it may not be.'' 
Mr. Dukakis, the Democratic Party's Presidential nominee in 1988, said the cuts were ''absolutely essential if we're going to make sure that this state begins to get back on the road to economic recovery.''
Asked about the possibility of another tax increase, Mr. Dukakis said, ''I don't think that's at all realistic.''
Last year, legislators approved a 15 percent income tax increase that was supposed to be temporary. Then this year, the Legislature approved $1.2 billion in higher taxes for this year and $1.6 billion for the next fiscal year, as well as cutting all spending by 4 percent across the board.
 
Republicans Are Critical
Mr. Dukakis's action was endorsed by Richard Manley, head of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, which is backed by business, and by Democratic leaders in the Legislature.
Republican leaders, while acknowledging the need for cuts, said the move was too little, too late.
''It is my understanding the Governor has canceled his trip to Europe on the theory he recognizes the fiscal crisis,'' said David Locke, the leader of the Republican minority in the State Senate. ''He might do well to take his European trip and cancel the return flight.''
Mr. Dukakis said he planned to join the European trade mission later this week.

HEADLINE: Budget Negotiators Prepare for a Last-Ditch Effort to Cut the Deficit

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
Then, with their opening bids on the table, Mr. Darman and about two dozen lawmakers from both parties will begin an isolated weekend of bargaining in an effort to reconcile these positions that have long been irreconcilable.
 
Little Headway in 3 Months
These same people made little headway in three months of talks this the spring and summer.
Now they are faced not only with an economy that appears much weaker than it did when their discussions broke up early last month, but also with a military commitment in the Middle East of unknown cost and duration. That would seem to mitigate against an agreement. 
But one factor - the calendar -leads the negotiators to think they can reach an agreement over the weekend. If nothing is done, across-the-board spending cuts of more than 40 percent in most Government activities, including the military, will go into effect automatically starting on Oct. 1, at the start of the fiscal year 1991. Such cuts are seen by both sides as untenable.
The automatic cuts would result because the deficit forecast for fiscal 1991 is far above the $64 billion ceiling set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law.
 
Projected Budget Deficit
Last month Mr. Darman put the prospective deficit in the $1.2 trillion budget at almost $170 billion if the savings and loan bailout is not counted, and at $232 billion if the bailout is included. This afternoon, just before meeting with Republican lawmakers, the budget director said changes in the economy in the last month had probably pushed the top figure to $250 billion.
Both sides acknowledge that the target under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law will have to be changed. All agree that the economy would collapse under a deficit reduction package of $100 billion or more.
But they also say that changing the budget law without making what an Administration economist called ''a down payment on some enduring budget reduction strategy'' would be economically and politically disastrous.
The financial markets, they say, would conclude that the politicans did not have the stomach to make even a modest dent in the deficit, sending interest rates soaring in the face of likely inflation.
Politically, said Representative Leon E. Panetta, the California Democrat who heads the House Budget Committee, ''neither party can face the election without having something in place.''
 
Need for a Credible Plan
Keynesian analysis suggests that raising taxes and reducing spending is the wrong medicine for an economy on the verge of recession. But economists in the Administration and Congress are convinced that the drag of a $50 billion deficit reduction package would be offset by lower interest rates.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has said for years that the Fed would be able to drive rates down if the politicians enacted a credible long-term deficit-reduction plan.
Mr. Darman and Mr. Gephardt told reporters today that they were committed to cutting the deficit by $50 billion in the fiscal year 1991 and by $500 billion cumulatively over the next five years. Other lawmakers and officials, including Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, made similar statements publicly.
But, pushed on what they really think, lawmakers and Administration officials said the most optimistic outcome was a deficit reduction of perhaps $40 billion and that $25 billion was more probable.
 
How to Cut $25 Billion
Stanley E. Collender, a budget specialist at Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm, who probably follows the negotiations more closely than any other expert outside the Government, suggested how the budget negotiators might arrive at the $25 billion figure.
Before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, negotiators were considering Pentagon spending cuts of $10 billion to $12 billion. But given the new military commitment, Mr. Collender said, $6 billion is the largest reduction that could be expected.
Democrats in Congress are unlikely to accept bigger cuts in domestic spending than in military spending, he said, so the most that could be taken from the domestic ledger would be $6 billion. That makes $12 billion in spending cuts.
The Administration and Republican lawmakers, Mr. Collender said, will not let taxes be raised more than spending is cut, so the largest possible tax increase is $12 billion. Adding $1 billion for reduced interest costs that would result from the lower deficit, and Mr. Collender comes up with $25 billion.
''What drives it is how much defense can be cut,'' he said.
 
'There Has Got to Be Symmetry'
Without accepting Mr. Collender's figures, Mr. Panetta said the reasoning was sound. ''Whether anybody likes it or not, there has got to be symmetry,'' he said.
Senator Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said he hoped to persuade his colleagues that the military spending in the Persian Gulf was such an ''extraordinary, temporary cost'' that it should be counted separately from other military expenditures.
Some economists in the Administration and Congress said a $50 billion cut in next year's deficit would have been reasonable if it had been enacted last spring, but might not be wise now. They contended that the Federal Reserve's monetary policy wsould take time to affect the economy, and that even if lower interest rates became effective this month it might be too late to offset higher taxes and lower spending across the economy.
Thus, the economists said, tax and spending changes might have to be postponed until April instead of becoming effective in October or January, and that would limit their impact in the next fiscal year.
One Administration economist suggested that the spending and tax decisions could have a ''safety valve'' that delayed them automatically if the economy turned really sour.
Until now, Mr. Darman has shared the budget negotiations with John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. But Mr. Sununu will be with the President in Helsinki this weekend, and Mr. Brady will not return until Saturday from a trip around the world to raise money from allies to offset the effect of the conflict in the Persian Gulf.

HEADLINE: End-of-Year Shortage of Oil Forecast

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
Mr. Easton said the loss of exports from Iraq and Kuwait was about 4.3 million barrels a day, of which about 3.3 million would be made up by the additional output agreed to by Saudi Arabia and other oil producers.
 
Private Economists Pessimistic
While he suggested that over time key areas of the country could find heating oil in short supply, private economists painted a much grimmer picture. ''We are convinced that the usable commercial crude oil stocks will be depleted by the end of October,'' said Edward N. Krapels, president of Energy Security Analysis in Washington, a consulting firm that tracks the price of oil. 
Mr. Krapels added that the daily shortfall in production could easily reach two million barrels, pushing the price of oil to $40 a barrel.
That prediction is significantly larger than the one made by the 21-nation International Energy Agency, which estimated last month that oil-producing countries could make up for all but 500,000 barrels of the loss from Iraq and Kuwait.
Mr. Easton, as one of the first representatives of the Bush Administration to testify on the energy supply situation since Congress returned from its August vacation, encountered a host of worried lawmakers, who expressed frustration over the rising cost of gasoline, accused the oil industry of price gouging and criticized the Administration for refusing to tap the nation's 560-million-barrel reserve to ease rising prices. Most members of Congress have supported Mr. Bush's actions.
''Despite urging from many in Congress, the Administration refused to ease the pain of consumer price increases by drawing down the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which could have prevented both a shortfall and Wall Street speculation about it,'' said John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the committee.
''The U.S. is being held hostage, not by Saddam Hussein, but at the gas pump,'' said Chuck Douglas, Republican of New Hampshire.
 
Collusion Issue Played Down
Mr. Easton also tried to play down questions about collusion by the oil industry to push prices up. ''I don't think we have enough empirical evidence at this point to make statements like that,'' he said.
The members of the panel pressed him on how the Administration was planning to address the problem of the country's growing dependence on imported oil. While he said the first priority would be to promote a more efficient use of fuel, Mr. Easton added that the Administration was looking at a series of tax breaks to promote production, as well as efforts to open up drilling in new areas.
But he declined repeatedly to be specific, saying that more than 700 proposals had been submitted to the Energy Department, which will propose a policy to the President by the end of the year. He added that the President would make his recommendations to Congress by early next year.

HEADLINE: Ripple Effect of Soviet Oil Drop

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
In addition, early this year Moscow stopped its worldwide marketing of Iraqi oil, which it had received in exchange for arms shipments, according to experts. Experts say Iraq produced that oil, estimated at 145,000 to 200,000 barrels a day last year, outside its quota set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and its loss further reduces world supplies.
The Soviet Union's own exports will average about 3.3 million barrels a day this year, down from 3.7 million barrels a day last year, according to Robert E. Ebel, the vice president for international affairs of the Enserch Corporation of Dallas. Mr. Ebel, a former Government intelligence officer, said that in 1988 exports reached 4.1 million barrels a day.
Eastern European countries that took about half the Soviet exports, paying for them through barter or in currencies that are not freely exchangeable on world markets, have borne the brunt of the export cuts, according to Western experts. Some of that crude was refined and sold to Western countries. They were also major users and processors of Iraqi oil, generally acquired by barter. 
There is also some reduction in sales of Soviet crude to Western European countries that paid in hard currency, but Soviet oil income could still rise because the price of a barrel is up sharply.
The Soviet Union is the world's biggest oil producer, but as an exporter it trails Saudi Arabia, the world's largest, which had an OPEC quota of 5.38 million barrels under the last agreement before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. But it is ahead of Iraq, which had a quota of 3.14 million barrels, and Kuwait, which had a quota of 1.5 million. The United Nations-led embargo has denied world markets the 4.6 million barrels a day from Iraq and Kuwait, but OPEC has authorized other members to produce more oil to try to make up the loss.
The United States is the second-largest producer, with about 8.5 million barrels a day of crude oil and condensates, but it also the world's largest importer, buying about the same amount it produces, in normal times.
Compared with these numbers, the Soviet declines are small, but they come at a time of market tightness.
The Iraqi barter with the Soviet Union ended early this year, months before the invasion of Kuwait. Robert Mabro, director of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said that the Iraqis had been paying for ''arms, flour, tractors, whatever,'' and that none of the oil actually went to the Soviet Union; it was simply sold or re-bartered. Western experts are not sure why the barter stopped; one suggested that it was for a debt that had been paid off.
With demand heightened by tourism and other factors, Eastern European countries like Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, which were large users of Iraqi oil either through direct barter or through the Soviet Union, are importing refined products, adding to the pressure on Western European refineries, according to Western experts. And oil traders in New York say that demand for gasoline in Europe is so strong now that some cargoes have gone from the Gulf Coast of the United States to northwestern Europe, opposite the normal flow, driving up prices in the United States.
Moscow was also channeling 90,000 barrels a day of Iraqi oil to India, and is reportedly making that up from domestic production. With that diversion and the decline in Soviet output, deliveries to Eastern Europe are down by 30 percent, by some estimates.
Soviet officials have told the former members of the Soviet bloc that they will demand payment for oil in hard currency beginning next year, and have reportedly asked for cash even sooner from some countries. But Western analysts doubt that the countries can meet the deadline.
The main reason for the decline in Soviet production is a decision early last year to decrease investment in the oil industry, in favor of investment in areas that could put products for consumers on store shelves.
''If perestroika means anything, it means cuts in energy and military capital expenditures,'' said one analyst based in Paris, who said he could not be publicly identified.
The oil and gas sector had soaked up 70 percent of the new investment capital available in the late 1980's, according to Thane Gustafson, a professor of government at Georgetown University and an expert on the Soviet oil industry, When production began to drop in 1985, he said, ''their response was to throw money at the problem. But this time they've decided explicitly not to do it again. The Soviets have said 'no,' they will let oil output fall.''
Ethnic unrest and a general breakdown of the Soviet economy are adding to production problems, experts say, but have not been as important as the lack of investment.
Mehdi Varzi, an oil expert at Kleinwort Grieveson Securities, in London, pointed out that Soviet production peaked in 1988, before the unrest in Azerbaijan, site of much of the oil service industry, and before the restiveness of other republics and the general breakdown of the economy.
''They really haven't undertaken the necessary measures in maintenance, well workovers, replacement of equipment and so forth, what is normally called good industry practice,'' Mr. Varzi said.
A ''wild card'' for future oil production, according to Mr. Gustafson, is that some republics have asserted a claim to their mineral resources.
The Soviet Ministry of Geology and the government of the Turkmen republic made a joint announcement earlier this week that they would open about 90,000 square kilometers, or 56,250 square miles, to exploration by Western companies. This was the first joint announcement between the national government and a republic, Professor Gustafson said. About 85 percent of existing production is in the Russian republic, however.
Soviet and American oil production is declining at roughly the same rate. But oil companies in the United States say that Soviet geology offers far more promising possibilities than does that of the United States. ''They have not developed a technical base for drilling deep for oil,'' said Mr. Ebel of the Enserch Corporation. Rather than drill below 10,000 feet, he added, they moved on to other oilfields, but now they have run out of new fields.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Chairman Is Named For Emery Worldwide

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

 BODY:
Long a leader in the trucking industry, Consolidated fell into a financial crisis after the April 1989 acquisition of Emery Air Freight for $478 million. Unable to reverse Emery's losses, which were running at $1 million a week at the time of the acquisition, Consolidated reported its first loss since 1961 and suspended its common stock dividend for the first time in 19 years. 
In July, Lary R. Scott, 54, Consolidated's president and chief executive officer and the architect of the Emery deal, resigned under pressure and was replaced by the former chief executive of Consolidated, Raymond O'Brien, who is 68. J. Frank Leach, 69, who had been on Consolidated's board since 1975, but was not an employee, joined as president and chief operating officer.
Mr. Bass, who is credited with returning Coopervision to operating profitability, believes he can do the same for Emery. It is ''a company with 42 years of infrastructure and a franchise,'' he said. ''We have the ability to leverage that franchise and exploit niches underexplored by other players,'' he said, but added that he was not yet sure how to do so. ''Literally, I've got a lot of homework to do,'' he said.
Before joining Cooper in March 1989, Mr. Bass was vice chairman and president of Federal Express. He is also a former chairman and chief executive officer of Midway Airlines. He received his B.A. in English from Middlebury College in Vermont. He and his wife, Paula, have three children.

HEADLINE: White House Opposes Plan for Data Base

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
The proposed data base would include all industrial technology -dealing with physics, chemistry, biology, communications, transportation, medicine and other sciences - developed with the aid of Federal- and state-financed research. The Federal Government spent $6 billion last year on university-sponsored research. But the Administration said today that the final project would duplicate existing Government data bases and that a $25 million pilot project would be too costly. 
 
Approach Seen as Piecemeal
House Democratic leaders contend, however, that the Government's approach has been piecemeal and that access to the current data bases depends on knowledge of their existence and protocols - rules governing the communication and transfer of data between machines. They argue that technology transfer through data bases provides the biggest return for the investment.
Raymond G. Kammer, the deputy director of the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology, told the House Small Business Committee that although the Administration supported the legislation's goals, it opposed the proposed project. Mr. Kammer said the Government had several programs designed to give American companies access to federally financed technology in specific areas.
''We do not need additional authorizing legislation to develop and/or implement them,'' Mr. Kammer said.
This view was challenged by Representative John J. LaFalce, Democrat of upstate New York, chairman of the committee. He said that under existing programs a business in need of technical assistance had to know ''10 different protocols needed to access 10 different data bases.''
 
Keys to 'Competitive Kingdom'
Mr. LaFalce said consolidation of industrial technology data in a single data base would mean that ''all a business needs is access to a personal computer and a telephone in order to have the very best technological expertise.''
Similarly, Representative Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, chairman of the Small Business Subcommittee on Regulations, Business Opportunities and Energy, called technologies ''our keys to the competitive kingdom'' and urged the Government to give American companies access to industrial technologies.
Joe Shuster, the chief executive officer of Teltech Inc., a Minneapolis information systems company, said that ''smart, world-class competitors are constantly looking for leverage, and nothing today provides more economic leverage than technical knowledge - nothing.''

HEADLINE: Prices of Oil Rise Again Amid Signs of Hoarding

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:

 
Controls Imposed by Texaco
'It appears to be happening all through the distribution chain; wholesalers, retailers and customers are topping off their tanks in anticipation of higher prices,'' said Paul Weeditz, a spokesman for Texaco Inc. ''We have had spot outages at some terminals.'' He added that the company had imposed a system of controls limiting the amount distributors can withdraw each day to prevent runs on storage terminals and shortages.
''Yes, people are filling their tanks,'' said Deborah Urso, a spokesman for the Mobil Oil Company. ''They are filling up because they are nervous about price.'' 
Sales made directly to gasoline stations are following normal patterns, but intermediate buyers, called jobbers, have been increasing their demand, said James Huccaby, a manager of supply for the Chevron Corporation. ''We do not know if they are keeping it in their tanks or selling to other accounts on an unbranded basis. But jobber demand is up.''
A rush by motorists to fill their tanks could cause shortages because of the sheer number of cars on the road, oil industry officials said. ''There are 140 million vehicles on the road,'' said Cyrus Tahmassebi, chief economist for Ashland Oil Inc. ''If each one of them starts carrying five more gallons, that is a tremendous amount of gasoline; almost 17 million barrels.''
Current supplies of crude oil and refined products appear to be adequate, according to figures released yesterday by the American Petroleum Institute. Gasoline inventories, for example, remained virtually unchanged during the week ended Aug. 31 at 210.5 million barrels compared to 210.9 million in the previous week.
But the loss of 4.3 million barrels a day of exports from Iraq and Kuwait could start producing shortages as early as November, according to the International Energy Agency, a monitoring agency for the industrialized nations.
The agency said stocks on hand appeared adequate to meet demand for now, but colder weather could bring regional shortages. The agency said the 24 countries represented had stocks adequate for 98 days of consumption on July 1, two days better than a year ago.
Demand in the fourth quarter will be 1.25 million barrels a day higher than the third quarter because of weather, estimated Mehdi Varzi, an oil analyst with Kleinwort Grievson Securities in London. In trading there, the benchmark Brent crude closed at $30.95 a barrel, up 80 cents on the day.
 
Buying From Far East Cited
The higher prices, he said, were being driven by buying from the Far East. ''Underlying all this is fear that war will break out in the Persian Gulf and Far Eastern customers will suffer, so they need to retain a higher level of stocks than other areas of the world,'' he added.
Similarly, an analyst in New York, who declined to be quoted by name, said war fears were also propelling prices upward. ''People are reluctant to let go of the barrel they have,'' he added. ''If war breaks out, they may be better off with that barrel.''
Yesterday, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq made one of his most inflammatory statments to date, calling for Arabs to unite in a holy war against United States forces in Saudia Arabia and to depose King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. Shortly before Iraq invaded Kuwait, touching off the current crisis, oil was selling for about $21 a barrel.

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales Tumbled 21.4% in Late August

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 5

 BODY:
For all of August, the annual selling rate was 6.8 million. Since January, cars have been selling at a rate of approximately 6.6 million.
Faced with sluggish demand, most auto makers have been paying rebates of as much as several thousand dollars on many car and truck models. In the last week, the Big Three domestic auto makers have announced a new round of rebates on most of their 1991 models, which are just beginning to arrive in showrooms. These new rebates are generally smaller than those for the 1990 models that dealers are trying to clear out. 
The Big Three and the Japanese auto makers that operate factories in the United States sold 388,661 domestically built cars and trucks in late August, compared with 494,261 during the comparable period of last year.
 
Big Three Auto Sales Off
The number of domestic vehicles sold by the Big Three was off 26.4 percent in late August, and the number sold by Japanese ''transplants'' was 15.9 percent higher. Thus, the Big Three's share of sales resulting from domestic production fell to 82.5 percent, from 88.1 percent a year in the 1989 period.
Sales of all American-built cars fell 18.8 percent in the late August period, to 257,241. The General Motors Corporation sold 105,306 American-built cars in the Aug. 21-31 period, down 21.5 percent from a year earlier; Ford Motor sold 62,829 cars, down 32.8 percent, and the Chrysler Corporation sold 27,549 cars, down 31.7 percent.
Of the ''transplant'' auto makers based in Japan, the Honda Motor Company sold 25,224 cars, an increase of 38.3 percent; the Toyota Motor Corporation sold 22,781 cars, an increase of 23.7 percent, and the Nissan Motor Corporation sold 5,484 cars, a drop of 33.7 percent.
Sales of light trucks were off 25.6 percent, to 132,186, in the period. G.M. sold 55,030, a drop of 24.3 percent; Ford sold 46,678, a drop of 22.4 percent; Chrysler sold 23,072, a drop of 33.2 percent, and Nissan, which builds trucks at a plant in Smyrna, Tenn., sold 6,640, a drop of 35 percent.
The Persian Gulf crisis has not had a big effect yet on vehicle sales, several analysts said. Scott Merlis, automotive analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company in New York, noted that higher inflation and interest rates, which have been evident for the last month, usually depress auto sales after about 90 days have elapsed.
But Joel Pitcoff, sales and marketing analyst for the Ford Motor Company, said Ford dealers near military bases had reported a slowdown. He cited the Fayetteville, N.C., area, near Fort Bragg, as an example.
For the entire month of August, sales of all cars and trucks, imported and domestic, fell 16.7 percent, to 1,174,126, from 1,408,891 in August 1989. Car sales were off 17.6 percent, to 802,868, and truck sales declined 14.6 percent, to 371,258.
The Big Three's total vehicle sales in August, including imported models, fell 23.6 percent; the Big Three captured 56.8 percent of the market, compared with 61.3 percent a year earlier. Sales by Japanese car makers, including vehicles built in the United States, captured 33.5 percent of the market in August, compared with 28.6 percent a year ago. Vehicle sales by importers outside Japan fell 20.4 percent; the market share of these non-Japanese importers was 9.8 percent, down from 10.1 percent a year ago.
G.M. sold 241,014 American-built cars in August, a drop of 18.7 percent from a year ago; Ford sold 153,604, a drop of 26.8 percent, and Chrysler sold 61,207, a drop of 32.3 percent.
G.M.'s total market share in August was 33.9 percent, compared with 34.5 percent in August 1989. Ford had 23.6 percent, compared with 24.4 percent. Chrysler's total market share was 10.6 percent, compared with 12.5 percent.Toyota's market share was 10.1 percent, compared with 8.2 percent, and Honda's market share was 6.6 percent, compared with 5.6.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Fund Yields Are Mixed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The new data will take into account the Middle East crisis, and the analysts said they should show that the economy was weaker and close to a recession.
Managers of tax-exempt funds repositioned themselves this week and increased the number of days that securities are held in portfolios by 2, to 59.
Assets fell by $812 million, to $79.9 billion, while the average seven-day, tax-exempt, compounded yield increased 9 basis points, to 5.43 percent, and the 30-day average yield rose 4 basis points, to 5.29 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
For investors in a 28 percent tax bracket the equivalent taxable, seven-day compounded yield is 7.54 percent; it is 8.10 percent for investors in the 33 percent bracket.
Among tax-exempt funds with assets of better than $100 million survyed by IBC/Donoghue's, the Spartan New Jersey Municipal Money Market Portfolio showed the best return for the week, with a yield of 6.14 percent. The fund is distributed by the Fidelity Distributors Corporation of Boston.
Of the funds investing primarily in New York securities, the Spartan New York Municipal Money Market Portfolio, also distributed by Fidelity, showed the best return with a yield of 6.02 percent.
Meanwhile, assets of taxable funds declined by $2.1 billion, to $398.8 billion. Analysts said that among the possible causes were the settling down of the bond and stock markets and the cash settlement on Treasury notes bought at auction last week. Institutional assets declined by $900 million, to $84.1 billion, while consumer funds fell by $1.2 billion, to $314.7 billion.
The average days to maturity of securities held in managers' portfolios increased by one, to 46.
Donoghue's said the seven-day compounded average yield for a taxable money-market fund fell a basis point, to 7.75 percent, while the 30-day average yield fell a similar amount, to 7.77 percent.
Of the general-purpose money market funds with assets of more than $100 million, the Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Money Market fund had the best return for the second week. Its yield is 8.62 percent.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 14,85 to 2,628.22, on Light Volume

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Trading volume continued sluggish at 120.6 million shares, up from 96.5 million on Tuesday, which was the slowest day of 1990. A solid 953 stocks advanced, with 13 hitting new highs, while 571 fell and 68 set new lows.
''The market doesn't like a standoff in the desert any more than those who have to be on duty in that environment,'' said Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers. ''Aimless drifting on modest volume may be the market's role until there's a basic change in the investing environment.'' 
Many traders and investors continued to mark time until employment figures are released tomorrow. There is widespread feeling that they will show that the economy is extremely weak. Whether it is weak enough to induce the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy by lowering interest rates is still uncertain, although many feel such a move is near.
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. -worried about earnings, the price of oil and other uncertainties - eliminated its buy recommendations on nine Big Board technology stocks, including I.B.M. and Xerox, and 10 over-the-counter high-tech issues.
 
Looking at Fundamentals
''We didn't feel there was enough fundamental justification that these stocks could go up in a down market,'' said Richard C. Billy, a Prudential-Bache electronics analyst.
Forecasting lower sales of computer chips in the wake of a decline in personal computer volume, a Goldman, Sachs & Company electronics analyst, Rajiv Chaudri, cut his earnings estimate for Texas Instruments. He also cut his earnings estimates for Motorola and Intel.
Predicting ''a softer economic environment, Shearson, Lehman Brothers' electrical equipment analyst, Robert T. Cornell, cut his earnings estimates for General Electric, Emerson Electric, Maytag, Square D, Westinghouse and Whirlpool.
With the California real estate market slowing, Paine Webber's savings and loan analyst, Gary Gordon, trimmed his earnings estimates for three West Coast companies, Golden West Financial, H. F. Ahmanson and, for 1991, Great Western Financial.
 
Compaq Computer Loses 2 1/2
Of the Big Board stocks that Prudential-Bache no longer recommended, I.B.M. fell 1/8, to 102 3/8; Xerox 1/4, to 40 3/4; Compaq Computer 2 1/2, to 45 3/8; NCR 1 1/4, to 61 1/8, and Silicon Graphics 3/8, to 29 1/4. Digital Equipment rose 1, to 66 1/2, and Marshal Industries 3/8, to 22, while Control Data was unchanged at 14 and Policy Management Systems was unchanged at 37 5/8.
In Nasdaq stocks on the list, Advanced Logic fell 1/2, to 9; Autodesk 1/2, to 49 1/4; Molex 1/4, to 19, and Pioneer Standard Electronics 1/8, to 11 3/8. Intergraph rose 5/8, to 15 3/8; Maxim Integrated Products 3/8, to 9 5/8; Software Publishing 3/4, to 23 3/4; Sun Microsystems 1/8, to 29 1/8, while Terradata was unchanged at 21, and Linear Technology was unchanged at 11 3/4.
Texas Instruments fell 3/8, to 27 3/8, and Motorola 2, to 69 1/8. On Nasdaq, Intel fell 1, to 32 1/2, in heavy trading.
G.E. fell 1, to 60 1/4, also in heavy trading, and Emerson Electric 3/8, to 33 7/8. Square D, which touched a new low of 43 1/4, closed at 43 7/8, up 1/4; Westinghouse remained unchanged at 32 1/4, and Whirlpool rose 1, to 24 1/2.
Golden West rose 3/8, to 26 1/2; Ahmanson 1/8, to 16 7/8, and Great Western 3/8, to 14 3/8.
 
JAPANESE STOCKS FALL
TOKYO, Thursday, Sept. 6 (AP) -Japanese stock prices fell today while the dollar moved slightly higher against the yen.
The Nikkei average of 225 stocks lost 266.43 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 23,811.91. The Nikkei had risen in early trading, but retreated by midday. It was down as much as 450 points during the afternoon.
The dollar finished the morning trading session at 142.40 yen, up 0.10 yen from Wednesday's close. The dollar had opened at 141.48 yen, its lowest level since Oct. 19, 1989, when it opened at 140.97 yen.
Currency dealers said the dollar rebounded following reports that an American citizen had been shot by an Iraqi soldier in Kuwait. In Washington, the State Department said it was trying to confirm the report.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in Heavy Selling On Talk of Fed Rate Move

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Heavy dollar selling began in Asia and carried over into European and United States dealing later.
The sales were prompted by speculation that the Federal Reserve might soon seek to foster an economic rebound in the United States by pushing interest rates down. Falling American rates would reduce returns on dollar holdings and thus lessen investment interest in dollars. 
Currency dealers said the dollar was also hampered by speculation that West Germany and Japan might soon raise their interest rates. Higher rates in those countries, especially if United States interest rates fall, would tend to spur demand for German marks and the yen.
''I think, on the whole, it was a lot of speculation about the Fed easing,'' David Marshall, an analyst with MMS International, said of the dollar's selloff. ''There was speculation about U.S. rates moving down and other rates moving up.''
Financial markets are awaiting the Government's monthly unemployment report, due tomorrow, for indications of the economy's condition last month. Some analysts expect only a small rise in non-farm employment and any such softening in the labor market would bolster the case for the central bank to loosen its monetary policy.
One of the most pronounced moves of the day was the dollar's drop against the yen. It was quoted at 141.65 yen late in New York trading, down from 143.40 on Tuesday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar fell to close at 142.30 Japanese yen, down from 144.05 yen on Tuesday, and in London it fell to 141.75 yen.
The dollar also weakened markedly against the British pound in New York and against the German mark. A pound fetched $1.9055 in late trading, compared with $1.8810 Tuesday. In London, the British pound rose to $1.8990, from $1.8750 late on Tuesday.
Against the German currency, the dollar fell more than two pfennigs, to 1.5580 marks, from 1.58115 in New York trading.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late on Tuesday, included: 1.2945 Swiss francs, down from 1.3135; 5.2180 French francs, down from 5.2965; 1,162.00 Italian lire, down from 1,179.00, and 1.15245 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16075.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, an ounce of gold for September delivery cost $2.40 more, or $386.10, than on Tuesday. The Republic National Bank in New York later quoted a bid of $387.20 for a ounce of gold, up $2.60 from the late bid on Tuesday.
Gold moved to a late bid of $387.75 an ounce in London, up from $382.50 late on Tuesday. In Zurich, it rose to close at $385.75, from $382.25 late on Tuesday. Earlier, in Hong Kong trading, gold fell $4.33 to close at $384.02.
In New York and London, silver prices rose. On the Comex, an ounce of silver for September delivery rose to $4.735, from $4.719 on Tuesday. Silver rose in London to a late bid of $4.78 an ounce, from $4.75 late on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
Tough New Campaign for U.S. Clothing

BYLINE: By Kim Foltz

 BODY:
This is the fourth year the New York-based council has formed a close association with the Miss America Pageant. In exchange for the council's substantial sponsorship of the pageant, the reigning Miss America makes numerous appearances at stores nationwide to promote American-made clothing.
In the new advertising campaign, one spot, titled ''Excuses,'' shows workers saying goodbye and packing up on the closing day at a clothing factory. In the background are voices of shoppers making excuses about why they do not bother to check the label to see if the clothes they are buying were made in America. ''Look, I'm on my lunch hour,'' one exasperated woman says. ''Next time I'll check where it's made.'' 
As the factory gates are being padlocked, the announcer tells viewers that because of foreign competition nearly half a million apparel and textile workers have lost their jobs. ''Buy American and Americans work,'' he says.
In a second guilt-edged commercial, a mother is shown explaining to her son that they have to move because his father lost his job. ''Why?'' the child asks. ''Because a lot of people are buying clothes made in other countries,'' she replies as the announcer recites the job-loss toll.
''Most people only think that Americans are losing jobs because of imported cars,'' said Robert E. Swift, the executive director of the council. ''We want to warn them that by buying imported clothing, they are sacrificing their standard of living and their neighbors' jobs.''
Mr. Swift also said the time was right to make this type of appeal because the public was increasingly concerned about the growing trade deficit and the weakening economy.
The council, which was formed in 1984, is primarily made up of members from the textile, apparel and fashion industries. When the organization began publicizing the difficulties of the American apparel and textile industries in 1985, the commercials had a softer appeal. Using celebrities like Bob Hope, Ted Danson and Loretta Swit, the ads told consumers that American-made clothing was superior in quality to most imports and urged people to look for the ''Made in the U.S.A.'' labels. All garments are required to have a tag showing where they were made.
Mr. Swift said studies showed that since the council's campaign began, consumer attitudes about imported clothes have changed. Researchers have found that about half of the women shoppers say they check labels for a garment's country of origin. In addition, some polls have shown that a large majority of Americans now believe that American companies make better-quality clothing.
Even though the council says it has been successful in telling consumers about the benefits of American-made clothing, it is now taking a tougher line in its advertising because imports have continued to grow. In the early part of the last decade, imports accounted for about half of all clothing sold. Mr. Swift said that figure had risen to 60 percent last year.
During the last 10 years, 14 percent of the apparel manufacturing plants in the country have closed, and the council attributes most of the problem to the rise in imports.
And the situation has become worse. The council reports that during the last year 65,000 jobs in the textile and apparel industries were lost and 49 factories permanently shut their doors.
''We want people to realize that buying American-made clothing has an added benefit beyond quality,'' Ms. Small-Weil said. ''We want them to realize they can save someone's job.''

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
CRACKS APPEAR IN EMBARGO AS SEVERAL NATIONS DISCUSS RELIEF FOR IRAQ AND KUWAIT

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6

 BODY:

 
U.N. Committee Meets
The United Nations resolutions allow for the delivery of food and medicine to Iraq for humanitarian purposes. A United Nations committee met today to create a mechanism to judge when an emergency existed that would warrant such aid, but broke up with no decision.
The White House announced today that President Bush had accepted an offer to broadcast a televised message to the Iraqi people and said he would use the message to explain United States policy in the Persian Gulf.
In the Administration's first public enumeration on the size of American forces in the gulf region, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said that the total buildup of United States forces there -including sailors deployed at sea - had reached 100,000, but that it was ''too soon as yet'' to halt the flow of troops and weapons.
 
Operation Called Successful
Mr. Cheney told members of the Institute for International Strategic Studies, meeting at Hot Springs, Va., that the monthlong operation ''has been an enormously successful one.'' 
As he spoke, the State Department confirmed reports today that an American man in Kuwait City was shot and wounded on Wednesday while trying to escape Iraqi soldiers who had burst into his apartment.
A State Department spokesman said the man, who was not immediately identified, had been shot in the arm but not seriously hurt. He is hospitalized in Kuwait City. An Iraqi official in Baghdad called the shooting ''an unintentional incident,'' but a State Department spokesman, Mark Dillen, condemned the act as ''outrageous behavior'' and said the Iraqi Ambassador here had been summoned to explain the shooting.
The shooting came as Iraq seemed to be conducting a relatively aggressive roundup of Americans and other Westerners hiding in Kuwait City. An Iraqi official said Baghdad was reviving a law calling for prison terms up to life for any foreigner caught trying to leave without an exit permit.
A hopeful sign for the 2,200 Americans trapped in Kuwait came today when the State Department said that on Friday a chartered Iraqi airliner would take Americans in Kuwait to Amman, Jordan, after first stopping in Baghdad.
Mr. Dillen said charters would continue as long as there were Americans who wanted to leave Kuwait. An Iraqi airliner chartered by Canada left Baghdad for Ankara, Turkey, today with a group of Westerners, including 12 Americans, from Kuwait City. The Associated Press reported that the flight arrived in London late today for refueling and that all but 24 of the 158 passengers were to continue to Toronto.
The American-led multinational force in the gulf got a boost today when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain told an emergency session of Parliament that she plans to send reinforcements to the gulf. She gave no immediate details, but her aides said Britain had not ruled out deploying more ground troops.
On the apparent cracks in the blockade, the United States and most other Western nations have opposed any exceptions for now, contending there are no acute shortages of food and medical supplies in Iraq.
 
Hardship in Kuwait
The United States has not directly addressed the issue of shortages in Kuwait, where hardship conditions in the wake of the Iraqi invasion have contributed to the exodus of foreigners along the Iraqi-Jordanian border.
The suggestion that Iran might seek to drive a wedge in the sanctions came in The Teheran Times, which is close to the Iranian President, Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani.
''There is a humanitarian question that has to be pondered upon in Iran these days: Should the Islamic Republic help the Iraqi Moslem people in these hard times when they are facing an economic blockade?'' the newspaper said.
''Since according to U.N. resolutions food and medicine are not included in the sanctions, by choosing to help the Iraqi people Iran will not be breaking any international law,'' it added.
 
Iraqi Is in Beijing
In Beijing, Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister, Taha Yassin Ramadan, led a high-level delegation that is trying to persuade the Chinese to break ranks with the Western-led embargo. China hinted that it might answer the appeal.
The United Nations resolution ''clearly stipulates that the embargo against Iraq does not include supplies intended strictly for medical purposes and foodstuffs in humanitarian circumstances,'' a Chinese spokeswoman, Li Jinhua, said at a news conference.
China has supported Security Council resolutions on the gulf but has taken a softer line than the four other permanent members - the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union.
India and Yugoslavia have also indicated that they might seek to send food and medicine to its citizens trapped in Iraq and Kuwait.
 
Defining Humanitarian
In New York, the Sanctions Committee of the Security Council met today to consider what defined humanitarian assistance, and in effect to set a standard for individual nations to follow. Nations are not now obliged to seek exceptions from the committee.
When the committee meeting broke up tonight, a diplomat said ''they are in complete disarray'' on the issue.
Diplomats close to the meeting here today said the committee had come close to an agreement on how to aid Jordan, where the refugee problem has assumed huge proportions.
The committee, which includes all 15 members of the Security Council, will meet again on Monday.
 
Iraqi TV Offer to Bush
In a campaign stop in Topeka, Kan., today, Mr. Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, explained the circumstances surrounding the President's decision to go on Iraqi television.
''Iraq's Information Minister has offered to broadcast a message from President Bush to the people of Iraq on their state-run television,'' he said. ''Although we have not heard from Iraq directly, we accept their offer of a broadcast to the Iraqi people. The President will tape a message to the Iraqi people in the next few days which will be provided to the Iraqi information minister.''
Iraq offered to send a television crew to Washington to interview Mr. Bush. It was not clear whether the White House's offer to send a taped message would be acceptable to Baghdad.
 
Friend Tells of Shooting
The State Department's confirmation of the shooting of an unidentified American came from a friend of the wounded man, Mr. Dillen said. The friend was also seized by Iraqi soldiers but not harmed.
An American consular officer was allowed to talk with the friend, who told the diplomat that the wounded man he had been shot when he tried to escape through his apartment window from Iraqi soldiers.
The two Americans were taken to a hospital in Kuwait City. The unharmed man was then taken to the Mansour Melia Hotel in Baghdad, where the consular officer interviewed him.
A State Department official on the Kuwaiti task force said tonight that the American was shot while leaving his apartment through a window. The official declined further comment.
Leaving the State Department this afternoon, the Iraqi ambassador to the United States, Mohammed al-Mashat, was questioned about the incident.
''It was an unfortunate incident,'' he said. ''Nobody knew that he was an American. It was during the curfew time and when he violated the curfew soldiers are under orders to enforce it. So he got a slight injury to his arm.'' The Iraqi envoy called the incident ''an accident.'' The State Department official called this remark ''ludicrous.''
When asked if the man would be allowed to leave Kuwait, as other sick Americans have been permitted to do, the Iraqi envoy replied: ''The sick people have already left. We're studying his case carefully.''
Mr. Mashat said that American diplomats will have access to the man, whom State Department spokesmen would not identify.
Mr. Dillen denied that the injured man was violating curfew or had ignored commands by Iraqi soldiers to stop. He said the shooting was ''another indication of the lengths to which the Iraqis are willing to go to carry out their inhumane policy of using innocent foreigners as shields while denying them the right to leave.''

HEADLINE: 2 Koreas, Ending Initial Talks, Agree on a Session in the North

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Sept. 6

 BODY:
''We place tremendous importance on these meetings,'' Ahn Byung Soo, the North Korean spokesman, said at a news conference this evening. ''Although there are still differences of opinion, there are also commonalities. The fact that such broad matters have been discussed is meaningful.''
Both sides emphasized that they had rejected each other's main proposals, but without the usual tone of accusation that accompanies exchanges between them. They regarded it as a success that the highest contacts between the two countries since World War II occurred without a hitch, although there was an inability to agree on a joint statement. 
Pyongyang, for example, reiterated its appeal to South Korea to stop trying for a seat for itself in the United Nations, to suspend its joint military exercises with the United States, and to release from prison two priests and a young woman who made unauthorized visits to North Korea in the last year.
 
Meeting with President
Prime Minister Yon Hyong Muk of North Korea took that message directly to President Roh Tae Woo of South Korea, who received all the delegates at the presidential palace known as Blue House after the talks adjourned at lunchtime today.
Mr. Roh was said to have listened to Mr. Yon's plan without responding except to offer praise for the general atmosphere. The South Korean President also asked Mr. Yon to seek a meeting later with President Kim Il Sung, the 78-year-old leader of North Korea.
The South Korean delegate spokesman, Hong Sung Chul, said Seoul was willing to listen to North Korea's ideas about the United Nations, but that the military exercises were essential deterrents to an invasion. He said the jailing of the three visitors to Pyongyang was an internal security matter.
But Mr. Hong also said he thought the talks had been valuable.
''Of course, we reached no agreements that would stir up the nation,'' he said. ''But because the eyes of the people were on us, both sides approached the talks with a sincerity unlike anything seen in the past.''
A main element of the atmosphere was the spectacle of Koreans divided for 45 years getting to know each other, discovering their common language and learning that they shared some of the same hopes about the future and legacy from the past.
 
Dissident Students Arrested
North Korea is widely considered among the world's most isolated countries and repressive police states, and the Northerners were such subjects of curiosity that even the 50 journalists accompanying the delegation were followed by television cameras and photographers wherever they went. Television and newspaper coverage has been intense all week.
Aside from the talks, delegates adjourned a couple of times for meals together as well as an afternoon of dance and music performances, and a couple of movies by South Korean film makers. The journalists went on a field trip to one of Seoul's biggest afternoon daily newspapers, but they were rebuffed in their request to visit with South Korean dissidents.
Outside the hotel, dissident student groups and others sought to deliver messages of support to the North Korean delegates but they were blocked by the heavy security. A few were arrested and later released.
Two fundamentally different approaches that appeared difficult to reconcile emerged from the talks.
 
Phased-In Troop Withdrawal
North Korea put its priority on what it said was the independence of Korea, interpreted each time as a code word for immediate expulsion of 43,000 American troops, a banning of American nuclear weapons and other ties with Washington.
Those and other steps, with a phased-in withdrawal of troops by both sides, were deemed by Pyongyang to be prerequisites to improved ties.
But South Korea took the view that there must first be exchanges of families, performers, athletes and other visitors, as well as joint business ventures and economic ties, before the two countries can narrow the larger military and political issues dividing them.
North Korea rejected that idea, saying that Seoul seemed to want to drag out the process and lend permanence to the divided state on the peninsula, holding to its longtime view that South Korea is still a kind of American colony lacking real legitimacy.
 
Both Favor Reunification
Indeed, North Koreans refrained from referring to Prime Minister Kang Young Hoon of South Korea as Prime Minister, instead addressing him as ''Chief Delegate.'' Later, South Koreans took satisfaction that Mr. Yon referred to Mr. Roh as ''Mr. President,'' saying that that reference recognized that South Korea does indeed exist as a country.
Both sides said they favored eventual reconciliation and even reunification, but each stuck to its vision of doing so on its own terms.
The next meeting is scheduled for Oct. 16 in Pyongyang, and Seoul officials said they were hopeful that it would take place. But they seemed to be crossing their fingers.

HEADLINE: Dukakis Accuses No. 2 of Plotting a Coup

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Sept. 6

 BODY:
After learning of Ms. Murphy's plans, Mr. Dukakis twice this week postponed his departure on a 13-day trade mission to Europe, and aides described him earlier today as virtually a prisoner in his own state. But this evening, he suddenly left for Berlin, joining his wife and state officials who had left on Monday as scheduled.
He said at Logan Airport that he had not spoken with Ms. Murphy today but that he believed what he took as assurances from a press conference Ms. Murphy held this afternoon that she would act responsibly while he was away. But he added that he would cut short his trip if Ms. Murphy took drastic measures.
At the afternoon news conference, Ms. Murphy hinted that she would execute a plan once the Governor had departed. Her announcement tonight that she would disclose the plan's details on Friday, coupled with Mr. Dukakis's departure, left unclear exactly what was going to happen over the next few days in Massachusetts, where the feud between the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor has overtaken the Middle East crisis as the topic of conversation. 
 
'No Mutual Respect'
''Everybody knows we need to take some steps right now,'' said Ms. Murphy, who has a Ph.D. in economics. ''When I'm in charge, I'll show you how I'll make the decisions. I want to show people that there's a very serious difference between me and the Governor on the sense of urgency around this.''
After a phone conversation with Ms. Murphy on Wednesday, Mr. Dukakis said: ''What I heard was a candidate who was trying to use this state's fiscal situation for personal political gain. We're going to make sure that this campaign and this particular candidacy doesn't make some kind of charade out of what are some very serious problems.''
Ms. Murphy said after the phone conversation that Mr. Dukakis and his aides ''were asking me to promise not to do anything and that is irresponsible.''
''There is no good will here and certainly no mutual respect,'' she said.
 
Economic Problems Develop
Massachusetts' fiscal troubles began in 1988 while Mr. Dukakis was running for President. The problems stemmed from a downturn in the state's economy, not recognized at the time, causing revenue from sales and income taxes to fall. Over the last two years, with Governor Dukakis and the Legislature at an impasse, revenues continued to fall, causing a deficit of about $1 billion in the $13 billion budget. In July, after heated debate, the Legislature finally passed the biggest tax package in the state's history and slashed the budget by 4 percent, but even so, revenues have continued to fall below expectations.
On Tuesday, Mr. Dukakis, who by then had heard of Ms. Murphy's plan and of reports that it included a 4 percent cut in spending, issued his own orders to Cabinet officers to draw up plans for an additional 4 percent cut of their budgets, across the board, or about $150 million.
The spat between Governor Dukakis and Lieutenant Governor Murphy, both Democrats, has further tarnished the image of the state's Democratic leaders, who have been widely blamed for the falling revenues and rising taxes in Massachusetts, which has slipped into recession after a decade of spectacular economic growth during most of the 1980's.
The budget mess has also given the small Massachusetts Republican Party, with only 13.5 percent of the state's registered voters, its best chance of capturing the Governor's office for the first time since 1970.
A poll published in The Boston Globe earlier this week suggested that either of the two Republican candidates, Steven Pierce, the House minority leader, or William F. Weld, a former United States Attorney in Boston, would defeat any of the three Democratic candidates. The poll, of 436 likely voters in the November general election, stunned many political analysts here. It had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points.
In recent months, Ms. Murphy seemed to have been badly hurt by the public perception that she was close to Governor Dukakis, a now widely reviled figure here, and a poll published today in the Boston Herald said she was favored by only 15 percent of likely Democratic primary voters, down from 23 percent in May. The poll, of 400 people, had a margin of sampling error of five percentage points.
 
'Scorched Earth Policy'
One of the Governor's aides, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said an adviser to Ms. Murphy had counseled her to pursue a ''scorched earth policy'' and to make a very public break with the Dukakis Administration.
But if indeed Ms. Murphy was seeking to bolster her prospects for election, the initial public reaction seems to indicate that she has not succeeded. Paul Tsongas, a Democrat and former United States Senator, said, ''I don't think people buy this kind of thing.''
And in a serious defection, one of Ms. Murphy's main supporters, Philip Johnston, the secretary of human services, said today that he was switching his allegiance to another Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Francis X. Bellotti, a former state attorney general. Mr. Johnston was said by colleagues to be disappointed by Ms. Murphy's actions.
The third Democratic candidate, John R. Silber, president of Boston University, dismissed the incident as ''the kind of coup d'etat you find in musical comedy.''
 
Stealing the Spotlight
Ms. Murphy did succeed in focusing public attention on herself, taking momentum at least temporarily away from her opponents. But it will now be up to her, as acting Governor, to show that she really does have a plan that can resolve a deep-seated fiscal crisis that has defied other political leaders for months.
Ms. Murphy, a former secretary for environmental affairs and a longtime officeholder who was elected lieutenant governor four years ago, complained today that Mr. Dukakis had ignored her proposals for resolving the budget deficit and had excluded her from an emergency meeting of top state officials on Sunday to discuss how to deal with evidence the budget crisis was worsening.
In the Massachusetts system the governor and lieutenant governor run separately.
The latest crisis began on Monday when Mr. Dukakis, who is not running for re-election after 12 years as Governor, postponed his departure for a 13-day trip to Europe that had been designed to boost Massachusetts' exports to help the state's faltering economy.
It was originally announced that Mr. Dukakis had delayed his departure because of new figures that showed state tax revenues in August had fallen below estimates made a month earlier.
 
Word of Ms. Murphy's Plan
Adding to the atmosphere of intrigue, Steven Crawford, Mr. Dukakis's press secretary, said Ms. Murphy had canceled a meeting with the Governor on Friday and had failed to show up for a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday to discuss the budget, though she had repeatedly assured Mr. Dukakis and his assistants that she did not intend to take any actions while he was out of the country. Mr. Dukakis had only learned that Ms. Murphy had a ''plan'' from news reports Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Crawford said, but when the Governor phoned her, she refused to divulge her intentions.
It remains unclear precisely what Ms. Murphy's plan to resolve the budget mess involved. But some state officials said it included the step Mr. Dukakis took Tuesday, ordering the further 4 percent cuts to bring the budget in line with falling revenues.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 8, 1990, Saturday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about a dispute between Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and his Lieutenant Governor, Evelyn Murphy, described one aspect of the dispute incorrectly in some copies.
Ms. Murphy's plans on the state budget are reported to have included the possibility of dismissing the Secretary of Administration and Finance, not the Secretary of Human Services. The article also misstated Mr. Dukakis's tenure in some copies. He has been Governor for 12 years, not 16.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
On the Campaign Trail, Bush Invokes Gulf Crisis

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE, Fla., Sept. 6

 BODY:
''Every use of force unchecked is an invitation to further aggression,'' Mr. Bush said in Tallahassee, at a barbeque fund-raiser for Rep. Bill Grant, Republican of Florida. ''Every act of aggression unpunished strikes a blow against the rule of law - and strengthens the forces of chaos and lawlessness that, ultimately, threaten us all.''
 
Patriotic Tone Struck
Mr. Bush's appearances in Topeka and Tallahassee set a patriotic tone that Mr. Bush and Republican strategists apparently want to strike in discussing the Persian Gulf crisis in the fall election season. Republicans are hoping that the American military deployment in Saudi Arabia will bolster their efforts to project the party as the safeguard of a strong defense and a strong economy. 
Mindful of the need to maintain Democratic support for the gulf operation, Mr. Bush drew no overt link between the crisis and domestic political issues. But the two themes were intertwined through both speeches on the campaign swing, which Mr. Bush made aboard the new Air Force One, a specially equipped Boeing 747 making its maiden flight.
At a fund-raising luncheon for Governor Hayden, Mr. Bush combined discussion of the gulf crisis with talk of domestic political issues, jabbing at Congress for not coming to an agreement on the 1991 Federal budget as he sought to bolster public support in the American heartland for the deployment of American troops in Saudi Arabia.
He peppered his speech with references to farmhouse culture, ''traditional values'' and common sense. He summoned the memory of Eisenhower, the World War II supreme commander who lived in Abilene. And he reminded his audience of the fictional Kansas girl, Dorothy, of the book and movie ''The Wizard of Oz.''
 
'A Wonderful Movie Set'
''For more than half-a-century, generations have marveled at a wonderful movie set here in Kansas,'' he said. ''Ask anyone from Warsaw to Wichita: They know what Dorothy said, 'There's no place like home.' ''
''There is nothing I want more,'' he continued, ''than for our Ameican servicemen and women to come home. And they will once we've completed a mission that does right by American, and does right by the entire world.''
To personalize his message, Mr. Bush included in his speech a series of vignettes about Kansans who are serving in Saudi Arabia in the 190th Air Force Refueling Group.
And the President's appearance at the luncheon gave the candidate, Mr. Hayden, an opportunity to draw the patriotic message into his own remarks. Mr. Hayden said: ''The message to the President from the people of Kansas is clear: We support you Mr. President. We respect your decision in this time of crisis.''
Before leaving Washington today, Mr. Bush was telephoned by President Turgut Ozal of Turkey, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany and President Francois Mitterrand of France. He also telephoned President Hafez al-Assad of Syria ''to discuss the situation and get his perspective on events in the gulf,'' Mr. Fitzwater said.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
As Forces in Gulf Build, U.S. Weighs Its Options

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6

 BODY:

 
A Decision on the Sanctions
At some point, certainly before the end of the year, Mr. Bush will have to decide whether economic sanctions have been effective. If the answer is no, he will face a decision about whether to use military force and if so, when, where, how much and to what end.
At this point, much of the military advice the President is getting urges him to rely on air power and technological superiority and avoid a land war to the degree possible.
Most analysts do not expect Mr. Hussein to force Mr. Bush's hand by launching an offensive of his own before mid-October. If the Iraqis did strike, American forces would lack a land force with heavy equipment sufficient to throw back an all-out assault by the 265,000 Iraqi troops based in the southern half of Iraq and in Kuwait. 
By some estimates, the United States, the Saudis and the rest of the international force would be hard pressed to prevent damage to the Saudis' main oilfields. But they are confident that an Iraqi offensive could eventually be stalled and contained, while air assaults on stategic targets in Iraq would eventually batter Iraq's military capacity and morale.
 
The Potential Scenarios
After mid-October, according to high-ranking Defense Department and White House officials, who spoke on condition that they not be identified, the President's options for offensive action would range from attacks on dams and roads as a way to step up economic pressure, through an attempt to kill or kidnap Mr. Hussein, the Iraqi leader, to an extensive military campaign to push the Iraqis out of Kuwait - and perhaps to continue to move into Iraq itself, perhaps all the way to Baghdad.
Such a campaign might well involve a drive north by Army units on the left flank, marines on the right, and an amphibious assault, not unlike those at Anzio and Inchon, by other marine forces now held in floating reserve.
Fighting could begin in one of three basic ways. Iraq could attack Saudi Arabia, which American experts, both inside and outside the Government, now consider extremely unlikely. President Bush could decide that the sanctions would not suffice, in a reasonable length of time, and order an offensive. Or a war could grow out of a small incident, like an inadvertent clash between American and Iraqi warplanes or some grievous mistreatment of hostages.
The fabrication or exaggeration of a pretext for action by either side is not unthinkable, as the manipulation of the Gulf of Tonkin incident at a key moment in Vietnam shows.
 
A Technological Edge
If war began, American planners would seek to make the most of their technological capacity, which includes such elements as electronic deception to complicate Iraqi air defense, laser- and radar-guided missiles and, above all, an arsenal of weapons and devices that should enable American troops to fight effectively at night, something the Iraqis are not yet able to do.
The planners would also seek to exploit vastly superior American air power to minimize the huge Iraqi superiority in troop and tank strength. Even when the United States deployment as now envisaged is complete, Baghdad is expected to have at least a two-to-one advantage in men and tanks, officers said.
Even the battleship Wisconsin could come into play, launching its cruise missiles at important targets like command and control centers.
By using missiles fired from afar, the Pentagon strategists would hope to limit American casualties and avoid the kind of ''Arab-Israeli desert blood bath,'' as one general put it, that took place in 1973. More than 20,000 soldiers were killed or wounded in the two-week war that year.
''The numbers are scary, especially their infantry and artillery strength,'' said Bernard E. Trainor, a retired Marine general and former New York Times military correspondent who heads the national security program at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. ''But in the end, numbers don't count, if you have a concept that exploits your enemy's vulnerabilities. The Germans were outnumbered 10-to-1 in 1940, but they still overran France.''
 
The Need for Troop Strength
Col. Harry Summers, a retired Army officer who writes and lectures on tactics, is much less sanguine.
''You can certainly punish him with air power,'' Colonel Summers said of Mr. Hussein. ''You can destroy his air force. But that's not decisive if what you want to do is forcibly eject Saddam Hussein from Kuwait and make it hard for him to return. That takes troops on the ground, and I wouldn't want to try it with any less than 10 armored divisions, which you could only get by moving most of the Seventh Army down from Europe.''
A first step in any offensive operation would be the destruction of Iraqi fighters and bombers, either on the ground or in aerial combat, and the elimination of the 36 SCUD-B missile launchers.
Anthony Cordesman, the author of ''The Lessons of Modern War,'' a history of the Iran-Iraq conflict, said that ''we have the ability to win air superiority very quickly.''
The Iraqi Air Force's planes - a few top-notch Soviet-built MIG-29's but mostly older MIG-23's and French-built Mirages - are considered inferior to the best American hardware.
Available to American commanders would be Awacs radar planes to help fighter pilots spot enemy aircraft, EF-111 and EC-130 electronic jamming planes to confuse Iraqi electronic systems, and a huge arsenal of fighters, fighter-bombers, ground-attack planes and bombers - F-15's, F-16's, A-10's and Harriers in Saudi Arabia, F-111's and F-117's in Turkey, F-14's, F/A-18's and A-6's on board the carriers Independence, Saratoga and Eisenhower, and even B-52 bombers based on Diego Garcia island in the Indian Ocean.
For Iraqi forces in the desert, there would be no jungle to provide cover, which greatly reduced the value of American air superiority in Vietnam.
 
Talk of 'Surgical Strikes'
In theory, the economic pressure could be tightened through the limited use of air power. Mr. Hussein's fragile domestic economy, strained by the embargo on food shipments, could be further disrupted through attacks on bridges, highways or even the two big dams just west of Baghdad and other hydroelectric plants.
There is much talk in Washington of ''surgical strikes'' from the air, but the experience of the Vietnam War, when pilots found it tremendously difficult to hit even large targets like the Paul Doumer bridge in Hanoi, makes some observers skeptical. A former naval pilot who flew dozens of missions over Hanoi and Haiphong said recently, ''Surgical strikes exist only in think-tanks and mental institutions.''
In addition, the American military establishment, starting with Gen. Colin L. Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is firmly opposed to gradual escalation or limited offensives, having concluded that the Vietnam War was lost precisely because of a limited application of force.
''Once you get air superiority, they will want to flatten Baghdad,'' Representative Aspin commented.
Flattening Baghdad would inevitably entail thousands of civilian casualties - Muslims killed by Christians - and that might put intolerable pressure on the coalition of western and Arab countries lined up against Iraq.
''We ought to play to our strength, which is air power,'' said Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee. ''But if we use military force in a way that alienates a lot of our partners in this operation, we will lose the embargo, and we will have that erode very rapidly, in which case we will be counterproductive to our own aims.''
 
One Military Solution
Finally, an extensive campaign of air bombardment would threaten the Western hostages who have reportedly been dispersed to strategic targets around Iraq to act as ''human shields.''
Asked what he would do if told that a military solution was needed, a leading Congressional expert on Mideast warfare commented: ''Establish air superiority, launch air attacks on civil and military targets away from population centers, especially in the southern desert, then try to push into and through Kuwait, stopping on a line curving northwest from Basra, where the fertile land ends and the major highways leading south from Baghdad peter out.''
Such a plan, which was mentioned in interviews with several other experts, would be dependent for its long-term success on either inducing the downfall of a humiliated Saddam Hussein or a continued program of air interdiction to prevent the effective resupply of Iraqi troops and thus to make a major counterattack impossible.
''Even that,'' said the expert, who described himself as a hawk, ''would be quite a difficult proposition.''

HEADLINE: San Francisco Journal;
City That Loves Opera Faces a Night to Lament

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 6

 BODY:
No other American city dotes on its opera company as San Francisco does, and opening night is the pinnacle of the social season. Canceled along with Friday's performances of ''Suor Angelica'' and ''I Pagliacci'' are three first-night galas that raise money for the opera and the Museum of Modern Art, Saturday's new production of ''Wozzeck'' and Sunday's free concert in the park.
For those who attend opening night, a ritual worthy of Cecil B. DeMille, the evening is a breathless reunion with friends who have been scattered for the summer from Europe to Lake Tahoe. For those who gawk from the sidewalk, it is a stuffier version of the Academy Awards, with limousines pulling into the carriage entrance of the War Memorial Opera House, disgorging women in emeralds and furs and men in tails and stiff shirts. 
''It's an electric night and there aren't many of those anymore,'' said Peter J. Seely, the general manager of Trader Vic's.
The cancellation of opening night, and threats from opera management that the entire 23-week season could be a casuality of the orchestra's wage demands, has cast a pall on a city that has yet to fully recover its tourist business after last fall's earthquake.
Herb Caen, the columnist for The San Francisco Chronicle, who has attended 42 consecutive openings, noted this week that the opening had more to do with economics than culture. ''Not only does the recalcitrant orchestra have to eat, but so do hairdresses, jewelers, couturiers and plastic surgeons,'' he wrote. ''This is another blow to the city's already faltering economy.''
The 69-member orchestra and the opera's management have bumped heads before, most recently in 1987 when a contract settlement was announced 10 minutes before the dress rehearsal for the opening-night performance of ''Il Barbiere di Siviglia.'' That contract lifted orchestra members' annual salary, on average, from $30,000 to $40,000.
At the start of these negotiations the musicians were seeking parity with the local Symphony, where orchestra members average $57,000 for a longer season but fewer hours of work. Since then the union has scaled back its demands while continuing to reject a 4 percent salary increase.
In contrast to the 1987 dispute, orchestra rehearsals were canceled this year as soon as the old contract expired. Lotfi Mansouri, the opera's general director, said rehearsing without a no-strike pledge might force management to agree to excessive salary demands rather than risk a last-minute walkout.
Locked out of the Opera House, orchestra members have instead set up their music stands on the sidewalk. There, amid lunchtime strollers, the tuxedoed members of Musicians Local 6 play the overture from ''The Magic Flute'' and ''Entry of the Guests'' from ''Tannhauser.''
The music drifts through Mr. Mansuri's open windows. ''I'd rather hear it from the pit,'' he said through clenched teeth.
Despite the lockout, opera lovers -those with box seats and those with standing-room tickets - expected the curtain to go up on time until an announcement to the contrary Tuesday.
Within hours of the cancellation, the wooden floor for the party tent was disassembled behind the Opera House and Mr. Seely called his supplier to say he would not need 400 extra duck breasts. At the stage door, security guards swamped with inquiries posted a cardboard sign that said, ''Don't Ask - We Don't Know.''
And at Mrs. Swig's house, the telephone rang with word from Saks Fifth Avenue that her dress had arrived, a Bob Mackie gown with an iridescent skirt the color of autumn leaves and a bodice covered with forest green bugle beads.
''I guess we don't have to hurry about alterations,'' Mrs. Swig said.

A labor dispute over wage demands caused the cancellation of opening night, planned for tonight, for the first time in its 67-year history. (Terrence McCarthy for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: With Barry Trial Behind It, Capital Focuses on Primary

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6

 BODY:

 
Call for a New City Image
''We need to build a city that can be respected, that we can be proud of,'' Mr. Ray, a man with a boyish grin and a buttoned-down look, tells voters as he moves frenetically about town preaching economic moderation, improved education, strong family values, self-help and law and order.
Mr. Ray has put together an efficient organization and has raised $1.1 million, more than twice as much as any other candidate. He has significant support in almost all sections of the city and is poised to unleash a last-minute burst of television commercials.
Polls indicate not only that he is well out in front in the race but also that the undecided vote, at one point more than 30 percent of the voters, is rapidly shrinking. The polls also indicate that among the more cutting issues are leadership in a post-Barry era and a solution to the city's drug epidemic. 
Mr. Barry's name is rarely invoked by most of the candidates. But when they speak of ''leadership,'' the clear euphemistic message is that they consider Mr. Barry's 12-year tenure to be an administrative, economic, sociological and political failure, particularly the latter years.
 
Scattering of Barry Group
Mr. Barry, a Democrat, has yet to endorse anyone, a political move with the potential to cut both ways. His once-powerful grassroots organization has scattered but is expected to coalesce again to an extent after Tuesday because he plans to run for a City Council seat in November as an independent.
The mayoral candidates have plastered the city with colorful political posters. The airwaves are filled with candidate debates and candidate advertisements.
''Lines are beginning to harden,'' said Joslyn Williams, the leader of the city's Democratic Party. ''People weren't paying any attention while the trial was under way. But I sense they are focusing now and what they seem to be concluding is that John Ray is the sort of quiet, solid politician that can give them a breather from the Barry noise and confusion and embarassment. I'd say it's John's race to lose.''
A recent poll by The Washington Post indicated that Mr. Ray had the support of 33 percent of all registered Democrats, about twice the support of his nearest competitor, Charlene Drew Jarvis, also a member of the City Council since 1979. Trailing Ms. Jarvis, with about 10 percent of the vote each, were Walter E. Fauntroy, the city's nonvoting representative in Congress for the last 19 years; Sharon Pratt Dixon, a former power company executive, and David A. Clarke, a member of the City Council since 1975 and its chairman since 1983.
The Democratic primary can be won with a plurality of votes.
 
Single G.O.P. Candidate
The unopposed candidate in the Republican primary is former Police Chief Maurice T. Turner Jr. He is running on a law-and-order platform, a popular political position in view of the city's serious drug problems. Still, most political analysts say he has little change of beating a Democrat in November unless his opponent is Mr. Clarke.
Mr. Clarke is the only white candidate. The city is about 70 percent black and racial lines were hardened by the Barry trial, which Mr. Barry contended was an effort by white prosecutors to bring down a black leader.
While the latest polls indicate Mr. Ray is well out front in the race, they also show considerable movement by Ms. Jarvis from earlier polls, in which she ran last or next to last. Political analysts credit much of this movement to her repeated attacks on Mr. Ray for accepting large contributions from the city's powerful real estate developers and to her allegations that he favored lifting rent controls to help landlords.
Ms. Jarvis's campaign platform calls for more careful management of the city's budget and curtailment of some programs to head off a deficit. But she favors expansion of education, anti-drug and job programs.
 
'Closing the Gap on John Ray'
''I think I'm closing the gap on John Ray,'' she said today during a dedication ceremony at a newly renovated apartment building.
Ms. Dixon, perhaps the best stump speaker in the race, also feels she is closing the gap on Mr. Ray. She notes that she has moved up to third in the polls, after being on the bottom much of the campaign, and she boasts she received the endorsement of The Washington Post a few days ago.
''I've got momentum going,'' she told a gathering of elderly people at a luncheon today.
Like all of the candidates, Ms. Dixon calls for fiscal responsibility to head off an expected municipal deficit and, like all the candidates, she avoids talk of any tax increase. Otherwise, her platform is considerably unlike that of any other candidate.
She is the only candidate to have publicly called on Mr. Barry to resign. Further, she says if she becomes mayor, one of her first moves will be to cut 2,000 workers from the city payroll of almost 50,000, now one of the largest in the country and one that she maintains is almost twice that of Los Angeles.
''I'll use a shovel, not a broom, to clean house,'' she declares.
Mr. Fauntroy and Mr. Clarke appear to have lost momentum in the race. But because the contest can be won with a plurality, political analysts are not writing either of them off.
''So far, it looks like John Ray is the winner because he's coming off as the best antidote to Marion Barry,'' said Mark Plotkin, a former Democratic political worker here who is now a political analyst for WAMU-FM, a National Public Radio affiliate. ''But never forget that you don't have to close but so far to win by a plurality in a crowded field. It can still be done.''
Mr. Fauntroy has had difficulty putting together an effective campaign organization, in part because he had few serious challenges during his years on Capitol Hill. His campaign has mainly centered on a boast that his experience in Congress has given him the tools to run a city competently. He also has charged repeatedly that Mr. Ray is too closely allied to white developers.
Mr. Fauntroy's opponents contend that he has done little on the Hill to help the city. They say he has been especially ineffective in winning more Federal financing.
Mr. Clarke, unlike Mr. Fauntroy, has a strong campaign organization. He also has significant support in the black community, though he is white, because of his longtime support for housing, job and health programs. However, his black support is still limited and his unalloyed liberalism scares off some whites. As a result, he has had a difficult time maintaining campaign momentum.

Mr. Bush, who is scheduled to leave Washington late Friday for a summit meeting in Helsinki with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, will open the talks at the Air Force base on Friday morning, and may check in late Sunday or early Monday when he returns.
 
The Details Are Secret
Each side's negotiators have pledged secrecy on the details of their plans, partly so as not to give the other side a political advantage that could result from a specific proposal that might be deemed unpopular.
But officials familiar with deliberations that went on throughout the day said the energy issue was the one remaining matter on which Democrats were having difficulty agreeing. In a brief statement to reporters Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, said only that Democrats wanted to ''recommit'' themselves to ''energy security for the United States.'' 
He said other Democratic priorities included protecting social welfare programs for low-income families, insuring that any tax increase is ''progressive and fair,'' encouraging economic growth and jobs, and providing ''adequate'' funds for a strong and effective national defense.
Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate Republican leader, was a little more explicit about the approach his party might take on energy policy. ''Hoepfully, we'll be able to address in this budget summit meeting some incentives for production,'' he said. ''They've got to produce some oil, not just some tax breaks.''
 
A Question of Support
Despite what remain as major difficulties in reaching an agreement among themselves, negotiators from each party say their biggest concern is whether the final compromise on spending cuts and tax increases can be sold to the rank-and-file members of Congress, particulary House Republicans who are still angry at the President for abandoning his 1988 campaign pledge of no new taxes.
One indication of the political trouble that may lie ahead for Mr. Bush came today when Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip, put forth his own proposal for $134 billion in tax cuts over the next five years.
Mr. Gingrich, who is a member of the Republican negotiating team, said that with the possibility of a recession now at hand, tax cuts rather than tax increases were needed, to stimulate the economy.
The measures proposed by Mr. Gingrich include the capital gains tax cut long sought by the Bush Administration, as well as corporate tax breaks to encourage business investment, tax credits to low-income families with children and expansion of tax breaks for contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts.

Two Yans' Partners Want to Sell Their Interests

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY

 BODY:

 
Worth Has Soared
McCluskey said some analysts had estimated that the Yankees are now worth between $300 and $400 million. Although McCluskey would not discuss the asking price, it seemed apparent that he was seeking between $30 million and $40 million for the shares. By contrast, when Doubleday and Company Inc. sold the Mets to Nelson Doubleday and Fred Wilpon in November 1986, the price was about $100 million.
''They know they can realize a fairly attractive return on their investment,'' McCluskey said. ''Now is a good time to sell.'' 
During a recent trip to Japan, McCluskey said, he had discussed the available portion of the Yankees with foreign investors.
''There are options with overseas buyers and that includes Japanese buyers,'' McCluskey said. ''The Japanese are very fond of the sport of baseball. It's one of the largest pastimes in Japan. It's worth exploring and we will explore it.''
Although a sale of a minority share need not be approved by the other major league owners, a sale to foreign investors would likely draw their attention as some among them have expressed reservations about foreign ownerships of a major league team. Japanese interests do own minor league teams.
Satter, who is from Boston, and Leighton, from Cleveland, would not confirm that they had put their percentage of the team up for sale.
''I have no comment on that,'' Satter said in a telephone interview. ''I have no comment on what we're doing.''
''I can't comment on that,'' Leighton said in a telephone interview.
Ansbacher Inc. specializes in media mergers and acquisitions and its clients are usually newspapers, magazines and book publishers. McCluskey said that the investment bank had recently increased its work in the entertainment industry and that the Yankees qualified as entertainers.
McCluskey said his clients' portion of the Yankees had been on sale for a week and that there had been a handful of conversations.
''We've opened up a few discussions and they've been very encouraging,'' he said. ''There will be many more discussions.''
McCluskey predicted that the sale would probably happen in the next four months.
 
Angels 12, Yankees 6
The Yankees lost a lot last night in the first inning. They lost two runs, a player, a coach and their manager after a questionable call on an apparent home run.
It took a few hours and a gallant but futile comeback effort before they actually lost the game, 12-6, to the Angels in 11 innings at Yankee Stadium.
Dante Bichette smacked a double off Lee Guetterman to drive in Luis Polonia, a pinch-runner, with the winning run. The Angels added five more runs as 11 players batted in the inning. Polonia even came around to bat and had a run-scoring single.
The Yankees had charged back from a 5-0 deficit to take a 6-5 lead into the ninth, but Bichette hit a homer with one out off Eric Plunk to tie the score.
With the Yankees trailing by 4-0 in the first, Steve Sax singled and scored when Jim Leyritz lined a ball into the right-field seats. Both players were in the dugout and the runs were on the scoreboard when the umpires called the ball foul. A slow-motion television replay clearly showed that the ball was fair.
The Yankees bickered with the three-man umpiring crew and ejections soon followed. Coach Mike Ferraro was thrown out by the first-base umpire, Jim Evans. Drew Coble, the home-plate umpire, ejected Leyritz and Manager Stump Merrill was tossed by the third-base umpire, Tim Welke. Dale Ford was the only umpire who did not eject a Yankee and he was at home for personal reasons.
The Angels took the early lead by raking Chuck Cary for five runs in one and two-thirds innings, with Dave Winfield slamming a three-run triple.

GRAPHIC: Photo: Jim Leyritz of the Yankees, right, was called back after hitting what he thought was a home run in the first inning. But the home plate umpire, Drew Coble, changed his mind after a protest by the Angels. Leyritz argued the changed call and was thrown out of the game. (Barton Silverman/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Tell Iraq: We're United. Against You.

 BODY:
Nevertheless, some Soviet officials have sent mixed signals about the growing U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf. And if Presidents Bush and Gorbachev do nothing else in Helsinki, they need to dispel any notion in Baghdad of being able to play Moscow against Washington.
Moscow has supported U.N. resolutions condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, including the economic embargo, and stopped arms shipments to Baghdad. Mr. Gorbachev did what he could to underline these points to Iraq's visiting Foreign Minister. Nonetheless, in a situation as tricky as the gulf, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev will have disagreements. Far better to try to resolve them before they become dangerously divisive. 
The Soviet Foreign Ministry, for example, has been proposing to deal with the gulf crisis in the context of an international conference about all major Middle Eastern conflicts, including the Palestinian question and Lebanon. The Bush Administration was right to promptly throw cold water on the idea.
It would be absurdly wrong and diversionary thus to legitimize Baghdad's argument that its takeover of Kuwait is in any way comparable to Israel's occupation of the West Bank. That began only after Arab armies attacked Israel. As for Israeli-Palestinian talks, Mr. Bush rightly wants them to begin, but apart from the gulf crisis.
Soviet officials also maintain that all outside forces in the gulf should be brought under U.N. command, and that force should be used only with that body's approval. Such an arrangement might be plausible if there were a standing and trained U.N. military force; or if nations besides the U.S. were contributing fairly to the common military effort; or after Iraq withdraws from Kuwait.
For now, the U.S. supplies most of the troops and shoulders most of the risks. If Moscow and others want to say more about how force might be used, let them send more of their own forces. Meantime, Mr. Bush cannot and should not subject the safety of U.S. forces to the whims of kibitzers.
His agenda for the summit meeting is probably modest and practical. He will ask that Moscow withdraw its almost 200 military advisers from Iraq. Their presence, while not critical militarily, sends the wrong signal. He also has constructive things to say about ways to bolster Eastern European economies during the crisis.
And whatever else the two leaders accomplish Sunday, their meeting will be a success if one point hits Iraq like lightning: Get out of Kuwait.

Gouges and Giveaways

BYLINE: By LEON V. SIGAL

 BODY:
Even countries with long-established free markets experience occasional price-gouging. But in Eastern Europe, where markets are just beginning to flourish, the entrepreneurial impulse is to get rich quick, even at the expense of customer loyalty. That's sure to rouse resentment of privatization. 
Price-gouging is not the only unpleasant aspect of privatization, as is evident from the West German, Italian and American businessmen crowding the better hotels in Budapest and Prague to talk deals. For every representative of a major corporation considering a long-term investment in Hungary or Czechoslovakia, there are many sharp operators looking for a fast buck.
Even government officials who push for rapid privatization in order to break the apparatchiks' stranglehold acknowledge that many of the deals they want to make may go sour. But how else can anyone find out the right price for a state enterprise when there's no real capital market? What's the actual worth of businesses with outdated plant and equipment and a skilled but overstaffed work force?
''Our opponents accuse us of giving the country away -often to foreigners - and they're right,'' says a senior Czech official who wants to privatize fast. ''But these enterprises won't be very productive if they continue to be owned and run by the state. And entrepreneurs won't have the incentive to make a firm work unless they own it.''
''What's sad,'' he said, ''is that the people who will benefit most are the old apparatchiks. They're in a position to cut the deals and end up managing the same firms they once ran for the state - at vastly higher salaries. Meanwhile, former political prisoners who were kept from developing marketable skills will be worse off.''
He knows the political backlash may come before the economic results are in. ''Economically, we have to privatize. Politically, we may pay for that with our own careers. But there's no alternative.'' LEON V. SIGAL

HEADLINE: Cable TV Bills Open Door to Competition

 BODY:
Regardless of how a cable operator may retier or manipulate services, regulators are instructed to compare annual changes in cable rates for similar programming in both bills. Because rates for the most popular tiers of service have risen more than 40 percent (three times the rate of inflation) since deregulation, and because the bills would allow the public to challenge prices, the legislation should provide consumers with long overdue rate relief. 
H.R. 5267 and S. 1880 would also open the door to competition in the cable industry. Both bills would prohibit cable companies that have an ownership interest in cable programming from refusing to sell that programming under reasonable terms and conditions to potential competitors, like the satellite and wireless cable industries. With popular programming available to alternative transmission technologies, competition to cable has a much greater likelihood of developing.
The legislation does not address all consumer problems with cable rates, service or anticompetitive activities. With just one month left in the Congressional session, only ivory-tower free-market ideologues like Mr. Hazlett would expect Congress to correct all the policy imperfections involving the industry. From a practical perspective, cable legislation like S. 1880 and H.R. 5267, which would put a lid on cable rates and open the door to competition, and which is ready for floor consideration in both the Senate and the House, is not a bad starting point for the protection of consumer interests.

HEADLINE: Racketeering Suit Against Carpenters Chief

BYLINE: By CRAIG WOLFF

 BODY:
The suit ''represents an application of the civil RICO law in order to eradicate systematic, ongoing and poisonous corruption,'' said Roger S. Hayes, deputy United States Attorney of the Southern District of New York.
James Fox, chief of the New York office of the F.B.I., said, ''We think that finally with this case we'll be able to nail the carpenters union and return it to the rank and file.''
The union, the District Council of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, represents more than 30,000 carpenters and other tradesmen in 22 union locals - from furniture and drywall installers to woodworkers, dock builders and floor coverers - making it one of the largest and most influential in the construction industry. 
The suit named as defendants Paschal McGuinness, its president since 1984, its first and second vice presidents, Irving Zeidman and Frederick Devine, its secretary-treasurer, Francis J. P. McHale, and the former boss of the Genovese family, Anthony Salerno, who is currently serving a 170-year sentence for racketeering.
Repeated messages seeking comment from Mr. McGuinness and the other officers were not returned. Joe Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for the union, said that he had been unable to reach them as well.
The complaint lists several instances in which the prosecutors say Mr. McGuinness demanded bribes from different companies and permitted the employment of nonunion workers. But overall, the emphasis of the suit is less on detail and more on a sweeping view of an industry that the prosecutors said has been ''infiltrated and exploited'' by organized-crime figures for decades.
 
Pattern of Payoffs Seen
''There has been a single pervasive pattern of payoffs, right through the 22 local unions,'' Marla Alhadeff, an assistant United States Attorney, said. ''At the very least, the district council officers looked the other way, but we also believe they committed affirmative acts of racketeering.''
A civil suit, Ms. Alhadeff said, provides the Government with an opportunity to try to bar organized-crime figures from participating in the union, stop union officials from associating with reputed Mafia members and replace union leaders with court-appointed officers. For these reasons, she said, the Government is not seeking monetary damages.
The suit - the 14th time the Government has taken civil action under RICO - continues a new strategy on the part of prosecutors seeking to disrupt the Mafia's control over labor.
In the past, prosecutors concentrated their efforts on the Mafia's traditional crimes: drug trafficking, illegal gambling and loan sharking. Investigations have recently focused on economic crimes, particularly in the construction industry, and on the inflation of prices through rigged bidding and kickbacks.
In the suit filed yesterday, Mr. McGuinness was charged with accepting or demanding payoffs from 11 New York companies. The three other officers also were charged with accepting or demanding payoffs from 24 other companies, the prosecutors said. Officials in the United States Attorney's office said that the contractors were not charged because the main objective of the suit was to oust the union officials.

HEADLINE: Tough Market Will Put Nordstrom to the Test

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Nordstrom officials, in their typically low-key and matter-of-fact way, do not seem very concerned about the slugglish sales climate. Industry analysts say a big reason is that Nordstrom already has two successful stores in the Washington area, and it has conquered other tough territory, like Los Angeles, before.
In fact, in the last 15 years that the Seattle-based chain has been spreading from the Pacific Northwest, Nordstrom has quickly become a dominant player in each region it has entered. In the process, it has set back competitors with its keen emphasis on satisfying customers.
The retailer now has highly successful stores in Alaska and in Northern and Southern California, as well as in the Middle Atlantic States. Nordstrom, which plans a Chicago cluster in a few years, professes to have no interest in locating within New York City. 
The bright brick and granite, 245,000-square-foot store in the Garden State Plaza shopping center in Paramus will be Nordstrom's second-largest store, after one in downtown San Francisco. It will compete head to head with Macy's, its chief rival in several cities, and will co-anchor in the large shopping mall.
 
High Salaries for Salespeople
Nordstrom has prospered in part by paying salespeople salaries and commissions as high as $100,000 a year to motivate them. Even so, it has had some highly publicized disputes with employees who said they were not paid for performing extra work.
Besides its service, which other stores have begun to try to match, Nordstrom attracts shoppers with a rich mix of nationally branded and designer clothes. Much like Macy's, Nordstrom keeps expansive inventories that exceed expected sales in case business suddenly bulges. But a recent slowing in sales and heavy overstocks have hurt Nordstrom's earnings in the last two quarters.
In addition to the slow retail pace in the area, financial pressures have shuttered such old-line stores as B. Altman & Company, Bonwit Teller and even newer upstarts like Alcott & Andrews. And the future of chains with very high debts like Bloomingdale's and Macy's is hardly as bright as it once was.
''We would have liked to open here at a healthier time,'' said James F. Nordstrom, one of three co-chairmen. ''But we made a commitment two and a half years ago for this store, and naturally we had to follow through with it.
''We are encouraged by the income diversity of this market. It is one of the broadest we've ever seen.''
 
Sizing Up Competition
Although he considers R. H. Macy & Company as Nordstrom's chief rival, ''even though we are a little above them in price,'' and Saks Fifth Avenue an important competitor, ''even though they compete with us only on the high end,'' Mr. Nordstrom said, ''We feel that there will be a demand for what we are doing here as it has been everywhere we have gone.''
He added that Nordstrom's average sales were about $400 a square foot, ''but we hope to do more here.''
Other merchants and analysts say Nordstrom's success in shearing off some of Macy's loyal customers and in luring new ones depends on convincing affluent shoppers that the store's salespeople are attentive and accessible, that it has an unusually deep and varied assortment of goods, and that it offers a high value relative to the prices it charges.
As an upscale fashion specialty store, Nordstrom has concentrated on higher-priced goods, which inherently have a higher markup, and therefore profit. The company has also been able to increase its profit return on sales to 5.3 percent last year after taxes, from 4.8 percent the previous year, one of the best margins in its segment of the industry.
 
A Reflection of Success
In ways large and small, the newest store reflects much about how the retailer got to where it is and how it will try to duplicate that success in the New York area.
The Paramus store, which replaces a Hahne & Company branch, is basically a new structure, with three levels surrounding an atrium so that merchandise departments confront the shopper in a circular arrangement. Warm, paneled walls let the women's clothes, accessories and men's wear departments show off a variety of color, a traditional Nordstrom feature that appears to make stores inviting and attractive in an era of often pale, even bleak decor in many stores.
In a brief spot-check of merchandise during a tour of the store earlier this week, it was clear that Nordstrom aims to appeal to a broad range of customers. Its private-label men's suits include wool garments as low as $375 and Oxxford wool suits from $1,295 to $1,345. Its shirts include City of London, Ferrell Reed, all-cotton brands from $69 to $90. Allan Edmond men's shoes are priced at $205, and Bally brands cost $265.
 
Calvin Klein and Liz Claiborne
In women's wear, Martinez Valero shoes from Spain cost $99.95. Calvin Klein ''bodysuits'' are $65. And Liz Claiborne clothes for women are widely displayed in several of the company's collections, all relatively moderately priced.
In another small, but telling, detail, Nordstrom's appears to be one of the few places that charges only 25 cents for a cup of coffee in its three restaurants.
Asked why, Mr. Nordstrom, one of the retailer's three co-chairmen, replied: ''Frankly, I don't like restaurants that charge $1 for a cup of coffee when it only costs a few cents. We want to use our restaurants to attract and keep our customers in case they want to go out for something to eat. So we keep the restaurant prices moderate.''
The company, which was founded in 1901 in Seattle, also does some other things differently. Nordstrom as of today will be operating 61 stores in seven states, with sales of about $2.8 billion. But unlike most large chains, the company has buyers in each store to respond directly to reports from sales clerks and comments by customers.
Other large retail chains buy centrally, through a headquarters purchasing staff that receives data on customer preferences from local store and department managers.
Still, it is Nordstrom's much-lauded prowess in handling customers that has given it a cachet far beyond its existing markets.
The reputation was marred earlier this year by complaints by Nordstrom employees filed with the Washington State Labor Department accusing the retailer of failing to pay some employees for extra work. Among other things, the employees said, they had to deliver items to customers' homes and offices and had to spend extra time with customers outside their own departments.
In response, Nordstrom's set up a $15 million reserve in February to compensate employees and moved to improve its record-keeping procedures.
 
Flexibility and Paternalism
While Nordstrom uses many of the same sales training techniques that other stores do, its core approach is to motivate salespeople through high commissions and a paternalistic culture that engenders a general initiative to keep the customer happy at almost any cost.
Sales representatives are also given more authority and autonomy than in most stores, Mr. Nordstrom said. ''They decide such things as special orders, when the goods are delivered, obtaining extra garments if needed and handling problems. But, mainly, they are urged to be attentive.''
Nordstrom's management arrangement is also unusual. The three co-chairmen are James; his brother, John, and their cousin Bruce, all grandsons of John W. Nordstrom, who opened the first store with Carl F. Wallin, a shoemaker. The company has no chief executive.
''Since none of us will work for the other, we all work as a committee,'' James Nordstrom said jokingly.
 
Analysts Lower Estimates
On Tuesday, while preparations were being completed, with employees listening to instructions and electricians and carpenters putting on the finishing touches, Nordstrom held a lunch for analysts. It turned out to the company's disadvantage, as several of the Wall Street analysts cut their earnings estimates after what was termed a disappointing meeting.
William Smith of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company said Nordstrom executives reported that sales for July showed a slim gain, while those at the company's stores in California and Washington were soft.
He said that he expected the company's third-quarter earnings to be flat or slightly lower than the 27 cents a share of a year earlier and that 1990 earnings should be $1.50 a share, versus $1.51. ''I think that Nordstrom's enthusiasm may be tempered by the slow retail environment,'' he said.
But in an interview afterward, Mr. Nordstrom did not appear worried. ''We'll know in just a few days how well we'll do in Paramus,'' he said. ''It doesn't take long. We feel that our Eastern expansion is our key to future growth for us and our employees.''

HEADLINE: Crude Up By $1.66, To $31.43

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
''It takes less and less to move the market more and more,'' said Robin West, president of the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington-based consulting firm.
 
Uncertainty of Traders Cited
He attributed the market's jump to the uncertainty of buyers and sellers about how to interpret unfamiliar events. ''People don't understand what the implications of war are and they don't understand what the implications of peace are,'' he said. ''The easiest reaction is to panic.'' 
Robert P. Boslego, an oil analyst in Lexington, Mass., said, ''The market as a whole is very unclear as to what the equilibrium price really should be, and it is fishing, so to speak.''
Several analysts described a market that is setting itself up for the possibility of a fast slide. The inventory levels of producers and refiners indicate that users farther down the distribution chain, from industrial companies to distributors to retailers, have bought extra supplies in anticipation of shortages or price rises. If those companies judge that the crisis is waning and that they should use up those extra stockpiles, their purchases would drop and prices would fall, even if consumption did not change.
That was not the assessment of buyers yesterday, however, as the crude oil price approached its post-invasion high.
 
Bad News Emphasized
The bad news cited by traders included the report overnight that an American had been shot in the hand by Iraqi troops in Kuwait; Saddam Hussein's call on Wednesday for a holy war, the second by the Iraq President since the invasion, and Congressional testimony, also on Wednesday, by an Assistant Energy Secretary predicting shortages by the end of the year, an expectation that had been raised earlier by private analysts.
Based on that news, however, John H. Lichtblau of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York, said, ''I can't figure out why prices are near $32.''
''Volatility is part of the game,'' said Mr. Lichtblau of yesterday's 5.6 percent oil price rise. ''Everybody is sort of tense, in continuous fear that there will be a war starting at any moment,'' he added. ''But the traders don't know anything about the world situation that everybody else doesn't know.''
Pulled upward by crude, the price of gasoline rose to 95.07 cents a gallon, up 2.8 cents, for October delivery, and the price of heating oil was 88.24 cents a gallon, up 4.87 cents, also for October delivery.
Crude oil contracts for November and December delivery also rose beyond $31 a barrel.
''It's just the same old story,'' said one broker on the floor who asked not to be identified: ''more expectations of increased hostilities.''
 
Self-Reinforcing Expectations
At Ashland Oil Inc., a refining company, Cyrus Tahmassebi, the chief economist, said that price changes reflected daily mood changes in the market about the likelihood of war, but that some expectations were self-reinforcing. For example, he added, if the market believed that shortages were likely, ''then everyone wants to stock up with inventories, and that could cause even more tightness in the market.''
Mr. Tahmassebi said that the short-term price trend would be higher.
Mr. Lichtblau suggested, however, that ''if there is any kind of calming statement, I think you would see prices come down again.'' He said the loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude to world markets - a total of about 4.5 million barrels a day - pushed the price of a barrel of crude to about $27 in New York, and that the rest of the increase, more than $4, was because of the fear of war.
Others attributed even more of the elevated cost to the war fear. Vahan Zanoyan, of the Petroleum Finance Company, said he expected production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to be the same by the middle of this month as it was before Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 because of extra production by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and others.
 
Not a Permanent Dent
In that case, he added, the invasion did not represent a permanent dent in supplies, but a one-time loss that he put at about 100 million barrels. But when the crisis began, he pointed out, crude stocks around the world stood about 250 million barrels higher than at the same time the previous year, indicating the loss could be absorbed easily.
Mr. West predicted that even if war came, the results were likely to resemble those of the ''tanker war'' that began in 1982, when Iran and Iraq bombed each other's tankers and export facilities.
 
Hard to Ignite
The main Saudi terminal on the Persian Gulf, Ras Tanura, is probably out of reach of the Iraqis, he said, and crude oil, as was discovered in 1982, is harder to ignite than many people imagine. ''These facilities are harder to hit and easier to repair than people think,'' he added.
But Mr. Boslego said that if shortages developed, then oil was ''still undervalued, relative to the kind of price we would need to seriously affect demand.'' If a reduction in OPEC output has to be made up by consumers going without, he added, ''a pretty substantial increase in price will be required to balance the market.''

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Uncertain Fallout From Gulf Crisis

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d told Congress this week that the Administration expected to maintain a long-term military presence in the gulf. But nobody knows what that means in terms of forces or weapons or stockpiles, above and beyond planned military outlays for the next five years. With the budget deficit worsening, not only from the Middle East conflict but also from the savings and loan bailout, the pressure will still be on the Pentagon to hold down military expenditures by reducing outlays on weapons systems related to strategic deterrence of the Soviet Union, now that the cold war is officially over, and on expensive long-range projects like ''Star Wars.''
The July estimate by the Congressional Budget Office for the Federal deficit for the current fiscal year, which closes at the end of this month, was for a deficit of $165 billion. But that has now been swollen by $68 billion for the additional costs of the savings bailout, raising the estimate to $233 billion, compared with the Gramm-Rudman target for this year of $100 billion. With the sluggish economy cutting tax revenues, plus the extra costs of the gulf operation, the current year's deficit will go still higher, probably to about $250 billion. 
The next fiscal year's ''baseline'' deficit figure - not counting any steps Congress may take to cut the deficit - is also estimated to be about $250 billion, without allowing for a faster rate of military spending; that figure compares with the Gramm-Rudman target for the 1991 fiscal year of $64 billion, which is supposed to shrink to $28 billion in 1992 and zero in 1993. It seems as sure as death and taxes that Gramm-Rudman targets will be changed, but with the White House-Congressional budget negotiations still in the spotlight, nobody yet knows how. The anticipated cuts in military spending and rises in energy taxes have been hit hard by the gulf crisis and the climb in oil prices.
Added to the military costs are the new economic burdens, like the effect of higher oil prices on the United States and other industrial countries, on Eastern European countries struggling to move to market economies, and on Middle Eastern states opposed to Iraq's effort and suffering the costs of closing pipelines or losing trade. American officials are using a figure of $3 billion a year to cover such losses, although Turkey and Egypt alone are each asking for $2 billion more. In many countries, reaching from South Asia to Latin America, there may be additional losses resulting from greater unemployment and business failures.
A cardinal uncertainty is whether the Middle East crisis will have its primary effect in strengthening recessionary or inflationary forces - or both at the same time. A majority of economists now say the correct answer is ''both at the same time,'' replicating the stagflation of the 1970's that resulted from the oil shocks of 1973-74 and 1979. Some economists say a recession has already started, and a majority now expect one to begin in the fourth quarter or early in 1991.
But that forecast is still far from unanimous. A sizable minority of economists still say the United States will squeak through without anything that can be technically defined as a recession - two consecutive down quarters - although even the relative optimists expect growth to stay sluggish through 1991. Virtually everyone expects the gulf crisis, the climb in oil prices and the worsened budget deficit to put upward pressure on prices.
All of this has driven the dollar to its lowest level ever against the German mark, the Swiss franc and some other currencies. This will help to sustain American exports and the economy, but will add to inflationary pressures. The Federal Reserve, confronting the inflation-recession dilemma, seems to be holding in place, hesitant to ease further in the midst of the gulf crisis, at least until it sees the whites of a recession's eyes.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Help Soviets Lift Oil Output

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6

 BODY:

 
Moscow Seeking Credits
American officials said they expected economic assistance for Moscow to rank high on the Helsinki agenda. The Soviets are also seeking credits from the United States for the purchase of American grains, beef and poultry.
The Mosbacher mission will include food executives who are prepared to discuss with their Soviet counterparts ways of lifting food production and improving food distribution. Earlier this week an acute shortage of bread in Moscow was laid to breakdowns in the Soviet distribution system. 
American credit lines to finance food purchases could be opened by normalizing trade relations, which is linked to liberalizing emigration laws, a move expected later this month in the Soviet Parliament. President Bush has said he would then ask Congress to waive the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the 1974 trade law that bars normal tariff treatment to countries restricting emigration. Tariffs on Soviet imports now range up to 10 times as high as most other countries.
Although Congress will be in session only a few more weeks this year, Mr. Mosbacher said the new trading relationship ''could happen this year.''
The business group will see President Bush in Helsinki on Sunday and later, in Moscow, meet Mr. Gorbachev and other Soviet officials.
Among the executives accompanying Mr. Mosbacher will be Lodwrick M. Cook, chairman of ARCO; Kenneth T. Derr, chairman of the Chevron Corporation; Mark C. Hungerford, chairman of Texaco Inc.; H. Leighton Steward, chairman of the Louisiana Land and Exploration Company; John J. Murphy, chairman of Dresser Industries, Dwayne O. Andreas, chairman of the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, and Donald M. Kendall, chairman of Pepsico Inc.
The world's largest producer of oil, the Soviet Union would like to increase oil exports to take advantage of higher prices caused by the Middle East crisis, but because of mismanagement, outdated equipment, deteriorating pipelines and a shortage of capital, the country's output has actually been falling.
Production this year is projected at 500,000 barrels a day less than the 12.1 million of 1989. Soviet output last year was greater than that of Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Kuwait combined. Its reserves are estimated at 60 billion barrels, twice those of the United States, but about a tenth those of Saudi Arabia.
Last year's exports totaled 3.7 million barrels daily - greater than Iraq - with about half going to the West and the other half to Eastern Europe.
''You don't have to be a brilliant economist to see that they'd like to raise production,'' Mr. Mosbacher said.
Last year's exports yielded $20 billion, or 40 percent of the Soviet Union's hard-currency earnings.
 
Sending a Signal
Mr. Mosbacher said that the Bush Administration was ''sending as strong a signal as we can that we're stepping up to the plate'' to improve economic relations with Moscow.
Last month the Administration granted export licenses for six Control Data Cyber 960 mainframes to the Soviet Union, the most powerful computers ever exported to that country from the West.
Mr. Gorbachev, who is preparing a new economic program to free market forces and promote private ownership, also wants to integrate the Soviet Union into the global economic community by joining organizations like the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Washington's longstanding opposition to Soviet membership in these institutions has receded.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
New Leader at Witco Is First Non-Wishnick

BYLINE: By Daniel F. Cuff

 BODY:
In March, Mr. Toller, 60, was named vice chairman, and Denis Andreuzzi, 59, was picked as president and chief operating officer, putting them in competition to succeed Mr. Wishnick.
When Mr. Wishnick reached age 65 he was given board approval to serve in the top post for three more years while a successor was chosen. ''I can leave now, knowing that Witco will be shepherded by the right people,'' he said in a statement yesterday. 
Mr. Wishnick, who has spent a half-century with the company, plans to remain on Witco's board and the executive, compensation and management committees. He has been chairman since 1964 and chief executive since 1971. He and his family own 17 percent of Witco stock.
Mr. Andreuzzi will continue as president and chief operating officer and will take on the additional post of chairman of the board's executive committee.
Mr. Toller will be the first non-Wishnick to take the helm. ''I'm very humbled by that,'' he said. ''It's a tremendous opportunity but a substantial responsibility to carry on that tradition.''
Before joining Witco, Mr. Toller was president of the Continental Carbon Company, a maker of carbon black, a chemical used to reinforce rubber. Continental, a unit of Du Pont's Conoco petroleum operation, was bought by Witco in 1984. Mr. Toller became Witco's chief financial officer in 1986.
His entire career, before Witco, had been spent at Conoco. Upon graduating from the University of Arkansas with an economics degree, he joined the big petroleum company at its administrative headquarters in Ponca City, Okla. Conoco was acquired by Du Pont in 1981.
At Witco, Mr. Toller will be guiding the company as the Mideast crisis pushes up the cost of its petroleum. ''It's a case of cautiousness,'' he said, ''but I still see a bright future for the chemical industry.''
No big changes are expected. ''We've got a very fine company,'' he said. ''Management strength, I think, is exceptional. It's a little bit of a worn phrase, but if it isn't broke, don't try to fix it.''

HEADLINE: Flat Sales Last Month At Retailers

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Among the best performers was Wal-Mart, whose total sales for August jumped by 30 percent from the corresponding period a year ago. The sales at stores operating at least a year - called same or comparable stores - were up by 13 percent.
Comparable-store results are considered the best guide to a retailer's health. They exclude revenues that come from opening new outlets. 
Sears, Roebuck & Company, the Chicago-based retailer that led the industry in annual sales volume last year, experienced some improvement in August over recent months, though its sales were still uninspiring. Its total sales rose by 4.7 percent from August of last year, while its same-store sales were up by 4.1 percent.
 
Slight Growth at K Mart
At the K Mart Corporation, the nation's second-largest retailer, sales edged up by 1.6 percent on a comparable-store basis. The company's total sales, including from stores opened in the last year, grew by 11.1 percent.
But the J. C. Penney Company said its store and catalogue sales for the four weeks that ended on Sept. 1 slid by 1.2 percent, from a record amount in the corresponding 1989 period. Those at its comparable stores declined by 2.4 percent.
''I would say that the list of retailers reporting disappointing sales is growing,'' said Jeffrey Edelman, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. ''We are in a consumer slowdown. And before it's over, we're going to have more disappointments.''
 
Cautious Christmas Outlook
Mindful of the economy's weakness and the negative effect that the Middle East conflict has had on consumer confidence, the retailers are planning conservatively for the important Christmas season, when they typically look to make as much as 60 percent of their annual profits.
''This will be another difficult Christmas for most retailers, marking the first time in a while that we've had two poor Christmases back to back,'' said Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company.
The grim outlook for retailers, however, may be good for customers. Shoppers may find merchandise marked down earlier than normal, as retailers pour on the promotions to increase sales.
But because inventories are being kept lean, the retailers may not need to be as aggressive in moving merchandise as they were last year, when financial problems at some chains caused rampant price cutting.
Several retailers bucked the trend in August. Wal-Mart, a rapidly expanding discounter based in Bentonville, Ark., that is widely expected to challenge Sears and K Mart, posted a double-digit gain in its same-store sales.
Following is a list of sales reported by retailers for August and for their fiscal years to date:
 
Sears: Overall sales rose by 4.7 percent in four weeks that ended on Sept. 1, to $2.63 billion; seven-month sales rose by 2.8 percent, to $18.73 billion.
 
K Mart: Up 11.1 percent for the four weeks ended Aug. 29, to $2.33 billion; seven-month sales up 12.2 percent, to $17.16 billion.
 
Wal-Mart: Up 30 percent for August, to $2.74 billion; year-to-date sales up by 26 percent, to $17.05 billion.
 
J. C. Penney: Down by 1.2 percent for the four weeks ended Sept. 1, to $1.21 billion; seven-month sales up 3.4 percent, to $7.87 billion.
 
Dayton Hudson Corporation: Up 19.9 percent for the four weeks ended Sept. 1, to $1.19 billion; seven-month sales up 13.8 percent, to $7.34 billion.
 
May Department Stores Inc.: Up 12 percent for four weeks ended Sept. 1, to $762.4 million; seven-month sales up by 10.1 percent, to $5.14 billion.
 
Woolworth Corporation: Up 7.3 percent for four weeks ended Sept. 1, to $515 million; seven-month sales up 8.4 percent, to $3 billion.
 
Limited Inc.: Up 14 percent for four weeks ended Sept. 1, to $408.3 million; seven-month sales up 18 percent, to $2.67 billion, excluding results of Lerner Woman unit, which has been sold.
 
Melville Corporation: Up 8.4 percent for four weeks ended Sept. 1, to $674.2 million; eight-month sales up 10.8 percent, to $4.93 billion.
 
Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.: Up 1.1 percent for four weeks ended Sept. 1, to $199.7 million.
 
TJX Companies: Up 13.7 percent for four weeks ended Sept. 1, to $216.5 million; seven-month sales up 12.6 percent, to $1.32 billion.

New England Monthly Closes

 BODY:
New England Monthly, a six-year-old regional magazine that has won two National Magazine Awards, will cease publication with its September issue.
In announcing the demise of the magazine, John Van de Kamer, its president and chairman, cited the general decline in magazine advertising, which has been felt nationwide, and the weakness of the economy of the Northeast in particular.
''After a $5 million effort to make a profit, the most prudent thing to do is to shut the magazine down rather than continue to build up debt,'' Mr. Van de Kamer said. 
Mr. Van de Kamer said no buyer for the magazine could be found. The publication, which is owned by New England Magazine Holdings Inc., had an audited circulation of 120,000.
The magazine was noted for its good writing and attracted writers like John Updike, Tracy Kidder and Dan Okrent. For instance, an article in the August issue by a Portuguese emigre, titled ''Talking in the New Land,'' described growing up in Peabody, Mass. And the September cover article discusses one man's fight to preserve New England's rural landscape.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Mixed Despite Jump in Oil

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:

 
Two Views of the Report
Market participants said a rise of 50,000 or less in non-farm payroll employment, excluding census workers, would be considered positive for the credit markets and would reinforce the notion that the Federal Reserve Board will soon move to combat anemic economic conditions by easing credit.
Conversely, a rise of 100,000 or more in payroll employment, excluding census workers, would be a negative for the credit markets, traders said. While not an enormous increase, a rise in payroll employment of that magnitude would in all probability convince the Fed that the economy is not on the verge of a recession and that no change in monetary policy is warranted.
Even though attention has been focused on the employment report for much of this holiday-shortened week, the market's reaction will likely be muted if the numbers live up to expectations. 
''Everybody has already factored a relatively small increase in employment into prices,'' said Kristen Foster, a financial market economist at Citicorp Investment Bank.
As a result, ''yields won't fall much if the number is as anticipated,'' she said. ''But we could see quite a reversal in short-term note and bill rates if the numbers are much stronger than expected.''
 
Less Optimistic Outlook
Although Ms. Foster and other analysts said they were fairly certain the Fed would react to a weak employment report by easing its monetary policy, some market participants were not quite so sanguine.
''I don't think one payroll employment number is as significant as the Street is expecting it to be,'' said Edward J. Sawicz, president of the Discount Corporation of New York, primary dealers in Government securities. ''The figures would really have to be far below expectations for the Fed to move.''
By late yesterday, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 97 31/32, up 5/32, to yield 8.94 percent, down from 8.95 percent late Wednesday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 8 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 18/32, up 2/32, to yield 8.81 percent. And the 8 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 5/32, down 1/32, to yield 8.03 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates inched higher. In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.37 percent, up a basis point. Six-month bills were offered at 7.31 percent, up 2 basis points. And one-year bill rates also rose by 2 basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.21 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
 
California Tax-Exempt Bonds
Elsewhere, the California Housing Finance Agency offered $185 million worth of bonds in the tax-exempt municipal bond market.
The bulk of the issue consists of term bonds that mature Sept. 1, 2031. The securities carry a 7.85 percent coupon and were preliminarily priced at $100, or par.
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets acted as lead manager for the negotiated sale. The issue is rated AA by Moody's Investors Service and A-plus by Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal securities, dealers said that prices of most widely quoted issues rose by 1/8 point to 1/4 point in quiet trading.
Corporate bond traders said that activity was light and that prices of most issues were unchanged to up 1/8 point.
Prices of high-risk, high-yielding ''junk bonds'' ended slightly lower yesterday in very light trading. But the Resolution Trust Corporation, which is charged with disposing of the assets of failed savings institutions, sold a block of $25 million of junk bonds, traders said. Among the issues that were offered for sale were some of the highest rated issues like Duracell, First Brands, Playtex and Vons.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve reported that two of the three measures of the nation's money supply declined during the week ended Aug. 27. The third and largest measure, M-3, rose by $3.9 billion.
The money report had no effect on prices in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: Stocks Slide As Oil Rise Continues

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
At one point just after 2 P.M. the Dow had slumped as much as 43 points but recovered by the close to 2,596.29, down 31.93. Crude closed at $31.43, up $1.66.
 
Program Trading Data
Birinyi Associates, which monitors program trading, said that six selling programs toppled the market more than 42 points. No daily record is available of the biggest traders but the New York Stock Exchange often lists Kidder, Peabody; Morgan Stanley; Susquehanna; Bear, Stearns, and Paine Webber as the top five. The first three, the Big Board said, often act for themselves while the other two represent clients. 
Although trading volume actually picked up slightly, it remained an anemic 125.6 million shares, up from 120.6 million the day before. Traders tend to discount stock movements on slow days because so few people are in the market.
Stock market declines outnumbered advances 2 to 1, with 960 stocks down and 76 hitting new lows while only 511 were up and only 12 hit new highs.
 
Weakness in Blue Chips
The weakness extended not only to the Dow blue chips but also to the broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks and into the smaller stocks on the Nasdaq index.
The S.&P. 500 fell 3.93 points, to 320.46, matching the 1.2 percent decline on the Dow. The Nasdaq composite fell 3.66, or almost 1 percent, to 378.78. Falling far less, the American Stock Exchange's market value index dropped to 324.50, down 0.91, or three-tenths of 1 percent.
In a sign of further weakness in the smaller stocks, Mr. Grennan of Shearson said over-the-counter issues ''got hit from the opening bell,'' the first time that had happened after six stabilizing sessions.
''Basically the focus is on the Middle East,'' said Kenneth P. Ducey, senior vice president of S.G. Warburg & Company. ''The volume is lackluster and it looks like the economy isn't going anywhere.''
''People want to see how the Middle East finally settles up,'' he went on. ''Anything can happen and nobody wants to step up. The market could easily drop 100 points if something happens.''
Summing up Wall Street's pessimism over the deepening recession, Mr. Ducey added, ''And somebody pulled the plug on Motorola.''
Heading the most-active list on the New York Stock Exchange, Motorola, the big electronics producer, plunged 7 5/8, to 61 1/2, after falling 2 the day before. Rajiv Chaudri, electronics analyst for Goldman, Sachs, cut his earnings estimate on Motorola on Wednesday and other investment houses followed. Referring to the economic slump, Reuters quoted David Angel, research director of Dataquest, as saying, ''We've got to batten down for heavy weather.''
With other high-tech producers under intense review, Honeywell tumbled 3 1/2, to 94 3/8; Digital Equipment 1 3/4, to 64 3/8 and Texas Instruments 1 1/8, to 26 1/4. I.B.M. traded as low as 101 1/2 but closed at 102 3/8, unchanged. Shearson, Merrill Lynch, Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley recommended I.B.M. yesterday. First Boston eliminated its buy recommendation yesterday, a day after Prudential-Bache. Compaq Computer traded as high as 46 3/4 but ended at 45 1/2, near its low for the day, but up 1/8.

HEADLINE: Rush Is On to Secure East Europe Trademarks

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6

 BODY:
American Express's commercials are an example of how a number of American companies are using trademarks as a first approach to the commercial potential of Eastern European markets. Companies of all stripes are busily registering their copyrighted slogans, labels and logotypes and sometimes displaying them in countries where their products are not yet in demand, not affordable, not readily available or even known.
 
Magazine Names
Time Warner Inc. is registering its Sports Illustrated and Money magazines in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia as a prelude to publication there. The National Basketball Association is taking steps to protect the names of American basketball teams in Yugoslavia, where the sport is popular. 
Those American companies like McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Gillette and Levi Strauss & Company that have been in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe for some time had their trademarks registered long ago to protect them from piracy.
But the political changes of the last nine months have set off a wave of activity as lawyers hastily double-check their companies' trademark portfolios to make sure they are protected. Other companies have design consultants sift through the latest in Polish, Hungarian and East German slang to avoid the expensive gaffe of creating brand names with offensive - or just plain dumb - connotations.
One company, Anheuser-Busch, has been negotiating for the right to use the Budweiser name in several European countries. In most of the Continent, the name is owned by a small brewery in Czechoslovakia.
 
The Allure of the West
''The allure with trademarks for Eastern Europeans is that they connote the West,'' said Ted Murphy, a representative of the United States Trade Association, based in New York. ''The people there want to have these products, and they've been denied them for so long that there's probably a lot of pent-up demand.'' Before a televised performance of the National Symphony Orchestra of Washington last February in the Soviet Union, the program's sponsor, the Procter & Gamble Company, promoted its name with a long advertisement. ''It was a 12-minute video of who we are,'' said Terry Loftus, a Procter & Gamble spokesman. ''Soviet citizens had a chance to see what brands we offered.''
Such advertisements are calculated to promote good will for American brands in Eastern Europe, but the dissemination of trademark names and symbols may come back to haunt American companies. While the ads establish name recognition, they may also open the way to piracy where it has not been a problem before.
''There's a potential for real abuse,'' because of a lack of enforcement in some countries, said Don deKieffer, general counsel for the International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition, a Washington-based organization that monitors the counterfeiting of products and intellectual property.
 
Not Rich Enough Yet
''So far, Eastern Europeans haven't had the opportunity to counterfeit,'' he said. ''They haven't been rich enough. Only time will tell if legal systems in those countries are up to the challenge.''
Lack of enforcement makes some companies hesitant about risking the use of their trademarks in Eastern Europe, said Dick Rivers, a lawyer with Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld.
''You want to make sure someone's not going to set up a shop down the street with your trademark,'' Mr. Rivers said. ''You have to have some hope of going into a Hungarian court and getting a court order saying, 'No, you can't do that.' ''
Another problem is a lack of private trademark lawyers in those countries, said John Pachtner, a spokesman for Levi Strauss & Company. In Eastern Europe, companies usually have to work directly with the Government, a distinct change and disadvantage, he said, from the way things are done in the United States and Western Europe. The way companies register their trademarks in Eastern Europe is not much different than in industrialized nations in the West. The companies pay a fee of about $500 to register with the local equivalent of the United States Chamber of Commerce, which conducts a search to see whether the brand name or design is already in use. If not, the company then has the exclusive right of use, sometimes for 10 years, sometimes permanently, depending on the laws of the country.
 
Trademark Requirements
Some nations, like Czechoslovakia, require proof of use of the trademark in that country. In others, like Romania, it is merely enough to register.
West German and East German companies that were part of the same operation before the partition of Germany after World War II may have to fight over who gets to use the trademark after unification, but most American trademarks are registered in both countries and should be valid in the unified Germany, trademark lawyers say.
The esthetics of a trademark involve another kind of risk. In the last year, American designers have begun to create brand names and logotypes for companies planning to introduce their products in Prague, Budapest and East Berlin. Marketing strategists recognize the potential for offending or alienating possible customers with an inappropriate turn of phrase or image, said J. Roy Parcels, a New York-based designer.
Corporate marketing officials were hesitant to mention specific cases for fear of disclosing information to competitors. But an oft-cited generic example of the potential for mix-ups involves the word ''gift.'' In English, it has an unfailingly pleasant connotation. In German, it has taken on the meaning of poison.
 
Dangers in Translation
''It's a fear that every marketer has, that he will go into a market where his word has a bad connotation,'' said Mr. Parcels, who is designing Eastern European trademark packages for two companies that he refused to identify. ''The concern we would have in Eastern Europe is, what are the words which have come to mean different things in the last few months. You've got to consult someone who is current in the marketplace. That becomes critical.''
At a Commerce Department exposition in Washington this summer to promote the value of trademarks in opening foreign markets, trademark lawyers with the Government, more commonly seen wearing dark suits, dressed up like Tony the Tiger, M&M candies and the Kool-Aid pitcher. In attendance were a number of American executives and diplomatic officials from Eastern Europe, as well as tourists and children eager to meet brand-name characters they recognized from television.
''As foreign trade plays an increasingly important role in the health of our nation's economy, trademarks make it possible for the American producer with an excellent product and good marketing savvy to expand his or her markets worldwide,'' said David Bucher, director of the United States Trademark Examining Operation, the branch of the Commerce Department that licenses trademarks in this country.
Mr. Bucher then donned a Mr. Peanut costume and went off to shake hands with Boy Scouts and sign autographs.

HEADLINE: Slow Growth Projected in Corporate Spending

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6

 BODY:

 
Setting a Record
The projected investment would exceed last year's record spending of $501.6 billion. But the 5.1 percent increase would be less than half of the 10.4 percent spending gain in 1989 and the lowest percentage increase since a 3.1 percent advance in 1987. Capital spending rose 9.5 percent in 1988. 
The new estimate is down from the 5.5 percent spending increase that businesses said they planned in the previous survey completed in May.
''It confirms the economy is sluggish and expectations for the future are that it will continue to be sluggish,'' said Thomas Runiewicz, an economist with the WEFA Group in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa.
After-tax corporate profits, which rose 1.5 percent from January through March, fell two-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter and many analysts expect them to fall further in the last half of the year.
Businesses are often reluctant to make capital investments as their profit margins weaken.
 
Effect of Gulf Crisis
Mr. Runiewicz said that most of the survey was completed before the Persian Gulf crisis. He said higher prices and uncertainty created by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 could prompt additional cuts in investment spending.
But economists at Mitsubishi Bank in New York suggested in their current newsletter that the crisis would have little effect on 1990 investments, ''given that most of this spending is already set in motion.''
Mr. Runiewicz said that business investment contributed to economic growth in 1988 and 1989 and that the slower increase in capital spending this year would reduce growth.
Many analysts have been looking for continued business investment to help keep alive an economy that has been weakening for more than a year as the Federal Reserve kept a tight rein on credit to curb inflation.
 
Predictions of Recession
Even before the oil-price shock associated with the Persian Gulf crisis, some economists had said the economy was headed for a slight recession later this year.
Spending on replacements for aging plants and equipment and on expansions help increase the nation's productivity, an increasingly important factor in view of the stiff competition from overseas.
Before adjusting for inflation, the department projected a 5.4 percent spending increase this year, to $534.8 billion, after gains of 11.4 percent last year and 11 percent in 1988.
It said the investment increase for all industries includes a 4.7 percent gain for manufacturing companies and a 5.8 percent advance for mining, transportation and other nonmanufacturing businesses.
Manufacturers are projecting investment spending this year of $192.4 billion.
The gain includes a 2.6 percent increase by industries making durable goods - expensive items expected to last at least three years - and a 6.4 percent increase by those engaged in nondurables like food and clothing.

Dollar, After Broad Loss, Is at 11-Month Low vs. Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The market consensus appears to be that the report will show a gain of 50,000 to 65,000 non-farm jobs. But there is considerable debate whether a figure within that range would cause the Fed to take action.
The central bank is under considerable pressure to ease rates to avert a recession. But lower interest rates could add to inflationary pressures at a time when the price of oil continues to rise. 
Some speculate the Fed will decide against easing because of the sagging dollar.
''The dollar is too weak to ease now,'' said Earl Johnson, a vice president at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago.
Lower interest rates in the United States reduce the incentive for foreigners to invest in dollar-denominated securities.
Foreign capital is critical to financing the nation's budget deficit. The United States has attracted foreign capital in the past by offering higher yields on government securities than those available elsewhere in the industrialized world. The interest-rate advantage has been narrowed, however, as yields in Europe and Japan have risen recently.
Against the Japanese currency, the dollar fell one yen today in New York trading, closing at 140.65. Despite weeklong weakness in the Japanese stock market, the yen has continued to gain ground, at the expense of the dollar and a number of European currencies.
Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 141.65 yen, from 142.30 yen at Wednesday's close. Later in London, it fell further to 141.05 yen.
The pound was bolstered by anticipation that Britain will join the European exchange-rate mechanism at a meeting of European finance ministers in Rome this weekend. The mechanism establishes currency rates for a basket of European Community countries.
In London, the pound rose to $1.9075, from $1.8990 late Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.9125 to buy a pound, up from Wednesday's $1.9055.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Prices Up for 3d Day; Grain and Soybeans Climb

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold futures settled $3.20 to $3.60 higher on the Commodity Exchange in New York, with the contract for spot delivery up $3.60, to $389.70 an ounce. The heavily traded December contract settled at $396.20.
Silver futures settled 3.3 cents to 3.7 cents higher, with September at $4.77 an ounce. 
The spot gold price has climbed $7.40 an ounce this week after plunging $32.70 last week amid perceptions that the Persian Gulf confrontation was cooling off.
 
Inflation a Concern
Heightened tensions in the gulf this week have provided support for gold, but investors seem to be responding more to economic news, especially to signals of higher inflation, said Stephen W. Platt, an analyst who follows the precious metals and oil markets for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. Gold is often considered an investment hedge against inflation.
Mr. Platt said a remark on Wednesday by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, before the Senate Banking Committee had apparently caused some of the demand for gold. Mr. Greenspan said it could take several years to reduce the United States inflation rate.
Oil prices rose sharply for a fifth straight day on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Grain and soybean futures settled mostly higher on the Chicago Board of Trade amid expectations of more sales of American grain to the Soviet Union. The soybean market drew further support from reports that hot, dry weather had begun to put stress on soybean crops in Nebraska.
Wheat futures settled 1 3/4 cents to 2 3/4 cents higher, with September at $2.65 3/4 a bushel; corn was 1/4 cent lower to 1 3/4 cents higher, with September at $2.43 a bushel; oats were 1 1/2 cents to 2 1/2 cents higher, with September at $1.11 1/4 a bushel, and soybeans were 1/2 cent lower to 5 1/2 cents higher, with September at $6.17 1/4 a bushel.

HEADLINE: Job Growth Hits a Standstill, While Unemployment Rises

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 7

 BODY:
Moreover, observed the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, Janet L. Norwood, today's data showed ''the first signs of trouble'' in two labor market indicators watched closely by professionals to spot emerging trends. These showed jumps both in the number of workers who left jobs for any reason in the last five weeks and in those who were laid off or dismissed.
While most analysts continued to stop short of declaring the economy in recession, today's report made that prospect more likely and added pressure on the Federal Reserve to spur economic activity by cutting interest rates.
 
'A Very High Risk'
''I don't think this is telltale evidence that a recession is in progress,'' said Edward F. McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''But there's a very high risk of being in recession in the next six months to a year.'' 
In Ottawa, the Canadian Government announced that its unemployment rate soared to 8.3 percent last month from 7.8 percent in July.
Despite the increasingly somber economic data, much of it confirming anecdotal evidence of anemic growth or decline in real estate and other markets, it remained uncertain whether the Federal Reserve would move soon to try to spur growth. Some analysts thought the board might act within days to cut rates, but others predicted no change. They cited the doubling of the price of crude oil this summer, uncertainties related to the military buildup in the Persian Gulf and unresolved negotiations to reduce the Federal budget deficit.
 
Inflation Fears Blunted
One relatively bright spot in the report today was a moderation in wages that blunted some inflation fears. Average hourly and weekly earnings each rose a modest two-tenths of 1 percent in August, compared with jumps of six-tenths of 1 percent in July.
Employment figures became particularly grim this summer for teen-agers. Teen-agers in August accounted for 223,000 of the 295,000 decline in the number of people employed, according to a department survey of households, which is used to measure the unemployment rate. The household survey is released along with a monthly survey of company payrolls, which economists say gives a better picture of job growth.
With the population of 16- to 19-year-olds shrinking rapidly, analysts had assumed that teen-age joblessness would pose no particular problem, but instead the rate climbed from 14.1 percent in June to 16.3 percent in July, and further to 16.7 percent in August. That was nearly two percentage points above the level of August 1989.
Not only are jobs scarcer, but fewer teen-agers are looking for work, their participation rate in the labor force having dropped from 56.5 percent last year to 50.9 percent. For black teen-agers, this combination of fewer jobs and less interest in seeking them means that only 22.8 percent of them hold a job now, compared with 28.7 percent a year ago.
 
Rise in Black Joblessness
The household survey also showed that the overall black jobless rate climbed five-tenths of a point in August, to 11.8 percent, seven points more than the rate for whites, which climbed two-tenths of a point, to 4.6 percent.
Over all, the percentage of Americans holding jobs has slipped to 62.5 percent, a decline of half a percentage point in the past two months.
The number of workers in the private sector fell by 295,000. That decrease, paired with a modest reduction in the labor force last month, raised the number of jobless by 189,000, to a total of 7,003,000.
Of these, 3,325,000 have been jobless for less than five weeks, up from 3,120,000 such people in July. The number of job losers - those laid off or discharged - rose to 3,367,000 from 3,088,000. The number of people leaving jobs and people who joined or rejoined the labor force all declined.
 
Factory Jobs Plummet
The department's survey of company payrolls, meanwhile, showed that non-farm jobs climbed a skimpy 45,000 last month, including only 17,000 new service jobs. Counting the departure of 120,000 temporary census workers, though, jobs declined over all by 75,000. At the same time, the department put out an improved figure for July, revising the decline in jobs to 89,000, including layoffs of census workers, from the 219,000 earlier reported.
Another 45,000 factory jobs were lost last month, twice as many as in July, with the bulk of the losses in durable-goods industries, particularly electronic and transportation equipment. From a post-recession peak in January 1989, factory jobs have tumbled by 455,000.
Construction continued its recent downturn last month, losing 40,000 jobs to bring the total to almost 100,000 jobs lost in the past three months.
The length of the average private-sector work week was unchanged last month at 34.5 hours. But the index of aggregate weekly hours fell for the second month in a row to 124.6, with the department for the first time using the 1982 figure as its base of 100. Some regard this index as the best single indicator of the gross national product, The percentage of industries adding workers fell back to 46.9 percent in August from just over 50 percent in July.
 
Highest Rate in 2 Years
At 5.6 percent, the nation's jobless rate is the highest since it reached that level in August 1988. It has not been higher since the 5.7 percent posted in March 1988.
When domestically based military personnel are included, the jobless rate rose one-tenth of a point last month to 5.5 percent. Officials said the Middle East deployment and reserve call-up had no significant effect on the figures.
Among the 11 largest states, the biggest changes were a one-point rise, to 6.7 percent, in the jobless rate for Florida and a one-point decline, to 3.6 percent, in the rate for North Carolina. New York's rate eased to 5 percent from 5.3 percent while New Jersey's was unchanged at 4.8.
Because of relatively small samples, the department cautions against taking state figures seriously in the short run.
Regionally, the Northeast and the West showed improvement in August, their jobless rates moving down to 4.9 and 5 percent, while conditions worsened in the South and Midwest. These figures, unlike the others, are not adjusted for seasonal variation.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
DEPOSED KUWAITI OFFERS $5 BILLION FOR GULF EFFORT

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Sept. 7

 BODY:
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other wealthy Arab nations, by agreeing essentially to pay for the American forces in the gulf, clearly increased the staying power of the Bush Administration in the confrontation with Iraq.
 
Fear of Public Reaction Eases
Administration officials feared that the blockade might require six months or more to choke the Iraq economy enough to have serious effects, and that as costs mounted the American public, already worried about a recession, might turn against the whole operation.
Mr. Baker went today from Jidda, Saudi Arabia, to Taif, to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, and finally to Cairo. He told reporters with him that in addition to discussing financial arrangements he had a full discussion with the Arab leaders of these countries about the possible military options against Iraq, should diplomacy not bear fruit. 
Mr. Baker told Congress last week that the additional cost to the Pentagon of deploying American forces in the gulf would be roughly $6 billion by the end of the year, or about $1.5 billion a month, assuming no fighting breaks out. On Thursday, American officials said, the Saudis promised to contribute roughly $400 million to $500 million a month to cover all fuel, water, transportation and other costs for American troops stationed on Saudi soil.
Besides Kuwait's commitment today, Mr. Baker won a promise of financial aid for Washington from Sheik Zayed al-Nahyan, the leader of the United Arab Emirates, but he declined to specify the amount, saying it was still being formulated.
The Saudi, Kuwaiti and United Arab Emirate contributions should constitute well over $1 billion a month for the United States. That amount, when coupled with the money Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady has been raising on his tour of Europe, should not only cover the costs of America's involvement in the gulf, but may even produce a profit for the Treasury.
Although Kuwait's assets were officially frozen shortly after the invasion so they would not fall under Iraqi control, the United States and other Western nations have permitted dispersals of money to the Kuwaiti royal family under licenses granted by the applicable governments.
In addition to the $2.5 billion the Kuwaitis committed to the United States, the Emir, who still controls the estimated $100 billion Kuwaiti foreign investment fund, also promised to give another $2.5 billion to Egypt, Turkey and other poor Middle Eastern nations that have committed troops to a multinational force confronting President Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader.
Sheik Zayed of the United Arab Emirates also told Mr. Baker that his country would make a substantial commitment to these poorer nations, but no details were disclosed.
 
'Some Pretty Good Progress'
Asked if the United States was now in a position to cover all its costs from the gulf military intervention, Mr. Baker said: ''I will let you be the judge of how we are doing. We are making, it seems to me, some pretty good progress.''
''The Kuwaiti Government has committed economic assistance in the range of $5 billion between now and the end of the year to be used in part to defray some of the direct incremental costs for the presence of our forces and assistance to countries adversely affected, such as Egypt and Turkey,'' Mr. Baker said. ''The Kuwaiti attitude was very, very forthcoming. They were very appreciative of what the United States and countries aligned with them are doing to defeat Saddam Hussein and obtain the return of their country.''
He added that of the $5 billion ''at least half'' would go to the United States.
Mr. Baker said he had discussed military options with the Kuwaitis, Saudis and Sheik Zayed. It was difficult to tell whether this was in preparation for some action, or just a statement intended to unnerve President Hussein.
''During the course of our meetings we had discussions regarding all options,'' Mr. Baker said, ''and we made the point, as we have publicly, that we cannot and do not rule out any options. We hope that there is a peaceful settlement to this issue. We hope that the unanimous resolutions of the Security Council are carried out. But obviously, we discussed the full range of issues relating to this matter.''
 
New Experience for Emir
The Kuwaiti Emir sat next to Mr. Baker in an overstuffed chair as American reporters shouted questions at him at a photo session. Diplomats said it was the first time the Emir had had such an experience and the first time he had ever spoken with reporters.
He said he would not mind seeing the United States and its allies use military force to drive Iraq out of Kuwait.
Speaking through an interpreter in a barely audible voice, the Emir said, ''I, as a person whose country has been aggressed against, hope that the issues will be resolved as soon as possible -no matter by what means.''
Asked if he was worried that Kuwait could be destroyed, he said: ''In order to restore my country to what it was before, we will not spare any amount or value. We have to liberate Kuwait. Whatever it takes, we would like to have it done.''
 
U.N. Ultimatum Urged
Kuwait's former Housing Minister, Yahya al-Sumait, who is also in exile in Taif, suggested that the United Nations give Iraq an ultimatum setting a deadline for a withdrawal, which if not met, would trigger a military response.
Mr. Sumait said of President Hussein: ''Knowing the man and knowing his intentions, I don't think seriously that peaceful solutions will be the result. We don't have much time because Kuwaitis are living in a nightmare.''
When Mr. Sumait was asked if the ruling Sabah family in Kuwait would be prepared for an election as part of a diplomatic solution to the crisis, he dismissed the suggestion, saying: ''No one in Kuwait will want any other leadership than the Sabah family. I don't think that this is for discussion.''
Regarding reports that Iran intended to break the United Nations sanctions on Iraq, Mr. Baker said that one of the gulf leaders, who have close contacts with Iran, had told him that the Iranians told them that they intended to ''substantially observe'' the boycott.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
BUSH WANTS A RISE IN MOSCOW'S FORCE

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 7

 BODY:
Mr. Gorbachev has indicated that the Soviet Union, which has at least two warships in the Persian Gulf, would not send additional forces unless Washington is prepared to establish a United Nations command.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev are expected to discuss efforts to arrange elections in Afghanistan, as well as Soviet political and economic reform and the expansion of Soviet-American trade and economic ties. Administration officials said Soviet efforts in the gulf crisis had left Mr. Bush even more disposed than before to discuss an expansion of American technical help to Moscow. But they said he was not prepared to talk about direct economic aid. 
The two leaders will also seek to lend momentum to negotiations on treaties that would reduce strategic nuclear weapons and conventional armed forces in Europe, officials said.
A senior Administration official said today that Mr. Bush was not carrying new proposals on these issues. But the Administration has issued such disavowals before previous summit meetings at which the President has laid out substantial initiatives.
 
United Front Against Iraq
As Mr. Bush prepared to leave for Helsinki tonight, officials said the President was looking forward to the summit meeting primarily as a chance to demonstrate superpower unity against Iraq. After the summit meeting, the two leaders have scheduled a news conference at which they are expected to again denounce the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
Officials said Washington hoped the meeting could also produce a more formal joint communique. But in any case, the United States was calculating that a powerful signal would be sent by the sight of Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev standing together on the Middle East after decades in which the two countries' regional policies have often collided.
''We'd like to show there is no daylight at the top of the international alliance against Saddam,'' an official said. ''That way, the Iraqis can't play us off one against the other, which they are clearly trying to do.''
American officials expect Mr. Gorbachev to seek assurances from Mr. Bush that the United States will not act unilaterally in the gulf. The Helsinki meeting will also be a chance to demonstrate to the Soviet people that the United States firmly backs Mr. Gorbachev politically and economically, the officials said.
 
Testing New Relationship
In a broader sense, American officials said they saw the Helsinki meeting as a chance to test the new Soviet-American working relationship during a crisis period.
A senior Administration official said today that Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev would discuss the 190 Soviet military advisers in Iraq, whom Washington would like to see withdrawn.
The official said the United States would be ''very happy'' if Mr. Gorbachev agreed to send more military forces to the gulf, especially ground forces. He acknowledged that Washington had opposed Soviet military involvement in 1986 when a multinational force was created to protect oil shipping through the Persian Gulf.
But, he said, ''The Soviets, I think, have demonstrated by their support against Iraqi aggression that they do see the situation there in a similar way to us, and therefore I think a cooperative approach is warranted.'' Soviet Troops on Saudi Soil? American officials said the Saudis told Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d during his visit there on Thursday that they would be willing to accept Soviet troops on their territory. But it is not clear precisely how those troops might be dispatched, since the two countries do not have diplomatic relations.
The Soviet Union has been looking to the United Nations Security Council's Military Staff Committee as a vehicle for carrying out such operations, but that committee has been moribund for decades and the United States has shown little interest in reviving it.
Representative Les Aspin, Democrat of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said today that Mr. Bush should agree to work with Moscow to set up a United Nations military command to enforce the economic embargo against Iraq.
But Administration officials said they opposed such a plan, which the Soviet Union has also suggested, primarily because the United States has provided the bulk of the forces now in Saudi Arabia and does not want to give up control of them.
 
Certain Kinds of Soviet Aid
Mr. Bush is prepared to talk to Mr. Gorbachev about expanding American technical assistance in light of the cooperation Moscow has offered in the gulf crisis. But officials insisted that this would not be offered as a quid pro quo for greater Soviet involvement in the Mideast military operation.
And they said Mr. Bush would not offer direct economic aid to Moscow, but would instead talk about more programs like a forthcoming mission in which American officials and businessmen will try to help boost Soviet oil production.
Both sides are expecting the meeting to prod talks on a treaty reducing conventional armed forces in Europe and another accord reducing long-range nuclear arsenals. A senior Administration official said it would be difficult, but not impossible, to sign both treaties this year.
 
SHEVARDNADZE WOULD GO TO IRAQ MOSCOW, Sept. 7 (AP) - Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union sain today he is willing to go to Iraq to help settle the Persian Gulf crisis, Tass reported.
''If need arises, I am ready to travel to Iraq,'' Tass quoted Mr. Shevardnadze as saying in an interview with soviet journalists while flying home from an official visit to Japan. He also said he expected Presidents Bush and Gorbachev would discuss at the Helsinki summit meeting how to influence events in the gulf by working with other Arab countries.
Mr. Shevardnadze again proposed an international conference on the gulf that also would take up the Arab-Israeli conflict in Lebanon.

HEADLINE: Berlin Turning Into a Mecca for Jazz

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER

DATELINE: WEST BERLIN, Sept. 7

 BODY:
Quasimodo has long been one of Europe's best-known music clubs, and recent jazz programming has reinforced its reputation. During a 10-day span in July, headliners from the United States included Archie Shepp, Wayne Shorter, Pharoah Sanders, Les McCann, Mike Brecker, Sun Ra and Nat Adderley.
Jazz stars who visit West Berlin do not necessarily perform at Quasimodo. Sheila Jordan sang to packed houses at an intimate club called Lohmeyer's this year, and Gerry Mulligan played in a high school auditorium. Bands led by Art Blakey and Herbie Hancock have given well-attended outdoor concerts. 
''There isn't a true jazz scene in Berlin the way there is in New York, but what we have is definitely becoming bigger,'' said Giorgio Carioti, the owner and manager of Quasimodo.
 
Owner Was Bartender
Mr. Carioti was born in Italy and came to Berlin in the 1960's as a student. He found work at Quasimodo as a bartender and bought the place in 1975.
This summer, Mr. Carioti opened a cafe upstairs from his nightclub. Sitting at a corner table one recent afternoon, as the strains of Charlie Parker's saxophone wafted from the speaker, he mused about what the collapse of European Communism might mean for jazz.
''Until now, it hasn't really been possible for most musicians to think about touring Eastern Europe,'' he said. ''There were problems with money. There were visa problems. You couldn't reach people on the phone.
''Now there are all sorts of new possibilities. Now a band can think about touring East Germany, playing in Dresden, in Leipzig, in Rostock and then going on from there through Poland and Czechoslovakia, or even farther. Berlin is the logical center for tours like that.''
 
Reverse Chauvinism
Berliners throng to hear famous jazz players from the United States, but are not always kind to local musicians. Club managers have learned that the word ''jazz'' is hardly an automatic draw, and that the public does not readily accept the experimental and avant-garde music favored by some young players here.
Nonetheless, Berlin is one of the best places in Europe to hear live jazz. Berlin-based bands play a wide range of styles. Many perform be-bop and free jazz. Others range from an all-female saxophone quartet to a band that specializes in compositions by the clarinet stylist Sidney Bechet.
One of the clubs that regularly feature local jazz bands is Badenscher Hof, which is tucked behind a main street in a residential neighborhood. Considerably smaller than Quasimodo, it attracts a mixed crowd of enthusiastic fans. They sit below faded posters announcing Berlin concerts by John Coltrane and Duke Ellington and eat jambalaya prepared by a chef whose apron says ''Cooking With Jazz.''
 
Drawing on Eastern Europe
One recent weekend the featured band at Badenscher Hof was a well-regarded be-bop quartet called Der Harte Kern. The pianist, Niels Unbehagen, said before his first set that he thought Berlin's musical future was bright.
''The best German musicians are already here, and now people from all over Eastern Europe are turning up,'' Mr. Unbehagen said. ''The bass player I'm working with tonight is from the Soviet Union. These are very musical countries. You're going to see some very original music coming out of here.''
Jazz was frowned upon by most of the recently deposed Communist regimes in Eastern Europe, for its associations with both freedom and America, and the musicians and fans were sometimes harassed or even jailed. But in recent years, interest in jazz has grown as repression eased. Several jazz musicians from Eastern Europe have won international reputations.
Among them is Conrad Bauer, an East German trombonist. Mr. Bauer began his musical career in a rock band in the 1960's. When the police warned him that his lyrics were too provocative, he decided to turn to jazz. He was first allowed to tour abroad in 1977 and since then has performed in the United States and most European countries.
''Now that there's no wall, everything in East Germany is totally different,'' Mr. Bauer said in an interview. ''Under the dictatorship, all culture was subsidized and controlled. We had youth clubs in every city run by the party. Nobody knows what's going to replace that. In six months, some new structure will start to take shape.''
There are said to be 250 to 300 active jazz musicians in West Berlin, and Mr. Bauer estimated that there are perhaps 150 more in East Berlin.
''People in the East love jazz,'' he said. ''They want to hear more of it. If their economies improve, so will the music.''

HEADLINE: Black Baptists Urge U.S. to Use Diplomacy in Gulf

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 7

 BODY:

 
Lives, Not Oil
The tone of the resolution was in keeping with the cautious response of most major religious groups to the military deployment: balancing condemnation of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait with concerns that the United States act out of humanitarian motives rather than to protect oil interests.
The National Baptist Convention said Mr. Bush had been correct to send troops to the Middle East after the invasion so the United States could negotiate from a position of strength.
But by pursuing diplomatic efforts for a negotiated settlement, it went on, ''we will prevent the loss of countless lives and spending billions of dollars that should be utilized to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, heal the sick, train the unlearned, house the homeless and encourage the lonely,'' the convention said. 
The denomination also commended the Rev. Jesse Jackson for helping win the release of some Western hostages in Kuwait, and warned the United States not ''to appear to choose one nation over another as allies in the Persian Gulf, just out of economic and material interests.''
 
The Shadow of Racism
The Rev. T. J. Jemison, the denomination's president, said after the vote, ''I just can't see lives being taken, fighting over oil.''
On Thursday, before the convention took up the Persian Gulf issue, Mr. Jemison told the delegates that race relations were at a critical point in the nation's history.
The Baptist leader, who led one of the first successful boycotts of segregated busing - in Baton Rouge, La., in 1953 -said racism in America was worse now than during the civil rights struggles of the 1960's. President Ronald Reagan and his appointments to the Supreme Court are a large part of the problem, he said, adding that blacks will feel the impact of their decisions for decades.
''They call themselves strict constructionists, but I call them strict segregationists,'' he said of the Justices. As for Mr. Reagan, he went on, ''he will be remembered not because he didn't have a memory, but he will be remembered because he gave respectability to racism.''
