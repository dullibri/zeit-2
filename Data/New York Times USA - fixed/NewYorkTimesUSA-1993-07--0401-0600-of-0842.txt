HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The Everglades Pact Could Be a Model for Environmental Accord.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
"THE river of grass has been given a new lease on life," Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt exulted, announcing a pact on Tuesday in which Florida's sugar and vegetable farmers are joining with a host of government agencies to defend the Everglades from the ravages of civilization.
The pact may not, in fact, assure the survival of this uniquely fragile marsh, for no one knows for certain why it is deteriorating into a garden-variety swamp. But Mr. Babbitt should be excused a touch of hyperbole. For the deal does promise a relatively happy ending to a bitter war between farmers and environmentalists that might otherwise have been fought into the next century. 
 As important, it could set a precedent for resolving some heavy-duty environmental struggles to come. "The failure to deal with runoff from land is America's most glaring, unaddressed pollution problem," says Paul Portney, an economist at Resources for the Future in Washington.
Until the 1920's, much of the southern shank of Florida was a flat, pale-green wilderness that was underwater a part of each year. Roughly half of the great marsh has since been drained for farms and suburban home sites, with 1,400 miles of canals and hundreds of pumps to buffer the annual seasons of dry and flood. The rest is state and Federal park and conservation areas.
But all is not well in this remaining chunk of humid Eden. Water pumped into the Everglades contains a dose of chemical nutrients, a combination of farm runoff, treated urban waste and acidic rain that nurtures alien plants and is probably upsetting the ecology of the grasslands. Perhaps as threatening, the artificial plumbing has disrupted the slow, even seepage of water through the Everglades, a process called sheet flow.
In 1988, a coalition of local environmentalists persuaded the United States Attorney in Miami to sue the state to clean up its act. And in 1991, a sympathetic Democratic Governor, Lawton Chiles, consented to a plan to set aside some 35,000 acres for "stormwater treatment areas" -- filtration marshes filled with plants that would absorb the offending phosphorus nutrients. The $400 million or so needed to build the system, it was assumed, would be levied against the farmers.
That set the stage for what everyone expected to be the mother of all legal battles, with the farmers using their ingenuity and financial muscle to delay implementation. But U.S. Sugar, the largest of the landholders and a company that had gone a long way to atone for the sugar industry's legendary abuse of itinerant labor, preferred to deal. And the agreement the industry has just cut with the State of Florida and the Interior Department contains more than a little something for everyone.
The environmentalists get their filtration marshes, a cleanup method the farmers believe will cost far more than alternative technologies. But the growers will get credit against their part of the bill for removing up to 45 percent of the phosphorus on their own.
This will allow -- indeed, almost guarantee -- the creation of a system of tradable antipollution credits not very different than the one now being set in place nationally to remove sulfur from power plant smokestacks. The farmers will divide the responsibility for removing phosphorus, then pay the most efficient among them to refrain from polluting. Robert Hahn, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, thinks the farmers can remove phosphorus at less than half the cost of the marsh solution.
What J. Nelson Fairbanks, the president of U.S. Sugar, calls an "environmental peace plan" goes further than defining the farmers' responsibilities for runoff. It also includes a framework for dividing rights to Florida's water, and a technical plan for re-creating something akin to sheet flow for the grasslands south of the sugar cane fields.
There is plenty of offstage grumbling about the deal. Growers do not see why they should be obliged to discharge water that is purer than the water entering their fields. By the same token, environmentalists who have been waging guerrilla warfare against the farmers for a decade are smarting about two compromises. The pact puts a clear limit on the farmers' responsibility for the cost of the filtration marshes, and it decrees that a portion of the marshes will be built on public land.
For their part, many economists are dismayed the farmers will not be given the chance to show they could get the whole cleanup done more cheaply on their own.
But the agreement will prevent the lawyers from fiddling while the Everglades chokes on cattails. And it is a high-profile precedent for meeting a high-priority environmental challenge -- the protection of lakes and rivers from "non-point source" pollution.
For the easy part of cleaning the nation's water is almost done. Most of the gunk still entering public waterways comes from thousands of storm sewers, tens of thousands of farms and millions of lawns. One way or another, government is going to have to identify the sources and create incentives for cost-effective abatement.

HEADLINE: UNDOING OF BUDGET STARTS IN CAPITAL

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14

 BODY:
In a tradition old as Congress itself, small groups of senators and representatives on Thursday will start burrowing into the Capitol's many unmarked and well-appointed private offices, where they will set about undoing some of the very compromises that enabled them to pass President Clinton's economic plan only a few weeks ago.
This is the conference committee on the budget measure. Its task is to take the differing House and Senate versions of Mr. Clinton's proposal and puree them into a single bill that will pass both chambers. This happens almost every time the House and Senate pass legislation, but conference committees are normally such boring and anonymous affairs that their doings pass unheralded. 
 Not this time. The economic plan, with roughly $250 billion in new taxes and $250 billion in spending cuts spread over five years, is one of the most contentious and partisan tax bills in decades. Its support in Congress is tissue-thin. And the House version -- backed by liberals -- is different in small but crucial ways from the more conservative Senate version.
Moreover, the chief bargainers are two of the Capitol's smartest and most colorful Democrats: Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Chicagoan who heads the Ways and Means Committee, and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the Finance Committee chairman.
While the horse-trading between senators and representatives will go on mostly behind doors or by telephone, the conference will actually resemble one of those Hollywood weddings at which hordes of bouncers shoo away the public, but which wind up on the cover of People magazine anyway. Too much is at stake, both economically and politically, for the process to remain secret for long.
 
Big Stakes for Clinton
 "Usually you don't get to see a Presidency rise or fall on one piece of legislation," said one principal Congressional aide involved in the talks. "So there's more public and press interest in this." This is a common view in Congress.
Onlookers got an advance peek at the coming theatrics today, when House Republicans opened a skirmish designed to cast the Democrats as free spenders.
Among other things, the Republicans proposed to instruct the House members of the conference to accept the Senate's more modest plans for spending on food stamps, a tax credit for the working poor and tax incentives for inner-city businesses. The Senate would spend some $21 billion less than the House on those programs over the next five years.
Tonight the House voted largely along party lines, 238 to 184, to reject the Republican proposal. But it immediately voted again, 235 to 183, to adopt one small part of the proposal that urged the House conferees to adopt Senate language on the taxation of Social Security benefits. The Senate bill allows a tax increase on Social Security recipients to take effect at a higher income level than in the House version.
Democrats, meanwhile, began lining up internal support for the measure. Vice President Al Gore met at the Capitol with the 38-member Congressional Black Caucus, a group that adamantly supports the House version of the bill and whose backing is crucial to the passage of any compromise. Later, Mr. Gore called it "inconceivable" that a compromise would not be hammered out and passed by both chambers.
This morning, Democrats gathered privately to steel themselves for the conference. The House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, predicted afterward that the final bill would stick close to Mr. Clinton's goal of $500 billion in deficit reduction over five years, despite some sentiment to seek a lower total.
 
Contention Over Fairness
 "Why include massive new spending in a bill intended to reduce the deficit?" the House minority leader, Robert H. Michel of Illinois, said as cable-television cameras carried his remarks to viewers around the country.
Because it provides "fundamental fairness for some people in our society," retorted the Democratic chairman of the House Budget Committee, Martin Olav Sabo of Minnesota.
Mr. Sabo and Senator Jim Sasser of Tennessee, who heads the Senate Budget Committee, are the ringmasters of the conference process, jobs that entail some celebrity and somewhat less real power. They will convene the process Thursday morning with a meeting of all of the 160 or so conference members -- 58 senators and about 100 representatives, chosen largely by Congress's Democratic leaders -- and they will oversee the collating, vote-counting and word-processing that ends with a bill and a thick analysis of the economic package.
If all goes well, both chambers will pass the compromise version of the economic package in the first week of August, just before legislators take their annual monthlong recess.
Conferences usually involve a handful of lawmakers; this one is grand because most committee chairmen claim a stake in the shape of economic policy. So outsized is the bargaining that the conference will be divided into at least a dozen subcommittees.
But the size is deceptive. The vast bulk of the bill is non-controversial. At the heart of the package are but two issues: tax increases and reductions in the growth of social programs. And on those issues, the only people who matter are a handful of very powerful Democrats.

HEADLINE: MEXICO, IN SWITCH, DECIDES TO RETURN STRANDED CHINESE

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 14

 BODY:
In a sudden reversal, the Mexican Government apparently bowed to American pressure today and agreed to take responsibility for 659 Chinese refugees aboard three ships about 60 miles off the Mexican coast that were intercepted by the Coast Guard while headed for the United States.
Only hours after officials here had reiterated their stance that the smuggled Chinese were an American problem, a senior official announced that Mexico would allow the ships into port and then immediately return the immigrants to China. 
 The official, Andres Rozental, Under Secretary of Foreign Relations in Charge of North America, said in an interview tonight that Mexico was taking charge of the Chinese "purely on humanitarian grounds," because of the deteriorating shipboard conditions.
 
Pressure From Washington
 But privately, Mexican and American officials confirmed that the United States had pressed Mexico hard to help resolve the problem, which embarrassed the Clinton Administration only weeks after it announced a new policy to discourage illegal immigration.
Some American officials had voiced concern that Mexico's tough rejection of the United States request came at a particularly inopportune time.
Only four months from now, the United States Congress is to cast the decisive vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement that is intended to eventually unite the United States, Mexico and Canada in a single, tariff-free zone. Mexico's demonstrated willingness to cooperate with the United States on non-trade issues is certain to weigh heavily in the vote.
Mr. Rozental said that Alexander Watson, the United States Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American affairs, raised the issue of the immigrants in talks with senior Mexican diplomats in Mexico City on Monday. But Mr. Rozental said, "I don't think there was any major pressure or anything."
Still, the episode was the latest in a series that have seemed to define the relationship between the two countries on the basis of Mexico's overwhelming desire to see the trade agreement passed. The accord is expected to increase jobs and wages in Mexico only slowly, but it is expected to quicken the flow of much-needed foreign investment in Mexico right away.
Over the last year, Mexico has prominently reversed itself several times in disputes with the United States, and almost every time Mexican officials have acknowledged their fears for the trade agreement as a leading factor.
A United States official said that tonight, even while senior officials in the Mexican Foreign Secretariat were publicly insisting that Mexico was not negotiating over the fate of the Chinese, and would not, other officials under President Carlos Salinas de Gortari were continuing to hold out the possibility of Mexican help.
 
Decision Is Welcomed
 "Throughout this thing, there were some Mexican officials who were irritated and were unwilling to cooperate on this, and others who were willing to cooperate to work this situation out," the American official said.
In a public statement in Washington, Martin Judge, a State Department spokesman, said: "We welcome Mexico's humanitarian decision. Our discussions with Mexico continue, and we are willing to cooperate with the Mexican Government in this matter."
Mr. Judge said "consultations" on the immigation issue would continue Thursday in Mexico City.
Tonight in Washington, National Security Council and State Department officials were so sensitive about the appearance of having pressured Mexico that they would not discuss the nature of the talks that took place with Mexico this week.
On Monday, Mr. Watson met in Mexico City with Foreign Minister Fernando Solana Morales to discuss the request that Mexico accept the Chinese refugees, Mexican officials said. But the Foreign Minister expressed his displeasure at the request and its timing, four days after the request was first reported in American newspapers, and the talks faltered, Mexican officials said.
 
Treatment of Mexicans
 Mexican diplomats had shown their ire at the American request for help with the Chinese openly. They suggested it was almost hypocritical to seek Mexico's aid with the problem when, Mexico maintains, the United States habitually mistreats some of the estimated two million Mexican citizens who cross illegally into the United States each year.
For more than a year now, Mexico also has been pushing the United States to change its immigration policies to guarantee undocumented Mexican immigrants better treatment and to allow more Mexicans living on the Mexican side of the border and working in the United States to be allowed to cross legally. Mexican officials said they feared that the Clinton Administration's new harder-line policy on keeping illegal immigrants out could have negative consequences for those goals.
But Mr. Rozental insisted that Mexico did not change its position. In its written appeal to Mexico for help last Friday, Mr. Rozental said, the United States had asked that Mexico bring the three Chinese boats into Mexican ports, then process the smuggled aliens jointly with the United States and the United Nations High Commission on Refugees to determine the validity of any claims of political persecution. The United States said it would then assume the cost of sending the rest of the Chinese, most of whom are believed to have paid thousands of dollars to be passed like chattel across the Pacific.
 
Mexico's Own Plan
 Rather than accept those conditions, Mexico came up with its own plan, Mr. Rozental said.
He said the Mexican authorities would only tow the Chinese ships into port once they had made their way from their current position, about 70miles out to sea, to the 12-mile limit of Mexican territorial waters. Since one of the three ships is disabled and another is believed to be in precarious mechanical shape, Mexican officials said they expected the United States to take charge of assisting the boats to the 12-mile limit.
Mexican officials added that, as is their policy, they would not hear any claims of asylum from the immigrants. And though they have consistently accepted American compensation for processing third-country immigrants in the past, they said they would reject an offer of United States financing this time.
"These people were in really bad shape and in order not to prolong their suffering, we felt that we should get them back to China as soon as possible," Mr. Rozental said.
 
Persecuted or Not?
 A Mexican official added: "We know very well that none of these people who are coming here are being persecuted. The U.S. knows that, too. The only difference is that in the United States, the only thing you have to do is to step on American soil and cry asylum, and you get a hearing."
Mr. Rozental said Mexican diplomats had ascertained that more than 100 Chinese repatriated by Mexico in May had not been punished by the Communist Government. But American immigration officials said an additional 112 Chinese whom the United States repatriated around the same time were subsequently jailed and fined.
Mexico has long prided itself on a generous policy of providing asylum to peoples fleeing politically motivated repression.
But last year, as Mexico struggled to begin the repatriation of more than 40,000 Guatemalan refugees who have been camped on its southern border for a decade, it expelled 123,050 illegal immigrants, many of whom it said were trying to cross into the United States for economic reasons. They included people from India, Latin Americans and Asians, 427 of them Chinese.
Mexico was especially angered in May, when about 200 Chinese from a group seized in Baja California escaped from the Mexicali airport and fled toward the United States. Most were caught, but Mexico was livid when the American authorities refused to allow the Mexican plane deporting them to even refuel on Alaskan soil.

HEADLINE: Where Suburban Tribes Gather for Sand and Surf;
At Family Resorts on the Jersey Shore, Seasonal Time Creeps at a Biblical Pace

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OCEAN BEACH, N.J.

 BODY:
Like a Bedouin to his tribesmen, Richard Dupras called to the families gathered round him on the burning midday sands: "How many people did we have at dinner the other night?"
"Thirty-five," the satisfying answer came. 
 This is the annual gathering of the suburban tribes on the sands of the Jersey Shore, where time seems to pass at a biblical pace, the years counted according to the generations of new in-laws and babies sharing the beach, chairs, umbrellas, cottage. Throw a handful of sand on the beach here and in neighboring resorts like Lavallette and it is hard not to hit a three-generation encampment.
"We first came here 30 years ago, after our first six children," said Mr. Dupras of Somerville. "John, how long have you come here?" he asked a son-in-law, John Hughes, still dripping from a swim.
"Since I was a baby, in Manasquan," Mr. Hughes replied. "These are my roots." He stopped and smiled. "I used to swim in the water until, when I closed my eyes at night, all I saw were waves coming at me."
Time can seem to be suspended in the filmy sunlight that hangs over these beaches because so little has changed in all the decades since northern New Jersey's suburbs created summer outposts on this strip of oceanfront along Barnegat Bay.
Ocean Beach, the Levittown of shore resorts, has 3,000 modest cottages crammed from bay to dunes along two dozen lanes named for fish and fowl (as in Tuna Way). In the last 10 years, it has survived winter storms, recession, pollution and, a sign of how out of whack that decade was, 1980's real-estate speculators.
Now Tuna and the other ways look like they always have, a treeless camp of squat cottages next to a wide beach and the Atlantic. The beach is as wide as ever, despite the storms, and as full of children, and the water looks its cleanest in years. For beach people, who do not spend their days inside, the essentials are here for as little as $500 or $600 a week. Rentals are strong, sales are up.
"We came here when we were teen-agers, 17 years ago," said Andrea Coriddi of Whippany, who was sharing a beachfront cottage with her sister, Dana Carter of Ogdensburg, and their husbands, their four children and, for the day, their mother. "Now that we all have kids, we're coming here again."
"Ocean Beach hasn't changed at all," her sister said.
In many ways the developers of this long strip of sand re-created the suburbs from which their buyers came, complete with their preoccupation with status. To elegant Bay Head and nouveau Mantoloking, the motels and boardwalk of Seaside Heights seem honky-tonk and the tiny lots of Ocean Beach are rinky-dink.
Robert McDonough helped develop Ocean Beach and now rents and sells the properties. "When this started, back in 1946, you could come down and buy a place at the seashore and your investment would be about $3,000," he said.
"It was the first opportunity for the average person to buy a house at the Shore. This was unheard of before World War II. The only people who came down here before were the rich."
Pat Grappone of Rutherford, who bought a cottage three years ago, 20 years after her first vacation here, said, "The only thing that's different is that these cottages are $90,000 now. But if anything, it seems better now. Maybe because we own.
"You know what's nice here?" she said. "Around 6 o'clock, all the men down at the water fishing."
Whether in Ocean Beach or more preppy Lavallette, the beaches have a rhythm and form enforced by the tides, the sun and local ordinances. Surf-casters line the beach as the sun starts to drop behind them.
The beachgoers travel light, like frequent fliers, carrying only chairs, blankets and books, and as the sun peaks overhead the morning traffic flow reverses, toward home and lunch. It is fortunate that the farthest homes are only a few blocks toward the bay, because the absence of coolers is a matter of law as much as style: No picnicking is allowed.
"We bring friends down here, and they're amazed because you can't do anything on the beach," said Wanda Longo of Goldens Bridge, N.Y., recalling when the Ocean Beach Yacht Club's beach patrol confiscated even her plastic squirt bottle full of water. "But that's what keeps it nice."
Ocean Beach, as a private association, also keeps itself nice by restricting its beach to owners, renters and guests. It has a family beach because only its families are allowed.
In that sense, Ocean Beach is no less exclusive than neighboring Lavallette, a borough of second-home owners and renters, and few day-trippers, where the issue of diversity is framed mainly by the competition between the ice-cream trucks that park at the end of its avenues.
In Lavallette, even the trucks have restrictions. Only one can park on each avenue and they are forbidden to ring their bells. "They want to keep the beach natural, but the result is there are no services," said Robert Morra of Belmar, who has brought his Good Humor truck to Lavallette for 16 summers.
"People count on us," he said. "We're a service."

HEADLINE: Sales of Cars and Trucks Built in U.S. Rose 14.6% in Early July

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 14

 BODY:
Sales of domestically built cars and trucks rose 14.6 percent in early July, apparently unaffected by devastating floods in the Midwest.
"We had been expecting to see some effect, but it wasn't there," said Tom Webb, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association. 
 But an analyst suggested future auto sales might be depressed by the floods.
"You can move your car to higher ground, but you can't move your house to higher ground," said Joseph S. Phillippi, an auto industry analyst at Lehman Brothers. "The impact on purchasing or spending intentions will be more severe later."
Auto makers reported today that car sales had improved 6.6 percent and truck sales 27.1 percent for the July 1-10 period.
 
 
Brisk Sales of Light Trucks
 At the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company, car sales were off slightly, but brisk sales of light trucks -- the category that comprises pickups, mini-vans and sport-utility vehicles -- more than made up for the decline in car sales.
The Chrysler Corporation does not release 10-day sales figures. Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade journal, estimated that Chrysler would have strong double-digit gains in car and truck sales.
The strong sales resulted in an annualized selling rate of 6.9 million for cars and 4.9 million for trucks. That compared with a 6.4 million rate for cars and a 3.8 million rate for trucks for the corresponding period last year.
Over the last three 10-day periods, cars have been selling at an annualized rate of 7.1 million and trucks have been selling at an annualized rate of 5 million.
 
 
Decline at Saturn
 G.M. said its car sales were off 3.5 percent while its truck sales were up 15.9 percent, for a total vehicle gain of 3.2 percent. G.M.'s biggest division, Chevrolet, turned in another solid performance, with sales up 14.9 percent. Pontiac and Cadillac also had higher sales; Buick and Oldsmobile had lower sales. G.M.'s Saturn subsidiary reported a rare decline, down 14.7 percent from a year earlier.
Ford's car sales were down a scant six-tenths of a percent, while light truck sales surged 32.9 percent, for a total vehicle gain of 12.7 percent.
Five of seven Ford division car models had higher sales. But sales of the bread-and-butter Taurus midsize sedan -- the best-selling car in the United States -- were off 21 percent for the period. Six of seven truck lines were up. At the Lincoln-Mercury division, five of nine models were up.
Ward's Automotive Reports estimated that Chrysler's car sales were up 57.5 percent and its light truck sales were up 32.6 percent, giving it a total sales gain of 41 percent.

Assets Intangible? Congress Has an Idea for You.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
If ever an issue cried out for simplification, it is the amortizing of intangible assets, a topic so bizarrely arcane that many people are ignorant of it, experts get lost in it and judges regularly disagree on just how to do it. So this spring, Congress inserted into President Clinton's economic package a proposal to do just that.
Now it is about to reap the whirlwind. 
 As lawmakers start negotiating a final version of the economic package this week, obscure issues like intangibles are kicking up nearly as much dust as Mr. Clinton's ill-fated energy tax and other better-known issues have. Clued in by their accountants, people who never heard of amortization are suddenly up in arms, complaining that either the House's or the Senate's handiwork threatens to drive them to ruin.
"It comes to the point where you squeeze the turnip enough and, hell, you're just being mashed completely," said Brian P. Smith, an official with the Savings and Community Bankers Association, whose home loans the House is accused of mashing.
"People are watching it," said Martin Sharkey, an analyst for NatWest Securities in Washington who says the measure could spur corporate acquisitions. Big money is involved here, Mr. Sharkey notes: from 1980 to 1990, the total value of intangible assets leapt to $400 billion from $45 billion.
All this cries out for answers to questions like these: What are intangibles, anyway? How does one amortize them? And what was wrong with the old way of doing it?
Here is a primer:
When a company buys a machine, or a building, or a car, it can generally write off the expense against its taxes, deducting a little of the cost from its income every year until the machine or building is worn out. In the language of accountants, the entire expense is then depreciated, or amortized.
Intangibles (from the Latin tangere, meaning to touch) are another matter. Wholly ethereal, they cannot be felt or kicked, and they do not wear out in any physical sense. But they nevertheless have value: computer programs, franchise rights, customer lists, employment contracts, even a company's reputation for good service or sturdy products, are all assets that other companies will pay to acquire.
Pay handsomely, in fact. Intangibles comprise as much as 40 percent of the value of cable-television franchises, with their big customer lists and entrenched position as the only company of their kind in most towns. The value of a big consumer-products company, with popular brand names and a good reputation, could consist of 80 percent intangible assets. A small-town insurance agency is close to 100 percent intangible, with little more than its customers and reputation for service to pass on to a buyer.
With the stakes as high as they are, many of the interested parties are very upset. Insurance agents accuse the Senate of trying to pilfer their retirement nest eggs. Unions charge that the House has become a handmaiden of Wall Street takeover artists. Wall Street takeover artists grouse that the Senate is trying to take away what the House gave them. Bankers complain that the House is pushing up the cost of home loans.
There is an Amortization of Intangibles Task Force, and a Coalition for the Fair Treatment of Intangibles. People are worried, or mad, or both, and want to shape the bill as best they can.
 
'Good Will' Off Limits
 Naturally, buyers want to write off these intangibles, just as they do factories and cars, to reduce their taxes. But the Government often balks. Sometimes it simply forbids the write-off of some assets, like a company's "good will" -- the mysterious quality that keeps customers coming back.
In many other cases it picks legal fights over issues like what constitutes the useful life of a customer list or computer program. (Companies like short lives, because that allows them to deduct their expenses quickly, and save more on taxes in the short run. The Government prefers longer lives for just the opposite reasons.)
Companies, left gun shy by these disputes, have resorted to some odd business practices as they juggled asset ledgers to maximize tax deductions and fend off I.R.S. lawsuits. "The law got to the point where in the simplest business transactions, people have to hire an army of experts to defend their tax treatment to the I.R.S.," said Kenneth J. Kies, a Washington tax lawyer and lobbyist. "We're not talking about complicated transactions. I mean, uncomplicated ones -- the sale of an insurance agency, a heating-oil business."
Mr. Kies lobbies for insurance agents, so he has a bias. But even less partial experts, like Alan Doris, a Cleveland lawyer who heads the American Bar Association Subcommittee on the Amortization of Intangibles, also agree that the current law is a mess.
 
Simple, Clear Rule
 So does Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Chicago, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which took up Mr. Clinton's tax package in May. He made certain that the package that came out of his committee included a simple, clear rule: all purchases of intangible assets, including good will, would be deducted over 14 years.
Mr. Doris says that the rule would allow the Government to rake in about as much tax revenue as it now does, but with greater certainty and simplicity for taxpayers. "It does an injustice to some, and it helps others who bought intangible assets with more than a 14-year life," he said. "But in the long run, it make sense for everyone."
Well, almost everyone. Last month, when the economic package went to the Senate, the Finance Committee decided to tinker with Mr. Rostenkowski's handiwork. Rather than allow companies to deduct everything, the panel limited write-offs of intangibles to 75 percent of their value.
 
Senate's Motivation
 The reasoning was no secret: the Senate panel had cut Mr. Clinton's energy tax by $50 billion, and it needed to make up the money elsewhere. Limiting the write-off of intangibles contributed a few badly needed billions.
But it also fractured whatever support Mr. Rostenkowski's original 14-year proposal had.
The nation's 500,000 insurance agents, who have warred with the I.R.S. for decades over the intangible value of their businesses, had opted for the certainty of Mr. Rostenkowski's proposal, even though the 14-year period was twice what they sought.
But they are apoplectic over the Senate plan, which Mr. Kies said could drastically reduce the value of an agency's reputation and customer lists and shave as much as 25 percent off the typical $200,000 sale price of an agency.
"For our guys, their agency is typically their largest retirement asset," Mr. Kies said. "He's worked in the agency all his life, basically planning to sell it sooner or later and retire to Florida. For them, this is like a life-or-death issue."
 
Banks' Big Business
 Bankers, on the other hand, feared that the Rostenkowski plan would cut deeply into one of their least-known and most lucrative businesses: collecting and processing homeowners' monthly mortgage checks.
Although most homeowners neither know nor care, their mortgages are frequently bundled together into huge bonds and sold to investors. The investors pay the banks for the service of collecting monthly checks and sending them to the mortgage's ultimate holder -- a cost that is built into the loan fee or the interest rate.
These mortgage-servicing rights are regularly bought and sold among banks, and buyers usually write off the purchases over seven years. Bankers complain that doubling that write-off period to 14 years would lower the value of the servicing rights by as much as $100 a year -- a loss they say would be passed on to borrowers.
The mortgage-banking and savings-industry lobbyists persuaded the Senate to include a clause that would reduce the write-off period to nine years for servicing rights alone, a perquisite the bankers are now fighting to protect in the final bill.
Wall Street lobbied hard for Mr. Rostenkowski's proposal, because it would make big corporate takeovers and spinoffs of subsidiaries at least slightly more attractive. That is especially true for big consumer-products companies, where corporate good will is a huge asset that until now has been worthless as a tax write-off.
But the Senate provision reducing the total write-off to 75 percent takes some luster off the notion of amortizing intangibles, and Wall Street will battle for the House version.
The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, on the other hand, argues that the big buyouts fostered by the House proposal would be ruinous to its members, mostly store clerks and other retail workers. Thousands of such workers were laid off during the leveraged-buyout boom of the 1980's, when corporate owners shut stores or fled to bankruptcy when they could not repay the money they borrowed to buy retail chains.
"Look at the leveraged buyout of Safeway," the big food chain, said Greg Caneer, a union spokesman in Washington. The buyer closed or sold its less profitable outlets, leading to layoffs, and "the spinoffs are still struggling in the marketplace," Mr. Caneer said.
This is not to say that some people are not content with either versions of the legislation. Some are.
Big-time professional sports teams are unconcerned, even though a 14-year write-off period would prove onerous in an industry where player contracts are worth millions, and the players can depreciate in one season.
Nor are Silicon Valley and its corporate customers much bothered, even though 14 years is a long time to write off the millions of dollars spent on software that is often obsolete in a couple of years.
Hollywood is also happy, even though 14 years is an eternity when millions are spent on film rights and stars for films like "Bonfire of the Vanities" whose useful lives are measured in weekends.
Of course, all three of those industries are exempted from the proposed new amortization rules in both bills.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 27.11 as Inflation Fear Subsides

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

 BODY:
News yesterday that consumer prices remained level in June prompted investors to set aside nagging fears that inflation and rising interest rates would squash the delicate recovery.
Oil and gold prices fell, yields on 30-year bonds sank to a 16-year low and money started pouring into the stock market, driving up most leading market indicators. 
 Small stocks made big gains, with the Nasdaq composite and the Russell 2000, two indexes of smaller issues, setting record highs.
Big stocks also put in a good showing. The Dow Jones industrial average came within five points of its all-time closing high before finishing up 27.11 points at 3,542.55.
 
The Small-Stock Surge
 "The summer rally is on the way," said Dennis E. Jarrett, chief market analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company. He said he expects smaller issues, the over-the-counter stocks, to outperform the blue chips.
"The sizzle will be in the O-T-C, and it will probably be in technology," he said.
Such sizzle pushed the Nasdaq composite up 4.02 yesterday, to 712.49. The Russell 2000 rose 1.49, to 237.84, while the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks gained 1.99, to 450.08.
Trading on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy, at 297 million shares, compared with 237 million on Tuesday.
Patrick Davis, head of Nasdaq trading for Salomon Brothers, said the market began to climb after some anxious selling during the morning -- particularly of troubled Dell Computer -- failed to send prices tumbling.
"Everything was for sale this morning," he said. "But it rallied when that didn't turn out to be the end of the world."
Worried short-sellers -- investors who bet that stocks will fall -- helped support the gains by buying stock to offset their losses, Mr. Davis said. Nevertheless, he expressed surprise that his market had set a record.
"It snuck up on us," he said. "It doesn't feel like it's at a record level."
Among the biggest Nasdaq winners was Novellus Systems, a company that sells expensive equipment to semiconductor manufacturers. After the company projected second-quarter earnings that exceeded analysts' expectations, the stock closed up 3 1/8, to 27 1/2.
"It's a very healthy semiconductor market, which in turn has caused the semiconductor companies to increase their capacity," said Fred Wolf, vice president of Adams, Harkness & Hill Inc.
Stocks in some health-care plans -- those that take the managed-care approach favored by the Clinton Administration -- continued to grow yesterday. Oxford Health Plans was among the big gainers on Nasdaq, rising 4 points, to 75 1/4. U.S. Healthcare gained 2 3/4, to 51 1/2.
One of the newest Nasdaq stocks, Celestial Seasonings, resumed its climb toward the heavens. In its initial public offering on Tuesday, the company, which makes caffeine-free herbal teas, put forward 1.9 million shares at $20 each. The stock shot up to 29 1/4 on the day. Yesterday, it gained another 2 1/4, to 31 1/2.
 
Another Bad Day for Banks
 The chief exception to the widespread gains yesterday was in the banking sector, which cannot seem to win; investors continued to reward banks' strong earnings reports by dumping their stock.

HEADLINE: Physicist Nominated to Lead Science Agency

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14

 BODY:
President Clinton has nominated Dr. Neal F. Lane, the provost of Rice University in Houston, as the next director of the National Science Foundation.
The appointment of Dr. Lane, a theoretical physicist who has served in the No. 2 position at Rice since 1986, would require confirmation by the Senate, but no hearings have yet been scheduled, officials said today. 
 If confirmed, Dr. Lane would replace Dr. Walter E. Massey, who left the foundation last spring for a senior position with the University of California. He had been director for two years.
The National Science Foundation, which has an annual budget of about $3 billion, is the Government's chief agency for financing basic research and college and university research in science and engineering, as well as public science education.
Dr. Lane said in a telephone interview today that the White House contacted him about the position several months ago. He met with Dr. John Gibbons, the President's science adviser, in May and returned to Washington in June to discuss the job with Vice President Al Gore. "Things were looking very promising then," he said.
"In those discussions, it was clear the Administration had a strong commitment to basic research and supporting science as part of its economic and technical plans," Dr. Lane said, "and this is what the N.S.F. does. I sensed this strong support, which was a main reason I considered the job."
The Clinton Administration earlier this year asked Congress for $200 million in supplemental financing for the foundation to increase its 1993 budget to $2.94 billion. Congress is still considering the agency's budget for the 1994 fiscal year, for which Mr. Clinton has asked a 16 percent increase to $3.18 billion.
Some scientists have expressed concern that the foundation has been moving away from its tradition of supporting small and medium-sized grants for basic research by individual investigators to supporting more applied research and large engineering and supercomputer centers.
 
'Balance Is the Key'
 "I know about the concerns that have been raised about the direction the N.S.F. has been moving, but balance is the key," Dr. Lane said. "The foundation funds a broad spectrum of activities from small grants involving only single scientists to large centers, and my perception is that it has retained its strong inclination and tradition of supporting outstanding basic research and science education."
Dr. Lane said the foundation had been "remarkably" successful in its mission and, "if confirmed, my job will be to move the institution forward on all fronts."
Much of Dr. Lane's research has focused on the collisions of atoms and molecules and predicting the outcomes of these interactions. Dr. Lane said that one disadvantage to accepting the Washington job would be putting aside this work for administrative duties. "But I'll be helping other people get their research done," he noted.
Dr. Lane, who is 54, is a native of Oklahoma City and earned bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees from the University of Oklahoma. He also studied as a postdoctoral fellow at Queen's University in Belfast, Northern Ireland.
He taught physics at Rice for 18 years, starting as an assistant professor in 1966 and leaving as chairman of the department in 1984 when he became chancellor of the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs for two years. He returned to Rice in 1986 to become its chief academic officer.
From 1979 to 1980, Dr. Lane took a leave from Rice to come to Washington as director of the science foundation's physics division, and in the mid-1980's, he served as chairman of the foundation's advisory committee for advanced scientific computing, which helped in setting up a series of national supercomputer centers.
Dr. Lane is married to Joni Sue Lane, a former computer analyst, and the couple have two grown children, a son who is an electrical engineer and a daughter who is a computer analyst.

HEADLINE: A Cabaret Survives A la Carte

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., July 14

 BODY:
It's 45 minutes to show time at the Downtown Cabaret Theater here, and much of the Saturday evening crowd is arriving early with picnic baskets of fried chicken, meat loaf and cartons of Chinese takeout.
The eclectic a la carte is standard fare at the Downtown Cabaret. Connecticut's only professional year-round theater might also be the only one in the country that encourages people to bring their own food and drink so that they can watch "Fiddler on the Roof" and have a picnic at the same time.
 
Food and Footlights
 The unusual combination of food and entertainment seems to be why it has survived so far in the middle of a declining city. But as its debts mounted and attendance fell in the last few years, the cabaret found itself far from immune from bad times. 
 Now, those who operate the theater say, it seems to be regaining its financial health, and those attending a show the other night were eager to tell why they think that is so.
"Here, I can park my car with no hassle and eat a little dinner, relax and catch a great show," said Sidney Finkelstein of Stamford, as he munched a Subway sandwich and looked around the cozy theater. Including its balcony, the theater seats just under 300, but says it attracts 70,000 people a year to shows like "Song of Singapore" and "Blood Brothers." The last is Willie Russell's musical that is now at the Music Box Theater on Broadway after its debut at the Downtown Cabaret in 1988.
One cabaret regular, Carol Lazanov-Miccio of Stratford, said the shows here were "at least as good as Off Broadway."
 
Ambiance a la Carte
 Some people bring along their own ambiance, too. They produce elaborate table settings, with porcelain plates and crystal glasses, on the large round tables where they gather to watch the shows and eat dinner.
Others are more casual and just unwrap modest sandwiches and swig canned soda or beer.
With the theater set up like a high school gymnasium on this night, the show's "Nunsense" cast will later be shooting basketballs and riding bicycles down a center aisle, even as audience members eat and drink.
The theater's 11-member staff concedes that this would seem bizarre in any other indoor theater, but it is normal at the Downtown Cabaret. Audience members participate in the show as the actors leave the stage and come down to the tables.
"It's like a big public party where everyone loves to bring in their own food and just have a good time sitting at a table with friends or total strangers," said the theater's executive producer, Richard C. Hallinan. "I think we're the only theater around where you often have a boiler man sitting next to a bank president."
 
Began at Sacred Heart
 The cabaret was started at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield in the early 1970's under the direction of Claude McNeal, professor of theater and creative writing at Sacred Heart. It has been in a city-owned building on Golden Hill Street since 1975.
There are four shows each weekend, and tickets are $16.50 to $20, although tickets are discounted to $10 the day of most shows. The theater also presents children's programs on weekends.
Mr. Hallinan, who has been running the nonprofit theater since coming from Ireland to rescue the financially foundering cabaret in 1980, said the theater was in yet another crisis now.
The theater nearly closed last year when losses totaled $120,000, total debts rose to more than $300,000 and attendance dipped to a 20-year low.
 
Some Sponsors Quit
 Operating on a $1.2 million budget -- about 75 percent comes directly from box-office revenues -- the theater has lost some major sponsors in recent years, including banks that have closed or had to cut financial support because of the economic downturn. To stay open, the cabaret has had to rely on private contributors, fund-raising and cutbacks.
"The theater had been thought to be recession-proof," Mr. Hallinan said, "but this was more of a white-collar recession and it impacted us in two ways. Our backers could no longer sponsor us and people couldn't afford to spend the money at the theater. But we're a lot like this city. We're tough and we've managed to just get by by the skin of our teeth. And now, things are definitely looking up."
Some creative cutting and budgeting has kept the theater on financial target through the first six months of 1993. It looks as though the cabaret will break even and show a nearly 10 percent increase in attendance compared with last year, said its general manager, Maggie Silverstein.
"I really don't know quite how we're doing it, but we're hanging in there and it looks like we're going to make it now," Ms. Silverstein said. "We're not out of the woods yet, but a year ago nobody thought we'd still be here now."
Directly across from City Hall on Golden Hill Street, the theater is in an old Y.M.C.A. building.
Mr. Hallinan, who lives in Trumbull, produced more than 250 plays at the Dublin Olympia Theater before 1980. He says he has never loved theater more than in Bridgeport.
"We're kind of the antithesis to a place like the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, where people drive out to an idyllic setting in the country to see a show," he said.

HEADLINE: Nelson Seitel, Associate Publisher Of The Law Journal, Dies at 78

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Nelson Seitel, the associate publisher of The New York Law Journal and a veteran of public service, died yesterday at his home in Peter Cooper Village in Manhattan. He was 78.
The cause was cancer, the paper said. 
 After more than 30 years in a variety of public posts, Mr. Seitel was recruited by The Journal's publisher, Jerry Finkelstein, as his associate in 1970. The publisher praised him as "a scholar, teacher, public official and expert in legislation and legislative drafting."
The appointment came when Mr. Seitel's predecessor, M. Marvin Berger, resigned to accept an appointment to the bench. The Journal, published on weekdays, is considered must reading by virtually every lawyer in New York City.
 
A Teaching Vocation
 Over the years, Mr. Seitel (pronounced sigh-TELL) also taught, most recently for nearly 10 years at New York Law School. Before that, he had lectured at Brooklyn College, his alma mater, and at City College.
Born in a small town in Rumania, he was brought to this country as an infant during World War I. After his graduation from Brooklyn College, he earned his law degree at Columbia University Law School. He was a lawyer, but he never practiced.
He served as director of research and planning of the city's Planning Commission, where he prepared the first master plan for housing and slum clearance adopted by the commission.
As Labor Commissioner under Mayor Robert F. Wagner he drafted an executive order that granted city workers the right to bargain collectively and established a career and salary plan for city workers.
He served as chairman of the city's Transit Advisory Board, which oversees services, equipment and fares of franchised bus operators. He headed a committee that came up with a formula to save the Staten Island Rapid Transit System when the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad threatened its demise.
Mr. Seitel wrote many government reports and helped to draft municipal ordinances and state statutes. He was counsel to various state bodies dealing with corporate law, penal institutions and local government. A report he wrote on prisons led to the state's Work Release Law.
He was serving as counsel to Assembly Speaker Stanley Steingut when Mr. Finkelstein enlisted him for The Law Journal.
Mr. Seitel is survived by his wife of nearly 50 years, Josephine; two daughters, Karen Seitel of Manhattan and Joan Ackerstein of Boston, and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: THE MIDWEST FLOODING: The Overview;
CLINTON REQUESTS $2.5 BILLION IN AID FOR FLOOD REGION

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DES MOINES, July 14

 BODY:
President Clinton, arriving here to tour a region saturated with rain and river water, asked Congress today to appropriate $2.5 billion in Federal disaster assistance to rebuild businesses, compensate farmers for crop losses and provide other flood relief.
Mr. Clinton flew overnight from Hawaii, where he vacationed for three days on his way back from Japan and South Korea, to view the damage by helicopter before visiting a water-distribution site and participating in a television and radio call-in program.
 
Clutching Gallon Jugs
 "It was awful," Mr. Clinton said as he alighted from the Marine Corps helicopter with Gov. Terry E. Branstad after the 40-minute flight. 
 "Because I come from a state that's not all that different from Iowa, I have seen whole towns flooded," Mr. Clinton said. "I have seen massive amounts of farmland flooded. But I've never seen anything on this scale before."
During his aerial tour, Mr. Clinton saw swollen rivers that had engulfed trees, houses, parking lots and railroad cars. One highway bridge near the downtown area had collapsed.
Elsewhere, torrential rains worsened flooding in several places in the Middle West. In Quincy, Ill., crews were trying to save the only bridge across the Mississippi for at least 100 miles in each direction after a 2,000-foot breach opened in a levee.
The water-distribution site President Clinton visited in Des Moines was one of the 79 set up for the 250,000 or so people who are without running water because the city's main water-purification plant was knocked out by flooding over the weekend. Several of those who came to see Mr. Clinton clutched gallon jugs and said they were happy to see the President visit.
Mr. Clinton roamed the streets of Des Moines afterward, attracting crowds wherever he went and offering television interviews that showed him in shirtsleeves standing in front of flooded streets.
 
A Welcome Presence
 His presence here seemed to be welcomed by the residents.
Rodney Anderson, 36, a pipe lineman who shook Mr. Clinton's hand, said the President's visit was "important" but added: "We need some divine intervention. He has a lot of power, but he doesn't have that kind of power. He can't make the rain end."
Mr. Clinton was slightly sunburned from his brief vacation. A photograph in today's editions of The Des Moines Register showed Mr. Clinton wading in the Hawaiian surf. He had shaved 12 hours off his three-day vacation to fly overnight to Iowa.
One sign along his route today read: "Aloha Bill. Welcome to the other big island." Most of those interviewed did not appear to begrudge Mr. Clinton his time off. Even so, White House officials said Mr. Clinton would return to the Midwest again this weekend, to view flood damage in St. Louis.
 
'Can't Stop Nature'
 The aid package the White House requested from Congress would increase the deficit because, as a supplemental appropriation over what is already budgeted for disaster assistance, it would require borrowing by the Federal Government.
Congressional approval of the flood-aid package appears virtually certain. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, was among those promising quick action.
Mr. Clinton and his aides defended asking for such spending while he was trying to win final approval for a bill that he had pledged would reduce the Federal deficit by $500 million.
"You just can't stop nature from taking its course," the President said on the radio program broadcast by WHO, the Des Moines radio station where Ronald Reagan got his break as a sports broadcaster. "And you can't afford to paralyze the American people on this."
But even as the President was announcing the Federal help, local and state officials were complaining that the amount was "totally inadequate."
 
Comment From Harkin
 "I told them don't get locked into a number," Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa told reporters as Mr. Clinton was speaking at the water-distribution site. "Whatever you're going to say is too low, and I'm just going to have to say it's too low. Our preliminary numbers are just double that."
The flooding has been blamed for at least 25 deaths. Federal officials are estimating damages in Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin at $2 billion to $3 billion, mostly in lost crops. That is far below the $18 billion in devastation from Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Last year, more than $9 billion in Federal aid was approved after Hurricane Andrew, most of it for Florida.
Mr. Harkin, a Democrat, suggested that the money should come from the defense and foreign aid. Yet Senator Charles Grassley, a Republican, called Mr. Clinton's announcement "very good news" and called the aid proposal "an example of follow-through."
Mr. Clinton and his advisers said the money they have asked for is a healthy start to a Federal commitment that will increase as new disaster assessments come in. Mr. Clinton also asked Congress to waive the requirement that states provide matching funds for such Federal assistance, the same thing he did for Florida after Hurricane Andrew.
 
Expensive but Necessary
 Last week, Mr. Clinton announced that he would steer $100 million in crop insurance to farmers and search for ways to change the crop-insurance program to ease requirements.
Christopher Edley, associate director of the Office of Management and Budget, told reporters that the deficit would increase because of the emergency assistance, but that the expenditure would be necessary for the long-term health of the region.
"The fact is, if we didn't do something to address the crisis, the economic impact would far outsrip its effect on the deficit," he said.
Mr. Clinton, who was wearing a wireless microphone so residents who had come to see him could hear his informal comments as well as the shouts of support from people who reached to shake his hand, has declared Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois and Missouri Federal disaster areas.
 
'The Sky Is Falling'
 As Mr. Clinton flew above the flooded areas wearing a pair of aviator sunglasses and leather hiking boots, he gazed out the helicopter window as Governor Branstad itemized the damage below.
Later, Mr. Clinton walked to the flooded intersection of two normally busy streets and joined volunteers in shoveling white bags full of sand. The sandbags have been used to block off flood waters and protect the ground floors of buildings.
"Chicken Little was right," said another resident, Paulette Morton. "The sky is falling."
The Clinton Administration has labored to establish a high profile on Federal reaction to the floods as the President has been traveling abroad. Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, Transportation Secretary Federico Pena and James Lee Witt, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, have visited all of the affected states. Vice President Al Gore toured the region Monday.
In addition, the Army Corps of Engineers has dispatched 433 employees to help fortify levees and flood walls. Mr. Clinton said today that the response time was faster than had occurred in other recent natural disasters, including hurricanes in Florida and Hawaii.
The Des Moines fire department continued to struggle to protect the city with minimal water supplies. Since Sunday, the department has fought fires with only the water it can carry to the scene because the flooding of the city's water system has damaged the pumps that send water to the hydrants.
On Tuesday, the department acquired 10 new tankers capable of carrying 5,500 to 7,000 gallons. Late Tuesday night, the department faced its biggest test when fire struck a printing plant. The department used 70,000 gallons of water to fight the blaze, some of it trucked in from a duck pond at the Des Moines airport.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Flat Last Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14

 BODY:
Consumer price inflation disappeared in June, the first time in more than two years that prices remained level in a month, the Labor Department reported today.
Although the highly favorable reading was anticipated -- partly because of Tuesday's report that prices at the producer level actually declined in June -- financial markets advanced smartly on the news. Stocks rose broadly and long-term interest rates skidded to their lowest levels in decades. [Pages D10 and D18.] 
 "This is more reassurance that inflation pressures are still subdued," said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist for Prudential Securities. He said he was particularly encouraged by a further easing of the core rate of inflation, which excludes food and energy prices.
 
 
Core Inflation Rate
 Without these gyrating components, the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers last month rose one-tenth of 1 percent, pulling the annual core inflation rate for the last three months down to 2.9 percent.
Prices for food, energy, clothing, tobacco and airline tickets fell in June, while medical-care costs rose less than in May. The annual inflation rate including food and energy was 2.2 percent over the last three months, compared with 2.9 percent for all of 1992.
A separate report from the Commerce Department today showed that the nation's shoppers increased spending at retail stores by four-tenths of 1 percent last month, the third consecutive advance. Sales were also revised upward for April and May.
The markets had largely ignored word Tuesday of falling producer prices, apparently deciding to await confirmation from today's report before acting. Of the two gauges, the Consumer Price Index is far broader, embracing a wide variety of services as well as imported goods.
Today's report seemed to bury any remaining fears that the Federal Reserve, some of whose officials have fretted publicly of late about potential inflation, would act anytime soon to push up interest rates by tightening credit.
"The Fed is on hold," commented Darwin L. Beck, an economist for the First Boston Corporation, perhaps "for the rest of the year and even well into 1994."
Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman, is scheduled to make his semiannual appearances before Congress next week to describe the outlook of the Fed for the economy and its monetary policy.
Low inflation seems to improve chances for passage of the Clinton Administration's budget plan, which many believe will restrain the economy, at least in the short run, because of its tax increases and spending cuts. Had the Fed raised rates to combat the price surge that appeared temporarily in the early months of the year, applying the additional drag of the budget plan might have been too risky.
Today's retail figures also confirmed the recent trend of the economy in continuing to grind out gains, albeit at a less than vigorous pace.
 
 
'Neither Boom Nor Bust'
 "The current environment exhibits neither boom nor bust," said John E. Silvia of Kemper Financial Services in Chicago.
The four-tenths of 1 percent rise in retail sales, to $171.86 billion, was in itself a lackluster figure, analysts said. But it was considered quite respectable in light of upward revisions of three-tenths of a point each, to gains of 1.9 percent and four-tenths of 1 percent, respectively, for April and May.
That means retail sales for the spring quarter ran 1.5 percent ahead of those in the first three months of the year, when shoppers moved into post-holiday retrenchment.
Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of economic activity, half across retail counters and half for things like automobile insurance, veterinary fees and electricity.
The report of unchanged consumer inflation, which was the best since a one-tenth of 1 percent decline in March 1991, included a four-tenths of 1 percent decline in food that reversed increases of that amount in April and May.
Grocery prices dropped nine-tenths of 1 percent. Indexes for beef and pork, which had risen sharply this year, both fell in June and more declines could lie ahead if flood-stricken Midwest farmers step up slaughtering for lack of feed.
 
 
Housing Rises
 Housing, which makes up 41 percent of the Consumer Price Index, rose three-tenths of 1 percent -- the same as the average for the three preceding months -- while apparel prices fell five-tenths of 1 percent for the second straight month.
Transportation prices eased for the second straight month as drops in gasoline, air fares and automobile finance charges more than offset another sharp rise for used cars that brought the 12-month increase to 9.1 percent.
Elsewhere, charges for medical care rose four-tenths of 1 percent, half the May increase, while the tobacco industry's discounting war showed up in consumer prices for the first time and sent prices down 1.6 percent.
The overall consumer price rise's annual rate of 2.2 percent in the second quarter was down from a 4 percent rate in the first three months of the year.

HEADLINE: New Wave in Health Care: Visits by Video

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN

 BODY:
Every month, specialists at the Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo watch on a two-way video system as 6-year-old Jessica Bogdan relearns how to walk. They observe increments in progress, make suggestions to her therapist and prescribe future care -- all as easily as if the little girl were in the same room, rather than at Cuba Memorial Hospital, 85 miles away.
Some of the most revolutionary technology in medicine today is also the most familiar -- the television and the telephone. The video link between Buffalo and Cuba, N.Y., is but one example of this new approach to medicine -- called "telemedicine" -- and how it is redefining health care. 
 Fiber optic cables now transmit X-rays from far away storage centers or between hospitals. Several dozen office buildings are equipped with heart defibrillators that can be operated remotely by doctors over cable telephone lines if, for instance, paramedics are stuck in traffic. In some cases, emergency rooms are being electronically linked to correctional institutions, so inmates, in need of emergency care, need not be taken from prison.
"This is the future," said Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, chancellor of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, where a NASA satellite system will soon allow surgical consultations between doctors in Texas and patients in places like Russia, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. "This is going to change the world of medicine."
Experts say the use of telemedicine will powerfully affect rural communities, which are chronically short of specialists, and urban centers where specialists abound.
"It will be a tremendous boon for the physician community here," said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, which represents the city's 68 private hospitals and nursing homes.
Of the city's 31,000 doctors, he said, 70 percent are specialists, and small hospitals seeking consultations from specialists are most likely to turn to the most concentrated source. "I would think that many of these link-ups would involve New York's medical centers," he said.
Most telemedicine systems are so new that hospitals have not worked out details like how to bill for the service. Several are lobbying the Federal Government to create a special reimbursement category.
And, so far, there is only speculation as to what the medical, economic and sociological effects of telemedicine might be. There are those who argue, for instance, that telemedicine will increase health-care costs, and not just because of the cost of the cameras and other equipment (a setup like the one between Buffalo and Cuba costs about $50,000; Dr. DeBakey estimates that his transmitting station will cost close to $1 million.) If expensive specialists are literally a phone call away, these critics say, they are very likely to be "visited" more often.
Others believe that the new systems will eventually lower costs. They predict that fewer specialists will be required since they could more easily concentrate in the largest medical centers, rather than opening practices in every hamlet of the country. In addition, they say, nurse practitioners and physician assistants could provide basic health care in rural areas if a doctor can be dialed up as needed.
 
From Car to Video Camera
 For the Bogdans, there have only been benefits. Two years ago, Jessica suffered a stroke in gym class, the result of a malformed blood vessel in her brain. Since then she has needed the care of doctors in more than a half-dozen specialties, and none of those specialists could be found in the tiny town of Cuba. So every month the Bogdans, with Jessica and her younger brother, drove the four-hour round trip to Buffalo, a trip that was draining on everyone.
Last summer, doctors told the Bogdans that the drives would no longer be necessary. The hospital in Cuba began a pilot program with the Buffalo hospital, with two video cameras and monitors at each site using lines from New York Telephone and U S Sprint that allow the calls to be dialed up as needed, without the expense of a dedicated private line.
For the last year, the system has been tested only with nonemergency rehabilitation cases. But next month it will be expanded to the emergency rooms of both hospitals, allowing specialists in Buffalo to advise family doctors and nurse practitioners in Cuba. Eventually, the program will be expanded so that Buffalo is linked with a variety of rural hospitals as well as area correctional centers.
Such arrangements are possible, said Dr. David Ellis, who is in charge of the Buffalo emergency room, in part because of recent advances in the quality of video pictures. "I became a believer during a test demonstration when they showed a patient with a skin rash," he said. "I could tell from the screen whether or not the rash was raised."
Other users of the system agree that it is surprisingly easy to diagnose a patient from hundreds of miles away. Barbara Bevins, nurse manager of the emergency department of Dodge County Hospital in Eastman, Ga., said her office regularly does cardiology consultations via video with doctors at the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta, 152 miles away. "Today we focused the camera on the jugular veins" of a patient with chronic heart problems, she said, "and the doctors could see how distended they were."
Video examinations are but one of the new medical applications of everyday technology. Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, short on storage space for radiologic images like CAT scans, MRI's and old-fashioned X-rays, keeps them in a warehouse three miles away in Somerville. In rush-hour traffic, the trip from the warehouse to the hospital takes far too long, said a hospital spokesman, Martin Bander, so Massachusetts General is testing a system called Radiology Storage Tracking Archiving and Retrieval, which is also being tested by hospitals in Dallas, St. Paul and Mission Viejo, Calif. The system allows a clear picture of the film to be transmitted to a screen at the affiliated hospital, where doctors can read the film.
This futuristic form of fax is in use in places like the clinic at Yellowstone National Park, where X-rays of injured hikers can be read by radiologists in West Park Hospital in Cody, Wyo.
Sensing profit in the new applications of technology, companies are maarketing products that join medicine and telephones. The New Jersey-based MEDphone Corporation manufacturers only one product, called MDphone, which looks like a hard-sided suitcase and contains a portable defribrillator, which can restart a heart by remote control over a standard or cellular phone line.
In the last two years, 100 of the $7,000 units have been sold, mostly to large companies, said MEDphone's president, Eric Wachtel. When activated, he said, the device dials the nearest participating hospital and allows someone with the patient to talk to an emergency room doctor. When the disposable adhesive electrodes are attached to the patient's chest, the doctor receives the patient's electrocardiogram, and, if necessary, the doctor can press a button to apply an electric jolt.
Less dramatic are a variety of home-testing devices which allow patients to stay at home while a doctor monitors heart rate, blood pressure and temperature over the phone. A study by Arthur D. Little Inc., a management consulting firm, last summer cites nearly two dozen such products either in use or in the works.
 
A Problem of Billing
 While this new availability of information solves many medical problems, it simultaneously raises others, from protecting the privacy of patients in an increasingly electronic world, to the liability of doctors who administer care long distance, to the problem of how to charge for it all.
At Erie County Medical Center, Dr. Ellis said, telemedicine consultations are billed at the same rate as regular consultations. But the hospital has joined with one hospital in Georgia and another in West Virginia, both of which are using similar systems, and requesting that the Health Care Financing Administration, which regulates Medicare and Medicaid, add telemedicine as a separate category.
The change would be significant because so many rural patients are also poor or elderly, and because private insurers follow the billing leads of the Federal Government. The consultations, he said, would, at least at first, be more expensive, to account for the cost of the equipment.
Other questions are more philosophical. David J. Rothman, a professor of social medicine at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University, believes telemedicine is a step toward better medical care, but he worries that, as is often the case with progress, something intangible is being lost.
For decades, he said, technology has been metaphorically distancing doctors from their patients, causing many patients to describe their doctors as callous or cold. Telemedicine, he said, is a literal distancing of doctors and patients.
"The ideals of medicine, the laying on of hands, there's no place for that here," he said. "You can't get much further apart than this."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Notes and Bonds Move Up

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The bond market got the kind of news it likes yesterday -- that inflation is low and economic growth is moderate -- and traders responded with enthusiasm, pushing prices of Treasury notes and bonds higher.
The buying sent the yield on the 30-year bond down to another 16-year low and yields on Treasury notes to their lowest levels in more than two decades. 
 The question from here is how much further prices can rise and yields, which move in the oppositie direction, can fall. Traders, portfolio managers and anlaysts seem to be cautious -- aware of the possibility of a sudden reversal with the market at levels not seen in decades.
But for the time being, the weakened state of the economy and inflation, and the progress in Congress of President Clinton's deficit reduction plan, seem to favor lower interest rates.
 
No Signs of Bouncing Back
 "The economy is not showing signs of bouncing back and the whole political process is restrictive from the economic point of view," said John Costas, managing director of trading and sales at the First Boston Corporation. "I think that means lower yields."
In trading yesterday, the price of the 30-year bond due in February 2023 rose 23/32 , and the yield fell to 6.56 percent, from 6.61 percent Tuesday. It was the fith day in a row that the yield dipped to its lowest level since the Treasury began to issue 30-year bonds regularly in May 1977.
The price of the 10-year note rose 11/32 and the yield fell to 5.70 percent, its lowest since the beginning of the 1970's. Yields on other Treasury notes fell as did the discount rates on Treasury bills.
The news that the Consumer Price Index for June was unchanged and that retail sales for last month rose just four-tenths of 1 percent did serve to end conclusively any thought of a rebound in inflation and a raising of interest rates by the Federal Reserve -- for now.
It will be easy now to dismiss the unexpectedly high rise in consumer and producer price inflation in the first four months of the year. The Consumer Price Index through April was rising at a 4.3 percent annual rate and had prompted two sharp selloffs in the bond market that pushed the yield of the 30-year bond over 7 percent temporarily.
But in the last two months, the Consumer Price Index rose just one-tenth of 1 percent in May and was unchanged in June, bringing down the annual rate of increase for the first six months of the year to 3.1 percent, just above the 2.9 percent increase for all of 1992.
But the key to the inflation outlook continues to be the pace of economic growth. If the economy begins to grow faster than 3 percent in the second half of the year, then investors may begin to worry that there will be inflationary pressures building up in 1994. And that belief could stop a credit market rally.
"The real issue is to what extent the economy improves," said Donald Fine, the chief market analyst at Chase Securities Inc.
Even with the strong car sales reported yesterday in the first 10 days of July, the June increase in retail sales of four-tenths of 1 percent still points to modest growth for now.
And it is likely that the outlook for the economy will continue to be modest because of the impact of the tax increases that are included in the President's deficit reduction plan. While problems in reaching a compromise between the House and Senate versions might spook the bond market from time to time, the bottom line is that the program will be a drag on the the economy.
 
Buying of Treasury Securities
 The rally in the market yesterday, however, was not all pushed by the good news on inflation. Prices were forced higher and yields lower by trading strategies and the continued buying of Treasury securities by state and local governments refinancing older, higher-interest-rate tax-exempt bonds at lower interest rates.
Mr. Costas of First Boston said that a lot of traders began yesterday thinking that prices were very high and yields low. In addition, some thought that the good news on inflation had already been factored in. So they decided to short bonds and notes, selling them in anticipation of buying them back at lower prices.
Instead there was slow, steady buying that soon forced many of the short-selling traders to buy back bonds and notes to avoid losses, which pushed prices higher. Some of this steady buying was from cities and towns that put Treasury securities into escrow accounts to pay off their old high-interest-rate bonds.

HEADLINE: Japan Sees Little Drop In Surplus

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 14

 BODY:
Only five days after President Clinton and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa announced a broad framework for trade talks, Japan's top trade official said today that the United States should not expect his country's trade surpluses to go down in the next two years.
The official, Sozaburo Okamatsu, said that while the agreement called for "a highly significant decrease" in Japan's surpluses over the "medium term," the sluggishness of the Japanese economy would keep imports here low for quite some time. 
 "My personal view is that in the coming two years the imbalance will not decrease much," said Mr. Okamatsu, who became vice minister of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry late last month and participated in the negotiations with the Clinton Administration. "Frankly, in this calendar year the imbalance will grow."
The vice minister is the highest career appointee in the ministry, and usually the most influential voice in setting policy. In his conversation today, over lunch with four correspondents based in Tokyo, he did not sound as if he was backing away from any of the commitments made by Japan.
Instead, he appeared to be interpreting the vaguely worded framework accord quite literally, noting that despite the Clinton Administration's insistence that an understanding exists about how to define the term "highly significant," the Japanese do not believe they are committed to cuts of a specific size.
His comments seemed to underscore how much of the agreement is subject to interpretation, and how many critical issues have been put off for negotiations to come. Under the framework accord, specific negotiations will take place in five more specific areas. But in none of them did Japan agree to specific targets.
"I don't believe that the present level of imbalance is normal, so we should take comprehensive measures to correct it," Mr. Okamatsu said. "But the U.S. says that means it should go down to 2 percent of our G.N.P., and there is no agreement on that at all. There is no numerical target."
In the hours after the agreement was announced last Saturday, several White House officials used the 2 percent figure, suggesting that it was part of an informal understanding. But even before Mr. Clinton left Tokyo, Japanese officials said they had fended off the Administration's efforts to put any kind of figures in the agreement, saying that would amount to managed trade.
"A highly significant reduction also depends on the United States," Mr. Okamatsu said. "If it is not accomplished, it is not the responsibility of Japan, only. It is also the responsibility of the U.S. and the condition of the world economy."

Dollar Off on Price Report And Gold Falls in New York

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday as a positive report on inflation pointed to lower American interest rates. As such, investments denominated in Japanese yen and German marks would be more attractive than those in dollars.
The dollar slipped to 1.7170 marks in late New York trading from 1.7195 marks late on Tuesday. Also in New York, the dollar dropped to 107.10 yen, from 108.13 yen on Tuesday. 
 Gold prices also fell. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the actively traded gold contract for August delivery dropped $3.10 an ounce, to $391.40. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted spot gold at $391 an ounce, down $3.25.
The Labor Department reported yesterday that consumer prices were unchanged in June. This followed Tuesday's report of a drop of three-tenths of a percent in the Producer Price Index for June.
"The data drove home the idea that the Federal Reserve is not tightening credit in the near-term," said David Solin, foreign exchange manager at the Toronto Dominion Bank.
As a result, he said, many people are taking profits made on the dollar's recent gains versus the mark.
Dealers flocked to mark-denominated assets as fears of a significant German rate cut faded after the Bundesbank cut its repurchase rate only slightly.
"There's a feeling the Bundesbank might have to ease, but not tomorrow," said David Glowacki, a senior trader at NBD Bank.
 
Pound, Swiss Franc Strengthen
The Swiss franc and the British pound also rose against the dollar, as yields on assets based in those currencies are expected to rise with the rebounding British and Swiss economies.
The British pound settled at $1.5015 in New York, above Tuesday's $1.4960 level. And the dollar slipped to 1.5120 Swiss francs, from 1.5177 on Tuesday.
"The dollar is losing a bit in terms of its safe haven status, but I don't want to make too much of the dollar move today, because it is still well bid on the back of tensions" in the European Monetary System, said Lisa Finstrom of Shearson Lehman Brothers.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
Witnesses for the Nation

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
As the rains continue and network reporters are still at their posts, herewith a word of gratitude for their many-sided and sustained coverage of the floods in the Midwest.
Disasters are made for the cameras, of course, and once again television has displayed nature's power. But more important, the bewilderment, loss, pain and grit in the faces on the screen has brought Americans together. And the presence on the scene of the three famous network anchors -- Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Dan Rather -- has been an affirmation of national concern and solidarity that went beyond the customary functions of journalism. 
 To be sure, there was plenty to be reported, and reported it was. Farmers and barge operators told of their troubles. Weather experts and river experts explained what was happening; and why, insofar as anyone could explain it. Economics reporters predicted the effects on food prices, and officials lobbied for aid. Viewers learned something about how levees and crop insurance work and don't work.
But all those matters could have been handled as well or better by the anchors' competent colleagues on the spot. This time out, however, Mr. Jennings, Mr. Rather and Mr. Brokaw have performed a service that only they could perform. Some of their forays to hot spots have seemed to be more an expression of restlessness than of necessity, but now they have been where they had to be.
Because of the special place the anchors occupy in the routines of much of America, these very public yet oddly personal nightly visitors became emissaries, speaking for viewers as well as to them. For audiences far from the flooding, their arrival affirmed its seriousness, and for the people in trouble, they were proof that the rest of the nation was watching and worrying. Moving out of their studios and into the country, the anchors became our get-well cards to our unlucky neighbors.

HEADLINE: 'Trade Only' Walls Weaken

BYLINE: By SUZANNE SLESIN

 BODY:
NOWHERE has the slump in decorating been felt more directly than in the to-the-trade showrooms. These exclusive arenas, often grouped in design centers in big cities, are where the business of decorating mainly takes place.
For many years it has been easier for the public to meet Madonna than to get past the receptionist in a designer showroom. But now a number of design centers are beginning to lift the so-called chintz curtain that has kept lay people from seeing, let alone buying, some of the choicest merchandise around. 
 Many showrooms are now wooing consumers for the first time. At some, they can browse freely, but purchase merchandise only with a designer. At others, consumers are allowed in to shop and buy during special events. At still other places, the public is allowed to buy at 15 to 20 percent discounts without a designer go-between.
These are soul-searching days in the world of decorating.
The stock-market crash of 1987 and the recession that followed have caused hundreds of decorating projects to be canceled or put on hold indefinitely. AIDS has also further sapped the industry's vitality by claiming scores of people in the design and architectural fields, including some of the stars and trend-setters. The business may never recover.
The showrooms -- oases of thick carpeting, fresh flowers and well-sharpened personalized pencils -- are where designers and architects, sometimes with clients in tow, can flip through thousands of fabric samples or run their fingers through scores of braided tassels. A to-the-trade showroom sells only to professionals, at a discount of about a third off retail.
Traffic is down. And antique shows, flea markets and auctions, as well as bargain furniture and fabric emporiums, have grown in popularity.
Marketing strategies are in force in decorator-only bastions like the Decoration and Design Building in New York, the Pacific Design Center in Los Angeles and the Merchandise Mart in Chicago. Tenants at the 25-year-old D and D Building, as it is known, on Third Avenue and 58th Street in Manhattan have recently emerged from a months-long debate, and have decided to remain to-the-trade only.
On July 7, the building was acquired by the Decoration and Design Building Partnership and is being managed and leased by the Merchandise Mart Properties of Chicago. A letter sent by the new owners to the tenants said the change came after "an uncontested foreclosure proceeding." The building was previously owned by D and D Associates, a division of the Aaron Diamond Realty Corporation.
"I think we're all very busy re-inventing ourselves," said Ann Pardue Sonet, a New York public relations agent who specializes in the design industry. "One thing is sure, we're not going back to the 80's."
Some fabric firms, like Brunschwig & Fils, are going into furniture; others, like George Hanson Lamps, have been bought by larger companies, in this case, the Hinson Company, a fabrics and wall-coverings concern.
The Pacific Design Center in Los Angeles has for the last few years looked for ways to allow the public in. It is part of their "consumer awareness program," said Julie D. Taylor, the center's manager of public relations. "We are inviting consumers into the building to browse and to learn about the process of professional interior design." If a customer wants to order, the building offers a referral list of designers.
Marvin Danto, the owner of design centers in Florida and Michigan, said, "We believe that consumer knowledge is good for our business, but getting the public into the showrooms is a big job."
In Dallas, they're trying.
At the Dallas Design District -- a 54-acre complex of 31 buildings -- a 15,000-square-foot marketing center with a multimedia theater is being developed as part of a promotion called the Design Experience, to open in September. The center was the first in the United States.
"The upscale consumer is who we're after," said Michael W. McAdams, president of Crow Design Centers, which owns Dallas Design District, the Boston Design Center and the Decorative Center of Houston.
Mr. McAdams said that a purchasing service will allow customers to buy some merchandise at 15 to 20 percent off the showroom list prices.
"We were amazed through the research we did last year at the number of people who didn't know that there was a design center in their home town," he said.
But at Clarence House, an upscale fabrics company that maintains 14 showrooms in the United States, there is no compromise on its to-the-trade-only policy.
In their two-story, 10,000-square-foot New York showroom with a private entrance in the D and D Building, there's really no such thing as "just looking" -- for the general public, that is. The showroom, designed by the late Jay Spectre with a striking winding staircase, has between 4,500 and 5,000 different textiles, from $24 to $2,550 a yard.
"We are very opposed to opening up the showroom to anyone but the professional interior designer or architect," said Susan S. Freedman, vice president of the 32-year-old company. "When you see 5,000 different choices, it becomes confusing. People get crazy. Our sales staff is here to serve the professional."
Suzanne Varney, president of Carleton V, a showroom in the D and D Building where fabrics range from $40 to $300 a yard, said: "We need the designer because we don't sell a finished product. Because the goods can be so expensive, if they are used incorrectly, it becomes an expensive mistake for the customer."
For the consumer, the designer is the necessary go-between. For the showroom, the professional has another value. "Decorators are like sales representatives," Ms. Varney said. "How many industries are there where your customer comes in, takes a sample and then sells it 10 times for you in a year? We don't want to live without them." Some consumers try.
"If you want something that's not only cheap but that you can take home with you, then you go downtown," said Rosi Levai, a New Yorker who is often looking for fabrics for her loft or her country house.Mrs. Levai has learned her way around the fabric emporiums that dot Broadway below Houston Street.
"I've gone to places down on Broadway, like Intercoastal, and found cottons, denims and even raffia," she said. "And often for $5 a yard. But don't expect anything fancy. It's usually a dusty basement with thousands of yards of stuff. You have to scrounge around and be prepared to get a little dirty."
You might also call it instant gratification. Being able to take it home with you has also been a factor in weakening the appeal of showrooms. "People don't want to wait anymore," said Mariette Himes Gomez,, a New York interior designer who sells has her own collection of furniture to the public in her Upper East Side showroom.
And there's fun in the hunt. Looking for the right chair, even the perfect textile remnant, anywhere but the in the traditional showroom has become a form of entertainment.
Some decorators, like Agnes Hibon, tries to cover all bases. Recently, Mrs. Hibon was scouring the showrooms at the D and D Building looking for "discontinued" fabrics for a "very limited budget job" for diplomatic clients. "I also shop downtown," she said. "Some places there are like the caves of Ali Baba."
Finding these alternative sources has become a small industry in iteself. Elysa Lazar's Home Report, a new publication, gives an almost day-by-day breakdown of auctions, antiques shows and warehouse sales in the New York area. And the "Fine Furniture and Furnishings Discount Shopping Guide," by M. Katherine Gladchun (Resources, Bloomfield Hills, Mich.; $12.95) lists more than 200 places where people can find that magic thing: a discount.
Although many to-the-trade showrooms do maintain some stock, much of the furniture and fabric must be custom ordered. Beverly Ellsley, a designer from Westport, Conn., said she goes to New York a couple of times a week because the D and D Building, "with its tremendous selection, is still the resource for fabric." But, she added, "Sometimes there's nothing behind the samples," meaning it's not in stock.
But Ms. Ellsley is not discouraged about the future of decorating. "In a poor real-estate market, people may have bought things at good prices, but they still need to be decorated," she said. "Just go to a cocktail party. Everyone is either talking about doing business with a decorator or is a decorator."

HEADLINE: PARENT & CHILD

BYLINE: By Lawrence Kutner

 BODY:
FOR some families with teen-agers, taking a vacation together is an exercise in frustration for both generations. For others, it's an opportunity to rebuild relationships and discover things about one another away from the day-to-day stresses of home.
"Unless you travel with your teen-agers, your time with them is likely to be limited to swapping car keys and telephone messages," said Candyce H. Stapen, a travel writer in Washington who has traveled extensively with her 11-year-old daughter and 23-year-old son. "It's a chance for you to get to know each other as people. Your kids get to see you as a person, not just a parent." 
 The key to a successful family vacation with adolescents, said travel professionals and experts in child development, is understanding and respecting one another's needs. A vacation that worked when the children were in elementary school may turn into a disaster when they are teen-agers.
"What the parents find interesting may bore a teen-ager to death," said Dr. Peter A. Wish, the director of the New England Institute of Family Relations in Framingham, Mass., and the father of a 17-year-old daughter. "A teen-ager who feels miserable on vacation will, in turn, make his parents miserable."
The last thing many adolescents want to do on vacation is sightsee. Only the rare 14-year-old can tolerate day after day of uninterrupted art museums or beautiful vistas.
"If they have to sit in a car for hours, they're likely to plug into things that isolate them from you, like a Walkman or a portable video game," said Dorothy Jordon, the managing director of "Travel With Your Children," a specialized book and newsletter publisher in Manhattan. "But part of the point of the vacation is to have them plug into their family."
Another important issue is independence. Adolescence is a time for children to experiment with being less reliant on their parents. Some of their efforts are awkward. They may go to the movies with their mother, but insist on sitting a few rows away from her. They may ask for a ride to a friend's house, but beg to be dropped off around the corner and out of sight. At times their desire to prove their independence may lead them to overlook the real dangers that come with some activities.
Family vacations offer teen-agers an opportunity to experiment with new levels of independence and self-reliance. Sports like wind surfing or rock climbing allow them to test the limits of their growing bodies.
Peer relationships are much more important for adolescents than for younger children. Teen-agers will seek out and want to spend time with people their own age. "They like a beach packed with other bodies, and something happening at night," Ms. Stapen said.
This combination of needs and opportunities can make parents worry about their teen-agers' safety. Yet, if parents keep a tight rein on them, adolescents will probably rebel.
Some cruise lines, resorts and hotels have responded by developing programs for teen-agers that complement their supervised activities for younger children. At their best, these programs offer enough structure and supervision to please the parents and enough independence, adventure and socializing to satisfy the adolescents.
Julie Halpern, the director of special markets for Hyatt Hotels Corporation in Chicago, said her company introduced "Rock Hyatt," a set of special programs for teen-agers, in 1992 after they noticed that families who had used their children's programs were going other places when those children were adolescents. "We see teen-agers as future business customers," she said.
Still, the mere presence of organized activities and special facilities for adolescents doesn't mean all children will find them attractive. "Many programs at hotels and resorts claim to be for children 13 to 17, but generally few teen-agers over 15 show up," Ms. Stapen said. "They don't want to be with the younger kids, even though they might have a good time."
 
Teen-Agers, Parents, Vacations: Perilous Mix
 IF you're going on vacation with teen-agers, one of the best things you can do is get them involved in the planning from the start. This addresses their need to be recognized as being more mature than when they were younger. For example, if they're aware of your budget and know how much things cost, they're less likely to ask for things you can't afford.
"Also, when things go wrong, they won't be as unhappy since they've made more of the decisions themselves," said Dorothy Jordon, the managing director of "Travel With Your Children," a specialized book and newsletter published in Manhattan, and the mother of two teen-age boys.
Here are some other things to consider:
Look into package plans, especially if your child likes sports.
An inexpensive room is a false economy if the only thing your teen-ager wants to do is zoom around on jet skis at $35 an hour. "You can go broke keeping a teen-ager happy with sports," said Candyce H. Stapen, a travel writer in Washington. "A package plan also means you don't turn into the bad guy who has to keep saying 'No!' "
Be considerate of one another's privacy and schedules.
One way to do this is to rent two adjacent rooms or a small suite. That way you're not being awakened at 1 A.M. when your teen-ager comes home from the disco or late movie, and you're not waking him up at 7 A.M. when you get up for a round of golf. Many hotels will offer discounts on a second room or a suite to families with teen-agers.
Don't push teen-agers to do early-morning activities.
Teen-agers are notoriously late sleepers. Pushing them to do things early in the morning that they're not especially excited about may leave them grumpy for the rest of the day. "Expect to have dinner but not breakfast with your kids," Ms. Jordon said.
If you're a single parent, look for communal dining.
You may see very little of a teen-ager who gets swept up in his own activities. "You can end up eating every meal by yourself, which can be a very lonesome experience if that isn't what you wanted," Ms. Jordon said.
Most cruise ships and resorts will allow you to share a table with others. They'll also allow you to discreetly change your seating if the company isn't to your liking.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Middle Ground on Abortion Shifting Into Terra Incognita

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14

 BODY:
Over the next few months, Congress and the White House will face one of the most complicated, unpredictable and perhaps politically perilous phases of the abortion struggle yet. Like it or not, the lawmakers will be forced to define a new political center on abortion.
Gone are the days when it was enough to simply support or oppose the legalization of abortion. Now, lawmakers have to decide whether being "pro-choice," a label many of them claim with pride, means supporting public financing of abortion for poor women, sharply curtailing the states' abilities to regulate abortion and including abortion services in a national health-care plan. 
 Lawmakers who consider themselves "pro-life" have to decide what can be realistically achieved without an abortion foe in the White House.
The issues of abortion accessibility that are now before Congress are of great subtlety and have far less public support than the question of abortion's legality. The White House has handled them gingerly in recent weeks, and the wariness on Capitol Hill is palpable.
Representative Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, is emblematic of the lawmakers caught in the middle. "I really believe there is a national consensus on this issue that is not represented by the views of either pro-life or pro-choice lobbyists," he said. "Folks are still struggling, but they probably come down with the position, 'Keep it legal, don't encourage it.' "
But Mr. Durbin, who describes his stance "as a middle position where I get battered from both sides," said he had yet to decide how abortion services should be treated in a national health plan. "It's a tough one," he said, "and at this point I just don't have the answer."
Groups on each side of the abortion issue are pushing hard, recognizing the crucial period now beginning as Congress returns from its Fourth of July recess. Supporters of abortion rights, with an agenda that seeks to undo many of the policies of the last 12 years, have already suffered an initial, embarrassing defeat when the House approved the Hyde Amendment, which would permit Federal financing of abortions for poor women only in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the pregnant woman was in danger.
 
Signs of Trouble
 Now, abortion-rights groups are battling to keep the proposed Freedom of Choice Act, the centerpiece of their legislative agenda, on track. That measure, intended to put the constitutional right to abortion into Federal law and prohibit most state restrictions on it, faces serious and mounting difficulties.
One of the latest signs of trouble was the announcement by Senator Carol Moseley Braun, Democrat of Illinois, that she was ending her support because the bill did not go far enough to protect the rights of poor women.
Further evidence of splintering support came this week when Representative Maxine Waters, a California Democrat and staunch supporter of abortion rights, told reporters that Senator Braun's position was "courageous" and added that it would be difficult to move forward with the bill "without consolidated support" among abortion-rights leaders.
Anti-abortion forces, at the moment, are presenting more of a united front. Widely discounted after losses in the 1992 elections, they have retooled their strategy to concentrate on the lawmakers in the middle, and they seem rejuvenated by their victory in the first legislative round.
The National Right to Life Committee and its allies are portraying the Freedom of Choice Act as an extremist and profoundly anti-democratic measure that seeks to force a national policy of "abortion on demand" on all 50 states.
 
Time for Directness
 Each of these issues is replete with nuances, amendments and exemptions that lawmakers have rarely been asked to confront so directly.
For example, where is the consensus on Federal financing of abortions for poor women? Is it, as passed by the House, in cases of rape, incest and saving the life of the pregnant woman? What about to preserve the "health" of the pregnant woman, which anti-abortion forces assert amounts to abortion on demand? What about leaving the matter up to the states, and simply reimbursing those states that choose to pay for abortions under the Medicaid program for the poor?
Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, said, "While gradually things are moving in a pro-choice direction, there's still a crucial swing vote of people who are marginally pro-choice or pro-choice with qualifications -- and that is the fulcrum."
Representative Jim Slattery, Democrat of Kansas, argues that President Clinton will move beyond that center if he includes abortion services in his national health package. "He'll spend a lot of time arguing about abortion instead of health care," Mr. Slattery said.
As abortion-rights organizers have already discovered, the lawmakers in the middle are hard to count and hard to predict. "First of all, they hate to vote on the issue," said Representative Vic Fazio, the California Democrat who is a leader of the abortion-rights camp. "And, second, they hate to talk about it."
The White House might have been expected to try to lead the way toward a new consensus. Throughout the Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton talked of making abortion "safe, legal and rare," suggesting that he would try to articulate a reproductive health program that would both protect abortion rights and work to prevent unintended pregnancies.
But abortion-rights organizers say the White House has been less than vocal on the issue as the legislative struggle heats up. Mr. Clinton submitted a budget that would have dropped the current Hyde Amendment, which allows Federal financing only when the life of the pregnant woman is in danger, but his Administration has yet to unveil the compromise language to replace it.
The Administration's stance prompted considerable grumbling among abortion-rights groups in the aftermath of their remarkably broad defeat on the Hyde Amendment.
"I would have liked to have seen them be a little more in control here on this," said Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion Rights Action League. "I think they're trying to avoid all kinds of controversy that might distract them from economic policy or health-care reform as a whole. But in doing so, they may be losing some very vital battles along the way that will weaken them over the long term."
Defeat on the Hyde Amendment has prompted supporters of abortion rights to review more carefully the political status of the Freedom of Choice Act. The Democratic leadership had little choice over the timing of the Hyde vote; it came on a spending bill that must be passed by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. But those leaders can decide when -- and whether -- to bring the Freedom of Choice Act to the floor. This, in fact, is the next big strategic decision on the abortion issue.
Supporters of the bill are fighting on two fronts. On one side are abortion opponents; on the other are abortion-rights supporters who dislike the bill because it would let states deny public financing for abortions and require some form of parental or adult notification for minors.
The battle over taxpayer financing of abortions, in the meantime, moves into the Senate; abortion opponents acknowledge that they face a tougher challenge there, but after their Hyde victory they enter in a stronger position than many had expected.
But the issue of financing abortions for the poor is considered only a preview of the struggle over health care. Mr. Clinton, who explicitly promised in last year's campaign that he would include abortion services in any national health-care plan, must now decide how to handle the issue.

HEADLINE: Troubles at Empire Blue Cross Reflect a Failure of Management

 BODY:

To the Editor:
You apply an unfairly broad brush when you paint a picture of blame for the dismal financial performance of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield in "The Failure to Police Empire" (editorial, July 2).
Arthur Andersen & Company was retained by the New York State Insurance Department to perform a broad management and financial review of Empire's performance, not an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Another independent public accounting firm has for many years audited Empire's financial statements to comply with statutory reporting requirements. 
 Our firm was engaged to help identify ways to solve Empire's problems and improve its future prospects; our role was not to assign blame for past mistakes. When we began last October, many of Empire's financial failings were already well known and well documented. Our review helped identify the course necessary to set Empire on the road to recovery. Our final report contained more than 120 detailed recommendations designed to improve virtually every aspect of Empire's operating performance and financial condition.
Developing these recommendations required an analysis of Empire's weaknesses and their underlying causes. But it is misleading to claim we "concluded that Empire's problem was primarily due to the practices of commercial competitors." That erroneously implies we concluded that Empire's management bore no responsibility for the company's poor performance.
While we determined that Empire's performance was seriously affected by economic forces and market pressures, we also concluded that Empire's management had failed to position the company as a competitive player in New York's health insurance market.
In particular, our report criticized the "autocratic" and "hierarchical" style of senior management and concluded that Empire had been "slow to appreciate the accelerating pace of change in the insurance market and even slower to respond to the ensuing challenges." To some, these management failures may reflect poor business judgment; to others, they may constitute mismanagement, incompetence or malfeasance. Those determinations are best left to others, including Empire's board of directors, regulators and elected officials.
Finally, you inaccurately suggest that our independence was compromised by the fact that Arthur Andersen & Company has had a "business relationship" with Empire. That "relationship" consisted of three prior contracts of limited duration, narrow in scope and confined to one part of Empire's organization. Moreover, the existence of these contracts was fully disclosed in our proposal to the New York Insurance Department, which agreed that this past work created no conflict of interest nor impaired our objectivity.

HEADLINE: South Africa Looks Better to Investors

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your July 6 Business Day article on reinvestment in South Africa raises important questions about the challenges faced in encouraging investment in a future democratic South Africa. However, the article lacks balance, arguing that when Nelson Mandela, the head of the African National Congress, calls for the lifting of sanctions and opens the door to investors, the reaction will be great caution from companies and investors who have a policy against investing in South Africa. We disagree. 
 The Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility has actively campaigned against apartheid in South Africa for almost 25 years.
Church investors who are part of the center hold $35 billion in their portfolios. In addition, we work closely with other social investment leaders, as well as with many state and city pension funds.
When official arrangements for the general election in South Africa next April are finalized, the call by South African democratic leaders to lift sanctions will be issued.
Concerned institutional investors, from the Episcopal Church to the United States Trust Company in Boston, from the Evangelical Lutheran Church to the Calvert Social Investment Fund are prepared to respond to that call by ending their divestment policies and encouraging corporations to invest in a new South Africa as responsible citizens.
Shareholder campaigns against companies with South African ties will end, and so will boycotts. Cities, states, colleges, unions and foundations will respond to a South Africa on the road to democracy by canceling their old policies.
This is in the spirit of supporting the struggle for change by listening to the voices of South African leaders. There will be no legitimate voices in South Africa urging continued economic pressure. How could we in the United States fail to respond in a similar fashion?
Of course, companies will continuously assess their options, but some like Digital Equipment and Lotus have already made the leap. There are now 150 companies with investments in South Africa, and scores of others are drawing up contingency plans for the future.
We expect that the call to lift sanctions will be welcomed by socially concerned investors in the United States, who will put aside past divestment and boycott policies and will instead urge American companies to invest as good citizens, following guidelines that are socially responsible in a South Africa that is free of apartheid.

HEADLINE: Procter & Gamble in 12% Job Cut As Brand Names Lose Attraction

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:
The Procter & Gamble Company, the nation's leading maker of household and personal products, said yesterday that it would reduce its work force by 12 percent within four years as it seeks to cope with consumers' rising preference for less expensive products.
The announcement of cuts in Procter & Gamble's work force, which far exceed Wall Street's expectations, come as the economy has been generating new jobs only grudgingly and companies have been cutting back employment. But while many corporate layoffs have occurred in troubled industries -- from airlines to arms producers -- Procter & Gamble is a healthy company in a profitable industry. 
 As a result, Proctor & Gamble's corporate diet would appear to be a warning to other companies that face diminished loyalty from financially strained customers drawn to a growing array of lower-priced products.
 
 
Company Remains Strong
 The elimination of 13,000 of 102,600 employees around the world might seem jarring, particularly for those affected and the communities where they live. But Procter & Gamble officials said the move was intended to make a strong company stronger and more capable of keeping its leading position among the manufacturers of household consumer products.
More than three-quarters of the items that Procter & Gamble makes -- scores of brands that include Tide detergent, Pampers diapers and Crest toothpaste -- rank first or second in market share in their respective categories.
"In broad terms, it looks as if Procter & Gamble ran up against a clash of pre-existing strategies of creating brand identities and the cyclical developments of the economy at large," said John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers. "With the recession, the subsequent sluggish recovery and only moderate income growth, consumers are being choosy about what they pay for."
The belt-tightening ought to be good for the company, he added, "as it represents a trend toward leaner production costs and smaller margins."
Procter & Gamble, which is based in Cincinnati and operates in 54 countries, said that half of the 13,000 jobs would be eliminated through plant closings. About 30 of its 147 manufacturing plants around the world will be shut down over the next four years.
The other half of the jobs will be lost though a plan to reorganize operations. Company officials said that many of the cuts were aimed at eliminating duplicated jobs and would be achieved through early retirements, buyouts, normal attrition and reduced recruitment. But layoffs are also expected.
Linda Ulrey, a company spokeswoman, said at least 4,000 jobs would be lost from Procter & Gamble's United States work force of 47,500.
While acknowledging that the cuts would be unfortunate for those affected, Edwin L. Artzt, the chairman and chief executive of Procter & Gamble, said the result would be a more efficient and more profitable company.
"The public has come to think of restructuring as a sign of trouble, but this is definitely not our situation," Mr. Artzt said in a statement. "We have a healthy, growing business, a strong balance sheet, positive cash flow, state-of-the-art products and a well-stocked technology pipeline with plenty of opportunities for growth. However, we must slim down to stay competitive."
Earlier this year, when Procter & Gamble first acknowledged the possibility that it might substantially reduce its work force, its intent was lauded by many analysts who follow the company for brokerage firms. Several agreed that inasmuch as Procter & Gamble has achieved hallmark status among consumer product companies for its profitability and brand integrity, the move was shrewdly pro-active.
Now that the cuts have been made formal, some economists suggest that other companies will take comparable ambitious steps.
"That a company is doing well doesn't mean we shouldn't expect to see a reorganization of this sort," said John F. Cogan, an economist who served in the Reagan Administration and is now a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative research organization at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif.
Procter & Gamble did not identify which manufacturing plants would be closed nor all of those where jobs would be cut.
In Cincinnati, where the company is the city's largest employer, with about 14,500 people working at its headquarters and plants, 2,000 jobs will be cut. That follows a decision by the General Electric Company, another big Cincinnati employer, to reduce its work force at an aircraft engine plant by 2,500 this year and by another 1,400 by the end of 1994.
"This is pretty devastating, especially when you read executives of P.&G. telling us how bad we need the North American Free Trade Agreement," said Dan Radford, executive secretary and treasurer of the Cincinnati A.F.L.-C.I.O. Labor Council. "You hate to see a community get hit like this."
Joseph Kramer, vice president of the economic development department of the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce, described the cuts as "certainly a negative," particularly after the region had gained 6,000 jobs in 1992 to offset the loss of an equal number in 1991.
To pay for the changes, Procter & Gamble said a reserve fund of $1.5 billion would be set aside, with $1.2 billion to cover the costs of plant closings and the rest for its reorganization program.
With that $1.5 billion, combined with $925 million to adopt accounting charges for deferred taxes and retiree benefits, which retroactively apply from July 1, 1992, the company said it anticipated a $500 million loss for the fiscal year that ended on June 30.
Even so, the company announced that it would raise the annual rate of its common stock dividend from $1.10 to $1.24 a share, an increase of more than 10 percent.
"These changes will be difficult for some of our employees," Mr. Artzt said. "That's the painful part of these otherwise positive and productive efforts. We will do everything we can to help those employees whose jobs may be changed or lost to relocate within the company or find a new career opportunity."

HEADLINE: L.I. Man Linked to 18 Deaths Pleads Not Guilty to Murder

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., July 15

 BODY:
As relatives of two murder victims linked to Joel Rifkin watched from a packed courtroom today, the unemployed landscaper pleaded not guilty to killing a 22-year-old Manhattan woman whose body was found last month in the back of his pickup truck.
"I am not guilty," Mr. Rifkin said slowly and deliberately at his arraignment here before Judge Ira H. Wexner of Nassau County Court. 
 Mr. Rifkin's statement at his brief appearance was his first public comment since his arrest on June 28, when the authorities say he confessed to killing 17 women over the last three years and dumping their bodies in rivers and woods across the metropolitan area. The state police say they have evidence linking Mr. Rifkin to an 18th victim.
Guarded by a phalanx of court officers, Mr. Rifkin, dressed in a striped shirt and gray pants, stood without expression before Judge Wexner, who ordered that he continue to be held without bail in the Nassau County Jail.
After the arraignment, Mr. Rifkin's lawyer, Robert Sale, said his client's plea meant that despite the confessions the state police said they obtained, Mr. Rifkin "wants to have his day in court."
 
First Murder Charges
 Earlier this week, a grand jury indicted Mr. Rifkin, 34, on second-degree murder charges in the killing of the young Manhattan woman, Tiffany Bresciani. Her body was found wrapped in a tarpaulin in Mr. Rifkin's truck by state troopers who had chased his truck after they noticed that it had no license plate. He was also charged with reckless endangerment because of the chase. The Bresciani case is the first in which Mr. Rifkin has been formally charged.
Among the spectators in the tiny, crowded courtroom were the mothers and a sister of two other women whom the police suspect Mr. Rifkin of killing. Maria Alonso, the mother of Anna Lopez, whose body was found in Putnam County, and Margarita Gonzalez, the mother of Jenny Soto, whose body washed up on the banks of the Harlem River, sat together in the courtroom. As the arraignment ended, Mrs. Gonzalez began to shriek and moan.
Mrs. Gonzalez's daughter told reporters that she and her mother had come to the arraignment to get a glimpse of Mr. Rifkin, "even if it's just for two minutes."
"To me, he's an animal," she said, as her mother dissolved in tears.
As they attempted to leave the Nassau County Courthouse, the crush of television news crews and photographers pressing in on the women became so intense that the Gonzalezes had to flee under the protection of a court officer.
Mr. Sale told reporters that because of the number of jurisdictions involved -- bodies linked to Mr. Rifkin have been found in New York City and Suffolk, Westchester, Orange and Putnam counties -- he was proposing that all the cases against Mr. Rifkin be tried in Nassau County.
 
Single Trial
 "Instead of having multiple trials before multiple juries, we'd have one trial," Mr. Sale said. He said that the various charges in each jurisdiction could be presented before separate juries in the same courtroom. Otherwise, he said, the process of trying Mr. Rifkin could take years.
Fred Klein, the Nassau assistant district attorney handling the Bresciani case, was skeptical of Mr. Sale's proposal for consolidating the cases. "It's highly unusual," Mr. Klein said. "I don't see the other jurisdictions would want to go along with that."
Kevin L. Wright, the Putnam County District Attorney, said prosecutors in all the jurisdictions involved in the case are to meet with Denis E. Dillon, the Nassau County District Attorney, in the next two weeks. But he said there was "little likelihood" of the proposal gaining acceptance.
To try to identify possible victims, the New York State Police released photographs of a woman that were retrieved by investigators from Mr. Rifkin's East Meadow home.
Trooper Thomas R. Collins, a state police spokesman, said his agency had been unable to contact or identify the woman and requested anyone with information to contact the state police.

HEADLINE: Dow Gains 8.38 Points; Other Indicators Off

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

 BODY:
Weakness among oil, drug and technology stocks yesterday drained the momentum from Wednesday's stock market rally, causing most leading indicators to slip slightly.
Only the Dow Jones industrial average posted a gain. After sagging for most of the day, it rose 8.38 to close at 3,550.93, about four points shy of its record high.
 
Nasdaq Falls 3.80 Points
 The Nasdaq composite fell back 3.80 from Wednesday's record closing high, ending at 708.69. The Standard & Poor's Index of 500 stocks fell 0.86, to 449.22, and the American Stock Exchange composite was off 0.69 at 437.98. 
 Trading on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy, at 277 million shares, compared with 297 million shares Wednesday.
"It was kind of a quiet, consolidative day," Robert C. Walberg, equity analyst at MMS Internationa, said. "A little disappointing after yesterday's rally, but we were encouraged by the close." Bargain-hunting late in the day salvaged the Dow, he said.
Mr. Walberg said that given the current low inflation and interest rates, he expected the summer rally to get back on track, with a new record high for the Dow by Monday and a run at the 3,600 level by the end of the month.
With the exception of oil stocks, which fell on continued concern about the low price of crude, most gains and losses yesterday stemmed from actual earnings reports, expectations about earnings reports or rumors about expectations about earnings reports. As for earnings reports so far, Mr. Walberg said, "There has been much more good news than bad."
But bad news has taken a toll. Companies that build computer networking systems for businesses were down sharply yesterday, undercutting the Nasdaq composite.
Synoptics Communications ignited the selloff with its second-quarter report, which showed earnings in line with analysts' expectations but a 2 percentage-point decline in gross profit margin. Its stock fell 6 1/4 a share, to 31 3/4, in Nasdaq trading.
Also in Nasdaq trading, Cisco Systems, another network builder, lost 4 a share to close at 52 1/4; the Chipcom Corporation fell 3 3/4 to close at 46 3/4, and Novell dropped 1 1/4, to 23 1/2.
Drug stocks also took a beating after an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris & Upham lowered her investment opinion of 12 of them because of the growing popularity of generic substitutes and the imminent expiration of several patents. Shares of Merck & Company fell 1, to 33 3/4, and Pfizer shares lost 1 1/2 to close at 63 1/4.
Among stocks that compose the Dow, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing led the gainers, climbing 2 1/4, to 110. It was the company's strongest showing since the shock of its lower-than-expected second-quarter earnings report last month. Investors were probably drawn to the company by the good economic news of the last couple of days, Peter J. Enderlin, managing director of Smith Barney, said.
One of the most active stocks on the New York exchange was a new issue, China Tire Holdings Ltd, a tire manufacturer. The company offered 6.1 million shares at 17 each. The stock closed at 18 after 3.37 million shares changed hands.

HEADLINE: Rising Incomes Suggest Economic Recovery

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
Suggesting that a recovery is finally underway in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, economists at Rutgers University said yesterday that last year personal incomes in all three states rose as fast as in the nation or faster, following three years when they had lagged far behind.
The analysis found that one distinction for the region had not changed -- its workers make more money than their counterparts in most other states. In a ranking of states by per capita incomes for 1992, Connecticut ranked first at $26,979, New Jersey ranked second at $26,457 and New York ranked fourth at $23,534, behind Massachusetts. Nationally incomes averaged $19,841 last year. 
 The economists at Rutgers, New Jersey's largest university, said a shifting pattern of income growth demonstrated that the region's long recession was over, that it was growing more prosperous and that its recovery may be picking up steam.
 
'A Distinct Turnaround'
 "A distinct turnaround in income growth occurred between 1991 and 1992," said the report. The shift, it added, "implies the beginning of an economic rebound."
But the authors of the report, James W. Hughes, a professor of planning, and Joseph J. Seneca, an economist, said one important element of recovery is lacking from the region's economic landscape. While incomes are rising for those who are employed, vast numbers of jobs that were wiped out during the recession are not being restored.
The region may be experiencing "jobless economic growth, where an improving economy coexists with a stagnant labor market," they said. Because computers and advanced telecommunications have permanently eliminated many jobs, and because companies are determined to increase the productivity of the existing workers without additional hiring, the number of jobs in the region may not rebound anytime soon.
"This ominous scenario may well be the key political-economic issue of the era," the report said.
 
Sluggish Population Growth
 And while the region's workers have benefited from a robust increase in earnings, the Rutgers analysis found that overall earnings in the region have lagged behind the national average, even in 1992. It attributed the slow increase to the region's sluggish rate of population growth, which has lagged far behind the national rate, meaning the region's pool of wage earners has also grown slowly.
Still, experts said yesterday that the Rutgers analysis was good news for a region that has been mired in recession for four years.
"It's very encouraging," said Matthew P. Drennan, an economist at Cornell University. He added that the region's fast pace of income growth was an important indication of economic strength because many of the jobs that have been eliminated since 1988 have been among highly paid managers and corporate workers.
The elimination of those jobs might have created a severe drag on income growth across the region, Mr. Drennan said. But because incomes have been rising, "it looks as though new things are replacing the middle-management jobs that have been lost," he added.
In its report, the Rutgers researchers found that per capita incomes in Connecticut rose 3.9 percent in 1992, the same rate as for the nation. New York and New Jersey fared better, with per capita incomes rising 4.3 percent in each state.
 
Paltry Income Gains
 The rate of income gains was paltry compared with the mid-1980's, when the New York region enjoyed an economic boom and when earnings soared in many industries, including construction, securities and law. In 1988, before the recession set in, all three states in the region experienced per capita income increases of 7.7 percent or more, compared with an average of 6.2 percent for the nation.
But from 1988 to 1991, the report said, income gains in the region fell far short of those in most other parts of the nation.
"We had moved from the economic penthouse to the economic basement," the Rutgers researchers said.
In 1991, the report said New Jersey, with a 1.5 percent increase in per capita income, ranked 46th among the states. Connecticut ranked 45th, with a 1.7 percent gain, and New York ranked 34th, with a 2.2 percent gain.

HEADLINE: A Long Wait for a New Life Is Not Quite Over;
For Haitian Refugees Released From Guantanamo, Housing Delay Prolongs Hardship

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE

 BODY:
Etienne Edmont thought for sure that his odyssey from Haiti to the United States would soon be over after he was released four weeks ago from the Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba.
After enduring 20 months of isolation from family and friends under the watchful eyes of armed soldiers, he had expected to move into an apartment in Brooklyn that New York City social workers had shown him two weeks after his arrival. 
 He is still waiting.
"We did not come here to live in a motel," said Mr. Edmont, 30 years old, sitting in the lobby of a motel near Kennedy International Airport where he has been staying. "I thought everything would go fast, but I see that is not the case."
Mr. Edmont, who worked as a money changer on the streets of Port-au-Prince, is one of about 35 Haitian refugees who are still waiting for the housing they were promised after a judge's order forced the United States to free about 200 Haitians from the Guantanamo camp. Most of the 200 had been kept there after being found to have H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. Although city officials say they are moving as fast as they can to help resettle the Haitians, the refugees and their advocates say they feel as if the bureaucracy is moving at a snail's pace.
 
'Yet Another Way Station'
 "This is yet another way station for them," said William Broberg, crisis intervention director at the Coalition for the Homeless, one of several agencies involved in resettling the Haitian refugees.
While the other agencies help resettle refugees with relatives in the New York area who are willing to house them, the Coalition for the Homeless helps to find housing for refugees with no relatives in the area.
While more than 65 of the newest refugees without families have moved into apartments the city found for them, the others remain stranded in the motel because of what Mr. Bromberg described as administrative bungling. In some cases it is a simple matter of the rental checks being issued in the wrong amounts or the name of a refugee being misspelled. The checks then have to be reissued, prolonging the refugees' stay at the motel.
"What makes it worse is that the city is replicating the same thing they went through at Guantanamo," he said. "By keeping them here, it's breeding resentment."
 
'A Moral Obligation'
 Burton Blaustein, deputy commissioner of the Human Resources Administration, rejected the criticism, saying his agency has two Creole-speakers who are working seven days a week to help resettle the Haitians. In the last week, five more Haitians have been moved into apartments.
"Any complaints are way out of line," said Mr. Blaustein "We have a moral obligation to these people who have spent years at Guantanamo and we have bent over backward to help them." But he said he had no estimate on when they would find permanent housing.
The refugees' journey began in September 1991 after a bloody coup that toppled Haiti's president, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Jittery soldiers roamed the streets and valleys of the mountainous country shooting indiscriminately at the populace. Others were marked for death.
Fearing for their lives, more than 40,000 people boarded rickety boats en route to the United States. As boatloads of refugees began to dot the Caribbean sea, the Bush Administration opened Guantanamo as a temporary immigration processing and detention center.
 
Economic Refugees Sent Back
 More than 10,000 were found to have a legitimate claim to file for political asylum. They were sent to the United States over the last two years to continue their asylum appeals. The roughly 200 refugees who had tested positive for H.I.V., or who were their children or spouses, were held at Guantanamo until the court order sent them to the United States four weeks ago. The others were deemed to be economic refugees and sent back to Haiti.
For the refugees still living at the motel, surrounded by the constant roar from airplanes overhead and drone of cars on the Belt Parkway, the uncertainty of their home is consistent with the constant state of flux since they were first detained at Guantanamo.
Some pass the days playing dominoes. Others smoke and listen to music from portable radios while others stroll around the neighborhood. There are no parties and no celebrations.
They eat a small breakfast of eggs and bacon in the motel's restaurant. But rice and beans and Creole-spiced meat are delivered by Haitian restaurants to the motel during lunch and dinner. The Coalition for the Homeless pays for the meals.
"We thank the Government for delivering us from the jail at Guantanamo, but our situation right now is still unchanged," Mr. Edmont said.
Another refugee at the motel, 28-year-old Donald Dupre, added: "I just want to be somewhere I can relax. It's been a long time."
 
Labeled by Fear of AIDS
 Complicating their existence, though, is the stigma of having H.I.V. Many of the 200 refugees say they are not sick because they have yet to show any symptoms common to patients with full-fledged AIDS.
"I want to be tested by an independent doctor," said Lionel Charles, 27, "Until then, I don't know."
But Widmayer Jean, 29, who spent 14 months at Guantanamo, was more strident. "It's purely political," he said. "I don't have AIDS. No one has ever given me any medications." Federal officials say that all the diagnoses were made in medical tests at Guantanamo.
As the refugees struggled to resume their lives in New York, those interviewed said they are still haunted by their stay at Guantanamo.
Because of the diagnosis of H.I.V., the refugees were isolated from the others and taken to a remote area of Guantanamo. There, they said, they shared their sleeping quarters with rats, snakes and other animals.
It was because of these conditions that last month a Federal judge in Brooklyn, Sterling Johnson Jr., called their confinement "a squalid H.I.V. camp" and ordered their release, effectively closing the refugee camp.
 
Doctors' Snubs Recalled
 The refugees said that doctors refused to shake their hands and wore gloves and surgical masks during the slightest contacts. They were kept under the constant watch of armed soldiers. And they said their living quarters were as bare as the arid mountains that surrounded the camp.
So they staged hunger strikes. They set fire twice to the tents, and the adults stopped participating in any organized activities. Four refugees tried to commit suicide by hanging themselves with sheets.
"It was like they put us somewhere and waited for us to die," said Mr. Jean, a refugee who is now living with his wife and sister-in-law in Brooklyn.
Mr. Charles, like some other refugees, said he would like to put the experience behind him and resume his life here.
"At least I was alive," he said waiting for his luggage at La Guardia Airport after his arrival last month. "If I was in Haiti, I would have been killed."
Since arriving in New York, Mr. Charles, who lives in Jamaica, Queens, with his sister, says he is awed by the subway and the teeming Manhattan skyline dotted by glass and steel buildings.
He said he hopes to get a job, save some money and eventually attend college and study law.
"I know that this place can provide a lot of opportunity and I would like to take my chances," he said. But with the national uneasiness over immigrants, opportunities may be few for the other refugees.
Mr. Edmont, who left his wife and three children in Haiti, along with 12 brothers and sisters, says he just wants to settle into an apartment so he can start working and sending money back home.
"I will do anything," he said. "My problems are big."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Rally Shows Market Adapting to Weak Economy

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Two truths about the continuing bond rally have been overlooked -- and may give its outlook a different shading.
Attention has been focused mainly on the positive news on inflation, which has been seen as the force driving down the yield on the closely watched 30-year bond. Its yield was unchanged yesterday at 6.56 percent, its lowest level in 16 years. 
 But another factor deserves as much credit for the downward swing: the growing belief that the economy, rather than recovering, is going to continue to be sluggish.
 
 
No Longer the Bellwether
 And the rally may have focused too much attention on the 30-year bond as an indicator of where interest rates are headed. This attention may in itself be misguided. The 30-year bond, for many traders, is no longer the bellwether of the $2.3-trillion-a-day Government securities market. And it will be less so when the Treasury begins to slash its regular auctions of 30-year bonds this fall.
The push to lower interest rates based on expectations of continuing weak economic growth will only be strengthened if the Administration wins approval for its deficit-reduction plan. The deficit plan includes major tax increases, which should be a drag on the economy. Also down the road is the Administration's health-care plan, which is likely to include even more tax increases.
For many forecasters, this means that interest rates will be moving lower even if the inflation reports over the next several months are good but not as sparkling as those for the last two months. But if inflation remains stable and economic data show that the economy is growing faster than expected, the bond market rally may run into trouble because of the prospects of higher prices in the future.
Neal M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation, said the expectation of slow growth had been a key element in the recent bond rally. "If you had a vision of an economy solidly grounded, even if inflation rates were moderate now, you would be truly fearful down the road," he said.
 
 
Not-So-Great Expectations
 Because the bond market is now counting on sluggish growth, any effort by the Clinton Administration to spur the economy, such as tinkering with the deficit-reduction package, can disturb the rally.
As for the role of the 30-year bond, its yield is still followed closely and quoted often. But the 10-year note is a better reflection of the long-term rates that affect the economy because it is a guidepost for mortgages.
Most bond traders also watch the 5- and 10-year notes. The notes are traded more actively, are used in hedging strategies and are bought heavily by cities and towns that are paying off older, higher interest-rate loans with new low interest-rate borrowing.
"For market participants, the five-year note is the bellwether," said William Pike, managing director at Chemical Securities, a primary dealer. "It comes more often," he said, referring to the regular monthly Treasury auctions, "and it is traded by more people."
The 30-year bond does not even offer a good comparison with interest rates in other countries, where 10-year maturities are typical.
These factors have eroded the bellwether status of the 30-year bond for some time. What will challenge its role even further is the Treasury's decision to cut the amount it issues by 40 percent and to hold two auctions a year instead of four.
These changes could make movements in yields and prices of the long bond more subject to extraneous factors, like supply, instead of economic fundamentals.
 
 
Effect of Supply
 "It is possible that supply considerations could exaggerate the fall in long-term rates, but I wouldn't expect them to be large," said John Lipsky, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers.
John P. Costas, the managing director of trading at the First Boston Corporation, summed up the status of the bond this way: "It is still the bellwether because it is the most often quoted. But it's not representative of what is going on in the market."
After the next Treasury auction in August, "it is going to be interesting to watch what happens," he added.
There will then be a six-month span with no new 30-year bonds sold. No one is sure how the bond and the market will react to such a new trading environment.
 
Treasury Market
 There was little action in the Treasury market yesterday as traders and investors took a breather after the positive reports on inflation that came out on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The price of the 30-year bond was unchanged. Prices on Treasury notes were little changed, including the 10-year note, whose yield remained unchanged at 5.70 percent.
In the municipal market, the Puerto Rico Highway and Transportation Authority sold almost $1.2 billion in tax-exempt bonds, the second-largest municipal issue of the year. The lead underwriter was Merrill Lynch & Company.
Yields on the longer-term bonds ranged from 5.70 percent in 2017 to 5.72 percent in 2021. The issue also included about $370 million in specially designed products called derivatives, which can offer a higher yield to the buyer but come with a lot more risk.
Among these products are inverse floaters, which allow the buyer to make more in interest if short-term interest rates remain steady or fall. But if they rise, the investor's return declines.

HEADLINE: Report Suggests Ledyard Casino Is Among the Most Profitable

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LEDYARD, Conn., July 15

 BODY:
The Foxwoods High Stakes Bingo and Casino may be the most profitable casino in the country, according to a newspaper report today.
The Day newspaper of New London said it had obtained a financial statement showing that the casino had a $20.4 million profit in June. That is as much as some large casinos clear in an entire year. 
 Foxwoods's total revenue, including money made at table games, slot machines, bingo, restaurants and stores, was $40.8 million last month. That ranks Foxwoods among the largest casinos in Nevada and New Jersey in terms of the money spent and lost by customers.
 
Low Expenses
 With relatively low operating expenses of $19.1 million for June, according to the report, Foxwoods is far more profitable, in terms of both total profit and profit margin, say industry analysts.
"The numbers are incredible," said Marvin B. Roffman of Roffman-Miller Associates of Philadelphia, when told of the June revenue report. "This reservation has a license to coin money."
The Mashantucket Pequot Indians decline to discuss how much the casino is making, saying they prefer to keep their finances private.
William Eadington, a professor of economics at the University of Nevada-Reno who specializes in gambling issues, said that based on the June report, gambling revenues for the year at Foxwoods could be $400 million or more. That would place it among the country's largest casinos, like the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City and Mirage Resorts in Las Vegas.
But the operating expenses for those casinos is much higher, he said, largely because they have high debts from money borrowed to build them. The Mirage, for instance, had gambling revenues of $409 million in 1990, its opening year, but its annual pretax profit was just $30 million.
Mr. Roffman said that if the report is true, Foxwoods keeps as profit about half of every dollar it takes in as revenue.
That 50 percent margin compares with 30 percent or less for a huge operation like the Las Vegas-based Circus Circus, which is considered a carefully managed company, Mr. Roffman said. Many other operators have margins of 15 percent or less.

HEADLINE: A Report Sees Legislative Perils to S.& L.'s

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
Legislation intended to complete the cleanup of the savings-and-loan industry might instead drive the remaining institutions out of business, according to a new report to Congress.
The report, written by an industry advisory committee and endorsed by top officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said the savings and loan industry would be unable to compete with banks if, as legislation pending in the House required, insurance premiums paid by the industry were made the main source of financing for a Federal fund that would insure deposits in the surviving S.& L.'s. 
 The bill has been passed by the Senate. In seeking to write a politically viable bill, lawmakers stripped away most taxpayer financing for the insurance fund, leaving the financial industry with the costs.
House Democratic leaders are now struggling to find enough votes to pass the bill, which has few avid supporters. A vote has been delayed, and the report could make the task even harder, said Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, a senior member of the House Banking Committee, which received the report on Tuesday.
The House panel says that the Senate-passed version must be changed to avoid a potentially lethal crisis.
 
Continuing Reluctance to Tax
 The Senate's version would provide $26.8 billion for the S.& L. cleanup, and the bill before the House, $34.3 billion. Both versions restrict the use of tax money for the new Savings Association Insurance Fund, with the House bill being especially restrictive. The fund, created in previous banking legislation, is to begin operations in October, when the Resolution Trust Corporation ceases taking over failed savings and loans.
But Congress declined last year to provide new money for either the R.T.C. or the insurance fund, and the costs of the unresolved savings and loan debacle continue to mount.
The new report, submitted to the House and Senate Banking Committees, was written by an expert panel established in 1989 when Congress passed the law to begin cleaning up the savings and loan industry.
The committee based its report on data from the F.D.I.C., which predicted a large gap between the premiums that would be paid by the surviving savings and loans and the lower ones to be paid by banks, a disparity the committee said would put the savings and loans at a potentially fatal competitive disadvantage. The F.D.I.C., the Federal bank insurance fund, is not saddled with S.& L. costs from the 80's, so its premiums are declining even as the banking industry returns to health.
The committee is made up of economists and savings-and-loan industry officials, and it reflects concerns about the legislation that have been festering in the industry for months.
The report is the first detailed analysis of how the proposed legislation would affect the industry. The committee said it was "staggered" when the F.D.I.C. predicted at a briefing on July 1 how much lower bank premiums would be than those paid by the savings and loans.
Steven A. Seelig, the F.D.I.C.'s chief financial officer, says there is a risk that the savings and loan industry, as it now exists, may virtually disappear if the financing legislation is enacted without changes.
Frank N. Newman, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance, said in an interview that the F.D.I.C.'s projections were "a worst-case scenario" and that the Clinton Administration hoped the House would move swiftly to enact the bill so that the R.T.C. and the new fund could operate as intended.
But the committee said it was unrealistic to think that the Resolution Trust Corporation could finish taking over the weakest remaining institutions by Sept. 30, when the new fund is to assume responsibility. It called for a one-year extension of R.T.C. responsibility, a step neither the House nor the Senate is now considering.
The report's main long-term recommendation is that the legislation be altered to absolve the new insurance fund from a $770 million annual cost of paying interest on long-term bonds issued in 1989 to begin the S.& L. cleanup. It recommended this instead be paid from tax revenue.

HEADLINE: Business Sales Up 0.3%; Inventories Grow 0.2%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
Business sales grew three-tenths of a percent in May, the Government reported today, outpacing a modest two-tenths of a percent gain in inventories and assuring analysts that stockpiles were being held in check.
"There are some pockets of problems," said Michael P. Niemira, an economist at the Mitsubishi Bank in New York, "but they're within the retail component, and even there it's not universal. Over all, there's no inventory problem at all." 
 Mr. Niemira said the inventory growth reported by the Commerce Department was consistent with the slow-growth economy.
 
Unemployment Claims Up
 Also illustrating the sluggish economy was a Labor Department report today showing that new claims for jobless benefits edged up 2,000 last week, to 334,000.
Still, the less volatile four-week moving average of jobless claims, which analysts prefer to track because it more accurately reflects the labor situation, fell 2,750, to 339,000, in the period ended last week -- the lowest level in five months.
The Commerce Department said business sales totaled a seasonally adjusted $586.89 billion in May, up from $584.94 billion a month earlier. April's sales, originally estimated to have fallen two-tenths of a percent, were revised to a two-tenths of a percent gain.
Inventories totaled a seasonally adjusted $864.27 billion, up from $862.48 billion in April and the eighth straight increase. The April advance, however, was revised to four-tenths of a percent from tenth of a percent in the initial report.
The difference between inventories and sales resulted in an inventory-to-sales ratio of 1.47, meaning that it would take 1.47 months to exhaust stockpiles at the May sales pace. Analysts said the ratio was not seriously high.
A high ratio could lead to production cuts and job losses as businesses reduce orders to shrink inventories.
Retail inventories were unchanged in May after growing five-tenths of a percent a month earlier. Stocks on both the factory and wholesale levels rose three-tenths of a percent.
Retail sales grew four-tenths of a percent in May, and in an advance estimate on Wednesday, the department reported that sales again rose four-tenths of a percent in June. May sales originally were estimated to be up just a tenth of a percent.
Factory sales fell five-tenths of a percent in May, but sales at the wholesale level jumped 1.7 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises on Uncertainty On the Exchanges in Europe

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most major currencies yesterday amid turmoil in the European markets.
Gold prices also rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the actively traded gold contract for August delivery settled at $393.90 an ounce, up $2.50. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for spot gold of $393.10 an ounce, up $2.10. 
 The dollar thrived on the rumors and realities of currency intervention and uncertainty in Europe. "It's really been focused on the troubles in Europe at the moment," said Amy Smith, a market strategist for the IDEA economic consulting group.
There were rumors in the morning, ultimately unfounded, that the Danish Government was going to devalue its currency. That set the stage for extreme selling of the currency, Mr. Smith said.
 
Rumor on Repo Rate
 That in turn gave rise to unfounded rumors that the German Bundesbank was going to lower its repo rate, or the rate for repurchasing money market securities, as a way to supply banks short of cash with fresh money.
"That was the rumor that sent the dollar higher," Mr. Smith said. "There's always attraction for the dollar whenever there is chaos in the world."
Other action showing the weakness of European currencies included the interventions by the Dutch and Danish central banks to support their currencies. They both bought the Danish krone and sold the Dutch guilder.
Andrew Hodge, a vice president at Bank Brussels Lambert, agreed that the uncertainty over European currencies helped the dollar. "Once the panic subsides, the dollar will correct down," he said.
He noted that the the central banks of France and Germany were subtly trying to bolster their currencies by quietly adjusting overnight interest rates.
In New York, the dollar traded late at 108.01 Japanese yen, up from 107.10 yen late Wednesday. It was also quoted at 1.7205 German marks, up from 1.7150 marks on Wednesday, and 5.8805 French francs, up from 5.8565 francs. The British pound was quoted at $1.4915, down from $1.5035 late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Iraq Oil Sale Talks to Resume But a Critical Issue Remains

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 15

 BODY:
Diplomats agreed today to resume talks next week for a draft agreement on allowing Iraq to sell limited quantities of oil, but failed to address the crucial issue of whether Iraq would ship oil through its own terminal or its pipeline to Turkey.
The talks, which began on July 7, were suspended late Wednesday so the Iraqi delegation could seek further instructions from Baghdad. 
 "There wasn't even language on that point in the draft," one diplomat said, referring to the shipping issue.
Riyadh al-Qaysi, Iraq's Under Secretary in the Foreign Ministry, said that "we have reached a stage in the negotiating process where some questions arose."
A United Nations spokesman, Joe Sills, said the talks would resume "perhaps at the beginning of the week" but gave no date.
 
U.N. Seeks Close Supervision
 The United Nations, which imposed sanctions on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, wants Baghdad to sell limited amounts of oil under close supervision. Money from the sale would be used for food and medicine, including supplies for Kurds who are supported by United Nations agencies, as well as for other United Nations costs and for reparations to victims of Iraqi forces.
Baghdad has asserted that the monitoring is too intrusive and demands that most of its oil be shipped through its gulf port of Mina al-Bakr rather than through its pipeline to Turkey. Diplomats say they believe that the United States and Britain want at least 80 percent of the oil shipped through Turkey, where it would be easier to monitor.
The limited oil sale of $1.6 billion was demanded by the Security Council and is separate from easing or lifting the trade embargo that would allow oil to flow freely. Any broad agreement between the Iraqi and United Nations negotiators would require approval by Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and the Security Council.
 
Washington's View
 And Washington might decide against the oil sale because it could be seen as making life easier for President Saddam Hussein and give Iraq an opening into the market when there is a world glut in oil production.
Iraq would prefer that the oil embargo be lifted entirely without restrictions, but this depends on certification from United Nations officials that Baghdad has complied with Persian Gulf war cease-fire resolutions to destroy its most dangerous weapons. But Western powers want full compliance with all relevant resolutions before lifting sanctions.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Talks on Arms Standoff
 BAGHDAD, Iraq , July 15 (Reuters) -- The chief United Nations weapons inspector for Iraq, Rolf Ekeus, and Foreign Minister Mohammed Said al-Sahaf met for two hours today in an effort to resolve a dispute over the monitoring of missile testing in Iraq.
"I can only say that we have initiated talks and that they will continue," Mr. Ekeus said after leaving the Foreign Ministry. Mr. Sahaf is to meet again on Friday with Mr. Ekeus, who heads a special commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's most dangerous weapons under terms of the Persian Gulf war cease-fire.
Before today's meeting, Iraq issued a statement saying it was not certain that Mr. Ekeus had come with good intentions.
"This is not yet clear," Information Minister Hamed Youssef Hammadi told the official Iraqi News Agency when asked whether Mr. Ekeus had come to talk or to pave the way for an attack on Iraq. "He himself has created this problem at a time when Iraq started dialogue with the United Nations. It is our opinion that raising the issue of installing the cameras was deliberately aimed at undermining this dialogue."
 
Monitoring Ordered
 Last month, the Security Council ordered Iraq to allow inspectors to place monitoring cameras at two missile-test sites south of Baghdad or risk the threat of retaliation. The Council wants to monitor the sites, where Iraq is allowed to test short-range missiles, to insure the Government does not resume building longer-range weapons that are prohibited under the cease-fire.
Heightening the tension, Washington raised the threat of a military strike after Iraq barred United Nations officials from sealing off the test sites as a temporary measure last week.
Iraq, which has accused the United Nations of changing the rules, says the organization must lift the sanctions now because Iraq has cooperated in destroying its weapons programs. But the United Nations says Baghdad must immediately accept long-term monitoring.

HEADLINE: London Journal;
Will Minicab Force the Mighty Taxi Off the Road?

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, July 15

 BODY:
Waiting for his next fare just off Victoria Street the other day, Robert McDonald reminisced about the good old days of driving a cab in London.
"I was proud of my badge," Mr. McDonald said, referring to the license he was granted in 1959 after two grueling years bicycling around doing "the Knowledge," the intensive study of how best to get from point to point in London through a maze of more than 15,000 streets. 
 "I used to take people all around town, especially Americans, and show them the sights, and I could tell them all about London," Mr. McDonald said, sitting behind the wheel of one of the black taxis that have long been as much a symbol of London as Big Ben. "They loved it. Today? Today, it's no fun anymore."
London's taxi drivers retain their reputation for being among the world's most reliable. But Mr. McDonald and his 22,000 fellow drivers face the biggest upheaval in the London taxi trade since cars replaced horse-drawn carriages. If the more pessimistic among them are to be believed, the end could perhaps be near for the black cab itself.
 
The Agent of Change
 The unhappiness of the drivers is to some extent a function of Britain's poor economy, which has bitten deeply into their business. But the real agent of change is the minicab, the unlicensed competitor to the highly regulated black taxis. The minicabs first went on to London's streets in the early 60's, raising the threat even then of giving the standard black taxi a run for its money.
As their ranks have swelled, minicab drivers have increasingly been charged with crimes against passengers, particularly women traveling at night. Investigations have found many of them to lack proper insurance and to be driving unsafe vehicles (most minicabs are family sedans with no modifications). The police say many of the drivers are men who are otherwise unemployed, who are violating welfare regulations by working.
There are now at least 40,000 minicabs operating in the metropolis, and if their drivers might sometimes seem to have difficulty finding Buckingham Palace without a map, they have nonetheless become widely used.
Barred from plying for passengers on the street, minicab services respond speedily to telephone requests for pickups, particularly late at night or in outlying areas where few black taxis are to be found. Their fares vary widely and are often cheaper than those of licensed taxis.
At a time when competition for passengers is intense, some minicabs have infuriated their counterparts in black taxis by illegally seeking out passengers at railroad stations, hotels and nightclubs, leading to a growing number of street fights between licensed and unlicensed drivers.
Under pressure to rein in the minicabs and better protect their passengers, the Government is trying to develop a new system of regulation to cover both the traditional taxis and their new rivals.
Drivers of black taxis would like to see a single licensing standard, which would presumably be difficult if not impossible for most minicabs to meet. The solution most widely discussed so far, however, is to license the minicabs and their drivers, but not require them to meet the same standards as black taxis for training and for vehicle size and safety.
That type of two-tier licensing program is generally supported by the legitimate minicab companies, who say they want the business cleaned up in a way that would not put them out of business, and by consumer groups supporting passenger safety.
Such proposals, though, have left drivers of traditional cabs increasingly convinced that there will soon be no competitive benefit in the practices that have always set them apart: investing two years in doing the Knowledge, and then investing $33,000, twice the cost of a family car, in a vehicle whose specifications to this day reflect considerations like the required headroom for a gentleman in a top hat.
"We're a tradition then, aren't we?" said Charles Aylott, another driver, who was chatting with Mr. McDonald. "And like everything else, the Government's throwing it away."
The changes affecting the taxis come at an unsettled time for other forms of transportation in London. The red double-decker buses, for example, are starting to fade away as new private operators begin to introduce buses of different colors.
Steven Norris, the Minister of Transport for London, said he had not yet made a decision on a new regulatory plan. He said he would lay out the specific alternatives this summer for public debate as the first step toward developing whatever new regulations and laws might be needed.
Some drivers said that whatever decision Mr. Norris makes, it would be foolish of them not to recognize that the business is changing and that they will have to change with it. One change that drivers appear likely to consider is scrapping the traditional taxi vehicle.
 
'London Taxi Has Got to Go'
 Jim Wells, the chairman of the London Cab Driver's Club, said the cost of buying and maintaining the two current models of the traditional vehicles -- one introduced in 1958, the other in 1987 -- had got out of hand.
"The London taxi has got to go," Mr. Wells said, noting that drivers often pay several thousand dollars a year in upkeep on their taxis. "It's too old-fashioned, there are too many problems with it and it's ridiculous to keep trying to bring a vehicle designed for 1958 up to 1993 standards."
"The real old bangers don't want to change," Mr. Wells continued. "But we have to be realistic. The passengers we pick up are not prepared to pay more in fares, so we have to find ways to cut costs, and the vehicle is the obvious place to look."

HEADLINE: Clinton Is Said to Accept Parts of Plan on Gay Ban

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
President Clinton has decided to accept in large measure Defense Secretary Les Aspin's proposal for a limited lifting of restrictions on homosexuals in the military, but last-minute work is continuing to answer legal questions raised by Attorney General Janet Reno, Administration officials said tonight.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Aspin met for more than two hours tonight as the Defense Secretary formally submitted his recommendation for a policy that would drop the military's current ban on homosexuals but limit how open they could be about their sexuality, the officials said. 
 One official said Mr. Clinton had decided to adopt Mr. Aspin's essential "don't ask, don't tell" approach but was seeking "refinements" that would make it somewhat less restrictive and would heed warnings from Ms. Reno that the policy could violate gay soldiers' Constitutional rights.
 
Deadline Set in January
 Today was the date set by Mr. Clinton in January when, faced with strong opposition from the military and in Congress, he delayed his plan to lift the ban and asked for a new proposal.
But Mr. Clinton told Congressional leaders this afternoon that he wanted to take two or three more days to study the recommendation before he gave his final approval. He also wants Attorney General Reno and her aides to review it once more before he signs off on it, officials said.
A senior Administration official characterized the Aspin compromise as a policy of "don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue." What that means is that new recruits would no longer be asked whether they are gay. But they would not be allowed to identify themselves as homosexuals once in the armed services, except to chaplains, doctors and lawyers. Homosexual conduct on or off base would still be prohibited.
 
Legal Concerns
 But in deference to the Justice Department and homosexual rights groups, the policy would also explicitly spell out the conditions under which the military could pursue an investigation into homosexual conduct.
Aides to Mr. Clinton and Mr. Aspin were working tonight on these particulars, which were apparently added after Ms. Reno told the White House last week that the policy could be hard to defend in court. Officials said she cautioned that the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law could be violated if the policy went too far in prohibiting homosexuals from saying things that heterosexual soldiers were free to express. Her role in the discussion was disclosed today in The Baltimore Sun.
Under the policy, a homosexual soldier who was seen going into a gay bar or gay church could not be investigated on those grounds alone. There would have to be "credible evidence" of either an acknowledgement of a homosexual orientation or homosexual behavior, and just going into a building would not constitute that.
This notion of "don't pursue" as a way of creating a little room for homosexuals in the military to express their sexual orientation more freely outside military bases was pushed by the President on Wednesday night in discussions with Secretary Aspin, who went over it today with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Justice Department lawyers.
For the past few weeks, Secretary Aspin has been holding discussions with the Joint Chiefs, the Justice Department and the White House, trying to identify as many of these situations as possible so the recommended policy will make it clear to the President precisely what would and what would not lead to an investigation.
 
Leaving Room
 "What everyone wants to avoid is giving room for a homophobic commander to go around launching investigations of homosexual conduct wherever he feels like," said a senior Administration official. "We also want to avoid stimulating vigilante squads who will post themselves outside of gay bars and churches, filming everyone who goes in because they think that will trigger an investigation.
"But we also want to avoid giving license for someone to go up to their commanding officer and say, 'I'm gay, and I want everyone here to know that,' " the official said.
White House officials said that approach had won the general assent of the Attorney General, but Ms. Reno's office would not comment. Ms. Reno, who seemed to be trying to play down her role in any compromise, said late today: "All we're doing it is reviewing it to make sure that we are giving the best advice to the President."
White House officials acknowledged that the compromise would fall well short of the President's campaign promise to lift the ban on homosexuals unconditionally, as long as they did not engage in open homosexual conduct.
But White House officials said Mr. Aspin's formulation was all they believed they could achieve politically at a time when a bipartisan conservative coalition in Congress has threatened to write a homosexual ban into law if the President opens the military doors too wide. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have also resisted efforts to lift the ban.
 
Avoiding a Fight
 Because the President wants to focus on his economic package, the White House wants to avoid a political battle on the issue of homosexuals in the military.
Mr. Aspin has told White House officials that the Joints Chiefs of Staff will only accept a policy that would allow homosexuals to serve only if they abstained from public or private declarations of their sexual orientation, leaders of gay rights groups have said.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff voted two weeks ago for a policy that would retain the current statement that "homosexuality is incompatible with military service." But Secretary Aspin has apparently managed to persuade the chiefs to accept different wording that describes "homosexual conduct," not homosexual orientation, as incompatible with military service.
The administration has set an implementation date of Oct. 1 for the new policy.

HEADLINE: THE MIDWEST FLOODING: The Continuing Struggle;
Digging Out in Face of a New Threat

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST DES MOINES, Iowa, July 15

 BODY:
The weather forecast today scared Jill Downing like a nightmare: Rain is expected this weekend and it could bring more flooding. On Saturday, high water forced 3,500 people here from their homes.
Ms. Downing is the manager of special events in the Valley Junction section of this town, a district of antique, craft and art shops and family restaurants built on faith and life savings. On Saturday, the district was consumed by flood water and is only now beginning to clean up its buildings and raise people's spirits. 
 Today, dozens of business owners and employees tore out flood-soaked walls, pulled up ruined carpets and wiped away tears, as the sight of the damage was almost too much for some to take.
Still, it was Ms. Downing's duty to walk the muddy streets and warn people that maybe they should stop rushing to rebuild their lives just yet because the river might be back.
 
'You Want to Deny'
 "Our feeling is we don't want them to clear up now and have to do it all over again," she said. "That could be too much. But people are reacting to this almost like a death, you want to deny it's happened or that it could happen again."
But there is reason to hope that the worst is over. The Raccoon River, which sent flood waters six blocks into Valley Junction, has dropped eight feet since sodden Saturday, and people here said they were willing to take a chance that more misery would pass them by.
"We have to reopen," said Craig Laws, who runs a restaurant, his brow dripping with sweat as he scrubbed the mud and slime from a table. "We have to survive, so I'm going to take my chances. I just don't think lightning is going to strike twice in the same place in less than a week."
And besides, Mr. Laws and his neighbors are tired of being pushed around by a river, of living with friends in cramped apartments miles away, of storing their belongings in three or four different places, of hearing their children cry, of watching their businesses and jobs die.
So they have returned with their hammers and crowbars, their rubber gloves and tetanus shots.
 
A Life Turned Around
 LueVeda Lau has returned because she is no stranger to hard times. She lost a job after 25 years and used her retirement money to open her restaurant and dress shop two years ago.
"I took my hurt then and turned it into a business," she said. "I don't know what I'm going to do with this new hurt."
Donna Martin, the owner of Donna's Dolls, a clothing and craft shop, is also back, offering a cool drink to a visitor who wants to know how it feels to lose so much so fast.
"The Lord only gives you what he knows you can handle," she said, standing in her store, ruined by the flood. "But I don't know how he figured it out."
And Russ Leckband hurried back, too. He spent today tearing down a wall at his mother-in-law's flood ravaged arts and crafts shop.
"You can't look at the whole picture because that will overwhelm you," he said. "You have to rebuild board by board, nail by nail."
Cleaning up will not be easy, even if the weather spares the city.
Unlike its big sister, Des Moines, this suburb of 37,000 residents does have running water. But people from all over the area have flocked here to use it and officials have placed strict controls on its use.
Next door in Des Moines, Mayor John (Pat) Dorrain said water for bathing and fire fighting should be running through the city's pipes on Sunday or Monday.
But the water will not be safe to drink for several more weeks and officials said they thought the levee at the city's crippled water plant had been built high enough to protect it in the event of another flood.
Today, Mayor Dorrain again ordered businesses in the city not to reopen until the water service was restored.
 
Lawn-Waterer Cut Off
 People in West Des Moines are prohibited from using city water to clean up their businesses until Des Moines can restore its water system on either Sunday or Monday. The other day, the city disconnected the water of a man who refused to stop watering his lawn.
"Until this crisis is over," said the fire chief, Randy Bracken, "he's going to be like Des Moines: no more water."
To clean the half-inch of muck on the floor of his antique furniture restoration business on Fifth Street, Jack Mendrys and his employees, Roger Vriezelaar and Mike Limke, brought up flood water still sloshing around in the basement.
"I'm 46 today," Mr. Mendrys said. "Tomorrow, I'll be 50 and I'll be older the next day. We're going to be out of business for at least 60 days."
The flood's timing caught many here off guard. At a town meeting on Friday, city officials said the river would crest on Monday or Tuesday, giving people time to empty their businesses. They based their warning on the forecasts of the National Weather Service.
"Then our two-day warning turned into 12 hours," Mr. Mendrys said, adding that city officials told people on Saturday morning that the predictions had changed and trouble would arrive around dusk.
Now, Mr. Mendrys and his employees will spend the next two months working without pay. He said he hoped the promised Federal money would be available soon, but he had little faith that the Government could take a breath in less than six months. He said the Federal Government had been discussing improving the levee system for the Raccoon River for more than 20 years.
"It takes them a long time to do anything," he said.
Construction on a $20 million levee project is scheduled to begin this fall because the Raccoon River had flooded this town before. The last time was in 1990, but then the water did not rise as far or as fast.
Mr. Limke, who has worked at Mr. Mendry's shop for five years, owns a home a few blocks away. At 7:50 P.M. Saturday, his property was dry. By 8:10 P.M., water was at his back door.
"The water sounded like someone was trying to break into the house with a bulldozer," he said.
With a plastic bag of clothes over his head, Mr. Limke fled, like thousands of other here, many of whom still have not returned. People started returning Wednesday.
Craig Webber never left. Mr. Webber, a 39-year-old construction worker, spent the entire flood in his house, surrounded by three feet of water. He slept on top of his kitchen table. He fell asleep at night to the sound of about six inches of water rippling on the floor.
When he needed supplies, he rowed to get them in his rubber raft. Today, he was trying to get the water out of his basement with a bucket. "These floods don't scare me," Mr. Webber said. "I had a ladder; I was ready to go up on my roof."
But he sent his two teen-age daughters and his 78-year-old mother to stay with relatives.
"I didn't want to have to worry about them swimming out," he said.
 
Clinton Seeking More Flood Aid
 DES MOINES, July 15 (Reuters) -- President Clinton is seeking an additional $2.47 billion in Federal aid to help flood victims in the Midwest. The request includes the following:
 *$800 million for the Federal Emergency Management Agency for individual and public relief grants and contingency funds.
*$945 million for the Department of Agriculture, of which $900 would be earmarked to help cover crop losses. The rest would be used to finance soil conservation and flood prevention efforts. This is on top of $400 million already budgeted.
*$300 million in Small Business Administration loans.
 *$153 million for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, most of which would be used as contingency funds for disaster related community development and low-income housing rebuilding.
*$100 million in contingency funds to the Commerce Department for economic development.
*$100 million to finance highway repairs.
*$65 million to the Army Corps of Engineers to finance flood control works repairs.

HEADLINE: Poll Says Conservatives Dominate Talk Radio

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
The talk radio and call-in programs that have become a potent force in national politics distort public opinion because people heard on those shows are far more conservative than the general population, a poll released today concludes.
The survey, by the Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press, found that talk shows, like telephone calls and letters to elected officials, are dominated by a "vocal minority" composed largely of Republicans who are more critical of President Clinton's overall job performance and economic program, and are more hostile to him personally than most people. 
 Mr. Clinton's disapproval rating, which the poll put at 43 percent, was 10 to 15 percentage points higher among people who had talked on the radio, written their Congressional representatives or responded to call-in polls.
The survey's findings suggest that in gauging public opinion, news organizations and politicians have put too much emphasis on the views of a very active, very loud and often very angry minority.
Almost half of all Americans listen to talk radio fairly often, the survey said, with one in six listening regularly. Eleven percent said they had tried to call into a radio program, and 6 percent said they succeeded in getting on a call-in program.
Of those who consider themselves regular listeners, 24 percent identified themselves as conservatives, and 11 percent as liberals.
The survey is based on telephone interviews with 1,507 adults nationwide, conducted May 18 to May 24 under the direction of Princeton Survey Research Associations. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus three percentage points.
The most striking difference between people who aggressively express their views on call-in shows and other forums and those who do not are in how they judge Mr. Clinton.
Asked about how they viewed President Clinton personally, 35 percent of the general public said they had an unfavorable opinion, while 49 percent of the talk-radio callers registered an unfavorable opinion.

HEADLINE: THE MIDWEST FLOODING: The Federal Aid;
Clinton Saying Flood Relief Will Cover Just Part of Loss

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
President Clinton sought today to quell any hopes that the Federal Government alone could bear the full cost of relief for all of the damage caused by the Midwestern floods.
As his Administration's own estimates of the damage swelled to $8 billion, Mr. Clinton did say he might have to seek an increase in the $2.5 billion in immediate assistance he had requested from Congress on Wednesday. But he made clear it that he was not contemplating aid on a wider scale. 
 "The Federal Government has never compensated natural disasters dollar for dollar for every kind of disaster loss," the President said this afternoon. He said some costs would have to be borne by local governments, private sources and the victims themselves, as has often been the case in earlier disasters, including the hurricane that hit Florida last summer.
Mr. Clinton spoke after meeting on Capitol Hill with lawmakers from the eight states stricken by floods. Some, including Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, had said Congress should prepare to spend as much as $9 billion to assist farmers, business owners and other victims of the floods.
 
'A Big Distinction'
 The director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, James Lee Witt, told lawmakers privately that the damage could eventually exceed $8 billion. And Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy said that "as these losses increase, we will have to come in and ask for more support."
Mr. Clinton did suggest today that another package may be needed to cover crop losses and other damage assessed in the months ahead. But he twice reiterated that the Federal obligation would be limited, saying, "There is a big distinction to be drawn between the aggregate loss and what is normally compensable by Federal programs."
The $2.5 billion in disaster assistance already requested by Mr. Clinton is to provide immediate relief before the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, and its full amount would be added to the Federal deficit, creating a new strain just as the White House is urging Congress to adopt its deficit-reduction plan.
A Republican Senator, Dave Durenberger of Minnesota, today urged Mr. Clinton to underscore his commitment to the principle of defict reduction by proposing spending cuts that would offset the costs of flood relief.
But the President made clear after his meeting this afternoon, which included the Democratic leaders of Congress, that he had no inclination to risk such a politically unpopular step. He noted that the balanced-budget requirement imposed by Congress in 1990 allow an exception in cases of emergency, and said lower interest rates this year would push the budget deficit to a level well below what was estimated in January.
 
'Glad to Hear' Ideas
 "I think we can handle this," Mr. Clinton said of the added fiscal burden. "I have heard the general principle advanced it would be nice if we paid for it all with offsets, but I haven't seen any specific suggestions, and in the absence of those, I think we should just take the '90 law and proceed as is."
Mr. Clinton appeared mindful of the potential impact of the argument raised by Mr. Durenberger, who told him in a letter that it was their duty "to pursue fiscal responsibility -- even in times of disaster." Mr. Clinton said he would be "glad to hear" recommendations for spending cuts.
But he said he took heart in sentiments of flood-state lawmakers from both parties who said they were ready to work together to provide relief to those whose homes, businesses and farms have been overwhelmed by the flood. "The most important thing is that we get the aid out to those folks as quickly as possible," Mr. Clinton said.
The President is to return to the Midwest Saturday to review the extent of flood damage with governors and local officials, the White House said today. The meeting is scheduled for the St. Louis area, where the flood-swollen Mississippi River is expected to crest on Monday.
 
Third Visit Is Planned
 The visit will be the President's third to the region since the Mississippi, Missouri and their tributaries began to spill over their banks. He stopped in Iowa July 4 on the way to the economic summit in Tokyo and, after a brief vacation in Hawaii, stopped there again on Monday as he returned to Washington.
But Mr. Clinton's late-afternoon meeting at the Capitol with senators and representatives from the eight flood-stricken states provided him his first extended opportunity to listen to lawmakers' views of the widening disaster.
Only a week ago, White House officials were hearing estimates of just $500 million in total damage from the flood. And Federal officials earlier this week had estimated damages in Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin at $2 billion to $3 billion.
But Administration officials indicated today that the sweeping scale of the floods and the damage they had caused to crops had led them revise those estimates sharply upward. An Agriculture Department expert, Randy Weber, said after the Capitol Hill meeting with Mr. Clinton that most of the eight million acres of crops submerged by the floods would be lost.
Mr. Witt, the director of the emergency agency, did not publicly repeat the damage estimate of $8 billion that Congressional officials said he had made in private. But other Administration officials, Mr. Espy in particular, made it clear that more relief would be needed beyond the package requested by the White House, which includes $1 billion to reimburse farmers for crop losses.
"We think that it's a good start," Mr. Espy said, but added that he expected the Administration to have to ask Congress for more support, perhaps after completing a monthly report on crop damage that is due early next week.
In seeking to fend off pleas for more comprehensive relief, President Clinton did not refer directly to the formula adopted by the Federal Government after Hurricane Andrew last year, in which $9 billion in aid was provided to ease devastation estimated at $18 billion.
But he appeared to refer to such an approach as he emphasized that the Federal Government has never provided total relief. He said personal losses could be covered only by low-interest loans, and noted that other kinds of Federal assistance must in most cases be matched by the state and local governments.
"There are other losses that simply aren't covered by any Federal law," he added.

HEADLINE: THE MIDWEST FLOODING: Where to Get Help;
List of Major Programs That Help Flood Victims

 BODY:
Federal, state and voluntary agencies offer a wide and varied assortment of aid programs to flood victims, both individuals and businesses. The processing time can vary from a couple of hours to a couple of days or a number of weeks, depending how pressing the need and how much documentation is required. Here are the major programs, most of which are offered at disaster assistance centers:
BASIC EMERGENCY NEEDS The Red Cross, Salvation Army and other voluntary agencies offer immediate gifts of food, shelter, clothing, bedding and medicine to help flood victims while they await approval of government aid or work out their own arrangements. 
 CASH GRANTS Up to $11,900 in Federal funds is available to people who have no insurance and few if any cash resources to meet disaster needs not covered by any government or private aid program.
DISASTER HOUSING Federal grants are available to pay for up to 18 months of temporary housing or for emergency repairs to make a damaged house habitable.
HOME LOANS The Small Business Administration offers loans of up to $100,000 for as little as 4 percent interest for home repairs. Limited loans are also available to homeowners for help in making a dwelling less subject to flooding.
BUSINESS LOANS Loans of up to $500,000 are offered by the Small Business Administration to flooded businesses.
FARM LOANSFarmers and ranchers can get loans of up to $500,000 to cover production and equipment losses.
TAX ASSISTANCE Homeowners whose flood losses are not insured or are underinsured can take a tax deduction on their loss.
UNEMPLOYMENT AID People who lose their job because of a flood are entitled to unemployment assistance.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
The Congressional conference on the budget got under way today with senators and representatives doing what they do best: meeting, making political speeches and having their pictures taken.
Then they adjourned until next week, when they will start on something they may not be so good at: figuring out how to lower the Federal deficit by raising taxes and cutting spending in a way that can win the support of President Clinton and a majority of senators and representatives. 
 Most elements of the deficit-reduction legislation passed by the House in May and the Senate last month are identical, or so similar, that the conferees should easily find common ground.
Both measures would lower the deficit by about $500 billion over the next five years, primarily by raising the income-tax rates for wealthy individuals and corporations, cutting military spending, and limiting the growth of Medicare.
But reaching a compromise on energy taxes, spending on social programs and a few other touchy issues is likely to be an excruciating process that will last at least until the end of this month. So the lawmakers -- as if to reward themselves with a spoonful of sugar before taking the bitter medicine -- devoted today to the kinds of events they love.
 
Courting the Cameras
 It began with all 226 conferees -- 53 senators and 173 representatives, 42 percent of the entire Congress -- meeting for the first and probably only time as a group in the cavernous Caucus Room in the Cannon House Office Building across Independence Avenue from the Capitol.
The seats were arranged in concentric horseshoes, with the most important members of the conference -- the party leaders, the chairmen and top Republicans on the budget and tax committees -- sitting in the rear tier, facing the backs of their fellow lawmakers but looking straight at the television cameras. They made speeches that anyone following the budget process had heard a thousand times. Here are sound bites:
Representative Martin Olav Sabo of Minnesota, chairman of the House Budget Committee: "This is our best chance to regain control of our economic future."
Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, top Republican on the House Budget Committee: "This tax and spending proposal that is before us today is a job-killer."
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader: "Deficit reduction is job creation."
 
Actual Work on Tap
 The real work of the conference committee will begin behind closed doors next week, when about a dozen subcommittees will begin working on the final compromises. The conferees from the Agriculture Committees will work on the matters in their jurisdiction, those from the Banking Committees on theirs and so forth.
At lunch, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen met privately in the Capitol with Democratic senators. Afterward, he was asked by reporters what he had told them. "I told them we had to pass the bill," Mr. Bentsen replied.
In the early afternoon, the conferees from the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee met for what will almost certainly be the only time publicly. This is by far the most important subcommittee, and these are the most important conferees. They have jurisdiction over all the tax provisions and the most controversial of the spending measures, like limits on Medicare.
The session was like a rerun of the morning program with different actors speaking the same lines.
"We are in the homestretch," said Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. "I have no illusions about the difficulty of the job ahead of us. We face an enormous task. But we cannot afford to fail."
 
Clinton Shows Up
 While this meeting was going on, President Clinton arrived on Capitol Hill. He was greeted by a large, cheering crowd of Congressional interns, and he and Vice President Al Gore worked the line, shaking hands two at a time with as many interns as they could reach.
Then Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore went into the Capitol for a meeting with Congressional leaders and sat down around a table in a room near the souvenir stand on the first floor. Photographers were allowed in briefly to shoot pictures. From the rear, a reporter asked whether the President was still committed to $500 billion in total deficit reduction and a tax on energy.
He replied, "Today, I'm here to talk about my trip to Japan, Korea and Hawaii and talk a little about the flood -- the emergency flooding legislation that I'm hoping to get through."
A staff member who sat through the meeting said the budget had not been discussed at all.
But afterward, when Mr. Clinton held a brief news conference in the Capitol's Statuary Hall, a reporter again asked him about the deficit-reduction target and an energy tax.
"How it's resolved is something the conference will have to work out," the President replied, as he stood in front of a bronze statue of Henry Clay, the Great Compromiser.

Here comes the bride -- from Idaho to Transylvania.
When JOHN FLORESCU, chief executive and executive producer for David Frost's television company and scion of a distinguished Rumanian family, became engaged in October to GINA CHRISTENSEN, a political consultant, he could think of only two places for their wedding. "I explained to my in-laws, who are from Idaho, that it should be in either Sun Valley or Transylvania," Mr. Florescu said yesterday. "They were intrigued by the idea." So Transylvania it was. 
 On July 31, after seven months of planning, the couple is to marry in the monastery of Sinaia, about 80 miles north of Bucharest, where Mr. Florescu's paternal grandparents were wed in 1924. A reception will follow in the Foisor Palace, a summer home occupied most recently by Nicolae Ceausescu, the dictator who was executed in 1989.
For the 200 guests, this will be no quick-toast-to-the-bride-and-groom kind of affair. There will be five days of tours, lectures, picnics, dinners and parties.
Mr. Florescu's father, Prof. Radu Florescu, is a Boston College historian who has written four books about Vlad Dracul, the man on whom Count Dracula was modeled. "He was the 15th-century tyrannical prince who was credited with impaling 100,000 Turks," John Florescu said. Guests will visit Arefu Castle, Vlad Dracul's mountaintop home.
Also on the itinerary is a visit to the Ceausescu palace in Bucharest, which Mr. Florescu said "is bigger than the Pentagon."
Guests are expected from 12 countries. "Everyone who's coming sees it as a great adventure," Mr. Florescu said. "One person is coming by motorcycle from London, another wants to fly by helicopter from Moscow and land at dusk."
"We want everyone to appreciate the beauty and history of Rumania," said Mr. Florescu, who has a prime minister, ambassadors, noblemen and academicians in his ancestry. "All we read about it is AIDS, orphans and runaway inflation. There is another side, too."

Vinoly's Vision for Tokyo, and for the Identity of Japan

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:
Those who have forgiven the Japanese for buying a big chunk of Rockefeller Center may find it more difficult to excuse them for snapping up Rafael Vinoly to design the Tokyo International Forum, a colossal performing-arts and convention center now going up in the heart of the Japanese capital. Rockefeller Center, after all, isn't leaving New York. But why must we travel to Japan to see major public buildings as fine as the one Mr. Vinoly has designed for Tokyo? This prodigiously gifted architect lives right here.
At least we get to see the models. Mr. Vinoly's plans for the Tokyo International Forum are on view now in the architecture and design galleries at the Museum of Modern Art, as part of the museum's continuing series of shows devoted to important public works. This is the first show in the series to feature a single project by one firm, and the honor is richly deserved. The $1 billion project, which will be completed in 1996, is one of the largest under construction in the world today. It is also among the most sublime. Mr. Vinoly's design goes far toward dispelling disillusionment with the bloated scale of recent civic projects. And it revives faith in architecture as an instrument of intellectual clarity. 
 The Tokyo International Forum isn't just an architecture story. Like the Pompidou Center in Paris, this building exploits civic scale and prominence to set a national cultural agenda. The French critic Roland Barthes described Tokyo as a city with an "empty center," a modern metropolis that revolves around the ancient, opaque and politically impotent Imperial Palace. The forum, situated two blocks from the palace gardens, will be the antithesis to this venerable void. Lucid, accessible, deftly knit into the urban fabric, the forum will provide a public stage to dramatize Japan's leading role in world affairs. More important, it will inject an outward-looking, cosmopolitan ideal into the center of today's Japan. The innocuous word "international" carries a charged meaning here: although Japan has long been subject to foreign influences, it is widely perceived as a closed society. The forum is designed to counter that xenophobic image.
Mr. Vinoly has translated this symbolic goal into an appropriately symbolic form. His design is a monument to the idea of openness. The clarity of the forum's planning, its sparkling glass surfaces and exposed structural engineering, its generous public spaces and its links to mass transit will add up to a celebration of public access. Here, light and transparency become metaphors for a reconfigured cultural ideal.
There is nothing overtly Japanese about the design. But Western architects since Frank Lloyd Wright have found inspiration in the Japanese vernacular of spare, light, spatially sonorous forms. Mr. Vinoly, born in Uruguay in 1944 and educated in Argentina, has described architecture as an "art of dealing with heaviness." For him, creating shelter is less a matter of containing space than of escaping inertia. It is this idea, rather than a facile infatuation with industrial technology, that explains the prominence Mr. Vinoly gives to structure and the lyricism he extracts from it. Like trained bodies in motion, his soaring, structurally athletic enclosures convey the thrill of triumph over gravity.
(Fortunately, New Yorkers will have the opportunity to savor that thrill, though on a much smaller scale, when Mr. Vinoly's gymnasium for Lehman College, his most important New York project to date, opens in Riverdale, the Bronx, in September.)
What is discernibly Japanese is the forum's program, which combines four theaters for performing arts with spaces for major trade shows. This union of commercial and cultural uses would be anomalous in the West; we prefer to segregate Mammon from the muses. But it is consistent with a culture where art is traditionally fused with life. That tradition may be one of Japan's strategic advantages in today's international marketplace, where, increasingly, economic exchange is cultural exchange. Straddling the porous line between art and industry, the Tokyo Forum will reflect a global economy in which creative talent has displaced the primacy of raw materials and consumer goods.
The forum's seven-acre, trapezoidal site also straddles a physical line: a border between a grid of densely built-up commercial blocks in Tokyo's central business district and the curve of a rail viaduct that cuts through it. The forum's plan takes its cue from these two urban geometries. The four theaters, one of which will be the largest in Tokyo, are aligned along the site's eastern edge, attached to a slim slab building that faces the downtown grid.
Modular in form but variable in scale, the theaters diminish in size as the site narrows toward its apex. They look across an open plaza toward the Glass Hall, the forum's most spectacular component. With curving contours derived from the rail viaduct's adjacent arc, this shipshaped atrium rises 190 feet to a crystalline roof of metal and glass, designed in collaboration with the structural engineer Kunio Watanabe. If Tiffany made skyscrapers, the result might look something like this exquisite marquise.
Unfolding as a sequence of landscaped, triangular terraces, the plaza forms a pedestrian boulevard between the commuter rail stations that lie at opposite ends of the complex. Rows of zelkova trees will turn the plaza into a garden (this reverses the arrangement at the Imperial Palace, where gardens occupy the perimeter). The trees are to be ornamental, but their airy, spreading canopies will express a structural principle. Throughout the building, Mr. Vinoly translates vertical thrust into horizontal expression. He resists gravity not by erecting tall spires but by lifting the urban horizon.
A gigantic, illuminated walk-through model is the centerpiece of the Modern's show, which was organized by Terence Riley and Anne Dixon of the museum's architecture and design department. Split down the central axis of the plaza, the model lets viewers play at being benign Godzillas. A separate model of the Glass Hall's giant steel truss, suspended from the ceiling, highlights its resemblance to an ancient Egyptian solar bark. A selection of Mr. Vinoly's energetic charcoal drawings shows him exploring the texture of light.
Sociologically or esthetically, openness doesn't come easily. Large expanses of glass are unusual for earthquake-prone Tokyo. Sophisticated mechanics will protect the glass from seismic shocks, but Mr. Vinoly understands that terror is integral to the sublime. Like a movie maker, he skillfully manipulates fear.
I suspect, too, that he regards the Glass Hall as a metaphor for modern architecture. For Mr. Vinoly's classically modern approach has also withstood shocks. It has survived public disfavor, critical disillusionment, even its own calamitous hubris.
Some may find the design excessively retrospective, an evocation of yesterday's vision of things to come. Well, those things did come, but seldom with the grace Mr. Vinoly promises to confer upon the vision. He has not launched a new style. He seeks to enlarge the expressive potential and the urban dimension of a vernacular that originated a century and a half ago with Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace in London, designed for the first world's fair. Appearing now, at the end of a century that has seen movements rise and fall with accelerating futility, the design's evolutionary stance is refreshing. Not all radiance has perished in this brutal century: that is the elevating message that the Tokyo Forum could pass on to the next.
"Preview: The Tokyo International Forum by Rafael Vinoly Architects" is to remain on view at the Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, Manhattan, through Aug. 3.

CHRYSLER SEES RECORD U.S. AUTO SALES BY 1996

BYLINE: Reuters

 BODY:
Chrysler Corporation officials said yesterday that they expect United States car and truck sales to surge to a record 17 million vehicles by 1996. 
 Thomas Pappert, a Chrysler vice president, said a combination of low interest rates, attractive products and an aging fleet of cars on the road is bringing people into showrooms. He predicted that American car and truck sales would hit 14.3 million vehicles this year. Mr. Pappert's prediction, by far the most aggressive forecast of Detroit's Big Three car manufacturers, compares with 1992 sales of 13.1 million cars and trucks. The all-time vehicle sales record in the United States was set in 1986, when 16.3 million cars and trucks were sold. On Wednesday, American auto makers said domestic car and truck sales rose 14.6 percent in early July to 289,191 units. For the year, domestic vehicle sales are running about 12.5 percent ahead of last year's pace.

HEADLINE: Cracks in the Cuban Permafrost

 BODY:
President Clinton would risk little, and could gain a good deal, by removing America's Cuba policy from its cold war freezer.
For three decades, Washington's chief weapon against Communist Cuba has been a punishing economic embargo. But even as Fidel Castro changed from security threat to political curiosity, Congress tightened that embargo last year to make life still harder for Cubans trapped in a subsistence economy. And the new Congressional measure, the Cuban Democracy Act, has since backfired -- even in Miami, the heart of anti-Castro country. 
 Consider for example the bizarre telephone crisis. Illogically, the act asks Havana to permit freer contacts with exiles, yet makes it more difficult than ever for Cuba to earn hard currency. Some $80 million owed to Cuba for international calls has long been blocked in an American escrow account. So Havana now pressures Cuban-Americans to route their calls via Canada, which allows Cuba to recoup its share of toll revenues.
Among the outraged protesters against this practice is Representative Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, author of the Cuban Democracy Act. "We cannot allow Castro to extract profit from the desire of families to talk with their loved ones nor to set up a collection agency in Canada," he says. "The practices of these Canadian resellers are not only illegal but morally reprehensible." In other words, it's O.K. for Washington to wage economic war, but for Havana to defend itself is wrong.
A growing number of Cuban-Americans are getting tired of the standoff. The Cuban Air Force defector who became an exile hero when he flew back to rescue his wife and sons now urges a boatlift of food and medicines to the straitened island; a former guerrilla commando who spent 22 years in Mr. Castro's jails says he is prepared "to dialogue with anybody" in Cuba. Such dissenting voices emboldened the House Appropriations Committee to kill funding for TV Marti, a pet project of the hard-line Cuban-American National Foundation.
In another token of changing views, even some American conservatives have urged the Clinton Administration to end unilaterally the trade embargo against Cuba, and thus deny Mr. Castro the easy scapegoat of American imperialism. All this suggests that Mr. Clinton, who supported the Cuban Democracy Act, now has enough space to test the discretionary powers it gives him.
Why not challenge Fidel Castro to free all his political prisoners in return for a significant easing of the trade embargo? That would begin to get American policy out of the ice tray.

HEADLINE: Hope for the 'River of Grass'

 BODY:
Among the most painful of America's environmental tragedies has been the slow asphyxiation of the world's largest fresh-water marsh, the Florida Everglades. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt's plan to defend the Everglades from the further ravages of commerce gives the expiring patient its first ray of hope in years. But it is only a ray. A lot more hard bargaining lies ahead before anyone can declare victory.
The plan results from a month of furious negotiations among state and Federal officials and leaders of Florida's powerful agricultural interests, mainly the sugar growers. It seeks to give the vast "river of grass" what it needs most: a timely, reliable supply of fresh water. 
 First, the plan would alter and otherwise rearrange some of the canals now used to control flooding, thereby letting the water flow naturally southward toward the glades. Second, it would create 40,000 acres of filtration marshes to remove the pollutants contained in agricultural runoffs, mainly phosphorus from the huge sugar plantations north of Everglades National Park.
The Government estimates that the plan will cost $465 million. The sugar industry says it will pay two-thirds of that, but there's more than a little flimflam here. Florida's taxpayers will pay most of the upfront costs of construction while the industry will be able to spread its payments over 20 years, in dollars depreciated by inflation.
Mr. Babbitt's major achievement was to get an agreement, ending five years of legal wrangling and preventing more years of court fights, during which the lawyers would grow richer and the Everglades poorer. For that he deserves praise. But all he really has is a "statement of principles" whose details will be worked out over 90 days.
And the devil lies in those details. For one thing, the "statement" does not set forth a mechanism for enforcement -- no small omission given the ingenuity and clout of Florida's growers. For another, it commits the state and the growers to reducing the amount of phosphorus in the water to 50 parts per billion by 1997. That's progress, but 50 parts can still kill the Everglades. The statement contains a vague reference to the need for further reductions, no reference to the thousands of additional acres of filtration land that will be necessary to achieve these reductions and no reference to who will pay for them.
Mr. Babbitt's heart is clearly in the right place. Now his negotiators must construct a far tighter deal. As the Secretary knows better than anyone, there is no end to preserving the Everglades.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The U.S.-Iran Oil Scam

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Now watch carefully, everybody. This is big-time international three-card monte. The stakes are survival for the world's top terrorist regime, and billions of trade dollars for the American oil business. See how both clean the table.
The dealer is U.S. oil. He hands himself three cards, open. They are Presidential orders banning the import of Iranian oil. He shuffles the three cards, collects bets and turns one over. 
 What do you know -- it's a $4 billion trade in Iranian oil, making American oil companies Iran's biggest oil customer.
Iran wins, oil wins; you lose. The beauty part is that hardly any Americans outside big oil and government are even aware that their country is providing a major part of Iran's hard currency.
The money could be the difference between life and death for Teheran's Government. And it allows Iran to keep financing the terrorist network whose major target is the United States.
Like all good scams, the trick is simple. The Presidential orders of 1986 and 1988 prohibited import of Iran's major resource, oil. The purpose was to prevent American money from bolstering Iran and its terrorism. But -- get this part -- the orders did not specifically say U.S. oil companies could not buy Iranian oil!
So U.S. oil companies buy all the Iranian crude oil they want, transport it to South America or Europe and have it refined and sold. Sure, some of that refined oil is likely to wind up in the U.S. But who is to know or care? Certainly not the Iranians. They have their American money -- now about a quarter of Iran's annual oil exports -- and the delicious bonus of U.S. oil's marketing expertise.
In that word so dear to bureaucrats, oil is fungible; you can move it around for different purposes, different customers. Money is the most fungible stuff on earth. Iran uses its U.S. oil money to keep functioning both the Government and terrorist bomb squads.
The mullahs have Iranians by the throat, but they are also choking the once-proud national economy. Iran is hip-deep in debt, and beneath public complaints is the rumble of rebellion. Without those billions, the Government would move closer to collapse.
And certainly Iran needs oil sales to keep camps in the Sudan, its new political colony, well stocked with Iranian and other Middle Eastern specialists in terrorism.
Oh, one other thing -- the card dealer has several names: Exxon, Texaco, Mobil, Phibro, Caltex, Chevron and other familiar TV pals.
All right, fellow suckers, now you know how it works; you can leave the table. But some Americans cannot -- the people in the Clinton Administration, which inherited the mess.
The Administration recently worked out the policy of "dual containment" -- Iran as well as Iraq, no futile playing of one against the other anymore.
So Washington naturally is urging its allies to cut trade with Iran. You can see how that gets a little embarrassing when American businesses have faces greasy with Iranian oil. Exactly the same thing holds about planes. Iran hints it wants to buy some from Boeing, if it can scratch up loans. Meanwhile, the U.S. tells its allies that planes are dual-use products -- usable for war, not just peace.
As expected, some officials tell the President that if the U.S. does not buy oil from Iran, foreign companies will. So before doing anything, they say, get a strong consensus from our allies on oil and planes.
That was the argument made for arming and trading with dictators from Hitler and Tojo to Saddam and Assad. If the U.S. means so little to its allies that they prefer dealing with Iran, Mr. Clinton should tell us so, plain out.
For the U.S. the price of urging an economic squeeze is to lead or shut up. Shutting up is not a decent option. It would be appeasement of a declared enemy, the end of hope for so many Iranians who are our friends, and the survival of the Rafsanjani Government now so sweatily eager to sidle up for awhile.
That leaves President Clinton one good choice. He can speak to the American people, tell them what the oil companies are doing, pull out a pen and sign a new executive order closing the loopholes in the old ones.
That should not only end this hustlers' game, but make us stay awake the next time some dealer pulls out the cards and says gather round.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Fires Sharp Jabs At Giuliani

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins, his re-election campaign stalled in the polls, abandoned an incumbent's customary reserve and sharply stepped up his attack on his Republican-Liberal challenger, Rudolph W. Giuliani, yesterday -- even as Gov. Mario M. Cuomo effusively praised the Mayor as a man who "can show us how to live together as one city going forward."
The offensives by Mr. Dinkins and the state's top Democrat came on the legal deadline for the start of the race as the candidates filed petitions for the ballot and reported raising millions of dollars more for their campaigns. Mr. Dinkins took in $2.4 million in the six months ended last Sunday, while Mr. Giuliani raised $1.8 million. Each now has just under $1.5 million on hand.
 
A Joint Appearance in Brooklyn
 Aides to the Mayor and Governor said their remarks had not been coordinated. But a number of pressures -- from Mr. Giuliani's standing in the polls to the impending release of a Cuomo administration report on the handling of the Crown Heights disturbances -- have combined to keep Mr. Dinkins on the defensive. Meanwhile, some of the Mayor's prominent black and Jewish supporters recently wrote the Governor to say they hoped the Crown Heights report would not become politicized or inflame racial tensions. 
 It was in that context that Mr. Cuomo made his comments in a joint appearance with the Mayor at the Bridge Street African Methodist Episcopal Church in the heart of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. He took special pains to counter some recent reports that he was keeping his political distance from the Mayor.
"I've said it before and I will say it in the A.M.E. church and I will say it all over this city and all over this state," said Mr. Cuomo, who had sparred with the Mayor over the city's requests for more state aid last spring. "I will say it even louder and more frequently now that it's more necessary." To anyone looking for a hero, Mr. Cuomo said, "David Dinkins is an authentic American hero." He added, "He is the essence of civility and he can show us how to live together as one city going forward."
Hours earlier, Mr. Dinkins had used another public occasion to deflect questions about his own record by harshly challenging Mr. Giuliani's as a prosecutor, and needling him for offering "ridiculous responses" that avoided concrete stands on issues -- like how to structure the Board of Education -- that the Mayor is called to account for daily.
Appearing at a breakfast forum in midtown on business and economic issues sponsored by Crain's New York Business and the New York City Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Mayor defended his efforts to retain businesses and jobs and keep the city's budget balanced, and said that while he had been grappling with such problems for three and a half years, Mr. Giuliani "has done nothing -- absolutely nothing."
 
'The Mayor's Too Emotional'
 The Mayor also made in more pointed terms a claim he has suggested previously: that he is better able to unite the city's diverse groups than Mr. Giuliani. "I truly do have a fashion of relating to people that is superior to his," he said.
Told that, Mr. Giuliani's spokesman, Richard Bryers, invoked Dana Carvey's "Church Lady" character on "Saturday Night Live" and replied, "Isn't that special?" He added: "I just think the Mayor should not get so upset about poll results. It's too early in the game to get so mean. The Mayor's too emotional."
In fact, the Mayor seemed to be swatting at his rival with an unusual blend of playfulness and pique. Noting that Mr. Giuliani has said he is still developing a position paper on how the Board of Education should be run, Mr. Dinkins said, "It's O.K. if he doesn't have one, but he's had three and a half years."
He mocked Mr. Giuliani for having said that changes in rent control were "too emotional" to become part of an election-year debate, and said, "Rudolph Giuliani has never run a government." He also questioned Mr. Giuliani's record as a prosecutor, noting that some of his most celebrated cases resulted either in acquittals or reversals on appeal.
Asked later by reporters if he thought Mr. Giuliani was an ineffective prosecutor, the Mayor replied, "I won't say that." But in an unmistakable dig, he went on to add: "I don't say he's Nadjari," a reference to Maurice Nadjari, the former special prosecutor for the city's criminal justice system in the 1970's who was widely seen as overzealous and inclined to bring flimsy cases.
Mr. Bryers replied that in Mr. Giuliani's six years as United States Attorney in Manhattan, the office had 4,159 criminal convictions, 25 of which were reversed on appeal, and that the office obtained guilty verdicts in 88 percent of the cases it brought and collected more revenue for the Federal Government than any other United States Attorney's office.
Mr. Dinkins's remarks represented a sharp shift in tone from his usual lordly dismissal of Mr. Giuliani, a change that his aides said had been building gradually for weeks out of his growing frustration at what he sees as Mr. Giuliani's coasting along by attacking him without being held to the same degree of scrutiny. Four and a half months before the general election, it foreshadowed a testy campaign.
 
14,600 Signatures for Innis
 Indeed, the rematch between Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Giuliani is now the only real mayoral race, since aides to Mr. Dinkins's sole remaining Democratic primary challenger, Roy E. Innis, national chairman of the Congress of Racial Equality, said he planned to file only 14,600 petition signatures, not quite twice the 7,500 required and not enough to withstand challenges to their validity under the state's arcane election laws.
Mr. Dinkins's campaign manager, Bill Lynch, said he had not yet decided whether to challenge Mr. Innis's petitions. Any challenger has until Monday to file preliminary objections. Moving to knock Mr. Innis off the ballot could force the Mayor to curb his spending under the city's campaign finance laws -- which limit each candidate to $4 million for the primary and $4 million for the general election -- since there would no longer be an active primary. On the other hand, Mr. Innis could win perhaps one-quarter of the primary vote simply by remaining on the ballot, which could embarrass the Mayor as he moved into the race against Mr. Giuliani.
 
Giuliani Turns In Petitions
 Mr. Giuliani's wife, Donna Hanover, and their 3-year-old daughter, Caroline, took 38,530 petition signatures to the Board of Elections yesterday, far more than the 7,500 valid signatures required to get on the ballot and nearly 9 percent of all the registered Republicans in the city. Mr. Dinkins's supporters had already filed 125,000 petition signatures on Tuesday, reflecting the city's far larger Democratic Party registration and the shoe leather of their supporters in unions and political clubs.
Altogether, Mr. Dinkins has now raised about $5.6 million and spent about $4 million, his filings showed, while Mr. Giuliani has raised nearly $4 million and spent $2.5 million. Mr. Dinkins's camp estimates that he is so far eligible for about $500,000 in matching public funds, while Mr. Giuliani is entitled to about $900,000 because his average contributions have been smaller, which is rewarded under the law.
Mr. Innis's treasurer said he had raised "under $50,000" in the last six months and had "hardly any" cash on hand.

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the New York City mayoral campaign misstated the amount of public matching funds for which Mayor David N. Dinkins has qualified so far. It is just over $1 million, about $100,000 more than his rival, Rudolph W. Giuliani.

Report on Earnings Trims Storage Technology Shares

BYLINE: By KATHRYN JONES

 BODY:
Shares of the Storage Technology Corporation plunged $7.875 each yesterday, a day after the company reported sharply lower second-quarter earnings that fell below analysts' projections.
The announcement, released after the stock market closed Wednesday, pushed Storage Technology's stock down to $33.25 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. Trading was heavy, with almost 3.2 million shares changing hands. 
 The company, which makes systems that store and retrieve huge amounts of computer data, said second-quarter earnings slid 80 percent, to $1.3 million, from $6.6 million a year earlier. After payment of a $3 million preferred stock dividend, the company lost 4 cents a share in the quarter, compared with a profit of 16 cents a share a year earlier.
Analysts had expected Storage Technology to earn 5 cents to 10 cents a share in this year's second quarter.
Storage Technology's revenues also slipped 8 percent, to $355.1 million, from $386.4 million in the comparable period a year before. Ryal R. Poppa, the company's chairman, president and chief executive, said the weak economy in Europe hurt second-quarter results. He said he did not expect results to improve until the fourth quarter.
Storage Technology, based in Louisville, Colo., also said in the earnings report that it did not expect to begin production of its long-awaited Iceberg data-storage system before the end of the year. The company reiterated that it does not expect Iceberg to generate revenues until next year.
Iceberg, which is designed to let large computer mainframe operators back up information stored on disks in seconds without having to shut down operations, has been delayed several times because of problems tying together the complex hardware and software systems. Last month the company disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission had begun an investigation into last year's announcements about the Iceberg delays and is looking into possible violations of disclosure, reporting or insider trading requirements.
Storage Technology also announced yesterday that it had acquired the Sceptre Corporation, an Ann Arbor, Mich., supplier of software that manages data storage on cartridge tapes. Financial terms were not disclosed, but analysts said the acquisition was small and was not a factor in the stock price drop.

HEADLINE: ACCORD IS REACHED ON MILITARY RULES FOR GAY SOLDIERS

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
The White House said today that President Clinton had agreed with the Pentagon, the Justice Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff on a plan to allow homosexuals to serve in the military as long as they do not aggressively display their homosexuality or engage in homosexual conduct.
Senior Pentagon and White House officials said the accord, which was denounced today by gay-rights advocates, came together in the past two days in a flurry of meetings between President Clinton, Defense Secretary Les Aspin, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a bevy of lawyers from the Justice Department and Pentagon. 
 Mr. Clinton is expected to announce the new policy -- which will consist of a two-page executive order and an appendix of guidelines for implementation -- on Monday or Tuesday, as soon as the Justice Department gives him its final assurances that the policy is defensible in court and some last-minute refinements are completed.
 
A Pledge Unfulfilled
 White House officials acknowledged that the plan fell short of President Clinton's campaign pledge to unconditionally lift the ban on homosexuals serving in the military, but they said it was the best they could produce given the resistance of the military chiefs and Congressional conservatives. And they said it was an important start toward futher relaxation of the 50-year-old ban.
But the officials also said that even under the new policy, any homosexual who does not want to be discreet would be better off not entering the armed services.
The Clinton plan is dubbed by officials, "Don't ask, don't tell and don't pursue." "Don't ask" means that recruits will no longer be asked about their sexual orientation. But "Don't tell" is much more complicated, and the agreement finally resolves the question of what it means to identify oneself as a homosexual, a question that had bedeviled Mr. Clinton and his advisers for months.
Formally, the plan says homosexual servicemen and servicewomen may not "tell" about their sexual orientation or conduct. But gay soldiers and sailors will be given limited room to express their sexual identity by the "Don't pursue" policy, which sets strict guidelines that make it difficult for officers to pursue accusations of homosexuality without strong evidence of repeated homosexual conduct or ostentatious display. The net effect of this loose form of pursuit is to create an implicit "private zone" for homosexuals to live discreetly, an aide to the President said.
 
Using Common Sense
 For instance, a mere private declaration of homosexuality would not trigger an investigation, nor would drinking in a gay bar or marching in a gay parade. Only a pattern of "credible information" about the open expression of homosexual identity or open homosexual conduct by a serviceman or servicewoman would be allowed to trigger such an investigation, officials said. Even then, commanders will be urged to use common sense, discretion and keep in mind the limited resources for such investigations, officials said.
Nevertheless, Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and one of the first open homosexuals willing to accept a compromise, announced today that he could not approve of this draft plan, saying, "The victims of the prejudice would rather lose with the President on their side than win a small gain with him being perceived as having moved away."
Several key advocates of lifting the ban gathered yesterday at the War Memorial Veterans Building in San Francisco and said they were disappointed that the President seemed to have abandoned his campaign pledge to his gay supporters in deference to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
"The people in the Pentagon should realize the President of the United States was elected by the people and he is the Commander in Chief," said Keith Meinhold, a homosexual who was discharged as a Naval petty officer and then reinstated by a Federal judge last year. "I'm concerned he may think the military constituency is more important than the gay constituency. But I'll tell you, no matter what he does, he'll never have the military constituency."
In addition, several major gay-rights groups said they have given up on influencing the policy through the President and will instead fight it through the courts as soon as it is implemented, most likely Oct. 1.
"We intend to bring a lawsuit immediately after it is announced on grounds that it violates both the constitutional provision for equal protection under the law and the First Amendment right of free speech," said William Rubenstein, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's lesbian and gay rights project, on Thursday.
Earlier in the day, Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee, indicated that he wanted to write the principles that make up the basis of the Clinton plan into law, instead of simply relying on an executive order, which can be easily changed.
Some White House officials said they were taken by surprise by the Nunn proposal and did not want to comment until they could study it further. The officials said that the last thing the President wants is a legislative battle over homosexuals in the military while he is trying to get his economic program passed, and they were privately contemptuous of the Georgia Senator's efforts. Senator Nunn, once considered a candidate for Defense Secretary in Mr. Clinton's Cabinet, has been fighting the President on ending the gay ban since January.
But a senior Pentagon official and a colleague of Mr. Nunn said the legislation merely codified the Clinton plan.
 
Drawing a Line
 The policy tries to draw a line between homosexual status, which will be condoned if kept discreet, and open homosexual conduct, which would almost certainly lead to an investigation and discharge.
For instance, attending a gay bar or marching in a gay-rights parade would not necessarily trigger an investigation, but if there were multiple reports or overt behavior, like kissing or holding hands, a soldier might trigger an inquiry. Only an officer of the rank of major or above, or lieutenant commander in the Navy, will be allowed to order an investigation.
Officials said that the level of "credible information" that will be required to launch an investigation into alleged homosexual conduct will be the same as that required to launch an investigation into heterosexual conduct. Clinton aides hope that this will enable the Justice Department to defend the policy as not violating the guarantee of equal protection under the law.

HEADLINE: A Recovery That's Too Weak Results in Too Few New Jobs

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Americans are being bombarded with explanations of why the nation cannot generate enough jobs: a shortage of skilled workers, they are told, holds down hiring, along with higher taxes, global competition, expensive Government regulations, technology that automates work and cutbacks in military spending.
All of these play a role, many experts say, but the biggest problem is simply a lack of robust economic growth -- the most basic source of job creation. Until the national economy kicks into higher gear, they say, faster job growth will be hard to come by. 
 Many factors contribute to the slow economic growth. If military purchases are not replaced by some other type of spending, production declines and jobs are lost. The same things can happen if Ford moves some auto production from Michigan to Mexico, or if too many empty offices force a cutback in building construction. In the past, strong economic growth provided new jobs to absorb the displaced workers. That strength is missing now.
 
Output Is Lower, Too
 "There is much talk that this is a jobless recovery, but that is not the real story," said Marvin Kosters, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, referring to the view that the economy can expand without adding many jobs. "The real story is that the job growth in this recovery has turned out to be more or less commensurate with the job growth in previous recoveries, when you take into account that output has been less than in those previous recoveries."
The American Enterprise Institute is a conservative research organization. But Mr. Kosters's view was echoed across the political spectrum in more than two dozen interviews with economists, executives, Government officials, labor and small-business experts. It is a thesis shared by liberal economists like Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; by business leaders like Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, and by Wall Street executives like John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers.
They say that American consumers -- and for that matter European consumers who buy American goods -- have simply not purchased with their usual gusto. As a result, fewer workers are needed to make goods or provide services to the nation. The problem, in short, is weak demand, not a new world that has found a way to prosper without workers.
 
'The Main Difference'
 Even as the White House prepares for an international "jobs summit" this fall to try to pinpoint the causes and some solutions for what President Clinton describes as the "stubbornly high unemployment" that afflicts both Europe and the United States, the Administration is linking the lack of jobs to a lack of economic growth. In doing so, it is agreeing, in effect, with Mr. Kosters.
"We conclude that the main difference between the current situation and past situations is output," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the head of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. "The economy is growing more slowly."
The latest recession officially ended in March 1991. In the 27 months since, the American economy has grown at less than half the pace of the three previous recoveries during an equivalent period. Each of the three earlier recoveries generated more than 5.5 million new jobs in the post-recession period. In the current period, only 1.5 million jobs have been created.
That is far below the pace that President Clinton needs to generate eight million jobs in his first term, as he has promised. Job creation seemed to be hitting the Clinton target early this year, as the economy briefly surged. But the job growth virtually disappeared in June, amid numerous signs that the economy itself might be faltering.
 
Another View
 There are some strong dissents to the thesis that job growth and economic growth are still linked so closely. Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley, for example, argues that global competition sets this recovery apart from those in the past. Driven by this competition, he says, Corporate America relentlessly pursues greater efficiency, which means "job compression," even when sales are rising.
Ms. Tyson, too, says the emphasis on efficiency might inhibit some hiring, keeping unemployment slightly higher than it would otherwise be, even in a faster-growing economy. "I don't want to speculate about the number," she said.
President Clinton, for the moment, appears to be focusing on ways to make workers more efficient. He will appear this month at a Chicago conference, sponsored by the Labor Department, intended to foster greater cooperation between workers and bosses. The idea is that more cooperation makes a company more efficient and lowers costs, permitting managers to lay off fewer workers in hard times, and perhaps to hire when economic growth picks up.
 
Reliance on Low Rates
 But many experts insist that economic growth remains the priority. Their insistence on linking weak job growth with weak economic growth could focus more attention on the Administration's current economic policy. The White House is relying on low interest rates as the principal incentive to get consumers and companies to borrow and spend, hoping the rates will be sufficient to lift the economy enough to create jobs.
Administration officials say there is more lift to be gained from low rates than has been evident so far. But not everyone agrees that low rates alone will do the job.
"I think that you can get some economic growth from lower rates, but there is an important distinction to be made," Mr. Solow said. "If rates fall because business is pessimistic, that does not help the economy, and that seems to be happening now. I think we could get some contribution to growth by an aggressive lowering of rates, but not enough to really get the economy going."
Once that does happen, education, job training and similar work force improvements may help to bring jobs back quickly. Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich notes that workers who are college educated and highly skilled are more likely, at any level of economic growth, to get jobs than the less skilled and less educated. But in an anemic economy, the educated can also go jobless, and that has been happening, according to several studies.
 
Cost of Labor
 Then there is the impediment posed by labor costs. Mr. Jasinowski of the manufacturers' association argues that complying with an array of Federal regulations is costing manufacturers $100 billion a year, absorbing revenue that might otherwise have been spent on new employees. "You get these quite large numbers and people say, 'I don't want to hire people; I will do without,' " Mr. Jasinowski said.
Others respond, however, that if sales were growing more strongly, companies would be more willing to hire despite the regulatory costs.
Corporate executives also cite the higher costs of benefits, at a time when wages are essentially flat, as a barrier to hiring. That has encouraged managers who might have otherwise hired to resort to overtime or temporary workers. Both approaches eliminate the cost of benefits.
 
Europe's High Labor Costs
 Expensive social benefits are also a drag on job growth in Western Europe. Stronger unions, higher payroll taxes and numerous regulations that prevent layoffs have made many European jobs more secure and higher paying than comparable jobs in the United States.
The overall cost of labor has made employers less willing to hire, and economists say that has kept Europe's unemployment rate above the United States'. But what has sent it up most sharply in recent years, they add, is the deep slowdown in the European economy; unemployment in the European Community now averages 11 percent, compared with 7 percent in the United States.
Cutbacks in military spending have become another impediment to job growth. Some 225,000 jobs have been lost in the last 18 months at companies that once prospered making weapons, parts and other products for the military, according to the National Commission for Economic Conversion and Disarmament.
Retraining these workers for new jobs is a Clinton Administration priority. But without stronger economic growth, Mr. Lipsky of Salomon Brothers says, the new jobs are lacking, no matter how successful the retraining might be.

HEADLINE: New York Using Speed Trap of Future: Laser Gun

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ARMONK, N.Y.

 BODY:
It worked well over Baghdad; now laser warfare is coming to the median strip of I-684.
The New York State Police are using lasers the same way Air Force pilots do: to identify targets, although the patrol cars do not follow up with bombs, only speeding tickets. But the police are beginning to sound like Air Force generals as they talk about the arms race on the highways, where ever more sophisticated radar speed traps brought forth better and better radar detectors, until now. Now, the police say, they've got The Big One. 
 Laser measures speed quickly, sending out extremely short pulses of light for one third of a second, and at such a long range, nearly half a mile, that even if a detector on the speeder's dashboard picks up the signal, it is already too late, the police say.
"If your detector goes off," said Trooper Lee N. Gasparik as he took aim at the race of southbound traffic one recent afternoon, "this is what you should do: put on your signal light and pull over, because I'm going to talk to you."
The companies that manufacture detectors do not agree, of course, and some have begun offering combination radar-laser detectors. They do not see lasers as their nemesis, either, but for reasons that will not please their customers: laser has made millions of radar detectors obsolete, and the replacements commonly run between $250 and $300.
The police also say that they are pulling over more and more motorists equipped with radar detectors. Those drivers, they say, are the prime target because their cars are generally traveling the fastest. But more disturbing for public safety, statistics show that the worst offenders are driving faster than the worst did a few years ago.
According to a report last year by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the percentage of cars exceeding 70 miles an hour is 19. That is up from 6 percent in 1986, before Congress allowed the states to raise speeds on rural interstates to 65 miles an hour from 55. Most states have raised the limit on eligible roads, but New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Maryland have not.
(Drivers who cannot bear the thought of 55 miles an hour should also stay away from Delaware, which has no roads that meet the Federal definition of rural interstates, and Hawaii, which has 5 miles of eligible road but has not raised the limit either.)
The police are aiming at the fastest for two reasons. First, an increase in speed sharply raises the chance of death if there is an accident: a rule of thumb by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety is that for each 10 percent increase in speed, the risk of driver death goes up nearly 45 percent.
 
Red Dot in Viewfinder
 A less obvious problem is that if some cars are moving very fast, then the variation of speed among cars on the road is larger. And with some cars moving over 70 while others are in the upper 50's, the number of accidents rises, experts say.
For years the police have hunted the speeders with radar, despite some technical problems.
A radar gun fires a beam of microwave radiation in a pattern like a searchlight's, rapidly widening; at 1,000 feet the beam is 105 feet wide, which may be enough to cover both sides of a six-lane interstate. Unless the target car is the only thing on the highway, the beam is too wide to be useful at that range, so it is commonly used at a range of 600 to 800 feet.
But the beam fired by a laser gun is only 3 feet wide at 1,000 feet. The model used by Trooper Gasparik has a stock that rests on the shoulder, like a rifle stock, and in the viewfinder is a red dot to place over the image of the target vehicle. The gun sends out pulses of infra-red energy for one third of a second, and measures the pattern they form when they return, which shows the speed of the target.
The gun also measures the time the infrared takes to make the round trip, which gives the distance. Scanning the southbound traffic from the median of I-684 here, the trooper could pick out a white Nissan Altima traveling at 75 miles an hour at a range of 2,215 feet, or four-tenths of a mile.
 
Radar Detector Useless
 The technological edge provided by the laser is threefold. The trooper got a reading almost instantly after he turned on the beam, as a car swung into view around a gentle curve; the range and speed of detection would have made a radar detector useless even if the driver had one. Also, since most drivers look only 600 to 800 feet ahead, the trooper had probably measured the speed long before the driver spotted him. And at that distance, the trooper had plenty of time to make a U-turn on the median and safely swing his 225-horsepower Mustang into traffic for the chase.
The driver, a woman on her way home to the District of Columbia, was impressed with the effect, if not with the details of the technology. "I didn't see him until the very end," said the woman, who gave a reporter only her first name, Maria.
 
Resigned to Technology
 Steven S. Cowan of Northport, L.I., clocked at 75 miles an hour in his dark blue Econoline van at a range of 1,568 feet, said he never saw the police car until it pulled into traffic to snag him. He seemed resigned to this advance of technology.
The state police, in fact, are counting on that attitude. "When they hear laser, people think of the gulf war, of smart bombs," said Maj. Craig R. Masterson, the director of traffic services. "We deal in public perceptions," he said, and one result of that perception, he said, is "a reduced number of court challenges."
Not everyone thinks laser is such an improvement. At Bel-Tronics Ltd., of Mississauga, Ontario, which put a combined radar/laser detector on the market earlier this year, Rudi E. Sagl Jr., executive vice president, said that the laser beam is wider than the police think, because the unit is hand-held, and if the police officer moves just a little while holding it the signal sweeps across the highway. The size of the sweep "depends on how many cups of coffee he had that morning," said Mr. Sagl.
"The beam width in radar is quite a bit larger, I will grant you that, but with laser you do still get a warning," he said.
 
No Shortage of Targets
 At the Radio Association Defending Airwave Rights, a lobbying group that represents makers of radar detectors and, it says, the people who use them, Jason Richards, a spokesman, said, "Our beef was always that radar was not accurate, and the police always said it was." Now he sees irony in the police preference for laser as being more accurate.
At the moment, motorists are still far more likely to encounter radar than laser; there are only about 900 laser guns in use nationwide, according to the New York State Police.
There is no shortage of violators to ticket. Last year drivers in New York State collected 709,000 speeding tickets while covering 107 billion miles, or one ticket for every 151,000 miles driven. Trooper Gasparik, a 19-year veteran of the State Police and a one-man anti-crime wave, wrote 1,500 of them, although he was on the road only six months; the other six he was training new troopers.
(Take note: Trooper Gasparik usually works out of the Riverhead, L.I., barracks, and likes to stake out Route 27. He also likes to park his car in one direction and let drivers assume that he is scanning cars approaching from his rear, while he actually takes readings through the windshield and then makes a U-turn to catch his target.)
Of course, almost everyone could be ticketed, since most cars drive above the posted limit at some point. But, as Trooper Gasparik put it, "You're trying to take the most dangerous person off the road first."
 
No Safe Zone Above 55
 He denied, however, that there is a speed above 55 at which the police simply will not bother to write a ticket. "if you're driving above 55, you're on your own," he said.
Drivers sometimes complain that having such a widely flouted law is not sensible, but public safety officials counter that it makes no sense to change the law to conform to bad practices, and that no matter where the limit is set, most drivers will always go a little above it.
At the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, the regional administrator for the area that includes New York, Thomas M. Louizou, argued that if the purpose were to write legal codes that minimized violations, "We could make murder legal, too."

The Economy
Faster job growth will be hard to come by until the economy kicks into higher gear, experts say. Consumers have simply not purchased enough goods, meaning that fewer workers are needed to make products or provide services, they say. [1.]
Meat and poultry prices are expected to rise in the coming weeks because of damage to processing plants in Iowa caused by the Midwest flooding. [35.] Demand for sandbags is so high that domestic manufacturers are working overtime and record numbers of bags are being imported. [43.] 
 The executive vice president of the New York Fed, William J. McDonough, was named the president, making him the second most powerful executive in the Federal Reserve system, after the chairman. E. Gerald Corrigan will step down on Monday. [43.]
The merchandise trade deficit narrowed sharply in May, reflecting the biggest drop in the imbalance with Japan in over six years. [46.] Industrial production fell two-tenths of 1 percent in June and did not rise in May as was previously thought. [46.]
 
Companies
Prudential Securities is "extraordinarily close" to reaching a settlement with the S.E.C. of charges of securities law violations, the chief executive told brokers. The charges stem from the firm's practices in selling limited partnerships in the 1980's. [35.]
Apple Computer shares lost nearly a quarter of their value a day after the troubled computer maker announced its largest quarterly loss ever and an expensive restructuring plan. [35.]
General Motors said the Justice Department was investigating possible theft of documents by former employees. One executive said the focus was on Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. [37.]
Picturetel shares plunged on earnings concerns even though the company introduced a new line of videoconferencing products that were praised by most industry analysts. [37.]
Fujitsu will not use information from an I.B.M. mainframe operating system software this year, moving away from trying to provide I.B.M.-compatible mainframes. [37.]
Rockwell and the University of California will pay the United States $450,000 to settle a lawsuit involving illegal gifts made at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant, which Rockwell ran. [37.]
 
International
Ukraine is threatened by labor protests, declines in industrial output, hyperinflation, political quarrels and sagging agricultural production in a land once viewed as the Soviet breadbasket. [1.]
The president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development quit after an internal report criticized him for spending too freely on a new headquarters and on himself. [36.]
 
Markets
Declining technology shares dragged down the stock market. The Dow Jones industrials fell 22.64 points. [36.]
Treasury bond prices edged higher in reaction to signs of economic weakness. The long Treasury yield hit another low. [43.]
Oil prices fell sharply on reports of a breakthrough in talks on Iraq missile test sites. [45.] The dollar and gold fell. [45.]
 
Your Money
Recent college graduates with no job experience should continue to follow the classic advice: get out of debt, establish a good credit rating, start saving early and set financial goals. [32.]
Many real estate investment trusts are providing eye-catching returns. But are these investments right for everyone? [33.]
The Internal Revenue Service is taking a new tack with tax delinquents, allowing options on how to make payments. [33.]

HEADLINE: Deputy Chosen as Head of New York Fed

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
William J. McDonough, executive vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was named the bank's president yesterday, making him the most powerful official in the Federal Reserve system after the Fed's chairman.
Mr. McDonough had long been rumored to be the first choice of the bank's board, and he had the backing of E. Gerald Corrigan, who will step down as president of the New York Fed on Monday. The bank's board selected him on Thursday, and the Federal Reserve's board of governors in Washington gave its blessing yesterday. 
 Mr. McDonough, 59, the former vice chairman of the First Chicago National Bank, brings to his new post two decades of banking experience, wide international contacts and middle-of-the-road views on monetary and regulatory policy. Those who know the multilingual banker describe him as charming and say he is a pragmatic and deft politician.
In a demonstration of his political skills, Mr. McDonough repeatedly stressed at a news conference yesterday that economic growth was his top priority, something likely to play well at the White House and in Congress. "What we need in the world -- and here -- is sustainable growth," he said.
Mr. McDonough's appointment was applauded in Washington and on Wall Street. "He's really very well educated, not just in an academic sense, but in the practical experience one gets in a lifetime of application of what you know," said Wayne Angell, a governor of the Federal Reserve.
Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company, who has known Mr. McDonough for years, agreed. "Unlike a lot of Fed presidents, he has operated in the real world for a long time," Mr. Kudlow said. "He's had his share of successes and failures and therefore developed a very broad and deep knowledge."
When Mr. McDonough first came to the New York Fed, Mr. Kudlow said, he had one-on-one lunches with Wall Street economists. "That's never been done," Mr. Kudlow said. "It shows he's open."
The New York Fed holds a special place among the Federal Reserve's 12 regional banks. Not only does it oversee some of the largest American banks and brokerage firms, it also conducts the nation's monetary policy through domestic open market operations -- buying and selling government securities -- and through interventions in foreign exchange markets.
Its president is the only one of the regional presidents to hold a permanent voting position on the Federal Open Market Committee, the group that decides whether to raise or lower interest rates.
In his short time as a Fed insider, Mr. McDonough has been head of the bank's foreign desk, including service during the collapse of the European monetary system last summer. Since last August, he has also been in charge of the domestic desk, which conducts open market operations.
"I think Gerry did very good succession planning," said Karen Horn, the president of Banc One of Cleveland, referring to Mr. Corrigan. "He and the search committee chose a good guy, and then he gave him the experiences he needed." Ms. Horn was also considered for the presidency of the New York Fed.
Mr. McDonough's job description was more or less written by Mr. Corrigan, people involved in the selection process said. At the top of the list of requirements were high energy and an ability to deal calmly with various public pressures and crises. In its search, said one person close to the selection process, "the board looked for someone who could handle the policy questions, but more important somebody who could do the plumbing."
One controversial incident in Mr. McDonough's career at First Chicago involved his failure to act on a tip that a lease being negotiated by an executive under him involved improprieties. The lease eventually cost First Chicago $2.1 million, and the executive was jailed for fraud.
"The board looked into the issue," a spokesman for the New York Fed said. "It satisfied itself fully that Mr. McDonough had acted in an entirely appropriate manner."
Mr. Angell said: "I'm fully satisfied. The best assumption is that there was never anything to talk about."
Mr. Corrigan has played a major role in international banking issues. Mr. McDonough, who is well known to foreign central bankers, gently boasted at the news conference yesterday that he could "speak to any central banker in the Western Hemisphere in his own language."
 
Praise for Political Skills
 Mr. McDonough is well regarded in the financial community. "He's very likable, very Irish, and he's got a good political style," said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Securities. Added James Annable, chief economist at First Chicago who worked with Mr. McDonough for years, "He's very, very smooth."
Describing himself, Mr. McDonough said, "The McDonough view of the world is that things are better every day than the day before."
Mr. McDonough, conveniently, is also a Democrat, reportedly another job requirement. "He will be a useful voice within the Fed, which is always negotiating the terrain with the White House and Congress," said Mr. Annable, a former Fed staff member.
Mr. McDonough and his third wife, Suzanne Clarke, live on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He has six children from a former marriage.

HEADLINE: Energy Nominee Faces Battle on Feminist Group

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
In another trying twist for the confirmation of Administration appointees, Senate approval of Tara J. O'Toole as Assistant Secretary of Energy is in serious jeopardy because of her affiliation with a feminist group that formerly characterized itself as Marxist.
The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has delayed scheduling confirmation hearings for Dr. O'Toole indefinitely, and at least two powerful members of the panel have voiced concerns about her nomination for Assistant Secretary of Energy for Environment, Safety and Health. 
 Senators have complained that Dr. O'Toole, a physician and consultant at the Energy Department, has little administrative experience. But they have been most vocal about her membership in a study group, Northeast Feminist Scholars, which was originally called Marxist-Feminist Group I.
That affiliation, included on biographical materials submitted to the committee, raises questions about her philosophy and judgment, conservative senators say. The White House said Dr. O'Toole joined the group several years after it had changed its name.
 
'She Is Superbly Qualified'
 The conservative challenge to Dr. O'Toole comes as Republicans are trying to sidetrack the appointment of Dr. Joycelyn Elders as Surgeon General for her outspoken support for sex education and abortion rights. Administration officials say they will stand by both nominees, who they insist are targets of unfair political aspersions.
"The White House strongly supports her" Jack Gibbons, President Clinton's science adviser, said of Dr. O'Toole. Dr. Gibbons, who was Dr. O'Toole's supervisor at the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, added, "She is an extraordinarily fine scientist with a superb track record."
Dr. Gibbons added that Dr. O'Toole had passed a Federal Bureau of Investigation clearance procedure without problem.
William White, the Deputy Energy Secretary, said: "We believe she is superbly qualified. This Administration and this department do not embrace any Marxist ideology. According to Dr. O'Toole, she does not, either."
Supporters in the Senate have speculated that conservatives do not like certain of Dr. O'Toole's writings that suggest she might make private Energy Department contractors more accountable for errors made in nuclear and other projects.
But Senate critics seized on Dr. O'Toole's membership in the reading group. In a recent interview, Senator Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming, the ranking Republican member of the energy committee, accused President Clinton of nominating someone "from America's radical left fringe." The Senator refused further comment today.
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, another influential Republican member of the energy panel, has also voiced reservations about Dr. O'Toole's political orientation.
Senator J. Bennett Johnston, the Louisiana Democrat who heads the energy committee, would say little about the nomination. "We're getting some more information," he said. He said he doubted the committee would hold hearings until after the August recess, which means the Senate would return the nomination to the White House unless senators unanimously agree to retain her name for confirmation proceedings past the summer.
By returning her name to the White House, senators could kill her nomination without holding a hearing or taking a vote unless the Administration decides it wants to resubmit her name and fight for her nomination in the fall. Democrats want to avoid the political turbulence that accompanied the withdrawal of Zoe Baird as nominee for Attorney General and the withdrawal of Lani Guinier as nominee for Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.
Dr. O'Toole did not return several phone calls to her office today.
Thus far, the Administration has tried to support the nominee. In a July 6 letter to Senators Johnston and Wallop, the White House tried to minimize the importance of Dr. O'Toole's affiliation to the feminist study group.
"Dr. O'Toole has never endorsed Marxist theory, nor has she ever had the impression that any other members of N.F.S. held such beliefs," said the letter, signed by William H. Kennedy, associate counsel to the President.
Mr. Kennedy said Dr. O'Toole first made contact with the group in the fall of 1981, nearly a decade after it was founded and a few years after it changed its name from Marxist-Feminist I. "By the time Dr. O'Toole joined N.F.S.," Mr. Kennedy added, "its discussions had moved beyond economic theory, as applied to the role of women in society, to the consideration of issues related to women and society."
The group meets about three times a year and has a mailing list of about 45 people. The White House letter said Dr. O'Toole had typically led discussions on topics related to medicine and health.
In an accompanying affidavit signed by Dr. O'Toole, she said, "My understanding is that the original title of the group derived from the founding members' desire to engage in an academic and analytical analysis of women's status in society through a variety of theoretical perspectives which included but were not limited to Marxist economic theory."
But officials of the energy panel said it was their understanding that the group still had a radical orientation.
If confirmed, Dr. O'Toole would advise Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary on environmental safety and health policies as well as oversee the security policies for the department's nuclear test sites, offices and other projects.
Dr. O'Toole has worked as a senior analyst at the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, where she was principal analyst and contributor to a report called "Complex Cleanup: The Environmental Legacy of Nuclear Weapons Production."

HEADLINE: RUSSIA IS HALTING ARMS-LINKED SALE

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
Under pressure from the United States, Russia agreed today to halt its planned sale of equipment and technology to India that American experts said could be used to make a ballistic missile, the State Department announced today.
In a compromise that ended a bitter year-long dispute, the United States won Russian approval for the halt of the sale in return for waiving economic sanctions that had been set to go into effect today against two Russian companies involved in the deal. 
 In addition, the agreement held out the prospect of potentially lucrative joint space projects.
The dispute over the missile was the most serious disagreement between Russia and the United States on security issues since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. It also provided the Clinton Administration with the first serious test of its policy of seeking to penalize countries that spread technology for nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and ballistic missiles.
 
Need for Hard Currency
 The disagreement with Russia had taken on large implications because Moscow has argued that it must be able to sell its military hardware and expertise around the world in order to earn hard currency.
Under the agreement, reached late Thursday night after intense discussions at the State Department, Russia agreed to halt the transfer of sophisticated rocket engines and related technology to India under a contract that dates back to the Soviet era, said Lynne Davis, Undersecretary of State for International Security Affairs.
Even more important in the long term, Russia agreed to adhere to terms of the Missile Technology Control Regime, an international agreement that restricts the sale of military technology, as of November 1 and has told the Untied States that it is willing to sign the multinational agreement.
Until now, President Boris N. Yeltsin and other Russian officials have made much vaguer statements indicating that they are abiding by the principles of the missile agreement.
Michael McCurry, the State Department spokesman, said, "This result makes an important contribution to the expanding U.S. partnership with Russia and to our joint efforts to lead the way in the global promotion of nonproliferation."
 
Could Buy Elsewhere
 Some Administration nonproliferation experts complained that the compromise may be meaningless, because they believe that Russia has already shipped much of the technology that India needs and New Delhi could get whatever technology it would still need from another source, possibly China.
Other experts praised the agreement, but noted that it does not address the larger issue of Russia's other military sales around the world as a way to get hard currency.
"The agreement is significant because it bolsters the Missile Technology Control regime and will give Russia's aerospace engineers something to do in Russia rather than in say, North Korea," said John E. Pike, Director of space policy at the Federation of American Scientists. "But the real problem is things like the export of solid rocket propellant to Libya."
The agreement is likely to worsen American relations with India, which argued that it wanted to use the Russian-designed rocket engine to enter the commercial satellite-launching industry and that the engine and the technology have no military use.
 
Fears Missile Race
 The United States, however, fears that India's rocket-launching capability could lead to a missile race on the subcontinent, where tensions are already high because of the weapons buildup and nuclear programs of India and Pakistan.
In May 1992, the Bush Administration imposed sanctions against the state-owned enterprises in both Russia and India involved in the deal and tried to convince both Governments to amend or cancel it.
Last January, during his first visit to India, President Yeltsin promised that he would not buckle under to outside pressure and abandon the deal, which the United States estimated was worth between $200 million and $300 million.
Since then, the Clinton Administration made clear that it would not tolerate the continuation of Russia's fulfillment of its contract, although it recognized that it could do nothing about what may have already been shipped.
In addition to the threat of sanctions, included in legislation co-sponsored last year by then Senator Al Gore, the Administration had also threatened to suspend cooperation in space projects if the deal with India went through.
Under the agreement reached Thursday night, the United States will not compensate Russia monetarily for any financial losses. But the Americans instead told the Russians that their cooperation opens up space projects with the United States, including collaboration between NASA and the Russian space station program and potential contracts for launching American satellites on Russian rockets, that could mean $700 million in commerical trade for Russia in the next seven to eight years.
But in an important concession to Moscow, Russia will be allowed to renegotiate terms for selling some engines, but not the related technology, to India. The United States had initially opposed the transfer of both the engines and the related technology.

HEADLINE: Casino Backers Spent $2 Million in Hartford

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 16

 BODY:
Casino backers spent $2.36 million from January through June to persuade the Connecticut Legislature to allow casinos in the state, according to State Ethics Commission financial reports.
"I'm pretty confident it's the largest amount spent by any one cause," said Brenda Bergeron, staff attorney for the Ethics Commission. 
 A leading opponent of casino gambling, State Senator James Fleming, said: "It proves the battle is not over. It's clear they didn't spend that kind of money in Connecticut to just walk away. I think they'll be back to push a casino."
Gambling interests spent $500,000 in the first three months of the 1993 legislative session and $1.86 million during the last three months, according to reports that were released Thursday.
Despite the lobbying, the efforts did not pay off. Legislative leaders decided in late May not to even vote on a bill that would have allowed casinos to be built and slot machines to be run in Connecticut's pari-mutuel operations.
 
Money for Lobbyists
 Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. had vowed to veto any legislation that expanded legalized gambling, which meant the casino backers would have needed a two-thirds majority in each legislative chamber to guarantee that the bill became law.
Most of the $1.86 million in the session's last months was spent by New City Development Inc., the Hartford-based development arm of Steve Wynn's Mirage Resorts of Las Vegas.
Most of that paid for lobbyists' salaries and public relations work, but some has been spread among legislators in the form of trips, meals, videotapes and brochures.
"It's a lot of money, that's obvious," said Paul McCormick, the New City lawyer who filed the financial report. "A business decision was made by the Mirage to push for access to the Connecticut market. They were willing to spend money. It was a business decision. I don't think it's unusual from that point."
 
Additional Money Spent
 The figures do not include other money spent on lobbying on the casino issue, including the $36,000 that the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Council spent in the first three months of the session to block casino legalization. The tribe, which owns and operates Foxwoods High Stakes Bingo and Casino, wants to maintain its monopoly on casino gambling in Connecticut.
In addition to New City, Harrah's Club -- which had designs on a casino in Bridgeport but kept a lower profile -- spent $51,701 in the last three months of the session. The Connecticut Pari-Mutuel Association added $126,658.
Mr. Weicker has agreed to give the Mashantucket Pequots monopoly rights to operate slot machines at their Ledyard casino in exchange for giving the state a share of the revenues.
The agreement guaranteed the state $113 million this fiscal year and between 25 percent and 30 percent of the gross revenues in later years.
But if anyone else were allowed to operate slot machines, the agreement would be nullified -- a step that legislators were wary of taking in the current stagnant economy.
A report on the casino's finances obtained by The Day in New London shows that Foxwoods may have become the most profitable casino in the country. It posted a profit margin of $20.4 million on total revenue of $40.8 million in June alone, according to the report in the newspaper.

HEADLINE: Palestinian Chief Raises Risky Issue of Jerusalem

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 16

 BODY:
The head of the Palestinian delegation to the Middle East peace talks warned today that negotiations would go nowhere unless Israel gives up the eastern half of Jerusalem, which it captured in the 1967 war and has since annexed.
If Israel's position does not change, "it will kill the peace process," Dr. Haidar Abdel-Shafi, a physician from Gaza, said at a conference in East Jerusalem. "The important thing is that Israel should concede the Palestinian right in Jerusalem." 
 Palestinians want to make East Jerusalem the capital of a hoped-for future state, a goal that runs headlong into Israel's insistence that the city will remain its unified capital forever and that the subject is not open for discussion.
Officials from Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on down have warned that a sure way to scuttle the peace talks is to demand that Jerusalem's status be put on the bargaining table, a position supported by the United States in regard to the present negotiations over an interim form of Palestinian self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
 
Christopher to Visit
 While Dr. Abdel-Shafi's remarks were not new, they cast a somber note over the negotiations at a time when new ideas have begun to surface for breaking an Israeli-Palestinian impasse that is serious enough to have persuaded Secretary of State Warren Christopher to come to the region next month on a rescue mission.
Palestinians and Israelis have both raised the possibility of forming a confederation between the Palestinians and Jordan, and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres reportedly urged the proposal this week on a visiting State Department delegation. On Monday, Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization announced that they would form joint committees to discuss aspects of possible political, economic and juridical relations.
A senior Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erakat, said the Palestinian-Jordanian entity would be a quick way to leap-frog negotiations over an interim agreement in the occupied territories and to move quickly to a final settlement.
"Maybe it is time to really see the possibilities of going directly toward the final status," Mr. Erakat said on Israeli television on Thursday night. "A confederation is one of the serious options for the final status."
 
Peres Sees Simultaneous Talks
 According to the Israeli newspaper reports, Mr. Peres told the visiting Americans that negotiations over a permanent settlement, based on the confederation idea, could take place at the same time as the existing negotiations of interim Palestinian self-rule.
"We would not be skipping over the interim stage, but just saying that at the end we would be implementing confederation," Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin told The Jerusalem Post.
The final word, however, rests with Mr. Rabin, and a spokesman said the Prime Minister stands by the existing formula for the talks. Under that formula, interim self-rule comes first and only then, after a period of adjustment over several years, would there be negotiations over the territories' final status.
Nonetheless, Mr. Rabin himself has not spoken out this time on the matter, even though he was cool to a similar idea when it arose a few months ago. He also presumably would not welcome direct involvement of the P.L.O. Dr. Abdel-Shafi, too, said this week that the P.L.O. had to be changed, with the powers of its chairman, Yasir Arafat, reduced in favor a more democratic, collective leadership.
"I certainly think that Arafat has some qualities that are indispensable in terms of leadership," he told Reuters this week. "But I certainly don't condone Arafat being the source of the decision-making all alone because this is, in my opinion, detrimental to the cause."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
U.S Grows Impatient
 WASHINGTON, July 16 (Special to The New York Times) -- As his aides hinted that the Clinton Administration's patience with the pace of the Middle East peace talks might not last beyond the end of the year, Secretary of State Christopher announced today that he would make the first of what could be a series of trips to the region next month.
Speaking to reporters today, Mr. Christopher played down expectations that his trip would achieve any major breakthroughs in the stalled talks between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Aides to Mr. Christopher said he would visit Cairo, Jerusalem, Amman, Jordan and Damascus, Syria from Aug. 1 to 6, on his way home from a trip to Singapore and Australia.
Michael McCurry, the State Department spokesman, said that if no progress was made in the peace talks this year, "you really have to assess at that point whether it's wise to continue to use the resources of the United States and specifically, the good offices of the Secretary to help the parties."

HEADLINE: Paul W. Wright, 87, Retired Headmaster Of the Groton School

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

 BODY:
Paul W. Wright, a mathematics teacher and retired headmaster of the Groton School, died on Wednesday at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston. He was 87 and lived in Lexington, Mass.
The cause was cancer, a Groton spokesman said. 
 Mr. Wright began his 46-year career at Groton as a math teacher. He was appointed senior master in 1941, and he rose to become the headmaster in 1969, which he remained until his retirement in 1974. He was the fourth headmaster at the school, 30 miles northwest of Boston, since its founding in 1884.
During his tenure, the Episcopal-oriented private preparatory institution underwent major changes. The student body became more diverse, reflecting varied geographic, economic and cultural backgrounds. An advocate of coeducation, Mr. Wright played an important role in preparing the all-boys school for the admission of girls, which occurred shortly after he retired.
"This school never set out to train an elite class of leaders," Mr. Wright said in an interview in 1972 "We want to make our students useful citizens. If an opportunity presents itself to them to exercise leadership, we hope they would do it responsibly."
After retiring from Groton, Mr. Wright began a new career in 1975 as a math teacher at the private Belmont Hill School in Belmont Hill, Mass., teaching there until 1987.
He was born in Bellevue, Ohio, and graduated from high school there. He graduated from Williams College in 1927, magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa.
In 1987, the Paul W. Wright Chair in Mathematics was endowed at Groton by two graduates in his honor. Also that year, the Paul W. Wright Fund was established at Belmont Hill School by parents of students.
Surviving are his wife, the former Margaret Ann Gainer; two sons, James of Martha's Vineyard, Mass., and Paul of Princeton, N.J.; a daughter, Christina of Lexington, Mass., and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Treasury Bond Prices Rise Slightly

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices edged higher yesterday in reaction to further signs of economic weakness.
The 30-year Treasury bond rose 8/32 , while its yield slipped to 6.54 percent, from 6.56 percent on Thursday. 
 For the seventh session in a row, the 30-year bond's yield hit its lowest level since the Treasury started regular auctions of the bonds in 1977.
Shorter-term maturities were mostly unchanged and intermediate securities ranged from 1/32 lower to 1/32 higher, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported.
Traders said the 30-year bond strengthened after a report that the preliminary numbers from the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index showed a drop to 76.9 in early July from 81.5 in June.
The Government reported yesterday that industrial production fell two-tenths of a percent in June, the first decline since September.
The news of economic sluggishness lent further support to market expectations of low inflation, following figures this week showing flat consumer inflation in June.
The market had little or no reaction to merchandise trade figures released by the Commerce Department showing the trade deficit narrowed sharply, to $8.37 billion, in May.
The market's attention now turns to Congressional testimony scheduled for Tuesday by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, who will give members of the House Banking committee his seminannual report on central bank monetary policy. Now that the inflation scare of earlier this year has subsided, the Fed is considered less likely to tighten short-term interest rates as a way to rein in inflation pressures.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.66, to 1,313.64 yesterday.
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was unchanged at 3 percent, while the discount rate on six-month bills dropped one basis point, or hundredth of a percentage point, to 3.11 percent. The discount rate on one-year bills also slipped a basis point, to 3.24 percent.
The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 3 percent, down from 3 1/8 percent late Thursday.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 103 1/32 , unchanged from late Thursday. The average yield to maturity remained at 5.69 percent.

HEADLINE: Industrial Output Off 0.2% in June

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
Production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities fell two-tenths of 1 percent in June and did not rise in May as previously thought, the Federal Reserve Board reported today.
The report reflected the doldrums into which much of industry has sunk this spring. While industry represents less than one-third of the economy, activity in this sector, which tends to swing more widely than elsewere, is regarded as one of the best indicators of current conditions. 
 Other data released today expressed the effects of the weakness. The University of Michigan's preliminary July index of consumers' confidence in the economy fell to 76.9, from 81.5 in June.
Last month's decline in industrial output, the first since September, was attributed mainly to lower production of cars, light trucks, appliances and room air-conditioners, but nondurable consumer goods were also weak. And the Fed revised the previously reported two-tenths of 1 percent gain in May to show output unchanged in that month.
But even though June output, at 10.1 percent above its 1987 average, was no greater than in March, analysts said the result was not surprising in light of an earlier report showing a drop in factory payrolls and hours worked.
 
Decline Explained
 And, citing strong car sales through June, they said production would probably pick up after the usual summer plant shutdowns to replenish stocks.
"The decline in industrial production does not signal a new lapse into recession, but rather is due to the overbuilding of inventories in the first quarter," said Gordon Richards, economist for the National Association of Manufacturers.
Motor vehicle assembly slumped 4.7 percent last month to a 10.2 million annual pace as manufactuers took advantage of strong demand to cut stockpiles.
Nonetheless, there were soft spots, including a 1.5 percent decline in production of goods for the home and a resumption in the decline for construction supplies.
"The economy is losing momentum," observed Susan Hering, an economist at Salomon Brothers. "It wasn't strictly cars."
 
Utility Output Surges
 The June decline in the Industrial Production Index would have been more severe had not utility output surged 1.3 percent as unusually hot weather pushed up demand for residential electricity.
Factory output itself fell three-tenths of 1 percent following a one-tenth of 1 percent May decline while mining, where a drop in coal output swamped a rise in oil and gas, fell seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Today's report also showed that industry operated at 81.2 percent of capacity last month, down from 81.5 percent in May.
Production of consumer goods, the Fed report also showed, tumbled seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Excluding cars and trucks, total industrial production edged down one-tenth of 1 percent but consumer goods, without them, slipped five-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls as Data Show Sluggish Economy in U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most major currencies yesterday as economic news from the United States and monetary turmoil abroad competed for traders' attentions.
Gold prices also fell. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the actively traded gold contract for August delivery fell $1 an ounce, to $392.90. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted spot gold at $392.25 an ounce, down 85 cents. 
 "We had some very mediocre news on the U.S. economy today," said Randolph Donney, director of capital market research at the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
The Federal Reserve reported that industrial production and capacity utilization both fell in June. Also, Mr. Donney said, the University of Michigan reported that consumer sentiment dropped sharply in early July.
The negative news tended to weaken the dollar, he said. A weak economy generally portends lower interest rates, driving investors abroad where they can find higher yields.
The dollar initially rose yesterday after reports that the merchandise trade deficit narrowed significantly in May and that the trade gap with Japan fell by the largest amount in more than six years. But the weak domestic economic news pushed the dollar down.
"My overall feeling is the market is just looking for an excuse for some profit taking," said Hillel Waxman, chief foreign exchange dealer at the Bank Leumi Trust Company in New York.
Weakness in the French franc and Danish krone had heightened concerns about the viability of Europe's exchange rate system this week.
But successful intervention by European central banks to support the krone yesterday, led by the Bundesbank of Germany and the Bank of France, eased those fears somewhat, Mr. Donney said. That helped European currencies against the dollar.
In New York, the dollar was quoted at 107.55 yen late yesterday, down from 108.01 yen Thursday. The dollar dropped to 1.7160 German marks from 1.7205 marks.
The British pound also slipped, falling to $1.4860 in New York, from $1.4915 on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Stubborn Forest Fires Hit Drought Areas

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Like a bad idea borrowed from California, stubborn fires are burning above and below the forest floor in the drought-afflicted areas of New York and New Jersey, wearing out firefighters, forcing state police to close smoky roads and stinging the eyes and noses of people living miles away.
At West Point, where nearly 900 acres have burned, two Army Huey helicopters flew 150 missions yesterday to drop water on fires smoldering on inaccessible hillsides. Across the Hudson River at Camp Smith in Peekskill, a National Guard base, scores of volunteer firefighters plan to converge today to seal off a fire that has consumed at least 100 acres. 
 In between, the New York State Police have intermittently closed Route 6 near the Bear Mountain bridge because of smoke, and fire departments as far south as Yonkers and Mamaroneck have reported receiving calls from residents who smelled smoke.
Both those fires are believed to have started accidentally, said Capt. Raymond A. Wood, regional forest ranger for the Department of Environmental Conservation. "As hot as it was when the fires started, you would not be out in the woods unless you had to be," he said.
 
10 Days of Burning
 But in Brentwood, L.I., volunteer firefighters by yesterday had spent 10 days in a sweltering effort, so far unsuccessful, to extinguish a string of stubborn brush fires that they say must be the work of arsonists.
The smoldering Long Island fires, using a six-inch layer of decayed pine needles and leaves on the forest floor as fuel, began July 6 east the Sagtikos Parkway in an area of the Pine Barrens, known as oak brush plains, that abuts residential neighborhoods.
In New Jersey, 140 fires, most of them small, have been reported this month, state officials say. The largest covered 40 acres at the Atsion Recreation Area of the Wharton State Forest, in Burlington County.
Stephen J. Maurer, a fire warden in the New Jersey Environmental Protection and Energy Department, said that because the fires had burrowed into the leaves and debris on the forest floor, it was hard to tell when they were really out. That means "a number of people being there a lot longer than normal," he added.
The fires at Camp Smith and elsewhere have not burned many trees, only the debris and peat that form the first few inches of the forest floor. Firefighters do not think the trees themselves are dry enough to catch fire.
 
Waiting for Rain
 On Long Island, afternoon winds keep fanning embers back into flames, complained Lawrence E. Rex, chief of the Brentwood Fire Department. "It just keeps on flaring up," he said.
At Camp Smith, Chief Walter L. Groden, who is the fire coordinator for Westchester County, said: "Short of a week of rain, there is no practical or economically feasible method of extinguishing this fire at this point."
Camp Smith, a 2,000-acre installation owned by the state and used mostly for weekend guard training, is not part of any fire district and does not have a fire brigade of its own. Col. John A. Cusack, the commander, said that firefighters could build fire breaks to contain the fire but that it would burn "until it consumes its own fuel, or it rains."
The fires are the flip side of the floods in the Middle West; some of the rain that keeps falling in areas drained by the Mississippi River would in normal times be falling here, making the brush less fire-prone.
Instead, the fires here this year are much more numerous and stubborn than usual, fire officials say, and are the worst since at least the summer of 1988, when a six-week hot spell set up similar conditions.
 
Cutting Fire Roads
 All over, the firefighters have been hampered by terrain and distance from water supplies.
On Long Island, bulldozers and what firefighters call brush trucks, specially equipped to make roads into the woods, have cut fire roads and scores of swaths through the woods, flattening hundreds of pitch pines and scrub oaks. Soda cans left by thirsty volunteers litter some areas. In others, freshly felled trees lying in the smoking humus have ignited, adding to firefighters' woes.
While no houses have been damaged by the fires, the smell of smoke hung over many neighborhoods, putting residents on edge. "It's getting kind of scary," said Doris Valez, whose home on Princess Lane in Brentwood is bordered by a woods where firefighters fought a second brush fire yesterday. Chief Rex said that fire began when someone poured gasoline on a makeshift shack and set it ablaze.
Several hundred firefighters from 20 volunteer departments on the Island fought the fires at their peak. Officials said 35 volunteers have suffered heat exhaustion, and 10 had to be taken to area hospitals.
At West Point, 20 firefighters from the town of Highland Falls were working with 20 members of an Army engineering platoon. Not only does the terrain make access difficult in some areas, but one fire was burning in an area that is permanently off-limits because it is used as the "impact area" for artillery and other weapons, said Major Keith Trohoske, a spokesman. That fire was put out by dumping water from helicopters, he said.

HEADLINE: In Newark, Criminals Face a New Challenge: Officers on Bikes

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
Three bicyclists cruised easily down the streets of Newark, drawing stares from motorists who slowed down to let them pass.
The reason for the stares could have been the bikers' attire, a bit unusual given the above-100-degree heat: black biking shorts under short black pants, black short-sleeved shirts, black wraparound sunglasses and black bulletproof vests. If that wasn't enough to attract attention, there were the big neon-yellow words on the backs of their shirts: Newark Police Department. 
 The three bikers are officers who have forsaken their air-conditioned cars and foot patrols to join Newark's 10-member police bicycle squad, which will complete its first year in August.
At first, the Newark Police Director, William R. Celester, was not sure it was a good idea to use a bike squad to help police a city of more than 275,000 people. It took a little research and some prodding from Newark community boards and police officers to convince him.
 
An Experiment Pays Off
 "The research indicated that the bikes were more economical than patrol cars and more effective on street corners than foot patrols," Mr. Celester said. "And they were right. The bicycle program is one of the most effective police programs we have."
Newark, with a police force of 1,200 officers, is not alone in taking advantage of the two-wheel route to fighting crime, Mr. Celester said. More than 350 cities worldwide use bicycle officers to patrol their streets, including at least 15 cities and towns in New Jersey.
Bicycle squads are growing more popular because of their versatility, said Sgt. George Barr, 44, the dean of the squad, who has been with it from the start. Sergeant Barr said his officers can do things that would be daunting, if not impossible, for other officers.
"There are almost no disadvantages to riding bicycles on patrol," said Sergeant Barr, an avid cyclist even before his assignment to the bicycle squad. "We can get to places cars can't and we can go faster than a foot patrolman. In fact, there have been a couple of times that the bicycle policemen have beaten everyone else to a crime scene, even the patrol cars."
 
Element of Surprise
 The novelty of the squad has also been an advantage, Mr. Celester said.
"At first, no one had heard of police officers around here being on bicycles, so no one would pay any attention to the bikes," he said. "They were able to ride up on a crime scene and no one would move.
"Now, I think people are getting used to them being on bike, but they are so effective that it doesn't matter," he said. "I'd like to see someone else on a bicycle or on foot try to outrun one of these officers."
Out in the streets, the officers occasionally stop to remind a wayward motorist of the illegality of double-parking or to chat with someone about a problem in the neighborhood.
"One of the good things about these bikes is we can see just about everything," said Officer Raphael Bermudez, 37, as he patrolled the Hawkins Street Housing Complex with Sergeant Barr and Officer Rosa Torres, 35, the newest squad member. Within a couple of minutes, the three officers had circled through the entire complex and regrouped under a convenient shade tree.
"On a bike, I can see into cars, in backyards, up through windows, across traffic and other places that you would never be able to see from a car," Officer Bermudez said. "In fact, the other day I was riding by a parked car and saw this guy slumped down under the wheel. Apparently, he had suffered from heatstroke while sitting in the car. If I had been passing by in a car, I probably would have never seen him."
The officers usually work in groups of three, and no matter what happens, one officer keeps an eye on the bikes. The bikes' biggest disadvantage, Sergeant Barr said, is that they are far easier to steal than patrol cars.
"I don't think the Mayor would too much appreciate us letting one of these custom-ordered bicycles get stolen," Sergeant Barr said.
 
Customized Wheels
 The squad rides Schwinn mountain bikes, each one customized for the officer who rides it, with additions like strobe lights, electronic horns, spotlights and miniature computers with speedometers. And the officers have added a few extras of their own, including parking brakes made from rubber bands to help on the city's steep hills.
"This is still a developing program," Sergeant Barr said. "Every time we go out, we learn something new or see something else we need, so sometimes we just improvise."
As the officers relaxed under the tree, several neighborhood children pulled up on their bicycles and started asking questions.
"This usually happens when we come out into the neighborhoods," Officer Torres said. "One day we had so many children who wanted to ride around the block with us that it was beginning to block the traffic."
The bicycle squad works with community boards and other groups, giving speeches and setting up bicycle safety seminars for children.
"We're sort of semi-celebrities now," Officer Torres said. "We've been on television and in parades, so children see our uniforms and come up and talk to us. I see us as role models for them, to show them that police officers are human, too."
 
'We Get as Much Respect'
 This doesn't mean the bikers are not serious, Officer Bermudez cautioned.
"We are still police officers and we do actual work," he said. "We've ran down suspects before and pulled over cars in the middle of the street. We get as much respect as any other policeman, because we represent the city as much as anyone else."
Between August and December 1992, the bicycle squad questioned 165 suspects and made 35 arrests. Since then, the officers have added 77 arrests and questioned 146 suspects, a very respectable number for a new unit, Mr. Celester said. Almost a third of the cases are drug-related, he said.
The Newark bicycle squad is the first in New Jersey to work year-round, instead of just in the summer, Mr. Celester said. Because of the program's year-round success, Mr. Celester plans to expand the number of officers in the unit next month to 16.
"Of course, we have more appropriate uniforms in the winter," Sergeant Barr said, looking down at his short pants and short-sleeved shirt. "The weather conditions are really not much of a concern right now."
"Well, as far as the heat goes, we drink a lot of water," Sergeant Barr said. "The only weather conditions that the officers don't go out in on bike is when it gets below 30 degrees or it's a heavy downpour."
So what does a bicycle officer do in bad weather?
"When it gets like that, we have to suit up for foot patrol," Sergeant Barr said, smiling. "We usually end up outside anyway."

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Is Cut as Japan Imbalance Narrows

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
The nation's deficit in traded goods narrowed sharply in May, to $8.4 billion, mainly reflecting the biggest reduction in the imbalance with Japan in over six years, the Commerce Department reported today.
Exports resumed their rise despite lower aircraft sales, reaching the second-highest level on record, while imports of foreign goods tumbled. 
 Although the decline in the deficit was somewhat larger than expected, analysts noted that the economies of many of the United States' trading partners remained weak and that American imports were likely to rebound as growth in the United States picked up.
Moreover, the lowered deficit with Japan was thought by some analysts to have been politically manipulated by Tokyo before it was host to the summit meeting of the seven leading industrial nations earlier this month.
"They probably delayed some shipments and persuaded some of their trading companies to speed up imports," said Edward Guay, an economist for the Cigna Corporation, the large insurer. At $3.8 billion, the American trade deficit with Japan was $1.7 billion less than in April, the biggest drop since December 1986.
Unlike the overall trade figures, the data for individual countries are not adjusted for recurring seasonal variation, so comparisons are not exact.
Other analysts here noted that Japan this week reported June figures showing its surplus with the United States rising again.
Still, it appeared that the yen's strength against the dollar has made at least some dent in the trade imbalance. The rising Japanese currency, which has hit records in recent weeks, has made Japanese cars more costly here and makes American cars more competitive at home, so long as Detroit does not raise prices too aggressively.
The United States bought $1.6 billion of new cars from Japan in May, down from $2 billion in April, today's report showed. The total was $1.5 billion in May 1992.
At the Group of Seven summit meeting, the Clinton Administration reached an agreement on a new framework for trade that while avoiding numerical targets could aid American penetration of Japanese markets.
 
Industrial Supplies Strongest
 Exports rose in May by 1.2 percent, to $39 billion, with the strongest sector, industrial supplies and materials, up $600 million. There were small declines in motor vehicles, parts and engines, in foods, feeds and beverages and in the other goods category.
The drop in imports reflected a $600 million decline in automotive goods and lesser declines for consumer goods, industrial supplies and capital goods, the report showed.
May's $8.4 billion deficit followed two months in which the deficit was more than $10 billion, a level thought unlikely to be sustained. One reason is that many American exporters have worked themselves into such good competitive shape that they can sell even in fragile overseas economies.
The monthly trade report covers only trade in merchandise and ignores private services like insurance that last year generated a surplus equal to about two-thirds the merchandise deficit.
The nation's bill for imported oil edged down $200 million, to $3.5 billion, in May as volume fell 10 million barrels while the average price was nearly unchanged at $16.72.
 
Deficit With Canada Drops
 The overall deficit with Canada, the nation's largest trading partner, declined $40 million, to $828 million, while the surplus with Western Europe shrunk by $118 million, the department also found.
The deficit widened with South Korea but narrowed with Taiwan and Singapore while the American surplus with Hong Kong expanded. The deficit with China, however, swelled $300 million, to $1.8 billion, a level 50 percent higher than in May 1992.
Trade in advanced technology products generated a $2.7 billion surplus, $100 million less than in April.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Two Views on REIT's: Buy Them. Avoid Them.

BYLINE: By Jeanne B. Pinder

 BODY:
MANY real estate investment trusts are providing the kind of returns that would catch any investor's attention. But should every investor buy?
One expert who says yes is Gregory J. Whyte, first vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds, a leader in REIT's, which are a kind of mutual fund that buys real estate or mortgages, converts them into securities and passes any profit on to investors. 
 "These are great investments for individual investors," Mr. Whyte said. "I'm called every day by people asking, 'What should I buy for widows and orphans?' My response is, 'Don't buy one, buy two or three -- diversify.' But I do think you want to buy quality."
One expert who takes a different approach is John Fosheim of Green Street Advisors, a Newport Beach, Calif., firm that analyzes real estate trusts. If an investor asks about individual REIT's, which are traded like stocks, Mr. Fosheim said: "I would tell them not to, but the reason is not that I don't like REIT's. When individual investors call here, we tell them, 'Listen, this thing is fraught with danger.' Most individual investors get too focused on the wrong thing -- the dividend -- and don't ask the right questions, about interest rates and cash flows and management. Our suggestion to individual investors who want to buy a REIT is always the same: go buy a low-cost mutual fund and let the experts do it for you."
A primary factor in the popularity of REIT's is their returns. Publicly traded ones had an average total return of 19.11 percent in the first quarter, said the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, an industry group based in Washington, compared with a 4.28 percent total return on the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks. In the second quarter, all publicly traded REIT's had a negative return of 2.8 percent, compared with a .5 percent gain for the S.& P. 500. While it is unwise to generalize about a sag in REIT fortunes from such sketchy figures, many real estate experts say that a lot of smart money bought REIT stocks in the last two years, and that bargains and opportunities are now a lot harder to come by.
There are ample reasons for investor caution. The trusts have been around since 1960, and they have a record of booms and crashes -- including a memorable crash in the early 1970's that burned a lot of investors. Even more important, not all REIT's are stars. For example, apartments are among the best real estate investments right now, but office buildings are generally considered a less desirable investment because of the glut of office space.
It also pays to remember the history of the real estate industry. The crash in values that followed the boom of the 1980's shocked traditional lenders, and most of them have stopped or sharply reduced their lending for real estate.
So real estate owners are now trying to get financing on the public markets, from average investors. And this gives some real estate experts pause -- because it means the public is paying more for buildings and mortgages than experts will pay.
"Right now, pricing for real estate is higher on Wall Street than it is on Main Street," Mr. Fosheim said. He went on to say that there were two ways of interpreting this: a bear would say it's time to get out of real estate, while a bull would say that the public markets are predicting where the private market will go -- up.
A big part of the decision of whether to buy, and what to buy, depends on research. Some people familiar with real estate trusts say that proper assessment of their risks and rewards requires an understanding of real estate that the average investor does not have. Others say experienced investors should be able to judge a REIT from public financial information and the other sources used in researching the purchase of any stock.
Richard B. Saltzman, managing director in the real estate department of Merrill Lynch, a giant in the REIT industry, said: "If they're comfortable buying individual stocks on their own, they should have the wherewithal to decide whether a real estate company makes more sense than high technology or whatever other kind of company they're considering investing in."
Mr. Saltzman and others said that probably the most important factor to consider in contemplating a REIT purchase was the quality of its managers: their reputation, experience and record of increasing assets' value. If management owns a lot of the stock, he notes, it increases the chances that it will look out for the interests of stockholders.
Prospective buyers should also try to evaluate the company's current portfolio. Some things to look for are the kind of property the trust owns, diversity of assets (many experts believe that REIT's should stay with one kind of property, for example, residential or shopping centers, to make the best use of management's experience), its income-generating ability and location (economically troubled Southern California could be a bad sign).
Beyond that, the standard issues -- general risk, capital structure, balance sheet, conflicts of interest and the like -- should be considered.
The Securities and Exchange Commission had $3.2 billion of deals in registration at the end of June in initial and secondary offerings for equity REIT's alone, Mr. Whyte said, and more in mortgage and hybrid REIT's.
That flood, he said, means that the search for quality is more important than ever, and that investors should "beware the naked swimmers."
"It's only when the tide goes out that you see who's been swimming naked," he said. "Frankly, I think that the tide is pretty phenomenal right now. In fact, you're seeing a tidal wave."

Primo, Power And Amateur Athletics

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

DATELINE: BUFFALO

 BODY:
PRIMO NEBIOLO was still on a high as he reflected on the celebration of his 70th birthday a day earlier. He'd received an honorary degree in the morning, and in the evening received 200 guests at a reception honoring the occasion.
Today, he was a year older, still rich, still powerful and healthy enough to enjoy it. Nebiolo is also the president -- some might say, emperor -- of the International Amateur Athletic Federation. 
 Frequently painted as a dictator who rules with a heavy hand and an iron will, Nebiolo is credited, almost without exception, with making track and field a lucrative international sport as well as the spine of the Olympic movement.
Largely because of his position, he found his way onto the International Olympic Committee, even though Italy already had the maximum two seats. I.O.C. President Juan Antonio Samaranch created two wild-card seats, one of which went to Nebiolo.
He does not apologize for enjoying power. In Italian, his first name translates as "first."
"I believe that all big men in life want to get some position for themselves," Nebiolo said. "We say a lady wants to continue to be nice. A man wants to continue to be important."
While Nebiolo has made track and field lucrative at an international level, many athletes chafe under his control. One of the world's best-known athletes is challenging his power.
A day before Nebiolo's birthday, a federal judge reaffirmed an earlier ruling awarding $27.3 million to Butch Reynolds, the world record-holder in the 400 meters. Reynolds sued the I.A.A.F. after he allegedly failed a drug test in 1990. The I.A.A.F. issued a 28-month ban.
In typical bulldog fashion, Nebiolo said the I.A.A.F. would pay nothing to Reynolds.
"Never, never. He can live 200 years," Nebiolo said.
Nebiolo pointed out with some pride that the I.O.C. will require all amateur athletes to sign a waiver to the effect that they will take their grievances before a special arbitration panel, not to courts of law.
If they don't sign, they don't compete. But what happens if the world's top athletes refuse to compete?
Nebiolo shook his head. "Impossible," he said. "That method will never materialize."
There is no Primo Nebiolo on the landscape of amateur athletics in the United States, and for this, many breathe a sigh of relief.
But our amateur-sports movement certainly needs a Primo. Or at least a tough, strong-willed figure to give it some energy.
The United States does not have sports kings and emperors. We prefer to let amateur athletics operate in a largely unregulated Wild West dominated by tycoons, speculators and investors.
A special-interest group like the National Collegiate Athletic Association polices itself, creates rules that either maximize profits -- in the name of academics -- or eliminate problem athletes in the name of academic reform. All the while, the N.C.A.A. tells the government to keep out of its business.
Actually, the amateur-athletic movement in the United States needs more rigorous government involvement: The development of young athletes -- the basic exposure of young people to organized competition -- is wretched for a country with such abundant human resources.
The responsibility for development has largely been left to colleges or assumed by the private sector. And this is precisely why the Olympic movement -- outside of track and field, basketball and boxing -- lacks diversity.
Officials in the various national governing bodies maintain that development programs are improving, but access to those programs for athletically gifted, but economically disadvantaged, youngsters is limited.
Even in our bread-and-butter amateur sports -- swimming, track and boxing -- the United States is seeing the gap between itself and the rest of the world being closed by countries that have decided to make their mark in global sports and are pushing to do so.
The idea behind building solid amateur sports programs is not simply to produce Olympians, but to introduce a variety of sports to a wider, more economically diverse groups of young people.
There is simply too much idle time and too few opportunities for young people to use athletics to scale the walls of their insulated worlds.
So while amateur sports in the United States may be better off without an emperor like Nebiolo, the movement certainly needs a Primo at the top.

HEADLINE: Helping Disturbed Children

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Having interned for a year at a not-for-profit child guidance agency where disturbed children are treated, I must take issue with Louise Armstrong and her book "And They Call It Help" (June 20). 
 At my agency -- and I believe it is representative of those throughout the country -- children were assessed with enormous care and caution. At no time during my tenure was a child treated simply because he was a nuisance to his parents or teachers, as Ms. Armstrong states.
To suggest that mental health workers, who typically have two to six years of graduate education, are unaware of the pitfalls of diagnostic labeling, or the economic etiology of many of our clients' problems, is ludicrous and insulting.
Child therapy modalities include play therapy, where the therapist and the child play with toys, or play board games; drawing; manipulating Play-Doh, and storytelling, perhaps aided by hand puppets. None of these techniques could be considered cruel or repressive. Children seem to benefit from them, and look forward to their next session.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: The Diamond District;
The Sparkle's Back on 47th

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
TENANTS at 20 West 47th Street are asking their landlord, Frank Ring, about expansion space. And 10 West 47th Street and 580 Fifth Avenue, at the corner of 47th Street, have waiting lists.
At the corner of 48th Street, 589 Fifth Avenue had a 48 percent vacancy rate less than three years ago. Today, only 6 percent of its space is left, and that's going fast. 
 "We could conceivably be fully occupied within the next three months," said Jane Haigney, the building's marketing director.
After a couple of rocky years, real estate prospects are again shining in the diamond district, that long, bustling 47th Street block from the Avenue of the Americas to Fifth Avenue.
Rents, which had been plummeting at a sickening speed, are firming in the $30's for the Fifth Avenue buildings, and in the $20's for the older buildings on 47th Street.
Diamond companies that had shrunk to survive the last few lean years are expanding again. And manufacturers and dealers that were driven out in the 1980's by overcrowding and soaring rents are returning.
"People who drifted to 46th and 48th or even to the 30's are starting to drift back," said Kenneth F. Kahn, a general partner in 10 West 47th Street and 580 Fifth Avenue. And they are drifting into larger quarters, added Mr. Ring.
"People who used to only want 300 to 1,000 square feet are now asking about 3,000- to 6,000-square-foot units," he said.
In fact, many of the newly expanding firms are migrating to the east side of Fifth Avenue, crossing what had once been an inviolable psychological boundary. The East Side buildings, notably 579 Fifth Avenue, at the corner of 47th Street, and 589 Fifth Avenue, are newer, and have higher security. And, they are close to 580 Fifth Avenue, home to the Diamond Club and considered the industry's psychological, if not physical, heart.
The impact on the East Side buildings has been enormous. When Axel Stawski and his partners bought 579 Fifth Avenue five years ago, it was vacant. Today, it is 94 percent occupied, with rents from the mid-$20's to about $40.
"The two trends -- toward the eastern end of 47th Street, and toward modern space -- have both helped us a lot," Mr. Stawski said.
What has also helped, of course, is the diamond industry's fiscal health. Unlike New York's real estate industry, the city's diamond industry seems to have come through the recession relatively unscathed.
Its collective bank debt of $450 million has not gone up appreciably in the last few years. Although the average value per-carat of the diamonds that have been selling has gone down -- $472 last year, from $517 in 1991 and $537 in 1990 -- the volume of gems imported and sold has increased each year.
"We keep seeing articles that say the diamond industry is in trouble, but in fact relatively few people have had to close shop," said Lloyd Jaffe, chairman of the American Diamond Industry Association.
The upbeat news is particularly cheerful to Manhattan officials, who decided this year that the city had not been properly mindful of the industry's importance and needs.
In February, Borough President Ruth W. Messinger's office released a comprehensive study of the diamond industry -- it's makeup (one surprise: 57 percent of the industry's employees are nonwhite, despite its long reputation as a Jewish enclave), its employee base (23,000 and growing) and its contribution to the city ($57 million in annual tax revenues alone).
"This is an industry that really wants to be in New York, and we've just never paid enough attention to it," said Andy Breslau, Ms. Messinger's press secretary.
CLEARLY, that is changing. Ms. Messinger's office has sponsored workshops on how to deal with competition from Antwerp, Hong Kong, Tel Aviv and other international diamond centers. It has arranged for technology assistance grants from the state to help find ways to cut down on gem loss in processing.
It plans seminars to help family-owned businesses better incorporate nonfamily employees into their succession plans, should other family members not want to take over. And it has committed $780,000 to capital improvements around 47th Street, to make it more secure, attractive and what Mr. Breslau calls "more pedestrian friendly." Among the possible changes: Entry archways to 47th Street on Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas, prominently tagged "Diamond Jewelry Way."
"The street is thriving, but its retail tenants are facing more competition than ever before," said Eric L. Waldron, whose company, Waldron Associates, manages 36 West 47th Street. "If the city can improve the street's image, it's lighting and it's security, we'll all be able to compete with the suburban malls and the discount jewelers."
District landlords are not waiting for the city to move. They are busily caring for their own buildings, particularly from a security standpoint. Many have put in extra guards, new alarm systems, and intercoms and closed-circuit cameras to check on visitors. Some of the newer buildings, like 579 and 589 Fifth Avenue, have sophisticated electronic systems that require key cards to get from a staircase to any floor, and that set off alarms if any staircase door is held open too long.
"We realized that by offering a really secure building, we could woo tenants across the Avenue," said Philip Shapiro, an Edward S. Gordon associate director who is leasing agent for 579 Fifth.
Security certainly lured E.W. International Diamond Inc. from an older building on 47th Street to 579 Fifth Avenue.
"PEOPLE could wander in and out of our old building," said Abraham S. Elias, E.W.'s vice president and co-owner. "We never had a problem, but we didn't want to take a chance." Recently, Mr. Elias expanded onto another floor at 579 Fifth Avenue. "We could probably move to a less secure building for $10 a foot less, but you don't want to have to worry when you open and close your place," he said.
But owners of older buildings are not giving up their tenants without a fight. Mr. Waldron says that 36 West 47th Street is almost full, and solvent; a couple of years ago, it was half-empty and bankrupt. His company has heightened the building's security substantially, as well as simplified the escalation clauses on leases, offered low rent and good free-rent packages to new tenants, and renegotiated older leases that called for above-market rents.
"We did a concerted marketing effort, and we offered good deals," he said. "One thing about 47th Street, when you offer good deals, the word of mouth is tremendous."
Actually, on 47th Street, word of mouth is the prime marketing tool. New York's diamond industry, despite it's multibillion-dollar size, is one in which business is done on handshakes, and personal relationships and trust often mean more than lines of credit. Because most diamond companies do not need much space -- a 400-foot booth on a diamond exchange, or a 700-foot upstairs spot for manufacturing and administrative offices would be large -- brokers rarely get involved in space negotiations. Instead, building owners walk the streets, introducing themselves to potential tenants and schmoozing with existing tenants, in hopes that they will pass the word to their cousins or sisters or brothers-in-law in the business.
For two years, management at 589 Fifth Avenue wined and dined its own tenants, asking them what they would like to see improved in the building -- queries that resulted in an extra security guard in the lobby, a beefed up maintenance staff, and a switch away from rent escalations tied to the consumer price index or porter's wages, and to flat pass-alongs of direct operating expenses and taxes. It cold-called diamond dealers and manufacturers up and down 47th Street, and sent them a steady stream of promotional premiums -- clocks, shoeshine kits, matchbook calculators, boxes of tissues -- all prominently marked with 589's logo.
"In the last year and a half, only two of the 35 deals we've done involved brokers," said Ms. Haigney. "Here, you rent when people get to know you. They just walk in your door and talk."

A Taxation Tempest Over Private Schools

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
IT has been chapter, verse and law since time immemorial: Thou shalt not tax private schools.
But officials of the 81 independent secondary schools in Connecticut are watching with apprehension as the trial date nears for a landmark lawsuit filed in Superior Court in Hartford challenging the Town of Windsor's right to levy a property tax on the Loomis ChaffeeSchool, founded there in 1897. 
 Beginning in 1992 the school has been taxed $65,000 a year on 28 units of faculty housing on the 300-acre campus. The school has appealed the assessment, and is seeking to recover the taxes, paid under protest, and to get assurance from the court that it will not be taxed in future.
No matter what the outcome of the suit, filed in May 1922, the loser is expected to file an appeal in State Supreme Court.
It is not unusual for private schools and their host towns to negotiate taxes on non-educational facilities. It is common for the schools to contribute substantial amounts informally to the towns in lieu of taxes.
Loomis Chaffee has not been forthcoming in that respect, said Joseph L. Hammer, an attorney at Day, Berry & Howard in Hartford, who is handling the town's defense.
Consequently, and without any mandate more specific than a state statute exempting from taxes property used exclusively for education, the town, in need of additional revenue, has chosen to tax faculty housing as noneducational property.
"All municipalities have an obligation to taxpayers to examine the real estate within their borders and to determine that all property owners are legally paying a proper tax," Mr. Hammer said. "There is no uniform application of law or custom across the 169 towns, but the fact that similar institutions are being taxed is evidence of support for Windsor's position."
Loomis Chaffee has an unusual charter, granted in 1874 by the General Assembly: It exempted the school from taxes as long as it remained an educational institution.
"It's conceivable that the court would decide the case based on the charter and make it unique to Loomis," said William H. Narwold, an attorney at Cummings & Lockwood in Hartford, who represents the school. "Over the years the town has raised the issue of taxing Loomis Chaffee more than once, but legal opinions by town attorneys have indicated that there was no authority to do so. Now Windsor is looking for revenue and took another shot at it."
Windsor is not alone in interpreting the law as excluding from tax exemption such nonacademic facilities as faculty housing, buildings rented to outsiders and excess land.
Choate Rosemary Hall in Wallingford, which dates back to the late 17th century, has $125 million worth of property, including more than 100 buildings on 425 acres. For many years it has paid up to $30,000 in property taxes on faculty housing, accommodations that were rented to visiting parents, and off-campus holdings.
The Kent School in Kent pays more than $76,000 on noneducational facilities, and Hotchkiss School in Lakeville gives about $50,000 a year to the Town of Salisbury. "I use the term gift, not payment in lieu of taxes, to emphasize the fact that nonprofit schools are not taxable," said Robert A. Oden Jr., the Hotchkiss headmaster.
Estimates by most school business managers indicated that some towns would receive less in taxes on noneducational property than they did as donations.
"There is much interest in this suit, not only in Connecticut but everywhere," said David A. Mitchell, business manager of the Taft School in Watertown. The Internal Revenue Service recently held an investigation there to determine why faculty housing was not taxable to employees as income.
"WE insist on having faculty members live on campus to supervise students 24 hours a day, and be available to students in crises," Mr. Mitchell said. The I.R.S. agreed. "That would seem to be a conclusive judgment in my view," Mr. Mitchell said.
Taft contributes about $70,000 to the town each year. "When the town comes to us occasionally in need of additional revenues we try to help out, to be a good neighbor and support the services it renders," Mr. Mitchell said. "But tax-exempt status is essential to the maintenance of the institution."
Campuses of some independent Connecticut schools, a third of which are religiously affiliated, can be as large as Hotchkiss's 650 acres. Annual tuition, room and board can reach $25,000, property values can be as high as $125 million and annual budgets can be more than $15 million. Endowments, in many cases, are generous.
Peter Tacy, the executive director of the Connecticut Association of Independent Schools in Mystic, said, "What worries us is not money, but relationships. If we end up paying taxes there won't be the incentive to buy fire engines, environmental and other equipment for the towns, provide scholarships for local children, keep private school libraries, pools, tennis courts, golf courses, ice rinks, and other athletic and cultural facilities open to the public at little or no cost."
AN effort was made in the last session of the General Assembly to introduce legislation that would permit towns to tax the nonacademic buildings and excess land of private schools. It did not get beyond the Planning and Development Committee.
Bud Trotta, the First Selectman of Salisbury, had a particular interest in the bill because his town has three private secondary schools: Hotchkiss, Salisbury and Indian Mountain School, which occupy a total of 1,200 acres. Mr. Trotta said the town received a total of $32,000 from the three schools, adding that he believed $125,000 could be collected in taxes.
"Nobody wants to hurt the schools, but the laws are archaic," he said. "Towns should be able to negotiate settlements with private schools based on local needs. Even if the economy picks up, the world has changed. We have to look to new means of revenue to sustain communities." Mr. Tacy said he feared that allowing towns to write their own tax-exemption laws would result in "everybody winding up in court."
"People would be pitted against each other, with the lawyers the only winners," he said. "If secular schools are taxed, what about religious schools and institutions, what about hospitals and other health facilities? And would channeling that money to local governments actually reduce taxes or improve services?"

HEADLINE: 2 Finalists Battle for an Expanded Unicef

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
A FINAL decision is expected by early October in the long-running bid battle between New York City and New Rochelle over which city will become the host for the expansion of Unicef, the Manhattan-based United Nations relief organization for children.
Both cities have offered tantalizing packages of financial incentives. New Rochelle is proposing to build a 20-story building -- which would also become the centerpiece of the city's downtown revitalization efforts -- for the agency. New York City has proposed buying additional office space. The competition is unusually intense because at least six other United Nations agencies are considering moving their headquarters from the East Side of Manhattan to New Rochelle, San Francisco and Bonn.. 
 The impetus for possible relocations stems, in large part, from a cost-cutting campaign at the United Nations. But agencies also contemplate movea because of expansion needs and the lure of cheaper office space, lower housing costs and a higher life quality elsewhere.
If all of the agencies were to leave, the city would lose at least 2,600 jobs, more than a third of the United Nations workforce in New York, and up to $200 million in salaries, rents, supplies and other spending in New York -- a fifth of the $1 billion the organization contributes each year to the local economy.
Moves by United Nations agencies could also result in an exodus of smaller diplomatic missions and United Nations-related services from the city. UNITAR, the United Nations Institute for Training and Research recently transferred its offices from Manhattan to Geneva, Switzerland. Most of the agency's 32 jobs, though, were transferred last winter to other United Nations offices in New York. Another international agency, CARE, also plans to leave New York in the next few weeks. Established 47 years ago in New York, CARE will transfer its headquarters -- and 200 employees -- next month from 66 First Avenue, near 37th Street, to a five-story building in Atlanta donated by a local charity.
"Retaining the United Nations is New York City's top priority," said Barry F. Sullivan, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development. "The Mayor and I are working very closely with the entire United States Mission to the United Nations and the Secretariat to plan for the long-term needs of the entire U.N. system. We believe that the city's role as host city to the U.N. is of the utmost importance to the international nature of the city."
Germany has been particularly active in attempting to lure U.N. agencies. Among the agencies considering a move to Bonn are the United Nations Development Program, the United Nations Capital Development Fund, the Fund for Population Activities, the Development Fund for Women and the United Nations Sudano-Sahelian Office.
The appeal of Bonn, which will have considerable empty office space once the reunified Germany moves its capital back to Berlin, lies largely in the German Government's offer of free rent. Germany has also offered $184 million in relocation costs and a substantial increase in the nation's voluntary contributions to the United Nations.
Of the agencies being wooed by Bonn, the United Nations Development Program is the largest, with 1,159 employees; its payroll also includes employees from the Capital Development Fund and the Sudano-Sahelian Office. The Fund for Population Activities has 242 employees, the Development Fund for Women has 31. All work mainly with third world development; the Sudano-Sahelian Office deals with famine relief in the Saharan region.
ELSEWHERE, another agency reportedly considering leaving the cluster of office buildings that surround the monolithic United Nations Secretariat Building on the East River is the newly created United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development. San Francisco wants it to move into the Presidio, an Army base under the Golden Gate Bridge that is scheduled to be closed. The commission is now based in the Secretariat Building.
The most immediate decision, however, may come from Unicef, formerly called the United Nations Children's Fund. Founded in 1946 as the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, the agency, which has 951 employees and injects $82 million a year into the city's economy, helps developing countries improve conditions for children by providing health, nutrition and social welfare aid.
Unicef is now based in 204,000 square feet of leased space at 3 United Nations Plaza on East 44th Street, between First and Second Avenues. It also rents office space in two buildings nearby, as well as in buildings in Long Island City and Secaucus, N.J. The agency, though, wants to expand by 1995 and consolidate its operations into one or two buildings. Unicef officials have projected that the agency needs about 440,000 square feet over the next 17 years, when it expects to have about 1,500 employees.
To meet those expansion needs, the agency advertised in September 1991 for bids and proposals. From an original list of 76 sites, New Rochelle, 18 miles north of New York City, and Manhattan are the two finalists. The Unicef executive board is now expected to make its decision in early October.
The executive board had intended to select a plan in May but instead told both New Rochelle and New York City to present new final offers by June 30.
"I still think we have an excellent chance," said Mayor Timothy C. Idoni of New Rochelle. "If New York's plan was so good it would have been approved two months ago."
New Rochelle's proposal is to erect a 440,000-square-foot, 20-story building on a two-acre city-owned parking lot on Huguenot Street opposite the municipal parking garage. The project would be financed with 30-year bonds issued by the city. The agency would be charged an annual rent of $378,000.
The new Unicef building would become the first in a what the city hopes would become a United Nations Community District. Future plans include three other new office buildings containing 800,000 square feet, 500 units of market-rate housing, a retail complex and a parking garage. The proposal was created with the assistance of the Starrett Housing Corporation/H.R.H. Housing Corporation and the architectural firm of Kohn-Pederson & Fox Associates, all of Manhattan.
"They want to build a U.N. city there in a nutshell," said Timothy E. Boakes, Unicef's director of administrative management. "It certainly is an interesting proposal."
NEW YORK CITY'S plan, as put forth by its Economic Development Corporation and the United Nations Development Corporation, a city-state agency, is to cut the $10 million annual rent that Unicef now pays on the Unicef House, its headquarters, by $28 million over 20 years. It would also turn over the ownership of Unicef House to the agency in 2026, when the bonds issued to pay for its construction have been paid off. Unicef House is owned by the United Nations Development Corporation. The city owns the land at the site.
Additionally, the United Nations Development corporation agreed to buy up to 200,000 more square feet of space near Unicef House and eventually turn the ownership of the space over to the agency. The expansion would be financed by city-issued bonds.
"We have been able to negotiate concessions with the City of New York that no one thought was possible," Mr. Boakes said.
Among the buildings that could be used to provide spillover space are the 31-story American Home Products Building at 685 Third Avenue, between 44th and 43d Streets, which will be vacant when the company moves to Madison, N.J. in November; a 41-story tower at 633 Third Avenue, between 41st and 40th Streets, and the United Engineering Center at 345 East 47th Street.
"We have been urging the city to do everything possible to make a comparable offer," said Victor Marrero, the newly appointed United States Representative to the United Nations Economic and Social Council.
The principal difference between the two bids, apart from their location, is their cost. "You could broadly say that over a 30-year period, there was a difference of $200 million," said Mr. Boakes said.
City officials, however, believe that depending on accounting methods, the savings in the New Rochelle plan, if any, are much smaller. They also note that what the agency might gain in cost-savings from the move could be erased by a loss of fund-raising dollars, possibly as much as $300 million over 30 years.
"The numbers are not really telling the full story," Ambassador Marrero said.
In April, however, a United Nations budgetary committee, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, which reviews fiscal and personnel matters, issued a report on the options.
The report, while not endorsing New Rochelle, concluded that "the proposed relocation of Unicef to New Rochelle is clearly the most cost-effective offer, resulting in savings of $261.7 million" over three decades, "compared to the best assured offer for Manhattan."
"The European community is saying we are tired of contributing money for administrative waste," said Mayor Idoni of New Rochelle. "Ten million or $20 million saved in cutting waste could be used to feed poor children. That's what Unicef is for."
A compromise has been presented by both the budgetary committee and Representative Nita M. Lowey, a Democrat whose congressional district includes New Rochelle. It would call for Unicef executives and up to about 10 percent of the staff to work out of the current Manhattan headquarters while the rest of the personnel work in New Rochelle.
"We'd accept," Mr. Idoni said.
THERE are, though, arguments that favor keeping Unicef in New York City. Moving to New Rochelle, for example, so far from the United Nations and the Permanent Missions, would create logistical problems, and leaving New York City would mean losing certain intangible benefits, namely prestige and a cosmopolitan environment, United Nations officials say. Indeed, in February the executive director of Unicef, James P. Grant, conceded that moving to New Rochelle would be less costly but nonetheless recommended that the agency's headquarters remain in Manhattan.
New Rochelle officials are irked by any characterization of their city as distant and provincial. "They are not moving to Kansas," Mr. Idoni said. "They are 23 minutes away by car."
Emily P. McKhann, New York City's acting commissioner for the United Nations Consular Corps and International Business, also said that there would be security concerns if United Nations agencies, such as Unicef, began fragmenting into the suburbs, particularly if foreign missions and consulates followed suit.
Approval by either the Secretary of State or Congress would also be needed for Unicef to relocate outside of the city, though neither New York City officials nor their counterparts in New Rochelle anticpate that the Federal Government would block such a move.
Ms. McKhann noted, too, that the United States Department of State and the United States representative to the 41-nation Unicef board, Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund, support staying in the city.
"Clearly, this is something the city cares about," she said. "Our bid clearly meets their needs. We absolutely want them to stay."

HEADLINE: The View From: Essex;
Will Publicity Change a Community's Character?

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH

 BODY:
ON a recent weekday morning two buses carrying older people arrived in Essex almost simultaneously, one from Rhode Island and the other from New Jersey. For the next few hours the visitors browsed in art galleries, boutiques and antique shops on Main Street, visited the historic waterfront and then had lunch at the 217-year-old Griswold Inn, the town's centerpiece.
Occasionally, other tourists drop in, usually in small family groups on what may well be Connecticut's most charming seacoast town, on the west bank of the Connecticut River, about six miles from Old Saybrook and Long Island Sound. 
 So far this spring and summer the number of visitors does not appear to have changed. Nor, for that matter, has anything else in Essex, where the Oliver Cromwell, the first warship in the Continental Navy, was built in 1775, as were several hundred other ocean-going sailing ships between the Revolutionary and Civil Wars.
That is good news for most residents of Essex, where the last major change occurred in the 1820's when the invention of the steamboat sent the town's thriving shipbuilding business into a sharp decline from which it never recovered. (Sad to say, business at the town's three boatyards, a legacy of the old shipyards, has been slowed markedly by the recent recession, which may also account for soup kitchens that are open on varying nights at local churches).
Apparently the invasion of outsiders that had been anticipated by some townspeople has failed to materialize in Essex, where, like Nantucket, time seems to have stood still for generations.
"A lot of people in town were fearful that Essex had been 'discovered' and that things were not going to be the same," said William G. Winterer, the owner and proprietor of the Griswold Inn, the landmark restaurant and hostelry on Main Street.
 
'Not Exactly Good News'
 Mr. Winterer, formerly an investment broker who has owned and operated the 'Gris,' as most local residents call the Griswold, for 21 years, was alluding to a book published earlier this year that listed Essex as the second-best small town in the United States. While many communities would relish the attention, not to mention possible prosperity, that such status might bring, many Essex residents were hardly enthralled.
"To many people here, it was not exactly good news," Mr. Winterer said in an interview at the white clapboard Griswold, the first three-story building in the state. "This is a very conservative, family-oriented town, and most people don't want anything changed."
Mr. Winterer, for one, was not displeased with the recognition bestowed by Norman Crampton in his book "The 100 Best Small Towns in America." (Elko, Nev., was picked as the best of the best.) "I thought it was going to be fantastic for business, but that hasn't happened," said Mr. Winterer, who became enamored of the Griswold while he was a young lieutenant training at the Coast Guard Academy in New London.
No other communities from Connecticut were included among the 100 towns, each with a population between 5,000 and 15,000. The 1990 census listed Essex's population at 5,904.
In addition to the population range, towns had to have "stand-alone economies" that provided jobs for a significant number of residents and could not be suburbs in metropolitan areas. Specific measuring criteria (Essex's standing is in brackets) included growth rate (tied for 17), per capita income (1), proportion of residents between 25 and 34 years old (13), proportion of blacks and other minorities (34), the number of physicians (8), the crime rate (72), expenditures for public education (32) and the percentage of residents with at least four years of college education (12).
 
Sleepy Little Village
 To some, Essex's standing in a few of those categories came as a surprise. For instance, the town's population actually has decreased in recent years and there are very few black and Hispanic residents of Essex. That Essex ranked relatively high in the crime category also surprised many people in a town that has no police department, only a resident state trooper, who works out of the Town Hall, and a full-time constable, and where crime is rare.
"There were some strong concerns that our ranking in the book would bring in a lot of people and perhaps change the character of the town," Bruce M. Glowac, the First Selectman, said in an interview. "But that hasn't happened, and we're still a sleepy little New England village."
Mr. Glowac did say, though, that in recent years there has been a slight influx of home buyers from "down river."
"Most of them have come from Fairfield County, New York and New Jersey," he said. "In many cases, they've bought second homes here, although quite a few have settled in Essex permanently, many after retiring. Almost all of the new residents are quality people who get involved in the community."
One of them is Joshua Crowell, pastor of the First Congregational Church, who estimates that he answered 260 calls last year as a member of the Essex Volunteer Fire Department. "The church is only about a city block from the firehouse, and I'm often the first one there," he said. "That means I usually drive a piece of apparatus to the scene. I do get some funny looks, especially when I have my clerical garb on. People aren't used to seeing a minister in a Geneva robe, tabs and bell sleeves driving a fire truck."
Most real-estate agents interviewed said they had received few inquiries as a result of Mr. Crampton's book. "We got only about a half-dozen calls," said William Foster, a broker at the Mitchel real-estate agency. "And I'm sure a lot of people here were glad. Some newcomers discover this beautiful little town and then want to pull up the drawbridge so no one else can get in. But others realize we have to be more realistic."
Only one real-estate broker, Donn Holland, the sales manager of the local Westledge Real Estate office, said his agency had received a large number of calls. He said the calls came from as far away as California. "They'd ask, 'Where are you? What are you like?' " Mr. Holland said. "Some came to visit, and I sold at least one house, to a doctor from New York, as a result of the book."
Even before the book extolling some of the town's many virtues came out, the residential real-estate business was picking up in Essex. "Things had been very slow for a long time," said JoAnn Chapman of Osage Ltd. Realtor. "But we've begun to get more second-home buyers, mainly from Fairfield County." Ms. Chapman pointed out that the biggest transaction in recent months was the sale of a home that had belonged to Chester Bowles, the former Governor, United States Senator and Ambassador, for $1.9 million.
For years, most home buyers in Essex were well-to-do retirees, many of whom had spent time in the area, and fairly affluent middle-aged couples. And most everyone owned a yacht in a a town that has three yacht clubs and two marinas. "More young families are moving in now," said Brenda Milkofsky, the curator of the Connecticut River Museum, which is on Steamboat Dock at the foot of Main Street. "I think a lot of them are attracted by our excellent elementary school, along with the overall beauty of the town. And once they're here, they find this a town with great spirit."
Middle and high school students from Essex attend regional schools in nearby Deep River.
Mrs. Milkofsky is not surprised that many townspeople were apprehensive that Essex's newfound celebrity would attract too many tourists. She recalled that, 15 years ago, townspeople overwhelmingly rejected a proposal by the state to include about 100 buildings in Essex as a state historic district. "Most towns probably would have welcomed such a move, since it guarantees that the buildings can't be torn down," Mrs. Milkovsky said. "But the perception by people here was that it would attract more tourists."
In truth, Essex has few so-called "tourist attractions." The main one is the Essex Steam Train, a collection of restored steam engines and coaches operating out of an old-fashioned depot in Essex, which takes riders on a trip into yesteryear on a 10-mile-long track along the Connecticut River between Essex and Chester. The others are the Connecticut River Museum and the Ivoryton Playhouse (Ivoryton and Centerbrook are both villages within the town of Essex), where Katharine Hepburn, a native of Hartford, made her acting debut in 1931.
Mr. Winterer, the proprietor of the Griswold, may be the only one in town able to compare Essex, "the second best town in America," with Elko, Nev., which was named No. 1 in the book.
"I've been to Elko, Nev.," Mr. Winterer said. "It's a nice town, but I assure you it can't compare with Essex."

HEADLINE: Q and A

 BODY:

Leasing With an Option
 
Question: I am interested in learning more about leasing a house with the option to buy. What are the pitfalls? 
 Is there a book or someplace where I could write to find out more of what is involved?
What happens if the buyer or seller changes their mind? How binding is it? . . . Ellen M. Tum Suden, Brooklyn
 
Answer: According to Alan Yassky, president of Rockland Realty, in Spring Valley, N.Y., leases that offer an option to buy, sometimes with all or part of the rent applied toward the purchase price or a down payment, are not common these days and are generally only offered by distressed sellers.
He added that the pitfalls are generally the seller's, as the buyer is usually only risking rent that they would be paying anyway.
The buyer also has the option to close, not to close or negotiate a new deal. Sometimes, though, particularly if the deal is being structured just to enable a buyer to raise a down payment, additional option money may be required of the buyer, raising his level of risk and commitment, Mr. Yassky said.
For more information, check the real estate or business section of any local book store or contract the National Association of Realtors (312) 329-8200), which can send you a list of books on various real estate subjects.
 
Evictions in a Purchase
 
Question: I am planning to buy a six-family house. All apartments are rent-stabilized, and they are presently occupied.
I need two apartments for my family. What is the process for evicting tenants from the apartments?
Also, how should I proceed to reserve two apartments as soon as possible? Are their any time requirements or deadlines? . . . Vladimir Vasilets, Brooklyn
 
Answer: According to Lou Ganim, a spokesman for the Department of Housing and Community Renewal in Albany, which oversees rent regulation in the city, after you buy the building you should state in a certified letter to the tenants that you do not intend to renew their leases because you are going to use the apartment for yourself and your family.
He also said that this letter must be delivered from 120 to 150 days before the expiration of the lease.
If the lease is expiring in less than 120 days, then the tenants are entitled to a renewal for the same length of time as the current lease, Mr. Ganim said.
He added that if the tenants refuse to leave, you can go to Housing Court, but not until the lease expires.
 
Renting a Condominium
 
Question: I own a condominium in Manhattan and want to rent it for four months. I received a copy of the sublease requirements, signed the forms and sent in my check.
Later, however, I was told that the board requires a one-year lease. I asked for written documentation on the requirement, and was told that there wasn't any "but it's somewhere in the minutes and it would take a long time to find it."
I have a tenant from out of town that expects to move in soon. What should I do? . . . Gertrude M. Brooks, Manhattan
 
Answer: Requirements restricting leasing are generally contained in the bylaws of the condominium which are filed with the declaration, according to Howard Schechter, a Manhattan lawyer.
As a general rule, though, there are no restrictions on leasing. Typical condominium documents give the board of managers right to match an offer to lease the space, but not to approve or disapprove a lease, he added.
In your case, Mr. Schechter said that you should check the bylaws to determine whether the board has the authority to restrict the term of a lease by formally adopting a requirement.
If they have not done that, then board has no right to prevent you from renting out your unit on a four-month lease, Mr. Schechter said.

HEADLINE: The Executive Computer;
Doesn't It Ever Stop? PC Price War Looms Again

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
JUST as in "Jurassic Park," the big dinosaurs -- Compaq, I.B.M., Digital and Hewlett-Packard among them -- are coming back to life and, boy, are they hungry. With the ferocity of a Tyrannosaurus rex, these giants of the computer industry are stalking and chewing up any personal computer makers not big enough, smart enough or nimble enough to survive.
The weaker PC makers have no choice but to scurry for cover. The Compuadd Corporation, following the lead of Everex Systems Inc., recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and laid off more than half its workers. Scores of smaller companies are going to unmarked graves. Even some fairly large American companies are disappearing -- goodbye Gecco, Fast Micro, Standard. 
 "Of the X number of advertisers we had in December, in June there was a substantial percentage less," said John Blackford, editor of Computer Shopper, a phonebook-sized magazine that carries ads for companies selling computers and components directly to users. "The first half of 1993 definitely saw a downtrend. The companies that are going away are the ones who didn't understand how to run an efficient business."
Adapt or die is the message, and the key question is how long companies have to adapt. "People want it to be over in two quarters, but we're looking at another 24 months of shakeout at all levels," said John McCarthy, director of technology research at Forrester Research Inc., a research and consulting company in Cambridge, Mass. "The summer doldrums seem to exact their toll, particularly in Europe and Japan. There's nowhere for these guys to hide."
It used to be that a company could buffer its sagging domestic sales by looking overseas, but the economic slump is worse in many quarters abroad. Business in Germany, which traditionally accounts for as much as 25 percent of European computer purchases, has declined sharply; Japan's economy is slowing.
Some companies are getting out, others are seeking protectors. The Tandy Corporation, for example, unloaded its PC business to AST Research Inc., which is expected to report a decline in earnings for its fourth quarter, which ended July 3.
Groupe Bull, a money-losing French company that owns the unprofitable Zenith Data Systems, acquired a 19.9 percent stake in Packard Bell, which contends it is profitable. Last year, when it wasn't profitable, Packard Bell had to cancel an initial public offering.
Even some of the bigger predators are getting nervous. Although the overall PC market continues to expand, "the hockey stick growth chart for many companies appears to have reached the knob on the handle," said Portia Isaacson, president of Dream I.T., a market research and consulting company in Colorado Springs.
Dell said last week it would report its first quarterly loss, while Apple surprised even the most pessimistic analysts by reporting a $188 million lossfor its second quarter, which produced a sharp plunge in its stock. Even the mighty Microsoft Corporation hints that slower times are ahead.
Now, with smaller companies on the run, big companies are preparing for what Andrew J. Neff, a senior analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company, calls the "clash of the Titans."
"The coming battle between the first-tier players, most of whom have deep pockets, could result in another price war and a tougher battle for market share points," Mr. Neff said.
The homogeneity of personal PC technology, based on the Intel Corporation's microprocessors and Microsoft's software, means that the battleground is almost certainly prices.
Price wars are happy news for computer buyers, of course, and demand for computers has stayed strong. Will Zachman, president of Canopus Research of Duxbury, Mass., said he suspects that the demand has been siphoned from 1994 into 1993 as a result of the low prices, and that demand will dry up soon.
But low prices mean slimmer profits, so the big companies need to sell ever greater numbers of computers to sustain their dinosaur-sized metabolisms. To do so they need to create new markets, which they can do by cutting prices further or coming up with new products. "I suspect we're at the early stages of the extinction process for some of these less adaptable creatures," Mr. Zachman said.
Apple Computer Inc. recently got a new chief executive, cut its prices for the third time in three months and handed pink slips to 16 percent of its work force. It will introduce its Newton personal information manager later this month.
International Business Machines, which got a new chief executive earlier this year, is lopping off excess workers in five-figure chunks and reshuffling its operations. It is strengthening its line of portable computers, employing new technologies in its desktop line and preparing to enter new markets with a line of low-cost PC's called Ambras.
The Compaq Computer Corporation has a head start on the pack. It started the current price war a year ago when it got a new chief executive and dumped 2,000 jobs.
Even so, Compaq recently reorganized its PC operations, announced an intimate working relationship with Microsoft, I.B.M.'s former spouse, and vowed to cut prices again. It, too, plans to introduce a new line of low-cost computers for the consumer market and small, pen-based computers.
The combatants, Mr. Neff said, will include such companies as Hewlett-Packard and Digital Equipment, which have not managed to crack the first tier but have the deep pockets needed to sustain a long battle.
Hewlett-Packard has proven its strength with printers and advanced work stations, and it recently introduced some impressive portable machines. Digital slept through the first decade of the personal computer business but has shown surprising vigor in the last year. Digital copied its direct-sales approach directly from Dell, right down to the advertising, and is suddenly a major force.
The winners, said Ms. Isaacson of Dream I.T., will be the companies that have unique strengths and own intellectual property rights -- that is, patents and copyrights.
"When we look at computer eras past, in minicomputers it was Digital, and in mainframes it was I.B.M., because they owned the intellectual property," Ms. Isaacson said. "Today, Intel, Microsoft and Apple own the intellectual property, although Apple has been creamed by the strength of the Intel-Microsoft standard. Dell owns the customer interface, with its account control and support, and the only other approach is to be really efficient in high-volume manufacturing. I'm not sure any company fits that mold, and that's why Taiwan Inc. now builds 25 percent of the PC's sold in the United States."
But even while the big dinosaurs thrash and tangle, there may be room for new species to evolve. "We're in another paradign shift to nomadic systems like A.T.& T.'s Hobbit, Penpoint and Apple's Newton, where other types of intellectual property are possible," Ms. Isaacson said.
For would-be computer buyers, the prospect of another escalation of the price war may make it worthwhile to wait for a month or two before actually putting the money down. Grab some popcorn and go see "Jurassic Park."

High Scores for Mutual Funds Abroad

BYLINE: By Robert D. Hershey Jr.

 BODY:
ANYONE seeking proof of the axiom that investors look to the future -- and care little about the present -- can find it this year in the performance of foreign stock markets.
Even as Japan and much of Europe succumbed to or continued to flirt with recession, mutual funds investing there in anticipation of recovery have produced double-digit returns following a long period of lagging performance. 
 "There's been an enormous change, a reversal," observed A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services, a prominent industry scorekeeper. "The four years' underperformance of the international market is over."
In fact, during the quarter ended June 30 international stock funds easily outperformed both global funds -- which invest in the United States as well as abroad -- and funds limiting themselves solely to America, where the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index eked out a 3.4 percent gain.
Funds heavily invested in Japanese stocks, up nearly 35 percent during the first half of the year, have performed best, aided by currency gains roughly equaling those from the stocks themselves. Small Japanese companies showed the most zip of all.
For the second quarter, funds concentrating in East Asia, including Japan, posted a gain of about 11 percent.
Europe, where privatization is helping entice American portfolio managers, has also done well. Latin America, an earlier star, has faded and East Asian markets other than Japan have flattened and are now seen as rather thoroughly picked over.
Among professionals, it's widely accepted today that investors of even modest sums should have some foreign exposure to avoid overreliance on America's business cycle and to exploit political or sociological change.
So where do portfolio managers think they will find the biggest rewards in the months ahead?
Japan remains a possibility, various managers say, but the investment outlook is not as bright as in the first half of the year, when basic industries and financial companies soared and the yen leaped against the dollar. The strong Japanese currency magnifies returns to foreign investors but also tends to hurt earnings of the country's exporters.
"Political problems, the strong yen, poor corporate results and a sluggish economy have combined to dampen our expectations for the Japanese equity market for the next few quarters," declared William F. (Chip) Wendler 2d, vice president of Rowe Price-Fleming International.
At the same time, the political turmoil seems likely to result after elections today in a new Tokyo Government, one that in the view of Fiona Biggs, who runs two international Dreyfus Corporation funds will sharply accelerate the shift in Japanese emphasis toward consumption and away from exports.
This implies, among other things, a shrinking trade surplus and a dollar that will rise sharply against the yen. Investors in Japan these days "definitely want to be hedged," Ms. Biggs said, so stock market gains are not wiped out by losses in the currency market.
Another cautious assessment came from John R. Hickling, who runs two Fidelity international mutual funds He said he remained "very optimistic" about Japan over the long term but said earnings disappointments over the next few months would make it a risky period for stocks.
On the other hand, with "no sign of inflation anywhere in Japan," Mr. Hickling said, the bond market there looks "screamingly" attractive.
In Europe, where the lesser markets of Finland, Denmark and Italy have done best this year, followed by Switzerland, Norway and the Netherlands, portfolio managers see only moderate appeal.
Germany, the traditional dynamo, has slipped into a deep recession and its efforts to recover are hobbled by budget deficits related to reunification, analysts say.
Still, said Mr. Wendler of Rowe Price-Fleming International, Europe appears in many ways "similar to the picture in the United States some three years ago" with bond rates coming down, corporate profitability in doubt and economic and political uncertainty the dominant sentiment.
Now, in fact, may be the time to jump at certain opportunities.
"Italy is almost irresistible to a value investor -- everything is falling apart there," said Jarrod W. Wilcox, director of international investing for Boston-based Battery march Financial Management. Mr. Wilcox has a similar view of Britain, where recession might be over but political and economic pessimism remain.
Privatization is another opportunity, Mr. Hickling added, noting a political imperative for governments in, for example, France and Spain, to insure the successful sale of state-owned companies by offering them at bargain prices.
"This is a major international investment opportunity -- and I'm all over it," Mr. Hickling said.
Some people still see opportunity in Latin America, where funds are confined mainly to Mexico and Argentina, despite fresh threats to the North American Free Trade Agreement. And the booming Chinese economy may also provide more investment possibilities over the longer term, particularly if Beijing is chosen the site of the Olympic Games in 2000.
Ms. Biggs already has a favorite stock, Hong Kong-based S. Megga, that she calls "a tremendous China play" based on a joint venture with the Government for telephones and other electronic gear.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Japan Currency Adjustments Work

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Karel van Wolferen makes two egregious errors in "Japan's Big Chance -- and Clinton's" (Op-Ed, July 6).
(1) He suggests that "previous yen-dollar adjustments never accomplished the desired correction in the trade imbalances." However, the currency changes of 1985-87 and attendant macroeconomic adjustments worked like a textbook in both countries: Japan's global current account surplus dropped from 4.3 percent of gross domestic product in 1986 to 1.2 percent in 1990, and America's global current account deficit dropped from 3.7 percent of G.D.P. in 1987 to less than 1 percent in 1991 (even excluding foreign contributions to our Persian Gulf war expenditures). 
 (2) He suggests that eliminating the bilateral United States-Japan trade balance should be an objective of United States policy. There is no rational basis for targeting bilateral balances in general. In this case, the pattern of world trade clearly indicates that the United States could easily run a global current account surplus despite continuing sizable bilateral deficits with Japan.
Likewise, Japan would retain a large surplus with the United States even if it met the Administration's goal of reducing its global surplus to 1 percent to 2 percent of G.D.P. -- mainly because it imports many primary products from Saudi Arabia, Australia and the like, and so must export manufactured goods to the United States and other high-income countries.

HEADLINE: RUNNING WILD;
The Mississippi Reclaims Its True Domain

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
NO one alive has seen the Father of Rivers yawn this high or this wide. No one imagined the Mississippi or its relatives would take such liberties, consuming so many hamlets whole, or that, if they did, technology would be nearly helpless to stop them.
There have been floods before. People in Hannibal, Mo., or Keokuk, Iowa, or Quincy, Ill., can tell you about watching their fathers and uncles pack sandbags to protect the year's corn crop or the feed store. For generations, some farmers figured floods and droughts into the cost of doing business. But then the country's big plumbing system of levees and dams, made better after every flood, was supposed to keep the rivers in their place and maintain the comfortable paradox of living on a floodplain. 
 Now the unimaginable has happened. Across the Midwestern cornbelt it has rained in biblical proportions -- 49 straight days, often in torrents. The rivers, driven past their banks, have taken back land that long ago was theirs, invading 15 million acres of farmland in eight states, forcing 36,000 people from their homes, halting river traffic for 600 miles and causing billions of dollars in damage.
From the air, from Minnesota to Missouri, from Kansas to Illinois, it looks like someone has spilled gallons and gallons of coffee on a green patchwork quilt that happens to be farms and towns. In silt rivers now wide as lakes, treetops look like bushes in a swimming pool, bridges and highways and other brave monuments to engineering are reduced to thin, threatened slivers, and even their builders know the water could take them, too, if it wanted. The floods have made the broad, S-curved Mississippi and its otherwise perfectly ordered valley look more like the Florida Keys.
Unlike earthquakes and hurricanes, floods defy the human urge to quantify. There is no single measure -- no Richter scale, or mile-per-hour wind as in the eye of a hurricane -- to gauge a flood. There are only the hundreds of crests and toppled levees on the rivers and their swollen creeks, and the thousand heartbreaks of lost soybean fields and moated Main Streets.
If the floods of 1993 have reminded people of anything, it is that the Mississippi River was never the docile pensioner some had come to think it was. It is not, after all, the Swanee. The Mississippi is America's watery aorta, draining or potentially flooding rivers in 31 states from the Appalachians to the Rocky Mountains.
"It's like talking about God Almighty himself," said Shelby Foote, the Memphis writer, who has lived his whole life on the river.
The river, ecologists and farmers say, was never supposed to follow the tight course humans have expected it to, indeed ordered it to, with their walls of dirt and concrete levees. Of course, that has not stopped people from building homes and farms and cities along the river. The Mississippi Valley's thick black soil is considered the richest on earth, impossible for farmers to resist.
But to claim the land meant making a bargain with the river, confining it to an artificially narrow path so that farms could reach as far as the shore and places like New Orleans and St. Louis could live undisturbed while their goods were carried safely from port to port. The price that river people pay is sudden and catastrophic flooding when excess rainwater, forced into a narrow channel by the levees, runs out of places to go and cannot drain naturally into the soil.
Then the river goes faster and faster, and it goes where it wishes, as it did during the flooding of the lower Mississippi in 1927, where, as William Faulkner wrote, the river "was now doing what it liked to do, had waited patiently the 10 years in order to do, as a mule will work for you 10 years for the privilege of kicking you once."
Mr. Foote was a boy during that flood. He remembers when word came that the levee had broken at Mounds Landing in Scott, Miss., north of Greenville. "It was a slow creeping rise," he said. "You can't even see it rise but if you turn away and then you look back, you see it is a little higher. Everything in its path is submerged or invaded. It presses against every crack and crevice. It's like solid wind when it comes."
Because of its might and willfulness, some ecologists argue that the very way people define a river is not particularly useful. They say that the river is not just whatever water you see in the channel, but the banks, the floodplain, in fact, the valley itself, from bluff to bluff. It is anywhere the water has been and could potentially go -- a river, Mark Twain said, "whose alluvial banks cave and change constantly, whose snags are always hunting up new quarters, whose sand bars are never at rest."
In earlier centuries, when towns in the bottomlands were invaded by river water, townspeople packed up and moved to higher ground -- as Franklin, Mo., for example, on the Missouri River, did in 1826. (Even that move could not save Franklin this time, however; the town is under water again.) Now, more than 7 million people live directly along the Mississippi, including more than 2 million around its confluence with the Missouri in St. Louis, where the two rivers are now cresting and levees straining and crumbling.
"No one is going to move St. Louis just because it happens to be in the river," said David Johnson, an aquatic ecologist who is assistant director of the School of Natural Resources at Ohio State University. "It's a question of working with the river or fighting the river. Fighting the river is almost always going to be a losing battle."
He argues for restoring the kind of wide open spaces that the river once had before Europeans and the great cities came, wetlands where the water could collect in times of severe rains. The Army Corps of Engineers reservoirs to catch the run-off, although the current flooding suggests they may not be enough. In defense of the complex and normally efficient flood control system, hydraulic engineers say that without the man-made reservoirs, the bloated river would now stretch from bluff to bluff, five miles across in spots, covering what we now know as Dubuque, Iowa, or St. Louis.
 
Return of the Marshes
 "People think of the river as their enemy," said David Lanegran, a professor of geography and urban studies at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn. "They fight the river, dike the river, pollute the river, ignore the river. Now the river is taking back its old places. You can see the old marshes coming back in the farmers' fields, all the places where the duck ponds used to be. It's almost like a ghost. The water is saying, 'This is where I used to be. This used to be my place.' "
That may be cold comfort to people whose homes and businesses are under the water. But there are some important differences between this disaster and others.
Things have changed since the days of Mark Twain, when armed guards patrolled levees to insure no one tampered with them or when, according to his stories, just about the only time a crowd would gather on the river was for a dogfight or a lynching. The flood has been remarkable for the show of volunteerism and general goodwill; there have been few reports of looting, and many of people driving for miles to work through the night sandbagging someone else's levee. It is a contrast to the country's biggest disaster of last year, Hurricane Andrew, which brought looters, and merchants jacking up the price of generators and people posing as carpenters and bilking roofless homeowners.
In Des Moines, where flooding of the Raccoon River knocked out the fresh water supply of 250,000 people, leaving residents without water to drink or take showers or fight fires or flush toilets with, people have shared well water, grocery stores have discounted bottled water and every other morning three senior citizens drive to a nursing home for the handicapped, where they deliver fresh water and personally flush all 126 toilets.
Midwesterners do these kinds of things, people here say, because even most city people originally came from small, rural towns where everybody knows everybody and it is an insult to take advantage. "These are standard, practical and utilitarian Midwestern values," said Douglas Hurt, director of the graduate program in agricultural and rural studies at the Iowa State University. "If your neighbor needs help, regardless of the spats you've had, you help him."
If there is an economic beneficiary of this flood, it is the farm states of the eastern Midwest -- Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, where farmers will get to take advantage of the run-up in crop prices due to the low supply.
"That will make the flood even more painful for farmers in the floodplains," said William Heffernan, a professor and chairman of rural sociology at the University of Missouri in Columbia. "They will be watching the highest prices in years and, they don't have anything to sell."
 
Lifting and Cleansing
 As disastrous as a flood is to those in its path, it is nonetheless part of a natural cycle of renewal just as forest fires are. The river channels grow so wide and the currents so strong they lift topsoil, carry nutrients downstream and deposit them in new soil. Iowa's loss may be Missouri's gain, but then Iowa may get its own refill from Minnesota. The heavy rains that precede the flooding can also cleanse the river waters and make a better pool for fish to spawn.
The current crisis will undoubtedly set off wide debate over ways to improve the system with an eye not to just one city or river but to the 250 or so creeks and rivers that feed into the Mississippi.
Only fairly recently in the river's history, when Congress authorized a Federal levee project after the 1927 flood, has there been any system-wide approach to flood control. But that was based in part on bringing up to code the haphazard levees of assorted farm towns who in times of desperation built wherever they felt like it. New and better levees have gone up, but they, too, can fail.
"People expect more out of what was there than was ever intended," said Harry Kitch, chief of the central planning management branch of the Army Corps of Engineers. "Any one of our structures can be overtopped if you have a big enough flood. We do a great deal of sophisticated work in rebuilding them, but there can always be a bigger flood."
The great lesson of the floods may be that humans will have to do a lot more if they are to outwit nature, if that is even possible.
"I think we as moderns tend to think that geological and meteorological changes have stopped," said said Bruce Michaelson, a professor of English at the University of Illinois at Urbana, who is writing a book about Mark Twain, "that volcanoes will no longer erupt, that hurricanes will no longer come off the coasts and the great rivers of the world are going to stay quietly in their banks so we can cruise them in our boats and barges."
But just as the river that Mark Twain romanced and revered carried the pieces of wrecked houses and trees from floods upstream, so it does a century later -- "the debris," Professor Michaelson said, "of battlefields between water and man."

HEADLINE: In Korea, Chilling Reminders of Cold War

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THERE are few areas in the world where the tug of war between ideological opposites is being played out these days as starkly as it is on the Korean Peninsula. There, the more familiar fare of Asian-American diplomacy -- trade wars and economic disputes -- has been suddenly overshadowed by the deadly serious business of tussling over who produces a nuclear weapon.
President Clinton, ending an economic summit conference in Japan, joined that tug of war with some trepidation last weekend, trying to decipher the erratic diplomatic signals that were being sent by President Kim Young Sam of South Korea as well as the message of foreboding he had just received in Tokyo from the Japanese Government over North Korea's threat to continue developing nuclear weapons technology. 
 Mr. Clinton and the South Koreans settled for tough talk, with the President warning North Korea that nuclear aggression on its part would bring calamitous results.
"When you examine the nature of the American security commitment to Korea, to Japan, to this region," Mr. Clinton said, "it is pointless for them to try to develop nuclear weapons, because if they ever use them it would be the end of their country."
The grim imagery of those words sounded unusually bellicose, but it did not mean a departure from a course already firmly set in American policy -- keeping the North Koreans from creating nuclear weapons. The Clinton Administration's approach to security concerns in Asia is part reaction to the worsening situation, and part holdover from previous Administrations, when Japan was first recruited to play a role in shaping an accord between the Communist north and the democratic south.
In March, the North Korean Government announced it would withdraw from the 25-year-old nuclear non-proliferation agreement that bars nations from acquiring nuclear weaponry. Its surprise announcement sparked already smoldering suspicions around the globe that Pyongyang was manufacturing enough plutonium to make at least one bomb.
But the North Koreans suspended their threat shortly afterward and agreed to discuss with American negotiators in Geneva the conditions under which they would permit full inspections of the military plant that might house the plutonium.
 
High-Stakes Chicken

 
 At a joint news conference in Seoul, Mr. Kim appeared beside Mr. Clinton to warn that "appropriate countermeasures" would be employed if North Korea were to make the wrong move. He declined to say what those measures might be, but his remarks surprised American officials.
During the past several weeks, White House officials have been puzzled by the South Korean Government, which initially appeared satisfied with the methodical approach the United States had chosen in trying to resolve the stand-off over North Korea's decision to withdraw from the 25-year-old Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. In recent press reports, American officials noted, South Korean leaders had begun suggesting that the Geneva talks, which began on Wednesday, were a stalling tactic for the North Koreans.
The Clinton Administration has looked for other reassurances by suggesting that China, which recently reestablished trade links with South Korea, might encourage the North to comply.
"I think the Chinese Government is very interested in supporting the position we have taken here," Mr. Clinton said, pitching his comments to Beijing. "And we will certainly ask for their support."
Last week, a spokesman for the South Korean Embassy here said no surprise was intended and that his country and the United States are in synch.
"We keep getting thrown curve balls," said a senior Administration official, who asked not to be identified. "It is not unknown for some of these curve balls to come from our allies."
In addition, Japanese officials have suggested they would wait to determine North Korea's ultimate intentions before agreeing to an indefinite commitment to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, which expires in 1995.
If the Geneva talks do not yield an agreement, Secretary of State Warren Christopher has said the United States will ask the United Nations to impose economic sanctions against North Korea.
American officials seemed acutely aware of the limits of their negotiations. Despite Mr. Clinton's warning, this country and its allies have ruled out military retaliation. Since so much of North Korea's nuclear complex is underground, a military strike has a fairly remote chance of succeeding.
 
Walking a Tightrope

 
 "North Korea bears constant and careful watching," Mr. Christopher said in an interview with reporters during the conference in Tokyo. "As far as talking with the allies, yes, I think we've begun to explore the possibility of the kind of sanctions that we might impose against North Korea."
Because using economic sanctions is problematical, American officials have a lot riding on the outcome of the Geneva talks. If North Korea has amassed enough plutonium for one or two bombs, such gradual punishment would be ineffective.
North Korea, however, is not in a much better position to hold out against pressure from their Asian neighbors and their Western allies. They extended the Geneva talks on Friday and both sides hinted they may have an agreement by tomorrow.
"We've never been pessimistic," Kang Sok-ju, the First Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs for North Korea told reporters in Geneva.
In discussing the future of the negotiations, American officials send out calm and measured reassurances to their allies. If the talks were to break down, the senior official said, the United States' appeal to the United Nations for retaliatory action would be "very fact specific."
"It depends on how the North strays from the path we have tried to chart out for them," he said. "My hope is if they keep on moving toward the right solution, if the pace quickens or slows a little bit, we can handle that. If there's some radical departure, that makes the tightrope a little harder to stay upright on."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Who Armed Iraq? Answers the West Didn't Want to Hear

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE terms of the punishment forced on Iraq since the Persian Gulf War may be most valuable for what they have taught. Rarely has a country defeated in battle been so laid bare to outside scrutiny. To the victors, the answer to how Iraq gained its power is now dispiritingly clear: it was us -- the West, and German companies in particular.
That conclusion is documented in stark detail in a new study by the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control. Based in part on the work of United Nations inspectors, it identifies the Western companies who supplied the crucial parts in what was emerging as an extraordinary Iraqi arsenal. German firms were by far the worst offenders, but others in Switzerland, Britain, France, Italy and the United States were also instrumental. Without Western help, the report's author, Gary Milhollin, shows, Iraq could never have come so close to producing nuclear weapons and long-range missiles. 
 The pattern is in some ways familiar. Countries aspiring to power have long turned to foreign merchants for muskets and machine guns. What has changed has to do with what has changed about war. Rather than in vast shipments, even the smallest of acquisitions may prove decisive in an era in which nuclear, biological and chemical weapons can hold populations hostage. And the goods sought for military value may just as well be produced by a supercomputer manufacturer or biotechnology company as by a munitions maker.
A Western bolt found in an Iraqi missile is not necessarily a sign of complicity. A bolt has many peaceful uses, too. But the picture provided by the Wisconsin Project suggests just how instrumental such dual-use trade can be. Italian technology allowed Iraq to extract plutonium, and high-performance Swiss presses gave it the ability to make nuclear weapons parts. Most of what Iraq needed to extend the range of its Scud missiles came from Germany. American computers were used in virtually all Iraqi missile and nuclear sites.
Of course, Iraq's most crucial acquisitions had even clearer military purposes. The Soviet Union openly sold Baghdad hundreds of Scud missiles; Brazil helped secretly in an effort to build an atomic bomb. But it was the wider Western flood, aided by lax laws and porous borders, that helped Iraq to refine those tools, outfit secret factories, and thereby to reach the verge of even more destructive force.
 
'Dairy Plant' Parts
 Just one example of that flow was first found in crates marked as dairy plant parts bound from Frankfurt for Baghdad. In fact the intercepted metal parts were a supplement to the 27,436 Scud missile parts worth $28.2 million that the German company, H & H Metalform, had already delivered to Iraq. A separate compression device was to have helped Iraq test a new intermediate-range missile. There was little mystery to its purpose, German intelligence found: the company had sold the same kind of rocket-testing device to Brazil.
With the most dangerous of the projects dismantled, the tension between Iraq and the West is mostly about the future. In refusing again last week to permit U.N. inspectors to install cameras at a missile-test site, Iraq made clear its aversion to the next step of U.N. oversight, which under Security Council Resolution 715 calls upon the West to keep long-term watch as Iraq begins to build new weapons.
An apparent agreement on a separate U.N. plan calling for Iraq to sell oil to meet humanitarian needs suggested that Baghdad might still be open to a last-minute compromise. But even a fence-mending visit by Rolf Ekeus, the chief U.N. weapons inspector, left unclear by Friday whether Iraq would back down or brave a Western threat of a retaliatory strike.
The new U.N. focus on monitoring -- with its fixation on products -- nevertheless carries a danger of being too narrow. There are signs that Western equipment remains a key ingredient in secret weapons programs, not only in Iraq but elsewhere.
A report to Congress last month concluded that illegal shipments by Western companies had helped Iraq repair or rebuild nearly all of the military production capacity it lost during the war. American intelligence reports have similarly warned of newly aggressive efforts by Iran to acquire the technology needed to produce chemical and biological weapons.
Iran has also ranged further afield, pressing both Russia and China for nuclear reactors that could halve the time needed to produce a nuclear weapon. North Korea has devoted its recent shopping to expertise, coming within minutes last fall of luring a contingent of Russian nuclear scientists to Pyongyang. Libya has tried to buy rocket fuel from a Russian concern. India and Pakistan have been similarly energetic.
In the American-led efforts to curb such commerce, the recriminations of the gulf war still echo. Under pressure from Washington, Germany in particular has taken steps to tighten its once-flaccid export controls. Britain has begun an inquiry to review what led its companies to assist in the Iraqi buildup, including the manufacture by Sheffield Forge-masters of 52 six-meter-long barrels for Iraq's never-completed supergun. With the Iraqi lesson as a model, Congress last fall voted to subject Iran to export restrictions as rigid as those that are in effect on Baghdad.
Not even Iran has proven anywhere near as brazen as Iraq, however, making its quest harder to detect -- and easier to minimize.
In the absence of a recognizable villain like Saddam Hussein, a private company can find the temptation of big business abroad difficult to resist. "One major foreign order is enough incentive for some of these firms to turn a blind eye to the law," said Anthony Cordesman, a Middle East expert who has advocated even more rigid restrictions.
That problem is compounded when governments send mixed messages, as a lawyer for an Atlanta banker argued last week. The client, the local representative of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, is accused of granting nearly $5 billion in unauthorized loans to finance Iraq's military buildup, and former President Bush was served with a subpoena after the lawyer said his testimony was needed to demonstrate that the client was just carrying out unstated United States policy.
Even the Clinton Administration, having vowed to subject Iran and Iraq to a new "dual containment," has yet to reject an appeal by Boeing and General Electric for special permission to sell $750 million worth of commercial aircraft and engines to Iran. Boeing has warned that a White House refusal to approve the sale would effectively surrender thousands of jobs to Europe's Airbus Industries.
 
Vague Pledges and New Pleadings
 Still more powerful pressures affect Germany and Japan, who rely far more heavily on the Iranian market. So it was no surprise that President Clinton was able to win little more than a vague pledge from other leaders at the economic summit in Tokyo to hold Iran and other rogue countries accountable for their actions. As Mr. Milhollin warns, "Most of the companies that sold to Iraq are still in business, and are still looking for sales in the Middle East."
And for governments increasingly preoccupied with job creation, it may be difficult to reject new pleadings from those who insist that their chemical or computer can do no harm.
Any sale looks less sinister when considered individually; but the lesson of Iraq might counter such complacency. As chronicled now, it shows millions of dollars in British and German machine tools used to make centrifuges; sleek new Swiss presses designed to forge nuclear weapons parts; Mercedes-Benz tractors and flat-bed trailers fitted as mobile missile launching pads. Its message is that economic security, for all its importance, remains a subset of something more fundamental.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
The Ph.D.'s Are Here, But the Lab Isn't Hiring

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
SCIENCE professors breed science professors. More or less like mice. Throughout a career of teaching and research, one Ph.D. can produce about 15 new Ph.D.'s to teach and carry on research. If the 15 stay in teaching, and most try to, they can produce 225 more.
Countering the conventional wisdom's often predicted shortage, Dr. David L. Goodstein, a physicist and vice provost of the California Institute of Technology, says the nation faces "a chronic, systemic oversupply of Ph.D.'s, a rising tide of Ph.D.'s that we seem helpless to stem." 
 Dr. Goodstein, who has written of his concerns in The American Scholar magazine, grants that long before his progeny overrun the universe, salaries will tumble, jobs will disappear and they will have to look for other work. Those phenomena seem to have dawned.
The scientific community has yet to suffer unemployment of the magnitudes of airline attendants and steel workers. But this elite, cerebral cadre of the American work force, one for which unemployment rarely happened, has awakened to a new economy.
Statistics illustrate the toll. From 1989 through 1992, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says, the recession drove general unemployment from 5.3 percent of the labor force to 7.4 percent, an increase of two-fifths. Among natural scientists like chemists, physicists and biologists, unemployment was low -- 2.3 percent last year.
The 2.3 percent figure obscures tensions or changes among individual disciplines; demands for environmentalists, who are also in the category, are strong and likely to get stronger. Even so, that rate represents a two-thirds increase in the numbers of unemployed natural scientists over the three years, from 15,000 to 25,000.
Overall unemployment among engineers jumped even more -- 159 percent, or from 27,000 to 70,000 and to a jobless rate of 3.8 percent. Chemical engineers were hit hardest.
The job drought is also affecting undergraduates looking for jobs in the sciences. Among the 402 colleges and universities monitored by the College Placement Council in Bethlehem, Pa., offers to graduating seniors remain well below their pre-recession peaks, as have those from industries that hire the most science and engineering majors.
The council declines to disclose numbers of offers, but says those from the aerospace industry have plunged from 7.4 percent of the offers students received five years ago to 1.4 percent in 1993. Offers by oil companies fell from 9.4 percent to 2.1 percent and by drug companies from 5.2 percent to 3.9 percent.
At Princeton, David Redman, acting dean of the graduate school, said 13 percent of this university's 250 new Ph.D.'s this year were unemployed as of early July, compared with 5 percent a year earlier. Of the new scientists who find university jobs, Dr. Redman said 15 or 20 percent settle for limbo-like post-doctoral fellowships that come without health benefits or the prospect of tenure and that terminate in two to six years.
A reason for the scarcity of jobs in science and engineering is the same that effects everyone: an economy that has been slow to restore jobs that were lost in the recession. But science and engineering, like many industries, has also been struck by something else. The scientific establishment -- aerospace and defense companies and big research universities -- which provided jobs to new graduates is shrinking and appears unlikely to revive anytime soon.
Across the establishment, in the laboratories of Government, industry and some universities, hiring has stalled. In the new tight-fisted corporate economy, industrial companies like A.T.& T., I.B.M. and Westinghouse have shut or shrunk laboratories that once recruited legions of researchers.
Geopolitics is also a major factor. Peace with the Russians has choked off Federal support of weapons research. And Washington's determination to reduce the budget deficit has forced cuts in space and most nonmilitary research.
Now Congress seems prepared to kill Big Science's crown jewel, the $11 billion atom smasher in Texas, known as the superconducting supercollider, on which construction has begun. If the Senate follows the House of Representatives vote in June to stop the work, Jerome Friedman, a physicist, Nobel laureate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and one of the supercollider's planners, says 2,000 scientists will have to find something else to do -- a significant number in the elite world of physics. (Although many scientists note that the supercollider has incurred big cost overruns that helped do it in.)
Professors, of course, like Dr. Friedman say legislators ought to pause before they subject science to the same cost-cutting criteria they bring to building roads. Scientific research, says Leon Lederman, a physicist and Nobel laureate at the University of Illinois, should be as unconstrained as the pursuit of good art. "What's enough music?" he asks.
So in a time of tight budgets, science has been forced to face the same arduous scrutiny that many other important endeavors do, from health care to urban education. Even Dr. Lederman says more scientists could take jobs bringing science to secondary schools.
The culture and wage scales of science discourage secondary school teaching careers, however. Salaries are often less than half the $100,000 that many established doctors of science earn in the top universities. And the culture confers little status on the scientist who abandons the university or Government lab. "You are successful if you end up as a clone of your faculty Ph.D.," said Alan Fechter of the National Research Council.
So now there are more and more scientists competing for fewer and fewer research dollars. Despite the economy's current austerity, universities still pursue such research. As these trends continue, Dr. Goodstein says, the leading universities will crowd out the less elite, forcing them out of the research business.
So far, most university labs have survived, but not because American students are still flocking to them. Instead, graduate and undergraduate science majors are choosing careers as management consultants and Wall Street analysts. But the positions at the university labs have been filled by more and more foreign students -- some of whom pay and some of whom benefit from Federal grants and subsidies to the universities.
That raises another question. Dr. Goodstein writes in The American Scholar: "Congress and the public don't seem yet to have noticed that, while largely ignoring our own students, we are putting our money and our best talent into training our economic competitors."

HEADLINE: U.S. IS TO STATION OFFICIALS IN HANOI

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, July 17

 BODY:
The United States will station diplomats in Vietnam for the first time since the Vietnam war under a plan disclosed today by senior American and Vietnamese officials.
The three diplomats would help the growing number of American families who visit Vietnam seeking information about missing soldiers. There have been no United States diplomats stationed in Hanoi since the French colonial period, which ended in 1954; and United States diplomats left Saigon in the south in the closing days of the Vietnam War in 1975. 
 The arrival of the officials should not be misread as a sign that Washington is preparing for normal relations with Hanoi, said Winston Lord, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs.
But diplomats and Vietnamese officials are sure to see it that way, since it will allow the State Department to have day-to-day contacts with the Vietnamese Government.
The plan, proposed by the United States, was announced today in Hanoi after two days of talks on broader cooperation in investigating the fate of the 2,253 Americans still listed as missing in action in Indochina.
The 22-member United States delegation, led by Mr. Lord, was dispatched by President Clinton earlier this month when he announced his decision to end Washington's opposition to loans to Vietnam by international development agencies.
Mr. Lord said in Hanoi today that he had been given a letter for President Clinton from President Le Duc Anh that promised continued cooperation on the M.I.A.'s. "I can tell you that it expresses great appreciation for the President's decision on the clearing up of Vietnam's debts," Mr. Lord said.
President Clinton has said that Vietnam would have to expand its assistance in resolving the fate of missing Americans if it wanted Washington to consider normalizing relations. He has kept a United States trade embargo imposed when Vietnam was unified under Communist rule in 1975.
At a news conference, Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai said Hanoi was already offering its full cooperation in the search for missing Americans. "But of course there will be more determination and more efforts, and that will lead to more results," he said.
The Defense Department already has a presence in Vietnam -- investigators who work with the Vietnamese to resolve the M.I.A. cases. American officials said that the presence of the diplomats would free the Pentagon teams to concentrate on the investigations.
Mr. Lord said his delegation, which included representatives of veterans' groups, had "laid considerable emphasis" on human rights issues. "We intend to pursue this matter, and the Vietnamese side was very open," he said.
 
The Vietnamese M.I.A.'s
 On Friday, the United States gave Vietnam microfiche copies of Communist documents seized during the war, to help Hanoi determine the fate of 300,000 missing Vietnamese.
Leaders of the veterans' groups said they were pleased with the promises of cooperation, but they warned that the cooperation must be complete.
"If the Vietnamese follow through on what they've pledged, I think there will be great cause for rejoicing," said David Givans, of the Disabled American Veterans. "If they don't, I think it will cause irreparable harm to this whole process."
The United States delegation arrived a week after a visit by Senator Bob Smith, a New Hampshire Republican, who spent four days in northern Vietnam investigating reports that some missing Americans may still be alive. Senator Smith said he believed that some prisoners may still be somewhere in Vietnam.

HEADLINE: Pennies From Hell: A Nation Is Saying, 'Keep the Change'

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 17

 BODY:
In trendy Georgetown, Rocklands barbecue restaurant programs its cash register to round off to $5.70 a check that would normally total $5.66.
More than 1,000 Winn-Dixie, Kroger and other supermarkets offer customers the option of raising their tab to the next dollar, with the extra pennies and other small change designated for charity. 
 And uncounted bars, restaurants and other retail establishments across the land are ignoring register exactitude, preferring to allow 1 to 4 cents a transaction -- occasionally more -- simply to go uncollected.
 
Opposition to Small Change
 Americans have become impatient with transactions involving small change, especially pennies. Increasingly, they seek by their behavior to eliminate the one-cent coin, so prominent in the popular imagination and idiom -- penny pincher, penny arcade, "a penny saved is a penny earned" -- from daily life.
"People are rounding up totals, including tax in the price, and doing all sorts of other things," said Clark Wolf, a Manhattan restaurant consultant. New Yorkers in particular, he added, "really hate pennies a lot."
That disaffection is no doubt encouraged by the fact that inflation has cut purchasing power by 77 percent since 1967, so even children no longer bother to pick up a stray penny from the street.
Indeed, the unpopularity of the penny -- since 1982 made almost entirely of zinc -- has grown considerably of late.
As recently as 1990, the General Accounting Office said that legislation to phase it out, along with the half-dollar, would be a bad idea. Not only are pennies profitable to the Government in that their value exceeds production and distribution costs, but the agency said it had found that people were in no hurry to give them up.
"Demand for the penny remains high and the public is skeptical about the effects, particularly on the poor, of rounding retail cash transactions to the nearest 5 cents," the 1990 report said.
 
Slumping Output at Mint
 But now, reflecting lower demand despite the proliferation of sales taxes to which the penny's survival has been tied, production is on the wane. After peaking at 16.7 billion in 1982, mintage slumped last year to 9.1 billion as society found ways to avoid counting or carrying -- much less saving -- pennies. Nickel production also fell last year, to just 58 percent of the record 1989 level.
Signs of penny-shunning include the ubiquitous cups or bowls placed by merchants near registers with little placards inviting customers to take what they need to ease transactions or to leave pennies deemed unworthy of pocket room.
Few, of course, object to being told to "never mind" the few cents they owe or even to a checkout clerk's polite inquiry about participating in Kroger's "Round Up for the Hungry" program.
 
Some Customers Indignant
 But what might be called surreptitious rounding, even though the customer may receive a receipt showing the overcharge, can arouse indignation when described to consumers and to those whose job it is to protect them.
"I don't see how they can let a cash register round up," said Constantine Cotsoradis, a program manager for the weights and measures section of the Maryland Department of Agriculture. "That's fraudulent."
Jack Gillis, a spokesman for the Consumer Federation of America, which has long campaigned against inaccuracy in supermarket scanners, said he had not yet heard complaints about rounding up. But the idea of not giving notice to the customer "absolutely blows my mind," he said.
When questioned, the owner, John Snedden, and others at Rocklands barbecue here said that their aim was merely to speed transactions by eliminating pennies and that the rounding, though not necessarily to the nearest nickel, lowered as well as raised prices and so did not increase profits. In fact, Mr. Snedden said, the computer program in the registers appears to be rounding down more than up, leaving a loss for the restaurant of $30 a month.
"We're not trying to put anything over on people," Mr. Snedden said, adding that he had begun to round off only after an attempt to eliminate pennies by adjusting pretax prices had failed.
 
Practice Could Spread
 Although the practice of rounding off still appears confined to a relative handful of establishments, the potential for widespread adoption is substantial. No Federal or state bodies are charged with the regulation of cash register accuracy except for registers connected to scales, like those used to weigh meat or produce.
Moreover, today's electronic registers are highly sophisticated, able to handle easily, for example, the three-for-a-dollar situation by charging 34 cents for the first item and 33 cents for the second and third, even when the items move across the checkout counter at different times.
"You can program these things to do almost anything you want," said Richard W. Hayman, president of Hayman Systems, an independent dealer in Laurel, Md. In general, new registers are programmed by dealers to customers' specifications, but most merchants are capable, with the aid of a manual, of reprogramming them when tax rates change or for other purposes.
Nor do there seem to be any specific laws governing rounding off. When asked what strictures apply, regulators cite general prohibitions against fraud and Handbook 44, a publication of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, part of the Commerce Department.
Handbook 44, to which the states subscribe, in practice, declares opaquely that "any recorded money value and any digital money-value indication on a computing-type weighing or measuring device used in retail trade shall be in mathematical agreement with its associated quantity representation or indication to the nearest 1 cent of money value."
According to Barry Wood, a document-testing analyst at Casio Inc., an equipment manufacturer in Europe has led the way in rounding off because of the adoption there of value-added taxes on goods and because of the rapid erosion in some currencies, like the Italian lira, a fraction of which is practically worthless. In some places, bits of candy substitute for trivial change.
The practice of rounding away a country's smallest unit is "called Scandinavian rounding," Mr. Wood said.
 
No Reason to Horde
 With pennies now consisting of just 2.4 percent copper, there seems no prospect for a repeat of the 1970's experience when soaring prices for the metal helped inspire hoarding. The resulting shortage of circulating pennies was so acute that some retailers offered to buy them in bulk for premiums of up to 5 percent. Zinc, worth roughly half as much as copper, is a poor candidate for profits from household stockpiling.
Indeed, assuming continued legislative indifference, rounding off to the nickel may be the means by which the public works its will and rids itself of a coin good for almost nothing except to pay sales taxes. But the penny's extinction, and the convenience it would bring, are unlikely to come at no cost.
"I do not have personal experience of anyone rounding down," observed Mr. Wolf, the restaurant consultant. "That's antithetical to commerce."

HEADLINE: Woman in Photo Is Found Safe

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: FARMINGDALE, L.I., July 17

 BODY:
A woman whose photo was found in the bedroom of Joel Rifkin, the unemployed landscaper who the police say has confessed to killing 17 women, was found to be alive and well today after an extensive search, the state police said.
The police feared the worst when they found two pictures of her in Mr. Rifkin's East Meadow home. Detectives released photographs of the woman on Thursday and asked the public for help in identifying her. 
 The police have said that they found identification belonging to women said to be Mr. Rifkin's victims in his bedroom, along with lingerie, jewelry and other items.
Today the woman was found to be alive, said a state police spokesman, Lieut. Eugene Corcoran. At her request, her identity is being withheld, Lieutenant Corcoran said. The woman was "a past social acquaintance" of Mr. Rifkin's, the spokesman said.
On Friday, the police said that several people had told them that they knew the woman and that her first name was Kathy.
Mr. Rifkin, 34, is charged with the murder of one woman whose body was found in his truck in Nassau County on June 28. He has confessed to killing 17 women, mostly prostitutes, whom he said he strangled after having sex with them, according to the police.
He is said to have dumped their bodies in woods and rivers throughout New York State.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL NOTES;
Yo, Florio, Yo, Whitman; Foes Trade Ring Cliches

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY

 BODY:
It is unclear just which of the New Jersey gubernatorial candidates -- the Democratic incumbent, Jim Florio, or the Republican challenger, Christine Todd Whitman -- threw the first boxing metaphor. But six weeks into the general election race, the state's promised political fight of the century has shaped up as a lackluster affair with each side trying to pound the other purple with prose.
Polls show Mr. Florio and Mrs. Whitman even in the governor's race. Behind the verbal sparring that has dominated the campaign is an attempt by Mr. Florio to soften his opponent's standing by creating public doubt about her. Mrs. Whitman's strategy has been to fend off Mr. Florio and to stress the record $2.8 billion tax increase the Governor pushed through in 1990 and the state's limp economy. 
 But Mr. Florio, a former Navy light middleweight, has clearly been the aggressor.
Among the flurry of daily jabs at Mrs. Whitman from the Florio corner is the charge that she has dodged reporters in an attempt to avoid embarrassing public blunders.
Mrs. Whitman's camp delivered a crisp response.
"If reporters want to talk to Whitman, they can look at her schedule and they can find her," Carl Golden, her chief spokesman, was quoted as saying. "If reporters are too lazy to go find her, that's their problem."
Mr. Florio unleashed what was seen as his best punch last week, his defense of the state's gun law, the toughest in the nation, which has brought him nationwide attention and has the support of nearly 80 percent of the New Jersey public. The Governor invited reporters to a gun range last week where law-enforcement officers demonstrated an array of semiautomatic weapons that are banned under the state law.
The event was staged to keep alive the repercussions of what is seen as a political blunder Mrs. Whitman made earlier this month when she visited a Jersey City gun shop, Caso's Gun-a-Rama. She told patrons there that she would support a grandfather provision allowing owners of semiautomatic assault weapons to keep them if they had bought them before the ban took effect three years ago.
Mr. Florio also used the news conference again to accuse Mrs. Whitman of dodging reporters, the issues and him. "You can't be trying to rope-a-dope your way through an entire campaign," Mr. Florio said.
It was a bow in the direction of Muhammad Ali, who in a 1974 fight against George Foreman leaned against the ropes for the first few rounds while his opponent pummeled him nonstop and then came back to defeat the spent Mr. Foreman.
Mrs. Whitman again drew on boxing images for her response.
"Rather than staging events, the Governor might make himself available to discuss the underlying causes of crime -- joblessness, low quality of education, grinding poverty -- which he has ignored for the past three and one-half years," she said in a statement. "Come on, Governor. The bell has rung; get off your stool, come out of your corner, and defend yourself at all times."
 
Ibid., Op. Cit., Cf., Headache
 In a recent New Jersey Supreme Court ruling, Associate Justice Robert L. Clifford demonstrated he is as exacting in legal writing as he is in jurisprudence with a blistering commentary on the use of footnotes.
Justice Clifford joined the court in a unanimous ruling that said a lawyer or law partners may serve as municipal attorney and municipal prosecutor for the same town. But in a separate concurring opinion, Justice Clifford said he was troubled by one aspect of the majority opinion, noting that a major point in the ruling had been relegated to a footnote instead of being stated in the actual ruling.
Justice Clifford described it as a setback "in my woefully ineffectual campaign to abolish footnotes from our opinions."
Legal footnotes are intended to serve the same purpose as those in high school term papers: to cite a reference or to add support or evidence for a statement or a opinion.
But Justice Clifford made it clear in his opinion that he thought the use of footnotes was being abused in law.
"They distract," he wrote. "They cause the reader to drop the eyes; to absorb what is usually a monumental piece of irrelevancy or pseudo-scholarship but is sometimes -- as here -- a significant pronouncement that rightly belongs in the text; and then to return, without skipping a beat, to the point of departure on the upper part of the page."
Justice Clifford concluded: "The whole irritating process points up the soundness of John Barrymore's observation." Barrymore, he recalled, once said that reading footnotes was "like having to run downstairs to answer the doorbell during the first night of the honeymoon."

HEADLINE: THE MIDWEST FLOODING;
Like Flood, Policy Shift Could Topple the Levees

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, July 17

 BODY:
Even as the Mississippi River continues to swamp cropland and force thousands of people from their homes, a debate is taking shape in Washington and the Midwest over whether to rebuild the levees that have washed away or to dismantle some and allow flood waters in the future to cover low-lying areas, effectively turning them into temporary reservoirs.
Two assessments by the Army Corps of Engineers, one completed almost a decade ago and one done this week for The New York Times, found that flood crests in Iowa, Illinois and Missouri would have been two to three feet lower had the river not been confined by hundreds of miles of levees on both sides of the Mississippi. 
 But the engineers who conducted the assessments also asserted that the volumes of water were so great in this flood that even with levees protecting only cities, the property damage would have been just as extensive.
"I just don't see the big effect that everybody thinks," said Gary Dyhouse, the chief of the hydrology section at the Army Corps of Engineers district office here and the author of one assessment. "The levees have been breached upstream. The flood plain is full of water from bluff to bluff, in some places three and four miles across, and we are still seeing a rising crest in St. Louis."
 
'Drag on the Economy'
 Other experts, though, have taken issue with that analysis of the levees' influence on flooding. Dr. Charles B. Belt Jr., an associate professor of geology at St. Louis University, studied the last great flood that occurred here in 1973, and concluded that the levees pushed the flood waters eight feet higher than they would have been if there had been no levees.
"The corps argues a foot is insignificant," Dr. Belt said in an interview here. "Two or three feet can mean the difference in how much property is damaged. It's a legitimate question whether the Government should put more money into this system of flood protection. Should the Government be subsidizing behavior that is getting more and more expensive? As a scientist, I'm not going to answer it. But as a taxpayer, I think it's a drag on the economy."
For weeks across this region where the Mississippi River has turned once-placid farm fields into huge and muddy lakes, the debate has been played out in real life. As pressure from conservation groups and others begins to mount in Washington for tearing down some levees, hundreds of residents in south St. Louis and farm families in Quincy, Ill., have been making their opinions known with shovels and sandbags as they work day and night to strengthen levees protecting their property.
At issue in the struggle both on the ground here and in Washington is how to control the Mississippi. The debate will involve economic and environmental factors that played no role 65 years ago when the United States first began to develop the dams, reservoirs and levees that transformed the Mississippi and its tributaries into restricted ribbons of water.
 
Some See Chance for Change
 Undoing parts of that mammoth plumbing system, proponents say, would enable the country to take advantage of the river's natural system for controlling floods at much less overall cost. Levees would not have to be rebuilt at a cost of $1 million a mile or more. And flood damage in the future would be reduced, they contend. Neither the states nor the Army Corps of Engineers yet know the extent of damage to the levees and the total cost of repairing them or removing some.
Most of the levee system between St. Louis and Rock Island, Ill., the region that sustained the most damage, is owned by farmers and other private interests. The Federal Government, though, pays 80 percent of the cost of repairing private levees that fail or are damaged, and the decision of whether to rebuild all or part of the levee system rests primarily with Congress and the Clinton Administration.
Though conservationists and wildlife officials in several states have urged the Government to refrain from rebuilding every levee and allow the energy of floods to dissipate over a wider expanse of land, such a departure in the Government's long-standing response to flooding would also subject farmers to more frequent damage to their land.
That possibility has left farmers and their families in the Upper Mississippi Valley not only battling flood waters but also looking ahead to a political fight none say they want. In Clarksville, Mo., 40 miles north of here, one farmer, Sarah Sterne, can look from her porch on a hill and see flood water covering every square inch for miles, including almost half of her family's 1,000-acre farm.
 
'Doesn't Make Much Sense'
 "Our family has been here farming for 50 years," she said. "We have had great benefit from these levees. It stands to reason that if you have crops planted you want to protect them. Families earn their livelihoods out there. Tearing them down or cutting holes in them? That just doesn't make much sense to me."
But that is precisely what some conservationists, independent engineers and state and Federal wildlife agencies are beginning to call for. These experts, who include staff members of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, contend that the disaster in the Upper Mississippi Valley was made worse by the Government's flood control structures. They argue that the levees hemmed in the river, causing more water to flow through a tighter space, thus causing flood levels to rise much higher than they would had the waters been allowed to take their natural course.
They are calling for levees to be moved farther from the river's edge or dismantled. "The challenge will be for the Congress to say to the Corps of Engineers, 'You must start using the flood plain as an ally in your flood control efforts,' " said Kevin J. Coyle, the president of American Rivers, a 20-year-old river conservation group in Washington. "They need two arrows in their quiver, engineering and nature. The nature part has been sadly missing."
 
Advocates in Federal Agency
 Mr. Coyle and other advocates of the new approach are urging the Federal Government and the states to restore wetlands, develop new riverside parks, establish wildlife refuges and take other measures to develop uninhabited regions in the flood plain to restore some of the Mississippi River Valley's natural capacity to absorb huge amounts of water and diminish catastrophic flooding.
"We don't want to see people moved out of their homes," said Richard C. Nelson, the supervisor of the Rock Island office of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages refuges along the Mississippi. "But it's worth looking at alternatives that will cost less to maintain and could be more effective in controlling floods."
While causing jitters among farm families and small-business owners across much of the Upper Mississippi Valley, such talk has also led the Army Corps of Engineers to question the validity of the data on which the calls for a new approach are based.
Mr. Dyhouse and his colleague, S. K. Nanda, the chief hydrologist at the engineers' district office in Rock Island, readily acknowledge that levees have raised flood levels. In addition, Mr. Dyhouse said that dams and reservoirs on tributaries had withheld enough water to compensate for the extra rise because of the levees.
Late this week, with data from a river gauge in Quincy, Ill., Mr. Nanda did a preliminary analysis of the effect of levees on the flood from Rock Island, Ill., south to Quincy.
Between the two Illinois cities are private levees that protect 360,000 acres of cropland on both sides of the river in Illinois, Iowa, and Missouri. As the flood crest moved downstream, the levees were breached or flooded over. Every time a new field was swamped, the gauge recorded a drop in the river's level, usually two or three feet, Mr. Nanda said. But with the river flowing at 500,000 cubic feet per second, the gauge came right back up hours later when the fields were full of water.
"What that says is that when the Mississippi is screaming past at these flows, the lands protected by the levees don't mean much," Mr. Nanda said. "They don't have enough storage volume to make a lasting difference."
Mr. Nanda added that he was prepared to take on critics of the corps about the value of levees. "These levee districts protect land that produces good for mankind," Mr. Nanda said. "They don't get flooded every year. Maybe once in 20 or 30 years. That has to be considered. Should we give up entirely all production on this land, making it nothing but swamps? In my thinking this is a resource to be used to produce food for all of us. Once in a while we'll take the loss."

HEADLINE: Action Taken in 216th Session of New York State Legislature

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 17

 BODY:
The New York State Legislature recessed its 216th session at 8:44 A.M. on July 8, 13 days after its scheduled closing. Despite toiling through the Fourth of July weekend, lawmakers left much work undone. They have to return to Albany for a special session later in the year to revamp the state's hospital payment regulations, which expire on Dec. 31, and may take up other unfinished business.
The session was notable for three weeks of paralysis caused by a deadlock between the Republican-controlled Senate and the majority-Democratic Assembly on the issue of rent regulation. The Democrats eventually agreed to relax rent-stabilization laws on apartments for the wealthiest tenants in exchange for a four-year extension of rent laws. 
 Another significant achievement of the session was passage of the Environmental Protection Act, which is intended to funnel $95 million a year eventually to land preservation and other environmental purposes. But Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and many legislators say that the financing behind the bill is tenuous. The money may be diverted to balance the state budget if the economy does not improve.
The Assembly passed 1,131 of the 8,433 bills introduced in that house, while the Senate passed 1,252 of the 6,212 bills introduced. A total of 837 bills passed both houses. Of those, Mr. Cuomo has signed 265 bills and vetoed 13 by today. As usual, much of the Legislature's activity came on the last day of the six-month session. Of the 1,131 bills passed by the Assembly, 104 were approved on the last day.
Following are the major actions of the session.
 
 
The Budget
 As in 1992, the most significant accomplishment of the budget's enactment this year was its completion virtually on time, only five days after the April 1 start of the fiscal year. Still, the state budget has not actually been passed before the deadline for the last nine years.
The spending plan for the 1993-94 fiscal year, including all Federal money, totals $59.4 billion, an increase of 8.4 percent over the previous year. The general fund budget, which consists of most state tax and fee collections, is $31.5 billion, an increase of 1.6 percent.
The Legislature and Mr. Cuomo raised cigarette taxes by 17 cents a pack to 56 cents, one of the highest levels in the country. They increased state aid to schools by $330 million and, in the process, revised the school aid formula so that the proportion of assistance received by New York City increased slightly for the first time in years.
Budget negotiations began in January, when Mr. Cuomo projected that the state's budget shortfall would be $3.7 billion. But New York's fiscal picture improved in the next few months -- the state finished the 1992-93 fiscal year with a surplus of about $140 million -- and that reduced the shortfall to about $3 billion. The unexpected revenue allowed the state to forgo proposed cuts in Medicaid and drug education programs and to create a $100 million reserve fund. But the Legislature still adopted a Cuomo proposal to take $516 million from a dedicated transportation fund, using it to balance the budget.

HEADLINE: EGYPT EXECUTES 5 MORE MILITANTS

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, July 17

 BODY:
The Egyptian Government hanged five more Islamic militants today as part of a sweeping crackdown that both officials and Islamic leaders say has inflicted the worst damage on the fundamentalist movement since it began its campaign of violent attacks 18 months ago.
The executions bring to 14 the number of militants hanged by the Government in the last five weeks, the largest number put to death for terrorist offenses here. Seven other militants, still at large, have been condemned to death in absentia. 
 Under the Government's tough new counterinsurgency measures against Islamic militants, hundreds of other suspects have also been arrested in the last few weeks, and military courts have handed down swift, and often harsh sentences.
Egyptian intelligence officials say they have penetrated many cells of the movement, arrested several key figures and uncovered large numbers of arms and bomb making equipment.
 
Militants Lie Low
 "The Islamic Group has clearly been hurt," one Western diplomat said, referring to the main organization of Islamic militants. "The question is how much, and for how long. Many of the militants are lying low and trying to wait this out."
The Islamic Group has carried out a series of bomb attacks and assassinations of police officers, Coptic Christians, intellectuals, Government officials and foreign tourists here in the last 18 months. A total of 180 people have been killed in the attacks and Egypt's $2.2 billion tourism industry has been devastated.
With the aid of Pakistan, the Egyptian Government has shut down several of the offices that had been used by the militants in the border town of Peshawar and curbed the amount of money funneled to the movement from outside the country.
The number of attacks linked to the Islamic Group, which regards Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman as its spiritual leader, have also declined.
 
Government Is Cautious
 But Government officials, embarrassed by statements last year that they had wiped out the movement only to have the attacks resume, are being cautious in assessing their progress, saying only that they have inflicted heavy damage.
"It is still too early to say whether the movement has been broken," one Government official said.
The Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anomymity, said that for all the force the Government has employed, it has not addressed underlying issues like poverty, unemployment and limits on political expression that he said had "pushed many young men into this extremist movement."
Several followers of Sheik Abdel Rahman are now in detention in the United States facing charges in connection with the Feb. 26 bombing at the World Trade Center in New York and a plot to bomb other sites and carry out assassinations there.
An aide to the cleric was arrested late Friday in New Jersey and charged with conspiracy to assassinate President Hosni Mubarak. The President's spokesman in Cairo said he had no comment on the arrest.
 
Mubarak Runs Unopposed
 President Mubarak, who faces no opposition in his bid to be nominated by the Parliament on Wednesday for a third six-year term in office, had been hesitant to carry out executions until this year.
Many of his critics say his decision to allow courts to hand down 22 death sentences, and the wide police sweeps that have left hundreds of people in jail without being charged with any crimes, may be counterproductive in the long term, although they admit that the measures have momentarily crippled the underground movement.
"This is unlike anything President Mubarak has ever done," a former high-ranking Egyptian diplomat, Tahseen Basheer, said. "And it is risky. There may be no immediate boomerang, as many in the Islamic movement go deeper underground, but the Government must begin to confront the socio-economic difficulties that create this movement, or it will only return."
The five militants were hanged consecutively today beginning at 6:30 A.M over a two and a half hour period. Three were found guilty of trying to assassinate Information Minister Safwat Sherif by ambushing his car on April 20. The minister's bodyguard was seriously wounded, but Mr. Sherif sustained only a minor cut on his hand.
Two of the three men were also found guilty of planting a bomb in central Cairo that killed a police explosives expert who was trying to defuse the device. The remaining two men were convicted of placing a bomb under tourist buses outside the Egypt Museum on March 16 and tossing a homemade bomb at a bus.
In the Cairo slum of Imbaba, a militant cleric described the setbacks to the movement as he sat over a cup of tea in a shop with several assistants.
"The movement, and especially the Islamic Group, has had to disappear from public view for the moment," the cleric said. "All these arrests, the constant police sweeps and the information the police get from interrogations have taken a toll. But if the Government thinks this is anything more than a lull they are mistaken, and when the violence begins again it will be even more vicious and deadly."
Since December the Government has arrested 6,000 suspects, many of whom have yet to be charged, according to Montasser al-Zayyat, a lawyer for Sheik Abdel Rahman.
"They are using everything they have to try and break the Islamic movement," Mr. Zayyat said in a recent interview.

HEADLINE: Bulgaria Has a University In U.S. Style

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BLAGOYEVGRAD, Bulgaria

 BODY:
Mike Orenduff, president of the University of Maine at Farmington, seems at home at what used to be the desk of the mighty regional first secretary of the Communist Party.
It is here, in the palace that the former dictatorship built for its top officials shortly before falling from power in 1989, that Mr. Orenduff is preparing for the arrival of a third class of students for the American University in Bulgaria. A lanky professor of philosophy, Mr. Orenduff is filling in as the university's interim president. 
 Though he has adjusted to his desk and office, Mr. Orenduff has moved out of the luxurious hunting lodge that formerly belonged to Todor Zhivkov, Bulgaria's leader for 35 years. The American said he felt intimidated by the building's size and splendor and the army of servants who hastened to fulfill wishes he had not even felt.
"It's not what American college presidents are used to," he said. He and his wife, Lai, an art historian, moved into a small two-bedroom apartment.
Despite his misgivings, Mr. Orenduff would have stayed in Mr. Zhivkov's former lodge if the University did not need the building as a dormitory.
 
Old High School Revived
 In a similar conversion of Communist premises, the American College, a private high school that operated in Sofia, the capital, from the 1860's until 1942, has recovered its campus from the Interior Ministry and resumed classes last year. The ministry had used the school to train its forces, including the dreaded secret police.
The American University's next freshman class will raise the number of students to 600.
Mr. Orenduff said the 600 were chosen from a large pool of applicants. To be admitted into the only American university in formerly Communist Europe -- the only institution of higher education here that charges fees -- students have to pass the standard Scholastic Aptitude Test and the Test of English as a Foreign Language.
All instruction is in English, and the faculty of 35 comprises 28 Americans, one Briton, one Canadian, 4 Bulgarians and one Pole.
The English-speaking ability of the students working at the university this summer is astonishing in view of the severe isolation of Bulgaria. Most are graduates of a network of high schools throughout the country that have begun teaching most subjects in English.
 
High Scores in S.A.T.
 The candidates' scores on the S.A.T., a college-entrance test taken throughout the United States, is equally startling, Mr. Orenduff said. Out of a possible score of 1,600, the average score of the first class, in 1991, was 1,106, compared with 896 in the United States.
"They're fantastic," said Janet E. Connolly, an associate professor and a sociologist from Temple University. "They're so well read. They express a civility toward us Americans that I don't see in America."
Professor Connolly, who is 64, took a year's leave from Temple in 1991 to be part of the founding faculty, and her husband resigned as Mayor of New Hope, Pa., to accompany her. Now, she said, she is not thinking of returning to Temple. "I would like to see the first class graduate," she said. Her husband has taught a course in business law.
Konstantin Stoev, a 21-year-old student who is a native of this town of 75,000 at the foot of the Rila Mountains 50 miles south of Sofia, said Bulgarian students applied "because we believe American-style education would have greater market value than Bulgarian."
He said diplomas from the university "will be valid throughout the world" because it is accredited through the University of Maine, which supervises its academic standards.
 
A Different Atmosphere
 Some students questioned said they felt that courses did not go deeply enough into subjects to prepare them for careers. Explanations that a wide-ranging education is the goal of many American universities are greeted skeptically by young people in a hurry to take advantage of Bulgaria's conversion to a free economy.
What impresses students most is the informality of the college atmosphere and the accessibility of professors. "They try to make contact with students," said Elena Taskova, 21, who works in the information office during the summer.
"In Bulgarian schools it's very hierarchic," Mr. Stoev said.
At first students were slow to adapt, Mr. Orenduff said. "They came from a system that didn't encourage innovation, asking questions and certainly not challenging authority," he said. "It was exasperating."
"They've taken to it with a vengeance," he continued. "Now they love it. I think we've created a monster. They challenge everything. They've become like American students."

HEADLINE: Vargas Llosa Disparages Peru, and Vice Versa

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES

 BODY:
Ask Peruvians about Mario Vargas Llosa and more often than not the reaction is surprisingly bitter.
"He hasn't lived here for three years," said Luis San Martin, a cabdriver who used to run a steel fabricating business. "How does he know what we need, what we are going through? It's easy to talk from Spain or London. But he doesn't live with the reality of the country, people getting killed every day, misery and poverty." 
 The writer, who almost became Peru's President three years ago, is now among the country's most disliked figures.
President Alberto K. Fujimori, who edged out Mr. Vargas Llosa in June 1990, has more than 60 percent popular support in polls. Mr. Vargas Llosa's ratings hover around 10 percent.
In his latest book, "El Pez en el Agua, Memorias," or "The Fish in the Water, Memories," he tries to shake off feelings of betrayal by Peru and to unveil the perpetual dirtiness of politics there, but he only succeeded in fueling his countrymen's anger.
The book devotes 10 chapters to his youth, particularly his troubled relationship with an autocratic and brutal father, interspersed with 10 chapters about his political career, which ended when he left Lima in 1990 for Europe, promising never to re-enter politics.
What angers Peruvians most is that Mr. Vargas Llosa spares no one, including former supporters of his Libertad movement.
He describes as "cheap intellectuals" those leftists who denounced American expansionism, then sought lucrative positions at American universities. And he excoriates a number of former conservative allies who have supported President Fujimori since he seized near-dictatorial power on April 5, 1992.
Hernando de Soto, one of Peru's most noted political and economic thinkers, was described as "pompous and ridiculous" by Mr. Vargas Llosa.
Sitting in the comfortable Plaza Hotel here, in the middle of a book tour, Mr. Vargas Llosa said the attacks against him did not sting that much.
"There is nothing that they can say to me that they didn't say during the campaign," he said. "I had to be specific and use names, otherwise the book would have no real weight."
He says unequivocably that he is done with politics, was a bad politician -- being too honest with the public -- and will never run for office again.
"I am returning to the ranks of the intellectuals and from there I plan, as I have always done, to be critical and express opinions and engage in polemics," he said.
Perhaps the most explosive pronouncement was his call for the United States to impose the same economic sanctions on Peru as on Haiti, after Mr. Fujimori closed Congress and the courts.
Peruvians, beaten down by poverty, guerrilla violence and economic recession, took great offense, since in large measure they saw Mr. Fujimori's actions as the only way to combat terrorism.
"The attitude here is that Vargas Llosa looks upon Peru as a Haitian dictatorship, and according to the polls the people do not think that way," said Alfredo Torres, president of the Apoyo polling group. "He is seen as elitist, an aloof intellectual who is against the country. I don't think he could ever come back to Peru. He would be insulted in the streets."
Mr. Vargas Llosa, apparently recognizing that fact, talks almost as a man without a country. "I am a Peruvian by geographical accident," he said, adding that he felt the current outcry was an attempt by enemies in the military "to use me as a scapegoat."
He concedes there could be some connection between his bitterness toward his autocratic father and his harsh pronouncements on the troubles of his country and his preference for living outside its borders.
"One thing my father instilled in me was an intense desire for liberty, to be free and not bound by anything," he said. "They criticize me for not living in Peru, but I am going to live where I please, wherever I write best."

HEADLINE: Once Destitute, Oneida Tribe Braces for Flood of Gambling Profits

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VERONA, N.Y., July 15

 BODY:
Until just a year ago, the Oneida Indians were in a struggle against extinction. Their once-sprawling territory in central New York had been whittled to a 32-acre grassy patch where two dozen families lived in rusted trailer homes discarded by the Federal Government. Unemployment routinely topped 60 percent. Their once-proud culture had been forgotten by almost all but the elders.
But these days, no one sees destitution when they look at the Oneida Territory. They see Fortune 500. 
 On Tuesday, the tribe will open a shimmering green-glass casino 35 miles east of Syracuse, and the changes under way in this rural region could not be more stark than if all the 1,100 Oneidas living on or near the reservation had just won the lottery.
 
Grand Expectations
 The new Turning Stone Casino, the first legal one to operate in New York State in at least a century, will be one of the largest table-game operations in the country and could generate over $100 million annually, tribal leaders predict.
With over 2,000 jobs from gambling and other ventures, the tribe is likely to become the largest employer in a two-county region next year. Investment proposals have begun pouring into the tribe, for everything from hot dog stands to hotels. And in a few years, tribal leaders say, every Oneida who wants a college education or a new home will get one -- at no charge.
"The only thing that limits us now is our imaginations," said Ray Halbritter, 43, the elected leader of the tribe.
For residents of the verdant Mohawk Valley, whose rolling hills, dairy farms and cornfields gently embrace the casino, the transformation could be no less breathtaking.
 
A Speculation Boom
 The anticipated flood of gambling dollars has already sparked a small boom in real estate speculation near the casino. New businesses are opening and existing ones expanding in the one-stoplight towns nearby. And homeowners are bracing for their narrow roads to become jammed with buses and cars from Buffalo, Toronto, New York City and beyond.
"If someone had said three years ago that the first legal casino in New York would be opening a stone's throw from Oneida City, most of us would have said, 'Yeah, and I'll bet you're selling swampland in Florida,' " said Thomas K. Millard, executive director of the Greater Oneida Chamber of Commerce. "People cannot begin to conceive what the effect will be."
When their casino opens, the Oneidas will join about 70 tribes across the nation who offer gambling under the Indian Gaming Act of 1988. Designed to generate wealth on impoverished Indian reservations, the law allows tribes to operate for-profit games of chance not otherwise outlawed by the state.
Although the Oneidas are only the most recent tribe to use the 1988 law, they are emblematic of the hopes, fears and conflicts gambling has generated on reservations nationwide.
The Oneidas say they will use their profits for social services that could reduce their dependency on Federal programs, including college scholarships, housing and a senior citizen center. Later, they plan to invest in businesses, possibly hotels, restaurants and stores near the casino.
"You can't act like a sovereign nation until you have economic independence," Mr. Halbritter said.
 
5,000 Gamblers Daily
 The $10 million casino will be owned entirely by the Oneida Nation but managed by NYGM Inc., a Reno-based company that is awaiting approval by the Federal Government. Construction has been financed through bank loans and profits from the Oneidas' bingo parlor, which has been operating about six years, Mr. Halbritter said.
The 68,000-square-foot casino will offer 168 tables for blackjack, roulette, craps and other games. The gambling area, nearly the length of a football field, can accommodate up to 5,000 gamblers a day, the Oneidas estimate.
By comparison, the average Atlantic City casino has about 90 table games, said Marvin B. Roffman, president of a Philadelphia money-management company that tracks the gambling industry. "It would surprise me if they were not a big success," he said.
Only half of the tables will be available on Tuesday, because the Oneidas are still training dealers. The remainder will be open by September, Mr. Halbritter said. The casino will not have slot machines, the most profitable of gambling games, because they are outlawed in New York State.
Designed by the Manhattan firm of David Smotrich and Partners, the casino is purposely not glitzy, to convey the sense that Verona is not Vegas. Barely visible from the street, the low-slung structure seems to flow out of a grassy berm. Inside, ventilation ducts crisscross the ceiling underneath a vaulted skylight running the length of the gambling area. At one end, a restaurant overlooks an artificial pond filled with snapping turtles and frogs.
Last week, the building was a beehive of last-minute preparations as hundreds of workers installed computers, laid bathroom tiles and planted wildflowers while scores of newly trained dealers and cashiers received final instructions.
 
Not Atlantic City
 "This is fun because people are excited; it's going to be what Atlantic City was like when it started," said Sean Costales, 24, as he modeled the pleated red shirt he will wear as a craps dealer.
Like several other dealers who came to Verona from previous casino jobs, Mr. Costales said he quit Atlantic City because work there had become spotty. "Atlantic City," he said, snapping his fingers, "is all tapped out."
Already, the casino has generated the most economic activity the region has seen in a decade, local officials said. And with the anticipated closing of Griffiss Air Force Base 12 miles to the north and the loss of several thousand military jobs, the casino is emerging as one of the area's chief economic engines.
Since January, the tribe has received more than 9,000 applications for an expected 2,000 casino jobs. To date, they have hired about 1,000 workers.
"There's just not really a whole lot of jobs in the area to support a wife and child," said Steven Costa, 28, an Air Force mechanic who lost his job recently and has applied for a maintenance position at the casino. "I don't know anybody else hiring like they are."
Real-estate agents say prices for property near the casino have increased fivefold in recent months, with inquiries coming from large national hotel and restaurant chains.
A mile away, Joel's Frontyard Steakhouse and Saloon has hired eight new workers and extended its hours to handle increased business, since tribe policy bans alcohol sales at the casino. "It could triple our business," said Jill Klossner, whose family owns the restaurant.
Small businesses tied to gambling are also cropping up. In the City of Oneida, for instance, a store that purchases jewelry from indebted gamblers is about to open.
 
Land Dispute Emerges
 Amid the high hopes, the casino has also raised fears that the Oneidas will begin buying up land and taking it off the tax rolls. Indeed, the tribe has purchased more than 400 acres in the past year. And it has a lawsuit pending against several counties in which the tribe contends that 300,000 acres of Oneida land were purchased in violation of Federal treaties and either should be returned or reparations paid.
But Mr. Halbritter has sought to allay such concerns in meetings with hundreds of local officials and civic groups. The effort has succeeded, partly because the Oneidas have also spread their wealth: Since last year, the tribe has contributed nearly $200,000 to local organizations such as the Red Cross. It has also agreed to give the Town of Verona $300,000 to renovate its Town Hall.
Mr. Halbritter has also had to battle members of his tribe. Some anti-gambling Oneidas, with the support of leaders from the neighboring Onondaga tribe, have challenged his authority, saying he no longer represents the majority of Oneidas. Mr. Halbritter dismisses their efforts as a power play for control of the casino.
Despite the conflicts, Mr. Halbritter, a Harvard-trained lawyer and father of six, talks like a man on the cusp of vindication.
He often tells visitors how, in 1975, local firefighters failed to respond to repeated calls for help as a fast-spreading fire consumed the trailer owned by his aunt and uncle. Both died. Mr. Halbritter says the experience taught him about the need for self-sufficiency on Indian reservations.
Today, though the tribe doesn't have a fire department, it does have its own 28-member police force.
"It's quite astonishing when you think about it," he said.

HEADLINE: Elizabeth to Restore Former Hub

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ELIZABETH, N.J., July 16

 BODY:
After 10 years of stop-and-start efforts, this Colonial port city is poised to begin its largest redevelopment project, a $100 million restoration of a tract that once served as its industrial crossroads.
City officials see the tract, a frayed fringe of 23 acres on the edge of the central shopping district, as the right piece of property at the right time to develop into market-rate residential housing and commercial and retail space. They also see it as an economic necessity for a city of 110,000 in which 47 percent of the property is tax exempt, owned either by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey or by Union County, for which Elizabeth is the seat of government. 
 When the project is finished, the city expects up to $1.9 million in tax revenue, compared with $80,000 now.
"With cutbacks in state and Federal aid, municipalities have to find ways to increase their own revenues," said Mayor J. Christian Bollwage. "We can't forget the 80's boom. Elizabeth missed its chance in the 80's. We need to be ready for the next economic upturn."
 
Prosperity Long Ago
 The proposed redevelopment covers an area that prospered in the Industrial Revolution as a coal and lumber hub along the Elizabeth River and the city's main rail line, which is now part of Amtrak.
But by the 1960's, manufacturing and shipping had all but abandoned the city, the waterfront commerce was in a long decline and the midtown tract had became more valuable as parking for train commuters than for business or industry.
Attempts through the 1980's to acquire the land -- the many lots were owned by N.J. Transit and by private individuals -- and agree on a developer met with bad luck, poor timing and, say some critics of the administration of the previous Mayor, Thomas G. Dunn, which lasted 28 years, a lack of political will.
Positioning himself as a vigorous, fresh voice for renewal, Mr. Bollwage, 38, a former Councilman, campaigned in part on a pledge to see the midtown project to completion. He defeated Mr. Dunn in the Democratic primary and easily overcame his Republican rival in the general election last November.
 
400 Town Houses Seen
 Earlier this month, the City Council voted to retain Sea Crest Construction Corporation of Freeport, L.I., to refine the development plans that form the basis for the city's project.
Sea Crest and city officials envision 400 two- and three-bedroom town houses, ranging from 1,000 to 1,500 square feet; 450,000 square feet of commercial space of which up to 75,000 would be retail, and two multi-deck parking garages for 800 cars. Officials said that although it was too early to set prices, some town houses might sell in the $135,000 range.
"We hope to attract young couples, commuters, people who are just starting out," Mr. Bollwage said. "That and middle-income families, because we'll have a good amount of open green land around the houses."
The redevelopment is closely tied to N.J. Transit's proposal for a rail link between Newark International Airport, downtown Newark and downtown Elizabeth. This $850 million project, which has been endorsed by the N.J. Transit board and could be completed by the end of the century, would put downtown Elizabeth within 10 minutes of the airport terminals, Mr. Bollwage said.
 
Railroad Station to Restaurant
 Sea Crest has also proposed converting a local landmark, the abandoned, century-old Romanesque Jersey Central railroad station, into a restaurant.
In the next four to six months, the city plans to acquire the remaining parcels needed for the project, demolish several buildings, including a rundown motel, and arrange for possible environmental cleanup where old fuel storage tanks are buried.
The city expects nearly $2 million in loans for land acquisition from the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, and $900,000 more from a state Green Acres grant for a park along the river. All told, the city's preparation costs, before selling the land to Sea Crest, could run between $5 million and $10 million.
Sea Crest, officials said, intends to build the project in phases, selling the town houses and renting commercial space. A purchase price for the tract remains to be negotiated.

Follow Money Trail to the Answer of Yankee Stadium Decision

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
The search for a possible new home for the Yankees is also a search for the money to build it. If the Yankees depart Yankee Stadium for Manhattan or New Jersey, at least $200 million would be needed to construct a new ball park.
In proposing the West Side railyard near the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center as a site for the Yankees -- in addition to a surrounding commercial and entertainment complex -- New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has suggested issuing state bonds backed by the complex's revenues as a form of financing. But the state would undoubtedly incur costs to improve the surrounding infrastructure. 
 However, if George Steinbrenner's search for the sweetest deal leads him to New Jersey, which has been wooing him since 1984, an intriguing form of financing would await him: casino revenues.
 
$1.7 Billion Raised
 The 12 Atlantic City casinos pay 1.25 percent of their gross winnings into the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority. During the course of the casions' 25-year obligation to the C.R.D.A., an estimated $1.7 billion for statewide economic development and housing projects will be raised.
Although the C.R.D.A. fund is skewed to projects in Atlantic City and south New Jersey, Nicholas Amato, the executive director of the C.R.D.A., said that at least $250 million will be available through the term of the casino's obligations to help finance projects in northern New Jersey, including a ball park. Use of the money is not subject to taxpayer approval.
"If the Yankees decided to come to New Jersey," said Amato, "between C.R.D.A. money, luxury suites and other financing, this stadium could be built without taxpayer money. My purpose in suggesting this has been to come up with a viable plan that would not use tax dollars or revenue bonds. The C.R.D.A. could be a conduit agency."
 
Bond Issue Rejected
 A 1987 referendum to approve a $175 million bond issue to build a baseball stadium in New Jersey was rejected primarily because it would have used taxpayer money. Recent polls suggest again the desire of New Jerseyans for a ball park, but only if they don't have to finance it with their taxes.
Amato met last year with Yankee officials before Steinbrenner's return March 1 from his banishment, but doesn't expect to meet with them again. "It was merely exploratory and just to apprise them of the concept," he said of the meeting.
David Sussman, the Yankees' general counsel, declined to comment on team contacts with Amato.
 
New Jersey Problem
 Financing would not be the job of the Yankees, but that of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which runs the Meadowlands sports complex. That complex consists of Giants Stadium, the home of the Giants and Jets; the Byrne Meadowlands Arena, home of the Nets and Devils, and the Meadowlands Race Track.
Amato said he had suggested the casino-fund concept to Jon Hanson and Bob Mulcahy, the authority's chairman and president, respectively. Mulcahy said recently that if New Jersey was successful in luring the Yankees, "We can put together a private-public partnership," using taxes like an extra levy on hotel bills or sin taxes on cigarettes and alcohol.
"The C.R.D.A. money is a way not to get involved with sin taxes," Amato said.
John Samerjan, a spokesman for the sports authority, acknowledged that Amato had suggested casino funding, then added: "If major league baseball were to come to New Jersey, we'd explore a wide battery of financing alternatives to the stadium. I'm sure that would be one area to explore."
Samerjan said that no price tag could be placed on stadium construction in New Jersey. "It would be site specific and dependent on franchise needs," he said.
In 1987, the authority projected that the failed $185 million bond issue to build a stadium on undeveloped land in Lyndhurst would have been divided this way: $85 million for construction, $71 million to buy land, $15 million for engineering and other fees and $14 million to cover inflation.
Costs will certainly escalate over the next few years at whichever site ischosen in New Jersey or New York.
The promise of casino revenues may figure in the funding of a new $175 million ball park in Detroit to replace Tiger Stadium. According to The Detroit News, Michigan officials are contemplating a plan that would finance the acquisition of land for a new downtown stadium by committing 4 percent of the revenues from two proposed Indian-run casinos.
 
Casinos in Detroit?
 Michigan Gov. John Engler would need to approve the two casinos, which would be located in downtown Detroit. He has been working on an agreement for on-reservation gambling.
In Cleveland, where a public-private parntership is spending $362 million for a new ball park for the Indians and an arena for the Cavaliers, financing inclues a tax on cigarettes and alcohol, luxury-suite sales, a state appropriation and the rights to name the facilities.
The Indians, who will pay $20 million to the construction fund from advance sales of luxury boxes, will pay the Gateway Economic Devlopment Corporation of Greater Cleveland no rent until attendance reaches 1.85 million. And the Indians will give none of its scoreboard advertising sales to the Gateway organization until those revenues exceed $1.5 million.

HEADLINE: NOTEBOOK;
For the Game's Best Hitters, .400 Is More Than a Number

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
With the predictable collapse of Andres Galarraga and the not-unexpected decline of John Olerud, baseball's .400 debate can be stowed on the statistical shelf until next season. Did anybody really think either one would hit .400 this season?
As they do with 12-game hitting streaks, many people got excited because Galarraga and Olerud spent most of the first half of the season hitting in the stratosphere of .400. The exploits of George Brett in 1980 (.390) and Rod Carew in 1977 (.388) were recalled with relish as speculation soared about the prospects of the first .400 hitter since Ted Williams hit .406 in 1941. 
 But playing against the Florida Marlins on July 6, Galarraga stroked only one hit in three times at bat, dropping his average to .399, and two days later Olerud failed to get a hit in three at-bats against Kenny Rogers of Texas, slipping to .397.
At the rate Galarraga has hit in recent weeks, he has no chance of seeing .400 again. After reaching .431 on June 22, Colorado's first baseman batted .246 (17 for 69) in 19 games entering yesterday's action for a season average of .385.
Olerud has not fallen so far so quickly, but he, too, faces a virtually impossible task. He has hit more evenly than Galarraga, but he never has had the cushion -- and certainly doesn't now -- that a batter needs to counter even the minislumps that occur. In their glorious seasons, Carew and Brett slipped to their final averages from beyond .400; they did not raise their averages to those points on their way to .400.
Since climbing to .411 on June 22, Toronto's first baseman has batted .343 (24 for 70) in 20 games, dropping his average to .395.
Only one other player has engaged in a serious flirtation with .400 this season. In his fantastic start, Barry Bonds of San Francisco was hitting .430 on May 17. In 51 games since then, however, he has batted .279, plunging to .342 for the season.
Chad Kreuter of Detroit was batting an impressive -- and shocking -- .462 on May 5, but he reached the All-Star Game break barely over .300 because in the interim he batted .241.
Kreuter's teammate, Kirk Gibson, also enjoyed an impressive start, albeit for a briefer period, but he has plummeted even more precipitously. Gibson, fooling himself and everyone else into thinking he could still play, was hitting .413 on May 1. Between then and the break, though, he batted .186, plunging to 247.
Other players have experienced dropoffs of varying degrees after getting hot in the early weeks of the season:
*J. T. Snow of California went from .407 on April 24 to .236 at the break by hitting .190 in between.
*Mo Vaughn of Boston, .417 on May 1 to .308 at the break, because of a .272 stretch.
*Larry Walker of Montreal, .429 on April 25 to .266 at the break, because of a .231 pace.
*Jim Leyritz of the Yankees, .484 on April 30 to .321 at the break, because of a .280 pace.
And there are other hitters who have been going downhill, too, although not from a high of .400. They include:
*Robin Ventura of the Chicago White Sox, from .304 on May 22 to .247 at the break, with a .199 average in between.
*Moises Alou of Montreal, .376 on May 11 to .272, by way of a .204 stretch.
*Carlos Quintana of Boston, .348 on May 9 to .268, after a .212 period.
*Eddie Murray of the Mets, .325 on May 18 to .269, by way of a .231 stretch.
*Eric Anthony of Houston, .341 on May 1 to .263, by way of a .233 stretch.
 
Myers's View of the World
 Randy Myers of the Chicago Cubs was upset that he was not named to the National League All-Star team despite his 27 saves, second only to Lee Smith's 30. He suggested that his omission might have stemmed from the Cubs' lawsuit last summer to block realignment of the league's two divisions.
"The National League has been hammering a little bit on the Cubs for suing to stop realignment," the wacky reliever was quoted as saying.
Myers obviously was too busy reading the military-mercenary magazines he likes to understand what was happening last summer. It was then-Commissioner Fay Vincent who ordered realignment, and whom the Cubs sued. The league, in the form of President Bill White, opposed the realignment effort once the Cubs exercised a veto under the league constitution.
And in case Myers sees a conspiracy involving Vincent, the former commissioner did not have any input into the All-Star selections, unless it was for the All-Star Game of the Cape Cod summer league.
 
Another Year, Another Team
 The Milwaukee Brewers were one of the surprisingly successful teams in the majors last year. Two of the reasons were Pat Listach and Cal Eldred.
Listach unexpectedly won the shortstop job and went on to win the rookie-of-the-year award after hitting .290, scoring 93 runs, driving in 47 and getting 54 stolen bases. Eldred was a mid-season addition to the starting rotation, compiling an 11-2 record and a 1.79 earned run average.
The Brewers this season are in last place. Listach, who is on the disabled list recovering from pneumonia, has a .218 batting average, 24 runs scored, 5 r.b.i. and 7 stolen bases. Eldred has a 10-9 record and a 3.86 e.r.a.
 
Turnaround for Starters
 Last season, Darryl Kile of Houston, Chris Hammond of Florida, Pat Hentgen of Toronto, Tommy Greene of Philadelphia and Alex Fernandez of the Chicago White Sox had a combined record of 28 victories and 36 defeats. At the All-Star Game break this season, they had a combined record of 52 victories and 15 defeats.
Compare their performances with the records of other five-man starting corps, real and imagined:
The vaunted starting five of the Atlanta Braves, readily conceded before the season to be the best in the major leagues, had a 38-29 record. Last season Tom Glavine, Greg Maddux, John Smoltz, Steve Avery and Pete Smith were 73-42 at the same point of the season.
The veteran quintet of Jack Morris, Frank Viola, Roger Clemens, Dwight Gooden and Bret Saberhagen had a 30-38 record.
The free-agent five of David Cone, Doug Drabek, Greg Swindell, John Smiley and Dave Stewart had a 26-38 record.
Last season's five 20-game winners -- Kevin Brown, Jack McDowell, Morris, Maddux and Glavine -- coming off a 102-46 record, had a 42-33 mark.
Mike Morgan, Kevin Tapani, Chris Bosio, Jose Guzman and Bob Tewksbury, who last season each won 16 games and had a combined 80-41 record, were 28-38.
 
The Big Overlook
 After languishing among the unemployed for a few years, Dallas Green and Davey Johnson were named managers earlier this season. Bob Gibson, on the other hand, is in his ninth year as an unemployed baseball person.
Gibson, who last week was honorary captain of the National League All-Star team, was asked why no one has hired him since his four-year tenure as a pitching coach with the Mets and the Atlanta Braves. He was the wrong person to ask, he suggested. Only the people who haven't hired him would know the answer.
"Obviously, there aren't enough jobs," the Hall of Fame pitcher said. "As soon as one is available, I'm sure I'll get one."
Baseball deserves the sarcasm. There aren't enough jobs available to hire every former player who wants to stay in the game, but as poor as the quality of pitching has become, this is one former pitcher who could add knowledge and attitude to any staff.

HEADLINE: The Dawn of a Democratic Japan

 BODY:
The Japanese, we've long been told, have no interest in politics in the American sense. Money talks, bureaucrats plan and consensus rules. We may have been told wrong.
Today's election represents the first serious challenge to one-party rule since the merger of conservative interests that formed the misleadingly named Liberal Democrats in 1955. Real multiparty democracy is not yet at hand, but at last Japan's voters face real choices. Whatever the outcome, many Japanese seem eager to see their politics become more responsive to their everyday needs. 
 During the campaign, poll-takers and interviewers found that assumptions about Japanese attitudes -- chiefly that ordinary Japanese were satisfied with the system -- were badly out of date. Not just Americans but Japanese establishmentarians may have been shaken by some of the subversive sentiments expressed. Affluent, educated and well traveled, Japanese society was revealed as more complex and sophisticated than even some of its professional interpreters imagined.
Japanese voters have long known that many of their leading politicians were spectacularly corrupt and out of touch. What's new and surprising is their bubbling revulsion against "money politics" in general -- a revulsion that has overwhelmed Japan's traditional reverence for conformity and obedience to authority. These stirrings, in turn, have given a younger generation of politicians their chance to challenge the aging and vulnerable old guard.
Most Japanese remain grateful to the Liberal Democratic Party for rebuilding a war-ruined economy into a world powerhouse. Yet this gratitude is no match for deeper dissatisfactions. They know that soaring gross national product figures have been only feebly reflected in their own living standards; they know that high land and food prices, long working hours and punishing daily commutes from home to office cheapen the quality of their daily lives.
None of the major contenders has quite captured this rebellious mood. The Liberal Democrats have tried shamelessly to exploit fears of upsetting a successful economic growth machine. Their main conservative challengers have been hampered by long personal association with a system that catered to special interests at the expense of ordinary urban "salarymen" and "office ladies." Meanwhile, the Socialists have managed to seem even more trapped than the conservative old guard in stances more appropriate to the cold war past.
This election is likely to mark only the first stage of a long transition between the one-party politics of the past and a more democratic future. Democracy's sun is indeed rising, yet high noon remains some way off. Post-election bargaining between parties is likely, involving both reformed and unreformed elements. Another election may be required in a few months to work out stable new alignments.
American interests -- more equitable trade relations, more stimulative fiscal policies and more active Japanese participation in global diplomacy -- probably won't be affected dramatically by today's election results. But a more democratic Japan, more responsive to urban consumer desires and less dominated by vested interests and a cautious bureaucratic elite, should eventually prove a more congenial ally and partner.

HEADLINE: Mr. Steinbrenner's Threats

 BODY:
Once again, George Steinbrenner threatens to abandon the Bronx, and once again politicians quake and start throwing dollar signs around, the kind followed by large numbers. Gov. Mario Cuomo (up for re-election next year) raises the prospect of building a new ballpark for the Yankees on Manhattan's West Side, at a cost of $500 million to $1 billion. Mayor David Dinkins (up for re-election this year) talks softly, and instructs his advisers to divine what would make Mr. Steinbrenner happy.
What goes on here? It's obvious. The Mayor and Governor don't want to be the politicians who lost the Yankees, even if it means abandoning the House that Ruth built. But as they struggle to appease Mr. Steinbrenner, they're acting on political survival instincts rather than on sober information. The public needs facts and figures, not guesses and political obfuscation. 
 Mr. Steinbrenner makes it impossible to ignore him, as much as New Yorkers might like to. But in fact, he is not the issue here. Presumably there will be a Yankees, a Bronx and a New York City long after there is no longer a George Steinbrenner. What's important is not what will help or hurt the Boss, but what is best for New York, for its spirit, image and economy.
The symbolic impact of losing the team to New Jersey or anywhere else would be incalculable. It would injure New York's prestige and its soul. But fatally? No. The city survived the departure of the Dodgers and Giants, and would surely live on if the Yankees desert.
The dollars and cents questions about the Yankees can be answered more easily, if only someone would ask them. What does the team mean to the economic viability of the city and to the Bronx? Hard as it is to believe, nobody knows. Reliable, up-to-date figures simply do not exist. The City Comptroller's office estimated that the team contributed only $48 million a year to the city economy, but that was in 1986.
And now? City Hall does not now know what the team earns and costs the city. Until that's determined, it's difficult to understand how elected officials can consider spending up to $1 billion on a new stadium.
Even more alarming is Mr. Cuomo's willingness to play into Mr. Steinbrenner's selfish hands by suggesting now that, if the Yankees insist on abandoning the Bronx, he'd consider Manhattan. Any discussion of an improved stadium or a new one must begin with the premise that government's first obligation is to keep the team where it is.
Moreover, any serious discussion of building a new stadium must take place within the context of the city's many pressing needs. A baseball stadium instead of what? Undoubtedly the bulk of financing for a new stadium would have to come from bonds, and there is not an unlimited market for government bonds, or an unlimited city capacity to pay interest on bonds. Whenever government proceeds with a substantial development project, it is in effect deciding against another.
A central issue is maintenance of Yankee Stadium and the surrounding South Bronx neighborhood. No one disputes the need for more security, better lighting, improvements to the surrounding streets and to roads to and from the Deegan Expressway. The city's just-announced plan to renovate the nearby Bronx Terminal Market would help, but not enough. Any improvements to the neighborhood are welcome, but should the city do more for the stadium itself, even as Mr. Steinbrenner threatens to abandon the Bronx? Not until he makes clearer his intentions.
Sometimes cities do need new major-league stadiums and sometimes they do not. But what they always need is owners who understand that possession of a historic franchise is a public trust that extends beyond their narrow business interests. Cities also need politicians smart enough and tough enough to educate owners who do not understand their civic obligations.

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
BMW Adds a Ragtop to Its 325 Series

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
DRIVING a top-down convertible through New York City's wee hours requires at least three things: an irrational sense of strength, a foolhardy mood and a car with more than its share of charm. Quick getaway also is nice.
BMW's new 325i convertible ($40,825 as equipped), in the showrooms this month, scores on the latter two points. And, what with the East Coast's recent crazy heat, I found myself fulfilling the other requirements. 
 So there I was, heading home at 2 A.M. on 36th Street, shirtless at the wheel. Vulnerable but happy, stopped at a red light and conversing with thugs.
Ah, New York.
The car is billed as a '94, and I told them that. I also told them it wasn't mine (bravado flagging just a tad), though I wished it were.
This particular gem was bright red, and the top -- stowed ever so neatly under a steel cover behind the rear seats -- was black. The trim, too, is black, except for chrome bezels around the kidney-shaped grilles, and it makes for a sporty package indeed.
The convertible rounds out BMW's 3-series line, which includes four-door sedans and coupes. The ragtop is the fourth model BMW has introduced in 1993 and the 10th in the past 14 months.
It is a spinoff from the 325i coupe, and both have a longer hood, lower roof and shorter rear deck than the sedan. But the engineers did more than simply cut off the coupe's roof. Body construction is stronger, with a thicker floor and heavy crossmembers for rigidity.
The windshield pillars have been reinforced, as have the door sills and the doors themselves. And a double-walled bulkhead spans the rear of the passenger compartment behind the back seat.
All this makes the convertible 265 pounds heavier than the coupe. It also accounts for some of the extra cost, although when it comes to price-per-pound, much can be attributed to selling the sizzle along with the steak.
The convertible's base price is $38,800, about $7,000 more than the coupe, and then there are the options that were on the test car, an automatic transmission at $850 and a trip computer costing $420. The car's inclement-weather package, which included heated front seats, heated mirrors and a limited-slip differential, added another $755.
That money buys a lot of high-tech goodies, although most of them are intrinsic and don't really show. For example, there is the window system that seats the door glass securely into "weather-seal" grooves to minimize wind noise. It does that by lowering the windows slightly when you open the door and raising them again when the door is closed.
In addition, all windows can be lowered with a single touch of their buttons, and the front windows also have one-touch closing. A safety feature reverses the window if it meets an obstruction. And another button allows opening or closing all windows at once, with one-touch operation in the down direction.
Unlike Mercedes, which pioneered one-button operation of the convertible top, the BMW requires that you twist a large handle at the windshield header, push the top up manually and then begin one-touch operation.
The control button at the front of the console unlatches the rear of the roof and raises it, pops the body-colored tonneau behind the rear seat and raises that, then folds the top into its boot, lowers the tonneau and clicks it into place. It sounds complex, but it's really quite easy.
Behind the tonneau, the small and shallow trunk will hold nine cubic feet of cargo. A pass-through helps somewhat, allowing long items to intrude into the rear seat. And, like all BMW's, the lid has a fold-down tray containing a set of tools.
The trailing edge of the trunk forms a low spoiler, with the high brakelight built in. At the other end of the car, an air dam completes the aerodynamic treatment, and it features built-in driving lights.
The hood rises on twin gas struts to reveal the 2.5-liter straight six, mounted fore-to-aft and driving the rear wheels. The powertrain is the same as in the coupe, with the 24-valve engine feeding 189 horses to a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic.
Because of the extra weight, the convertible is slightly slower than the coupe, but it is quite quick enough, going from zero to 60 in 8 seconds with the stick shift and in 9.5 seconds with the automatic.
Top speed is electronically limited to 128 miles an hour, so you'll never get to bury the needle on the 160-m.p.h. speedometer that graces the instrument panel (but the neighbors don't have to know that, do they?)
Otherwise, the interior is eminently usable, with eight-way power-adjustable buckets up front and seating for two in the rear. There is not much room in the back seat, but there is more than in some such cars, and adults can actually put their legs on the floor without having the circulation cut off.
For the driver, the four-spoke leather wheel has an air bag in its hub, and the front passenger also gets an air bag, mounted above a medium small glovebox. One of the nice features about that glove compartment, by the way, is a removable flashlight that resides in a recharging pocket.
Antilock brakes are standard, as are tensioners to take up seatbelt slack in case of a crash. In an impact, too, the central locking system unlocks the doors and turns on the inside lights and hazard flashers. A comforting touch.
I didn't get a chance to tell all this to the night people on 36th Street, of course. The light had changed, and I made what was probably unnecessary use of the quick getaway.
When I looked back, they were giving me the thumbs-up. It is a nice car.
To the end, Lawrence Walsh will remain true to the letter, spirit and mystique of the law. It is hard to imagine a more principled, dogged defender of jurisprudence. Yet what, finally, has his long investigation accomplished?
As we come to the conclusion of our last conversation, I ask Walsh if he had ever come to suspect that Iran-contra was too complicated and too devious to be grasped by the legal process. After all, the investigation may have proven that the Boland Amendment had been violated, but how many people even know what that amendment is? Or what has been done to rein in the elements in our society who believe that power is more efficiently exercised covertly? Can the law, in all its antique formality, really comprehend the metapolitical, microchipped venality of the fin de siecle scoundrel mentality.
Walsh takes a long time to answer. And when he does, his voice is rich with passion for that body of belief that has been the cornerstone of his life.
"There was a real question about whether Iran-contra could be grasped by the law, and I think one of the most important things I proved was that it could be, that neither the subtlety of the operation nor the shield of national security could keep us from our prosecutions. There may have been an illusion inside the Government about the safety of this type of illegal operation, but we dispelled it. And it was done the hard way -- by proving beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury that someone had committed a felony. The real question is, 'Will the jury convict these people?' And the answer is 'yes.' Every jury that was tested -- convicted."
 The article also failed to acknowledge a disagreement over Mr. McFarlane's travel to Iran seeking the release of American hostages. Mr. Walsh says Mr. McFarlane made two trips to Iran; Mr. McFarlane's lawyer, Leonard Garment, says there was no second trip. The article also incorrectly described the selection of Mr. Walsh as prosecutor. He was chosen by a panel of three Federal judges, not by "Reagan-Bush stalwarts."
When Grovers talk about their neighbor the Pines, they usually recite something like "The Pines is pretty but the Grove is fun" or mention "pine clones" or "fur-lined closets." But the spirit of competition is largely playful now. Water taxis travel back and forth between the two predominantly gay communities; on the Fourth of July, ferries full of Grovers in high drag, the Pope, Archbishop and Homecoming Queen and her Prince among them, cross the water for the annual "Invasion of the Pines."
WITH ITS THREE-SIDED dock, its waterfront cafe-bar, and its assembly of big yachts, the harbor at Fire Island Pines looks like a stage set for a European resort. Flats of annuals spill out of the florist shop; two young men with tight neat bodies walk by with their weekend duffels and shirts hung on a pole suspended between their shoulders. The harbor's floral borders are carefully planted and meticulously maintained.
Beyond the harbor, too, the Pines does not look at all like other island settlements. The largest community in all but population, with 600 houses and 200 swimming pools, it runs a full mile from east to west; from north to south, its boardwalk rolls dramatically over the secondary dunes. On the eastern end, there is a complex of 100 cooperative apartments hidden in the pines; along the water, big modern-architect houses are closed behind tall ornamental gates, deer fencing and security systems; almost everywhere, shade trees, flowers and bamboo.
Real-estate values in the Pines compare favorably with Beverly Hills; they fell in the 80's with the first wave of AIDS, but they haven't been affected very much by the winter storms. There are only a few examples of the bungalows from the early 50's that replaced the squatters' tents in the area, just as there are only a few direct memories of the original gay community that emerged in the 50's, a "new-class enclave" that was "young, affluent, enlightened and breezy in both attitudes and style," as Midge Decter, a resident then, described it in her famous essay "Boys on the Beach."
John Whyte, who was a successful model when he arrived in the Pines in the late 50's and now owns practically the whole town, can sketch a brief chronology of stars that suggests a social history: Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton; Montgomery Clift, who visited the Pines the summer he died; Tuesday Weld, Andy Warhol and Steve Rubell, Calvin Klein (who left in the mid-80's), Jerry Herman, Tommy Tune, Robin Byrd and Madonna, who visits her brother. Whyte, who has classic blond, square-jawed good looks, serves high tea to capacity crowds on the upper deck of the Pavilion, his bar overlooking the harbor; below, he has added a cavernous disco, decorated with mirrors and crystal chandeliers with blue and purple lights. Looking back on the late 60's, he recalls how there were group dances with women then, because it was illegal for two men to be together. From the 80's, he recounts sadness and memorial services.
Whyte is also president of the Pines Conservation Society, which this year is planning a gala fashion show around his pool to raise money to rebuild the dunes. Summer can be measured out in benefits: the Coming Out Party that opened the season with an auction to raise money for Lyme disease research; the Twice in a Blue Moon party for the Lambda Legal Defense Fund; the Morning Party on the beach in August for the Gay Men's Health Crisis. But the most high-toned parties are private, celebrated in houses staffed by houseboys where dinner begins at 11 and doesn't end until it's time to dance. "I cooked here with David Bouley last night," one resident lets drop, describing a mocha creme brulee.
Alan Brockman, who as head of the Property Owners' Association is the effective mayor of the Pines, lives in a house filled with the art of friends like Lowell Nesbitt and surrounded by a landscape with a waterfall. He shows off the community like a practiced diplomat: the incongruously luxe grocery store, with its lobster tank, crab cakes and vegetarian rolls to go; the seaplane landing; the community center, housed in a comfortably plain old Coast Guard station; the beachfront houses flying flags. He also shows off old friends like Rita and Jack Lichtenstein, who brought up two children here -- "We're in all the plays," Jack offers congenially -- and recent arrivals like Barbara and Marvin Gilston, who have built an imposing post-post-modern house on the bay. Pines homeowners are almost equally divided between homosexuals and straights now, although about half those houses are rented, mostly to gays.
The Pines is one of the youngest settlements on Fire Island, but it's been there long enough to evolve its own culture. It has its own flag, its social schedule, its aura of active sex and elegant style. It is "strictly creme de la creme," as a character describes a similar community in Terrence McNally's "Lips Together, Teeth Apart." It feels like a sheltered place, a strange utopia. The fact that Frank O'Hara was killed by a jeep on the beach in 1966 is still disturbing. "There is no place like this in the world," says Bob Howard, a real-estate broker.
EVERYONE AGREES that the winter of 1992-93 will figure prominently in the annals of Fire Island. Despite the volleyball and long sunsets and kegs of beer, last winter is still felt. "You make do with what you have, I guess," a young woman offers, watching her children scamper around the pilings of houses wrecked by the storms. Homeowners are still reconstructing their landscapes; although most of them had Federal flood insurance and were reimbursed for losses, many are still waiting for permission to rebuild. "What the D.E.C. [Department of Environmental Conservation] spent repeatedly flying over our property trying to catch people doing illegal work is a multiple of what it would have cost to have examined and expedited our permits," Adam Rose, a resident of the Pines, sums up, confronting the skeleton of a swimming pool he wants to repair.
Inevitably, in the aftermath of the storm and with a still-ailing economy, the real-estate market has suffered and the houses have slipped in value, from the $100,000 bungalow in Ocean Bay Park or Kismet to the $600,000 beach house in Saltaire or Seaview and the million-dollar property in the Pines. Beach houses represent larger investments than they did 20 or 30 years ago. "We are suffering, but we're not on the ropes," says Lee Mehlig, a broker in Saltaire. "There is a real tenacity and feeling of legacy on this island."
People like Ken Stein, who have lived through other serious storms here, try to make comparisons and detect natural cycles that would answer the big question, but in the end, they say that Fire Island stands at a new critical point in its history. The Fire Island News reports that the National Hurricane Center has predicted increases in both storm ferocity and frequency for the coming hurricane season. Gerry Stoddard, president of the Fire Island Association, says that Governor Cuomo now seems to understand that Fire Island is not just an expendable rich man's resort and needs to be rescued. He predicts that the state report will declare an emergency situation.
It has taken many months for politicians and the general public to begin to understand the workings of the ecosystem of the Great South Bay and to grasp the important role that Fire Island's barrier beach plays in protecting the South Shore of Long Island, how its dunes buffer waves and dispel storm energy and how without this line of defense, not only the island but also low-lying Long Island, its homes, institutions and billion-dollar tourist industry could be at risk. Major hospitals, apartment buildings and thousands of houses lie in the flood plain and would have to be evacuated with the higher tides and ocean surf that a breach would bring. In the 1960's, the Fire Island Association erected a billboard on the Montauk Highway that read: "If Fire Island goes, you'll be underwater here." Again the association is saying that without its dunes, Fire Island is but a fragile sandbar holding back the Atlantic from Long Island.
In the absence of immediate government assistance, Fire Island has begun to address beach renourishment on its own. Several communities have already hired coastal experts; one is investigating the installation of concrete reefs offshore to conserve sand. The association is trying to establish an erosion control district that will facilitate ocean dredging. Environmental controls often frustrate the efforts of once-ecologically sensitive homeowners as they find that they can't restore beaches where the endangered piping plover nests and they can't dredge sand from just anywhere in the ocean. Everyone agrees, however, that the restoration of Fire Island beaches will require commitment, interagency coordination and an overall plan.
Irving Like, the attorney for the association who was instrumental in drafting the legislation for the Fire Island National Seashore, proposes reactivating a dusty piece of Congressional legislation from 1960 that authorized building a system of 20-foot dunes, broad beaches and groins from Fire Island Inlet to Montauk Point to preserve the Long Island coast. It is the delay in executing this plan and what activists have called the state's "retreat from nature" that are held responsible for the breach of Dune Road at Westhampton Beach last winter, which has now become a half-mile-wide inlet and a multimillion-dollar public problem. "You don't run from nature, you learn from it," says Like, who was instrumental in halting construction of the Shoreham nuclear plant. "Sand is a resource and a mineral in the public trust. If it were gas or oil that we were losing, you can be sure the Federal Government would be out there trying to conserve it. Sand is gold in terms of Fire Island."
With the hurricane season officially only a month away, the Fire Island Association is worried about time. Stoddard hopes that the state's logistical decisions will be made this month and that the Army Corps of Engineers will be working on the beach by September at the very latest, but he says "even that is shooting dice."
Coastal geologists like Jay Tanski, who works with the New York Sea Grant Program, see reason for concern but not for panic. The western end of Fire Island is axially stable, he says; its eastern end is dynamic, which means it is gradually migrating northward. His frame of reference is 50 to 100 years, however. While he warns that a barrier island is subject to natural changes like migrations or the formation of inlets, summer people worry that the island will be underwater in a decade -- or less. "The ocean is unforgiving," Tanski concedes, arguing that the only way to minimize storm damage before it occurs is a management policy with both continuity and flexibility: "You can't start something and not finish. But you also can't expect to solve problems with a project that has a distinct beginning and end."
Park rangers are more philosophical about a course of action. David Griese, for example, who began in the Park Service as a dock boy in Watch Hill in 1967 and is the east district ranger now, is sympathetic to homeowners, but he also notes that "the beach comes and goes, especially when you don't have a point of reference like a house." Many people think the rangers would not mind if the whole island reverted to wilderness. Rangers think a lot about endangered species and ecology and the human spirit, these people say, and talk about faith in the future the way Al Gore does.
At the far eastern end of Fire Island, there are only one or two houses left in the wilderness area to attest to the small squatters' colonies that were once there, and they will be gone soon, leaving behind eight miles of uninhabited beach and ancient dunes, some 40 feet tall, the highest on the island, a landscape that must resemble that of the 17th or 18th century. Dick Barnett, who is the mounted ranger for the district, can point out all the old breaks in the barrier and all the imminent ones, too. At the spot known as Old Inlet on the map, he says, "Any betting man would put a buck on the fact that that inlet will be back." At another near-breach, he climbs a foreshortened dune and walks back across the long flat overwash. "I worry about the fall," he admits. "And after that, who knows?"

CORRECTION-DATE: July 18, 1993, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article in The Times Magazine on July 4 about Lawrence E. Walsh, the Iran-contra prosecutor, misstated the circumstances in which Robert C. McFarlane, national security adviser to President Reagan, testified before a Congressional committee on the Iran-contra affair. He was not given immunity and did not seek it.
An article in The Times Magazine last Sunday about Fire Island misstated the law on public drinking in the Corneille Estates section. It is prohibited there, under the laws of the Town of Islip, of which Corneille Estates is part.

Map: "Shifting Sand" -- The western end of Fire Island was hammered by two devastating nor'easters in December and March. Kismet lost 5 homes; Fair Harbor lost 21 homes and 150 feet of beach and dune, and Dunewood lost 3 houses. Atlantique is considered a prime area for the ocean to break through. Water Island lost up to 175 feet of beach in places. Even though the western end was hardest hit, from a geological viewpoint it is the most stable part of the fragile barrier island. "The western end has not migrated in 500 years," says Jay Tanski, a coastal geologist. "The eastern end is migrating, driven by these 50-to-100-year storm cycles." (pg. 26)

THE RISE AND FALL OF THE HOUSE OF WINDSOR
By A. N. Wilson.
Illustrated. 211 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $22. 
 HOLD the groans. The British novelist and biographer A. N. Wilson has compiled a lusty version of the sordid travails of the British Crown that panders to the intellectuals, inviting those who have attempted to maintain a fastidious distance from the stream of pulp print to learn both the basest details and loftiest constitutional questions that the whole mess invokes. Mr. Wilson no doubt sees dollar and pound signs for himself in stretching the net one more time for droppings from the royal menagerie. The poor Windsors should be thanked, at least, for providing such a successful economic stimulus package for the publishing industry. And who better than the chronicler of the life of Jesus to dilate upon the uneasy head that wears a crown in Buckingham Palace, even if, instead of riding on a donkey, she seems to be surrounded by them?
In "The Rise and Fall of the House of Windsor," Mr. Wilson sees the sickness of the British monarchy emanating from a multiple virus -- the press, the decline of family values, the erosion of Christian faith and the problems posed by the unwritten Constitution. As far as the press goes, he believes the leaks from the Prince and Princess of Wales themselves about their marital troubles severely damaged their position and allowed television and newspapers, formerly so deferential, to destroy their magic.
The teeth-gritting family solidarity presented by Elizabeth and Philip and their forebears is revealed for what it is: hypocrisy. The consequence, as Mr. Wilson shows, is the hopelessly unsuitable batch of candidates for marriage they produced. Since the Church of England has lost much of its authority in a country now pluralistic in religion, the title of Defender of the (Christian) Faith seems, he thinks, spurious. On the constitutional question, however, Mr. Wilson believes the monarchy still has a contribution to make. His argument hinges on the subtle checks that the Crown can impose on the unbridled power of government, particularly as recently embodied in the robustly autocratic person of Margaret Thatcher.
According to Mr. Wilson, certain individuals outside the royal family have contributed to the decline. He notes Margaret Thatcher's increasing tendency to behave like the Queen during her long tenure, with her neat hairstyle (a bit more fashionable than the Queen's), her nice leather handbag, her eagerness to appear consoling at national disasters, and her inclination to use the royal "we" when talking about herself. This merging of roles, he maintains, confused the British people and caused them to wonder if they needed two nannies pushing their perambulators round the world. The newspapers most responsible for the eye-popping and toe-sucking revelations about the royals are owned by a former Australian republican, now American citizen, Rupert Murdoch. Mr. Wilson believes this is no coincidence. Mr. Murdoch is exacting, through his raucous tabloids, a delightful revenge on the British upper classes who snubbed him so ruthlessly when he first arrived in England.
This is the high road Mr. Wilson directs us to take in a rather hastily assembled and repetitive, but amusing, extended magazine article. Along the way, the low road beckons. Mr. Wilson manages to incorporate almost every ghastly anecdote ever produced about the royal family, from George V's last words to the most unhygienic portions of the Camillagate tapes. He leaves no tale untattled, which means we may pass on Andrew Morton's "Diana: Her True Story," as well as the other countless tomes in print or in preparation on the subject. He even launches a pre-emptive strike on Kitty Kelley's forthcoming biography of Prince Philip.
Mr. Wilson proposes that if Prince Charles becomes King, the monarchy will collapse under the weight of eccentricity, indiscretion and divorce. He thinks Prince William is also a nonstarter because his undereducated, overemotional mother would become Princess Regent, and even those who love Princess Diana admit the idea is absurd. Mr. Wilson's own ingenious nomination for heir to the throne -- Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester -- comes from left field and will surely not be implemented.
The great British public, ever reticent, ever believers in laissez-faire, will, he thinks, let the monarchy die because nobody can come up with a good enough reason to save it. It seems ignominious, however, that while Communist regimes fall with a handshake, the historic island monarchy should sink in a pile of dirty newsprint. "The lights have not quite gone out," Mr. Wilson says, recalling an equally sober moment in European history. "But they are guttering in their sockets."

Gotta Dance!

BYLINE: By Rob Hoerburger; Rob Hoerburger is an editor of this magazine.

 BODY:
I WALKED INTO THE CONFESSIONAL A repentant sinner and walked out a dancer. The priest who heard my sins half-jokingly suggested that for my penance I join the church's production of "West Side Story," which he was directing. I was 27 at the time and hadn't performed on a stage since fourth grade, but I figured at the very least I could help out with the lights.
Instead, I ended up with the featured role of Riff, the leader of the Jets, mostly because of a lucky break (as in the ankle of the actor originally cast), and the usual dearth of male bodies in community-theater productions. After months of rehearsal, I was comfortable enough with the dialogue and the singing, but the dancing -- and "West Side Story" is mostly dancing -- petrified me. Right up to opening night, I was never sure which foot I would land on. 
 My anxiety was born of some taboo I had long ago internalized about dancing not being masculine. The typical after-school and after-supper pastimes for boys in my suburban neighborhood were baseball and football. Forget that dancing can actually develop the timing and coordination needed to play second base, or that dancers have physiques that gym rats only dream about. Any parent signing his or her son up for dance class instead of (or even in addition to) Little League was practically subject to child-abuse charges -- because invariably that boy would be subject to the cruel taunts of his peers.
This unspoken prohibition was especially painful because secretly I loved to dance. Sports were O.K., but there were many nights when I would forgo the pickup game of baseball on the street, throw on some Motown and whirl around my room for a few hours. But always behind closed doors. Now here I was about to make a public spectacle of myself, and in "West Side Story" no less.
Most of the other men in the cast expressed similar anxiety, but we got a reprieve in that the choreography de-emphasized the more balletic turns in favor of macho posturing and finger-snapping and the climbing of fences. When the steps did get a little more complicated, I took the choreographer's advice to "show a lot of attitude" and chalked the rest up to the power of prayer. And I vowed to get better.
But childhood taboos die hard. It took me a year and a half to summon the courage to enroll in a dance class in Manhattan. As I signed my name for a year's worth of lessons, a lifetime of aversion -- my own and my friends' -- to dancing in public flashed through my head. I thought of linebackers in high school who took and gave poundings on the football field but sweated through the box step at the prom. And I knew firefighters and fleet-footed detectives who had been in shootouts who cowered at the sight of a wood floor with a strobe light above it. Even after John Travolta gyrated through "Saturday Night Fever," tough guys still didn't dance.
I had been assured that there would be other men in the class, but when I arrived for the first one I was surrounded by leggy women in tights and tutus. The only other man was the instructor, Jeff, a former Broadway dancer who had been in "A Chorus Line" early in its run. He wore makeup and several earrings. Would I have felt more comfortable if he looked like Cal Ripken? Probably, but then I didn't have time to dwell on it, because I was immediately barraged with not only new steps but a new language ("plie," "releve," "jazz third") and lessons in attire. ("This is not aerobics," Jeff would say, casting gentle aspersions at my jock wear -- sneakers and sweats, which I clung to as the last bastions of my maleness.)
I tried to hide in the back lines, but in dance studios even the support beams have mirrors. I heard my name a lot in those first weeks: "Keep your shoulders down." "Other hand." "Watch your head." Yet every time I was tempted to quit, I also heard Jeff's words of encouragement: "If you get only 25 percent of the routine, I'll be happy" or "Just showing up is the victory."
Eventually the routines seemed less tyrannical, and I started to relax. I even compromised on my attire -- retaining my Nike T-shirt but trading the sweats and sneakers for black satin jazz pants and jazz shoes. ("Now those," Jeff said, "have style.") And the benefits of the class were instantaneous -- walking to my train after each session, I felt a kind of honorable exhaustion, having coaxed into consciousness muscles I hadn't even known existed. It was the same sense of physical satisfaction that I'd felt hitting a bases-clearing double or finishing a half-marathon.
My lessons were interrupted when the next show came along: "Man of La Mancha," which required me to age 30 years but hardly afforded me an opportunity to show off my new steps. When the show finished its run, I returned to the studio, only to find Jeff out sick and the class being taught by a drill-sergeant substitute. She demanded that each dancer cross the floor individually while she exhorted, "Kick that leg higher -- and now sell it." Under Jeff's kid-gloves tutelage, I had imagined myself as Fred Astaire, but now, under this magnifying glass, I turned back into Fred Flintstone -- stumbling, clumsy, self-conscious, as if all the inhibitions I had been whittling away suddenly gathered themselves back into an intractable whole. On my third or fourth solo flight across the floor I kept going into the locker room, up the stairs and out the door.
Jeff's absence turned out to be permanent -- his illness was forcing him to retire -- and the studio closed soon after that, a victim of the economy's own failing health. Then I got word of a cast call for a local production of "South Pacific," a show whose feats are primarily vocal, at least for the men. Reluctantly, I auditioned and made the male chorus. It looked as if my dancing days would be indefinitely deferred.
The men did have one big number -- "There Is Nothin' Like a Dame" -- which basically involved animated marching. Posture and expression were key, and, because Jeff had emphasized these in class, I had no trouble picking up the routine. The choreographer even singled me out to demonstrate a couple of steps, and the other men -- most of whom had never danced on stage before and were wearing the same long faces I did during "West Side Story" -- were saying things like "Obviously you've done this before." Now I was being celebrated for something that most of my life I had feared would bring me ridicule.
After much fine-tuning and many weeks of rehearsal, the other men came around, and by the time the show opened there was a buzz about "There Is Nothin' Like a Dame." The women in the show had three times as many dance numbers and their steps were much fancier. But the novelty appeal of "men who can move" ran high, and when we successfully executed a kickline at the end of the song we brought down the house.
At moments like that, and the many since I've had dancing in public and private, I remember that trip to the confession booth, and realize that dance has in fact become a kind of physical and psychic redemption. But it isn't penance anymore.

HEADLINE: FILM;
'Amongst Friends' Tops Off a Journey Of Self-Discovery

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

 BODY:
Through the years, Long Island has presented itself artistically in ways as varied as the dozens of communities that stretch its length, from the border of Queens to the tip of Montauk. The Long Island of F. Scott Fitzgerald's "Great Gatsby" is a lost place of privilege and of intricately stratified classes in brutal social competition. In the novels of Susan Isaacs, including "Compromising Positions," which became a movie starring Susan Sarandon, and the new "After All These Years," it is the backdrop for middle-aged, middle-class people engaged in such suburban pursuits as divorce, murder and revenge.
And while the island's less tony neighborhoods have never been as popular as, say, Queens or Brooklyn as movie locales, some have been memorably portrayed recently, most notably by Hal Hartley. His subjects are a different breed altogether -- alienated working-class types who might be seen hanging out at the convenience store of an afternoon and whose inner lives are beyond imagining. 
 Now comes Rob Weiss, a brash 26-year-old whose first movie, "Amongst Friends," portrays a world of mobsters and drug dealers in the Five Towns, a cluster of mostly affluent communities east of Kennedy Airport and near Mr. Weiss's birthplace. In this hive of intense upward mobility, residents show off with big cars, big houses and big billfolds. Mr. Weiss, the movie's writer and director, hastens to emphasize that while the characters could well be real, the plot is made up.
"I'm going to try to hide during the Five Towns screening," said Mr. Weiss. "What do you think? That they're going to be bitching and moaning and saying, 'This doesn't really happen here?' " he mused. "I set the film there, but it's not supposed to be any judgment on anyone."
"Amongst Friends," which attracted considerable excitement at the Sundance Film Festival in January, is to open in New York on Friday. It might take its inspiration from mob movies like "Goodfellas," which Mr. Weiss acknowledges as an important influence. But his film is really about a way of life in which well-off young people rebel against their own opportunities and slide into crime to fight boredom and flout convention.
Mr. Weiss clearly invites comparison to Mr. Hartley, another homegrown writer and director, whose three films about Long Island -- "The Unbelievable Truth," "Trust" and "Simple Men" -- have tended to focus on teen-agers and young adults so alienated from real life that they live in their own alternative, albeit internally plausible, universes.
But while Mr. Hartley used Long Island to describe anomie that could exist anywhere in suburban America, Mr. Weiss sets his film in a very specific environment of riches that breed aimless, and lawless, pursuits. His own voice -- sharp, fast-talking, cynical, heavily New York-accented -- emerges most clearly at the beginning of the movie, when his voice-over introduces the Five Towns as a place where "you got judges living next to gamblers next to rabbis living next to dentists" and "16-year-old kids thinking and acting like they're Flavor Flav," the rap star. "The only thing they all had in common," the narrator says, "was money -- lots of money."
"Amongst Friends" follows three boys from the pure friendship of their childhood to the grayer areas of young adulthood, when they eschew the professional pursuits of their parents for a life as low-level gangsters. The plan backfires. The three become caught up in killings and drug-running; and their tenuous alliance finally spins out of control into a betrayal that has left some preview audiences weeping.
The young men in Mr. Weiss's movie form alliances with the men of their grandparents' generation -- mostly first-generation Jews who arrived on Long Island with nothing and made their living at the edges of the law.
"The real reason these kids are like this is that they're spoon-fed everything as a child, and you know that's not going to get you respect in the real world," Mr. Weiss explained. "The grandfathers got respect becuase they worked to the bone 18 hours a day. These kids tried to forget all the privileges they had and start again."
Mr. Weiss said the three young men in "Amongst Friends" were inspired by different facets of his own personality. "These are not kids who want to grow up to be 9-to-5 guys," said Mr. Weiss, clearly not a 9-to-5 guy himself. In fact, he wrote "Amongst Friends" after his own period of wretched listlessness. Born in Baldwin, near the Five Towns, Mr. Weiss dropped out of the Parsons School of Design, where he studied fashion, then film. He found himself out of work and living goallessly back at his divorced father's house in Lawrence, smack in the Five Towns.
"Whatever was going on in my life, I felt like I was dying, you know?" Mr. Weiss said. "I was 24 years old, laying awake at night, sweating myself to bed, thinking: 'Who the hell am I? Where am I going?' I didn't have a dime in my pocket. I was living with my dad. Everyone else had all graduated from college after four years like normal people."
So he wrote his screenplay in a matter of weeks. Don't ask him how, because he doesn't know. "I have no idea, no clue," he said. "Stream of consciousness. I just sat down and it just came out. I had never written anything before in my entire life. I had never completed a short story -- nothing."
Though he clearly grew up in comfort, the then-unemployed Mr. Weiss did not have much money to make "Amongst Friends," which cost $900,000, much of it borrowed from family and friends. Shooting on location in the Five Towns, the crew was so strapped for cash that when Mr. Weiss opened a bag of Doritos for a scene in which he (in a brief appearance) smokes pot with a group of disaffected youths, he found little torn-up triangles of yellow cardboard. "I was like, we're making a film, and you don't have enough money for a bag of Doritos," he said.
Mr. Weiss's movie has already gathered praise for the sharpness of its story and authenticity of its voice. "He's a stylist, a born storyteller, and I think the types of film making he's capable of are as broad as his interests," said Ira Deutchman, president of Fine Line Features, a division of New Line Cinema and the movie's distributor. "This film twists conventions around and deals with a culture we've never seen on film before."
Mr. Weiss has already signed a three-picture deal with Universal and begun work on his next screenplay, for Tri-Star. After a short rough period, he seems to be adjusting with some aplomb. "After Sundance was a really bad time for me," Mr. Weiss said. "It was so wearing on me mentally, I was literally twitching. I was jumping up 100 times in the middle of the night.
"I had been staying with my girlfriend for the most part, eating Subway sandwiches every night, and all of a sudden I could eat whatever I wanted to eat. I could buy new clothes for the first time in four years. I could buy a laser printer. To meet these new people -- to all of a sudden be accepted into this world. You know, now I'm validated in some ways."
Mr. Weiss's mother's boyfriend is in the movie. But his father, who among other things organizes tour packages for casinos and who prevailed on some of his gambler friends to contribute money to "Amongst Friends," hasn't seen the movie; he wants to wait until he can see it in a theater. "I don't think my dad really understands that it's actually a movie," Mr. Weiss said. "I think he thinks that I'm just interested in film."
In any case, the journey from anxiety-filled inactivity to euphoria to near nonchalance has been a short one. "When we got accepted at Sundance I was so happy to be going there, I can't explain it," Mr. Weiss said. "But it wears off, because now when I open a magazine and see myself in there, I don't even care -- I just focus on how dumb I look in the picture. You could go to Cannes or Venice, but it'll never be the first time again."

HEADLINE: THE MIDWEST FLOODING;
Clinton Tours Floods and Considers Sending Troops

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ARNOLD, Mo., July 17

 BODY:
President Clinton made a third trip to the Midwest flood area today, this time to confer with Vice President Al Gore, eight governors and members of Congress and the Cabinet about how to relieve the misery and clean up what is turning out to be one of the worst natural disasters in American history.
But even as he and the officials gathered in a high school cafeteria here just south of St. Louis, near the sodden, nearly overflowing levees of the Mississippi, the destruction continued upstream. A bridge linking Missouri and Illinois was closed near Quincy, Ill., and a Des Moines levee threatened to give way and flood a residential and industrial area. 
 Worse, more rain began to fall over much of the disaster area, described at one point in the conference as beginning to resemble one of the Great Lakes.
As he opened the daylong session, Mr. Clinton said, "We don't want people to think they have been abandoned when the immediate emergency is over."
 
More Federal Troops
 Then the President, who had earlier taken a quick helicopter tour of the flooding near St. Louis, said he was considering mobilizing Federal troops and additional National Guard units to relieve the exhausted guardsmen who have been struggling the better part of a month in the eight affected states -- Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin -- to shore up levees and evacuate victims.
He also said he might seek an increase in the $2.45 billion in disaster assistance he has requested from Congress. He has warned several times that the Federal Government cannot and should not pick up the tab for the entire loss. But he said today that he might seek more than $2.45 billion "to reflect new damage estimates."
By some assessments, the overall loss is now pushing close to $10 billion, including the destruction of 8,000 homes and businesses, the displacement of 30,000 people, and the inundation of hundreds of thousands of acres of some of the world's most productive farm land. Furthermore, 27 people have been killed.
 
New Flooding Near Quincy
 New flooding occurred today near West Quincy, Mo., where a levee burst last night, and near Quincy, Ill., where rising water closed the approaches to one of the few bridges in that area that was still open.
Most of the flood water spread across farmland and inundated evacuated houses. But the force of the break sent a river barge crashing through the opening and into a gas station, setting off a spectacular fire.
No injuries were reported.
In Des Moines, perhaps the hardest-hit city in the flood zone, a levee on the Des Moines River near downtown began to sag this morning, and it had to be quickly patched.
In the St. Louis area, the next major danger point in the flooding, the cresting Missouri River continued to breach small agricultural levees just to the west of where it joins the Mississippi north of the city. Some homes were flooded.
South of the city, not far from where President Clinton was holding his meeting at the school cafeteria, suburban residents were desperately adding sandbags to levees where water was already spilling over. Disaster officials ordered some homes evacuated.
The Mississippi is expected to crest at St. Louis on Sunday at 46.1 feet. It rose today in front of the Gateway Arch to a record 45.6 feet. That has brought on desperate sandbagging because many levees in the area can withstand a level of only 45 feet. The levees protecting the city's business district can take a crest of up to 52 feet.
 
'More Water Coming Down'
 Earlier, the National Weather Service predicted that the river would crest at 46 feet on Monday. But the break in the levee at Quincy drew off some of that water.
"That's the plus side of things, at least for St. Louis," said Greg Deyer, a National Weather Service forecaster stationed there. "The minus side is the rain that is still falling across the flood region, particularly in Iowa. That means more water coming down, eventually, though not necessarily at record crest. It also mean the water will stay high on the levees longer, which further weakens them."
In Mr. Clinton's helicopter tour of the region this morning, he got a firsthand look at the fight against the flood, shaking his head in wonder. He was accompanied by Senator Bob Dole, the Republican minority leader from Kansas, and Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader, who is from South St. Louis.
"All of us," he said later at the school conference, "have been very moved by what we have seen, both the pain that people have experienced and their enormous courage and often their great good humor."
Vice President Al Gore followed Mr. Clinton on his tour in another helicopter. Later, speaking at the school cafeteria, he displayed satellite photographs of the entire Midwest disaster area. "It's as if another Great Lake has been added to the map of the United States," he said.
 
Workshop in Disaster Relief
 Among the seven Cabinet officers the President brought with him were those who oversee health, housing, agriculture, labor, transportation, commerce and the budget, and their presence -- along with scores of top Federal, state and local officials -- transformed the school lunch room into a crowded workshop on disaster relief.
A blue banner behind a podium proclaimed the event a "Flood Response Mobilization and Recovery," and each participant was issued a thick briefing book with a Presidential seal.
Mr. Clinton acted as moderator for the session, much as he had in Little Rock, Ark., last fall during a similar summit meeting on economic issues and again this spring in Oregon during a session on timber issues.
The President had warned earlier this week that the Federal Government could not be expected to reimburse many flood losses. He sought today to emphasize what would be done. "People who have worked hard all of their lives deserve a helping hand," he said in his weekly radio address. "With that helping hand, the people of the Midwest will get back on their feet."
But while his meeting with the governors was generally friendly, its tone sometimes reflected the strains felt by state leaders confronted with staggering losses and rigid Federal rules.
In response to a question from Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, Mr. Clinton said he would consider the idea of waiving a regulation that requires states to match Federal contributions for disaster relief.
While expressing concern for farmers, Mr. Clinton did not pledge to revise the rules for Federal payments that can sometimes limit reimbursements to 20 percent of the value of lost crops. He said that given budget problems, it would be "virtually impossible" for Congress to be more generous.
But in response to a question from Gov. Jim Edgar of Illinois, Mr. Clinton told the governors he wanted to make "absolutely clear" that the Administration would add to the $2.45 billion request for assistance "as more information comes in on the losses."
In addition to the President and Vice President, the top Administration officials who traveled to the Midwest for the meeting were Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy; Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena; Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown; Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros; Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich; Health and Human Services Secretary Donna E. Shalala; Leon E. Panetta, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Carol M. Browner, the adminstrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
Apart from Governors Branstad and Edgar, the governors in attendance were E. Ben Nelson of Nebraska; Walter D. Miller of South Dakota; Arne H. Carlson of Minnesota; Mel Carnahan of Missouri; Edward T. Schafer of North Dakota, and Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin.
Mr. Clinton flew later this afternoon to Little Rock. He planned to return to Washington on Sunday.

HEADLINE: Made in the U.S.A.? -- Hard Labor on a Pacific Island/A special report.;
Saipan Sweatshops Are No American Dream

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAIPAN

 BODY:
On this tiny, tropical outpost of the United States, many people describe what happens to foreign workers here as something close to servitude.
Every year, thousands of laborers from China, the Philippines and elsewhere in Asia are flown here. The workers are often bused straight from the airport to squalid barracks where they live -- sometimes for years -- as many as a dozen to a room. 
 They are put to work almost immediately in nearby factories within view of Saipan's pristine beaches, many of them laboring six days a week at about half the Federal minimum wage, stitching together American brand-name clothes.
 
Familiar Labels
 The labels would be familiar to anyone who has strolled through an American shopping mall. Over the last year, Arrow, Liz Claiborne, The Gap, Montgomery Ward, Geoffrey Beene, Eddie Bauer and Levi's have all made clothes on this palm-fringed island that is part of the American commonwealth in the Western Pacific, 5,000 miles from the continental United States.
And while many of these garments are manufactured in foreign-owned factories by foreign workers, the apparel made in the Northern Marianas often bears another familiar label: "Made in the U.S.A." The American flag flies over several of the factories.
An estimated $279 million worth of wholesale clothing, virtually all of it made by foreign labor, was shipped from here last year to the United States.
 
Part of America at $2.15 an Hour
 "We come here because we make more money here than in China, and because the recruiters in China tell us that Saipan is part of America," said a $2.15-an-hour factory worker from a village near Shanghai.
The woman, who is in her early 20's, invited a visitor into the cramped barracks room that she shares with seven other women, their beds separated only by flimsy cloth sheets. The room also serves as a kitchen.
"They are not good conditions," she says, wrinkling her nose and pointing to a mildewy hallway strewn with litter. "If we complain, then our bosses would send us back to China and take away all of our money. Our families need the money."
 
The Sweatshops
No Comment From the Mall
 The biggest industries here -- garment manufacturing, tourism and construction -- are all dependent on poorly paid foreign labor, which explains why of the 42,000 people who live in the Northern Marianas, of which Saipan is the largest, more than half are foreign workers.
While clothing from the Northern Marianas made up only about 1 percent of the $29 billion in clothing imported into the United States last year, it accounts for as much as 20 percent of the clothing sold by some large American companies.
Several big manufacturers doing business here are silent when asked about labor practices or about the volume of clothing they import. Spokesmen for Arrow, The Gap and Montgomery Ward either did not return phone calls or said they had no comment on labor conditions in the islands.
A Claiborne spokeswoman acknowledged that the company did make "a small percentage" of its clothing in the Northern Marianas. A spokeswoman for Eddie Bauer said the factories here produced only "an insignificant percentage" of the company's goods. Neither company would discuss import figures.
 
Industry Battles Abuses
 The industry's trade group, the American Apparel Manufacturers Association, said its members were doing their best to end labor abuses in the islands.
"We oppose sweatshops wherever they are," said Larry Martin, the association's spokesman. "We believe and hope that our members are abiding by all labor laws."
One clothing manufacturer, Levi Strauss & Co., has been notably aggressive in trying to end labor abuses in Saipan. While it continues to make shirts at five plants on the island, it ended its contracts last year with the island's largest clothesmaker, Willie Tan, after an investigation by Levi's found evidence of "unsatisfactory treatment of workers and violation of the law" in his factories.
While insisting that his companies never abused or cheated workers, Mr. Tan, a Philippine-born American businessman, did agree last year to pay $9 million in back wages and damages to laborers, most of them Chinese, under a settlement with the United States Labor Department.
 
Legal Servitude
 The plight of foreign workers in the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands has outraged the few Federal investigators who have made the long journey across the Pacific -- Saipan is far closer to China and the Philippines than it is to Hawaii -- even as they acknowledge that most of what goes on here is within the law. Visitors to the islands are also startled by what they see.
"It certainly has its parallels to slavery or indentured servitude," said Neils Jensen, a Christian missionary from New Zealand who has lived intermittently on Saipan since 1983. "Many of these workers go into debt for what they think will be the privilege of working on Saipan. Because they're so deeply in debt, they can't afford to retaliate or complain or leave. Their conditions are horrendous."
Over the years Washington has granted a variety of concessions to businesses in Saipan to encourage economic growth and to end generations of subsistence living for the local islanders. For decades, the largest employer had been the United States Trust Territory government.
Under an agreement approved in 1976, the islands were exempted from the Federal minimum wage. The commonwealth government now sets its own minimum wage, which has been $2.15 an hour since 1984. (Other American territories, including Guam, which is only 120 miles from Saipan, use the higher Federal guaranteed minimum of $4.25 an hour.)
 
The Exploited
A Life of Misery Under Old Glory
 Yet the Chinese garment workers almost certainly have it better than many of the other foreign laborers here.
Thousands of Filipinos are employed in the Northern Marianas as construction workers or maids, jobs that are currently exempted from the islands' $2.15 minimum wage. Many young Filipino women are brought to Saipan to work in bars where, they say, they are forced by their employers to serve as prostitutes for the islands' tourists, most of them Japanese visitors on package tours.
The plight of Asian immigrants who are willing to take great risks to live and to work in the United States drew international attention in May, when a rusty freighter carrying 300 undocumented Chinese immigrants ran aground in New York.
In Saipan, Asian laborers arrive legally, usually in the comfort of a commercial jet. But there is plenty of evidence to suggest that many of the estimated 23,000 foreign laborers in these islands, like their undocumented counterparts in the continental United States, face a life of exploitation and misery under the American flag.
Saipan is the largest of the 14 volcanic islands that make up the Northern Marianas, scene of some of the bloodiest fighting of World War II.
 
McDonald's and TV Reruns
 After the war, the islands became a territory of the United States and eventually a commonwealth. The islanders are American citizens, and there are reminders everywhere of their ties to the United States, from the new McDonald's restaurant to a cable-television system that rebroadcasts "Murphy Brown" and the "Today Show."
The garment industry was established in the early 1980's as a result of Federal rules that allow manufacturers here to export clothing to the American mainland duty free and largely without quotas.
There are now more than 20 factories, most of them owned by foreign investors who were also lured here by the islands' liberal investment and immigration laws.
Under commonwealth law, foreign investors are welcome, and they have brought with them a flood of foreign workers who are willing to accept minimum-wage jobs that local islanders routinely reject. Most of the islanders work for the local government and receive much more than the minimum wage.
The commonwealth's Governor, Lorenzo I. DeLeon Guerrero, said that he had heard the slave-labor comparisons in discussions of foreign workers. "It is an insult to us," he said. "There's no slavery here."
But he also readily acknowledged that some employers take advantage of foreign workers. "It's very true that the conditions of these people should be far better," the Governor said. "We have to be honest about that."
 
The Reformers
30 an Hour Raise And Barbed Wire
 The local legislature approved a law this year to raise the minimum wage by 30 cents a year for each of the next seven years and to apply the minimum to construction workers. The Governor has proposed the creation of a human rights commission to protect the rights of workers.
But the reforms do not go far enough to satisfy many of the commonwealth's critics -- under the new law, Saipan's minimum wage will not match the current Federal minimum of $4.25 until 1999 -- and there are threats in Congress this year to cut off more than $120 million in Federal subsidies.
"I'm afraid that an awful lot of time and motion is being wasted trying to give the appearance of reform instead of actually making real, structural changes," said Representative George Miller, a California Democrat who is chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, which oversees American territories.
American labor unions charge that, because of the low wages paid to foreign workers, the Northern Marianas are stealing jobs from textile workers in the United States. The unions want the Government to crack down on the labor abuses here.
"We have rules for protecting products, such as copyright laws, but seemingly we have no rules to protect the workers who produce the product -- if they happen to be in Saipan," said Arthur Gundersheim, director of international affairs for the Amalgamated Clothing & Textile Workers Union.
 
No Water or Electricity
 While commonwealth officials insist they are trying to improve the living conditions of foreign workers, the improvements are not evident in large Saipan neighborhoods like Susupe, where several oversize tin-roof plywood shacks serve as workers' barracks. Often they have no regular water or electricity.
In larger barracks, workers complain of living in virtual captivity, their housing ringed with barbed wire and patrolled by teams of uniformed guards.
"The girls have no freedom," said a 29-year-old Filipino who worked in a bar for five months before "escaping" last year and finding a different job. She asked that her name not be used for fear that her family in the Philippines would learn that she had worked as a prostitute.
While working at the bar, she lived with 20 other women in a three-bedroom house that they were rarely allowed to leave. "We were told that we could not go outside by ourselves, ever," she said. "The boss was afraid that we would have boyfriends and would sleep with them without getting money for him."
 
'Going to America'
 The exploitation of workers often begins long before they arrive here. Many pay large recruitment fees to middlemen in their homelands who find them jobs in Saipan. No matter how terrible the working conditions, they say, they cannot think of going home until the money is earned back.
Masudur Rahman, 30, said his impoverished family in Bangladesh sold off much of its farmland outside Dhaka, the capital, to raise the $4,000 fee demanded by the recruiters for a construction job "where the American flag is flying." Although the recruiter promised a job paying $1,500 a month, Mr. Rahman said, he never received more than $250 a month.
He said he was startled to discover once he arrived in Saipan that he, like virtually all other foreign laborers, had no right to travel on to the United States.
"The recruitment agent said we were going to America," Mr. Rahman recalled. "He never said Saipan."
 
The Exploiters
The Harsh Lessons Of Free Enterprise
 Among the garment industry employers, no one here had been more successful than Mr. Tan, whose family controls clothing factories that employ hundreds of foreign workers and ship millions of dollars worth of clothing each year to the mainland United States.
But Mr. Tan's luck appeared to run out last year, when he agreed to pay $9 million in back wages and damages to more than 1,000 factory workers to settle the Labor Department charges. The department's investigators said that workers in Mr. Tan's factories put in as many as 90 hours a week without overtime and were routinely paid as little as $1.65 an hour.
Separately, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration announced last year that its investigation had found "appalling living and working conditions" in Saipan garment factories and barracks, including those controlled by Mr. Tan.
Although Federal regulations require that workers receive a minimum of 100 square feet of space per person to cook and sleep, six of Mr. Tan's workers were found living in one room of 190 square feet. Toilet facilities were primitive.
 
Charges Are Dropped
 The Occupational Safety and Health Administration dropped the charges after the Tan companies made $1.3 million in repairs to the factories and barracks and agreed to pay $76,000 in penalties.
His lawyer, Robert J. O'Connor, said that Mr. Tan agreed to pay the back wages only because the Labor Department was harassing some of the factories' clients.
"The Labor Department was putting pressure on our buyers by putting out press releases implying that they were linked to slave labor," he said. ""We were coerced into the settlement."
Mr. O'Connor said that the wages had been withheld not by Mr. Tan's companies, but by Chinese Government supervisors under a longstanding agreement with the workers.
"We know that 97 percent of all the workers who work for Mr. Tan have asked to have their contracts extended," Mr. O'Connor said.
"When they are here," he said of the Chinese laborers, "they learn about free enterprise, democracy -- they become good-will ambassadors of our precepts of democracy."
That is not borne out by the scores of affidavits gathered by the Labor Department from the Chinese workers. The company "makes use of all kinds of illegal methods to steal our blood money," said Hu Li Yue, a factory mender in one of Mr. Tan's factories.
 
The Forgotten
Workers Stranded Without a Job
 Some workers arriving here on contracts receive nothing, not even jobs. Near the airport, a crumbling cinder block house without electricity or running water is home to 47 laborers from the province of Guangdong in southeastern China.
The workers arrived on Saipan in December 1991 on two-year contracts as construction workers, but the jobs they had been promised disappeared. "Now they're pretty much stranded," said their lawyer, Brian McMahon.
The South Korean businessmen who brought them here, Kim Choon Suk, says that because of a downturn in the local construction industry, he had no work for the Chinese laborers and no money to send them home.
"I do not write home anymore because I do not want my wife and my two children to know the truth of our terrible conditions," said Liu Lin Yong, a 30-year-old construction worker.
He leaned against one of the long sheets of plywood that Mr. Kim supplied to the workers to serve as beds. In one room, 22 of the men sleep side by side on the platforms. The toilets are flushed with rainwater, and the men bathe by swimming in the ocean.
"We have no money to pay for tickets to go home," Mr. Liu said, opening his wallet to show that it was empty. All it contained were a few photographs of his family. "I would go home today if I had a ticket. I would run to the airport."

Evolutionary Biology as an Approach to Improving Health

BYLINE: By MARJORIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
AN evolutionary biologist, Dr. George Williams, professor emeritus of ecology and evolution at the State University at Stony Brook, belongs to a handful of researchers who say patients would benefit if doctors took an evolutionary or adaptive approach in evaluating them.
An awareness of the evolutionary history would redefine some illnesses and explain others, according to the theory. Problems like infections, morning sickness, aging and psychological illnesses related to anxiety and stress would benefit from heeding Darwin's theory of natural selection. 
 In 1991 an article outlining the theory was published in The Quarterly Review of Biology by Dr. Williams and Dr. Randolph M. Nesse, a psychiatrist at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor. The two joined to write "The Dawn of Darwinian Medicine," which Times Books plans to publish shortly.
Dr. Williams, who lives in Setauket, joined the marine biology department at SUNY in 1960, when it was in Oyster Bay, after earning his Ph.D. from University of California and teaching at Michigan State University. His landmark book, "Adaptation and Natural Selection," was published in 1966.
Q. How would you define the subspecialty of Darwinian medicine?
A. Definitions evolve, I suppose, and if this is a term that will continue to be used, it will undoubtedly change. But what we understand by it is the application of the theory of natural selection which is Darwin's unique contribution, to medical problems.
For any symptom you should have an adaptationist's explanation for it. For example in infectious disease, a symptom may represent damage caused by a pathogen bacteria, or it may represent your own defense against that pathogen. It is necessary for an understanding of interactions between host and parasite to know who is doing what to whom and how these activities show themselves in the symptoms that you see.
Sneezing and fever are defenses against the pathogen. Do you give the patient something to curtail the sneezing or stop the fever? There have been studies in laboratory animals that have shown that if you give a drug to reduce the fever from infectious disease it prolongs the illness. Fever is a mechanism that speeds up the defense process more than it speeds up the activities of the pathogen. This is not to say that you should be glad when you have a fever because you are defending yourself. Many defenses which have evolved are maladaptive.
I speak in moderation, and defense mechanisms can go wrong. Everyone involved in medicine including the patient, should be aware of these problems, and we're trying to increase this awareness with our book.
Q. How did you become interested in the field?
A. In 1980, I ran across a brief article by Paul Ewald on how to interpret the symptoms of infectious diseases from an evolutionary perspective. We then met while I was doing a teaching fellowship at the University of Michigan. Between us we concluded evolutionary ideas have a relevance not just for infectious disease, but in many other ways.
It probably would have remained a side issue for me until I met Randy Nesse, several years later, who was on the faculty of the medical school there. He was interested in the application of evolutionary ideas in medicine in general, but particularly to psychiatry.
Q. Why has it taken so long for Darwin's theory to be associated with medicine?
A. It has taken this theory an awfully long time to find many of the fruitful applications that it has been put to recently within biology. It's only in the last few decades that the idea of natural selection has been a major organizing concept. The kinds of training physicians get includes very little exposure to this kind of thinking. A lot of the theoretical advances in evolutionary biology that are most important to medicine are really fairly recent innovations.
Q. Has there been opposition in the medical community?
A. I don't think there has been any concerted opposition. But an inevitable kind of opposition that everyone is probably guilty of is that everyone is busy already, and here we come along and say you'd better worry about this, too.
Q. Why would doctors benefit from applying an evolutionary perspective? What are the basic lessons that they should know?
A. In the short run we can now say there are some serious gaps in our knowledge that would not be there if a few decades ago medical researchers had been aware of the relevance of evolutionary ideas. There are aspects of human biology that are really mysterious. Looking at them from an evolutionary perspective, you can't imagine how it could be that we have these problems.
One good example is morning sickness during pregnancy. During a normal part of the human life cycle large proportions of those who experience it show symptoms that we associate with disease like nausea and vomiting. Yet the only response of the medical profession to this condition is to find something to relieve these unpleasant symptoms. They have not wondered enough about why these symptoms are there in the first place. The morning sickness has evolved as a mechanism that takes account of the fact that fetal tissues are more vulnerable to toxins than are maternal tissues. A woman whose symptoms are controlled by medication may eat things that she really shouldn't.
Allergy has been studied in the same way, essentially as a way of getting rid of toxins. There are some hay-fever sufferers whose hay fever is actually doing them some good.
It's important to imagine what would be the consequence of such conditions like morning sickness and allergy in the Stone Age. Things were harsh in those days, and any serious inconvenience would have serious consequences. We expect that evolution would have eliminated this kind of problem. The fact that today so many develop these problems is something that needs an explanation.
Having 25 percent of the population grow up nearsighted is inconceivable from an evolutionary perspective. If you look at primitive tribal life today, only 1 or 2 percent are nearsighted. Something about this grossly abnormal environment that we are in now adversely affects our eyes. There is wholesale child abuse going on that is causing this myopia. Children are not designed to sit in classrooms for hours on end.
The rule should be any medical phenomenon should be put in an evolutionary perspective. Ask why did we evolve this vulnerability or condition and who benefits from this condition?
Q. Will your book be for the public or a medical text? Is the evolutionary approach being taught in medical schools?
A. The book is for the general public, but it could be used by students. Now there is no medical school that emphasizes evolutionary approaches. Undoubtedly, there are individuals on medical-school faculties who are making use of evolutionary ideas in their teaching such as the University of Michigan. The only way it will become part of the curriculum in all medical schools is for the administrators to become aware of its importance.
Q. What are the medical disorders that would most benefit?
A. Certainly infectious diseases, as well as injuries and poisoning. They all have their evolutionary aspects that need to be worked out. Diseases of old age, obstetrical and gynecological problems and mental illness. In fact, an evolutionary perspective will provide an understanding of just about all medical disorders.
Q. In The Quarterly Review of Biology you said, "Human biology is designed for Stone Age conditions." How does that affect modern medicine?
A. One hundred thousand years ago people were anatomically very much as we are today. Genes mutate very slowly. There were things that succeeded in the Stone Age, and that's what we have today, whether we need them or not. But 95 of those 100,000 years were spent in the hunter-gatherer economies, with very sparse populations. There were many diseases, but not like those of today, whose transmission mostly requires dense populations.
Our dietary preferences are one example of how Stone Age adaptations now have negative consequences. The rule was eat the sweet fruit and reject the sour. Take this and put it in a world of chocolate eclairs and cookies. We continue to go after the sweetest thing available. Sugar and fat intake is enormously greater than it ever could have been in the Stone Age, leading to new health problems.
Q. Where do evolutionary biologists draw the line between the body's healing itself and the intervention of medicine?
A. The body is attempting to heal itself in disease, but the intervention should help rather than hinder. An example is in the early stages of a bacterial infection the iron count is often low. A traditional approach by the physician would be, "Here is an abnormality we need to restore." But what in fact is happening is the liver and other organs are pulling the iron out of the blood as a way of depriving the bacteria. The iron count is not a deficiency, but instead a useful defense against bacteria.
Q. How do Darwinists explain the aging process?
A. One of the 15 chapters in our book deals with the topic of the aging process, or senescence. It is a prime example of a genetically programmed difficulty maintained as a tradeoff. It is a gradual deterioration of many kinds of adaptive performances. Dietary restrictions at any age have some longevity benefits. The biggest effects are those established early. The aging process, as we see it, is an extension of human development. To control the negative aspects of this development, we need to know more about development in general. More fundamental work in developmental biology and genetics is needed before we can intervene to slow the actual process.
Q. Are there cancers that could be better understood with a Darwinian approach?
A. The understanding that comes from a Darwinian perspective with regard to cancers is mainly discouraging. We may learn how to detect some earlier, and control others. But the picture is the older you get the more vulnerable you get to more cancers. Cancers of women's reproductive tracts are a special case where a Darwinian perspective may produce some rapid and tangible benefits.
Q. What is the Darwinists' view on the treatment and future of the AIDS virus?
A. A lot of people studying AIDS and H.I.V. are looking at its evolution and the way things we are doing affect its evolution. The urgency of this problem has focused people's attention on the evolutionary changes this organism is undergoing. Researchers' help will come from a better understanding of the evolution of the retrovirus, of which the AIDS virus is one.
Q. What are your hopes for the future of Darwinian medicine?
A. I hope that within a very few decades everyone in the medical profession realizes that nothing makes sense unless you look at it in an evolutionary perspective. There is a quote from one of the founders of modern Darwinism in this century, Theodosus Dobzhansky, whom I paraphrase. He said, "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution."

HEADLINE: Town Seeks Donations of Goods To Save the Taxpayers Money

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
WHEN the Berlin Police Department was renovating a holding cell this year, it was supposed to cost $12,000. But by scavenging parts from a jail that was being torn down, the department finished the job for $4,500.
In a similar fashion, the police department solicited a truck from a utility company to transport the police dive team. A bank gave the department used computers and wall partitions to set up a detectives' bureau, and an insurance company gave the department some furniture and office equipment. 
 "We were putting a lot of these things in the budget, but because of the economy they would get cut," said Chief Gerald R. Charamut. "If we can get what we need -- even if it's not brand new, as long as it's serviceable -- we can save the taxpayers money."
The donations to the police department are part of an active solicitation program the town has developed over the last several years. This month, for instance, the town received 5,000 binders from an architectural hardware company that will be used in the Board of Education office, and summer programs routinely use disposable cups donated by a local paper products manufacturer.
"We want to continue to offer the same services that we always have, but you've got to cut the cost, because you can't continue to jack up taxes," said the town's Mayor, Robert J. Peters. "The town is not so proud that everything it uses has to be new, and most of the items that are given to us are in excellent condition."
The town even accepts donations of items it might not need, if it thinks it can realize a profit on the deal; at a recent auction of surplus property, Mr. Peters said, about $2,000 was realized from items that had been donated to the town as surplus. The town gets the cash, and the companies got the tax write-off for the donation, and a personal note of thanks from the town's executive board.
 
No Special Treatment
 The Berlin Corporation Counsel, E. Timothy Sullivan Jr., who is also a lawyer in New Britain, said there was no possibility that any of the contributors could seek special treatment from the town in return for a donation. The town seeks the contributions to augment its services; if it had to give something back in exchange, it might as well buy the items itself.
"In no way is there a so-called 'quid pro quo,' " Mr. Sullivan said. "It just wouldn't make sense."
Mr. Peters, who is in his third year as mayor of Berlin, was elected about the time Connecticut's economy went sour, so he said he's never known anything but fiscal frugality.
"I guess I just assumed everybody was doing it," Mr. Peters said. "You've got to hold down expenses, and this is one way of doing that."
But Berlin's solicitations program was unique enough to earn a mention in the Moneysavers section of Connecticut Town and City, the newsletter of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities.
"We're not aware of any other towns doing this type of thing, although we haven't performed any definitive kind of survey," said Kevin T. Maloney, a spokesman for the organization. "It seemed very innovative to us. In these sort of bleak economic times, towns have to find cheaper ways to provide services. This program is a unique way of getting what you need."
The solicitation program makes up only a small part of the town's $3.6 million budget, with most donations worth a few thousand dollars at best, officials said. But for the most part, what is donated are capital expense items that might not otherwise make it into the budget.
 
Tables and Chairs
 For instance, the Aetna insurance company donated some tables and chairs for a police classroom that previously was furnished with the old one-piece desks that had a writing table attached to the seat, and were designed for 96-pound fifth-graders.
"To put a six-foot cop with a full gunbelt into one of those seats and try to run a class; well, it was a little uncomfortable," said Mr. Charamut.
Shawmut Bank donated to the town some six-foot-high office partitions that allowed some privacy to the three-man detective bureau, the youth officer, and the narcotics officer. Previously interviews had to be conducted in a large, open office, Mr. Charamut said. The bank also donated computers that allowed the police to keep confidential files without entering them into the mainframe computer, where others could have access to them.
 
'Good Corporate Citizenry'
 "It's good corporate citizenry," said a spokesman for Shawmut, Brent DiGiorgio. "Computer equipment has a very good secondary life, so if we can find a town to use it after we've replaced it with more modern equipment, we're happy to provide it.
"I can't say that a lot of towns approach us, though," Mr. DiGiorgio said. "What we get are a lot of nonprofits that do it on a regular basis."
Some companies donate to the town as part of a regular corporate giving program. Sherwood Industries, which operates Sherri Cup Co. in Berlin, regularly offers paper cups and other products for town functions, and paper on large rolls for use in school art programs.
Sherri also has a program where nonprofit agencies can apply for free products once a year, said the company's assistant secretary for corporate finances, Nancy C. Caccavale. She said her father, one of the organizers of the company, set civic-mindedness as one of the goals of the company 45 years ago.
"We take pride in helping out organizations, whether a church, the Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts, or the town," Ms. Caccavale said.
Northeast Utilities, which has its headquarters in town, donated a Chevrolet Suburban truck that is used by the police dive team, and a big conference table used in the mayor's office. The truck was due to be replaced anyway, and the table was sitting in a trailer after the company completed a $28 million renovation and expansion project.
 
Line Workers and Executives
 A spokeswoman for Northeast, Myra H. Ahern, said the company also donates services, sending line maintenance workers to lecture Berlin school children on electrical safety, and allowing Berlin students to follow Northeast executives around for a day as part of a careers program. The company is also the town's largest taxpayer, with a bill of more than $2 million a year.
"We feel it's essential to be involved in communities where we do business," Ms. Ahern said. "So we support programs and activities that help improve those communities."
Mr. Peters said he acts as a clearinghouse for all solicitations, to make sure one company isn't approached too many times.
"I think there are limitations to what we should be looking for from these companies, because they're in tough times too," Mr. Roberts said. "There's an old saying -- you shouldn't overstay your welcome. I want to make sure if we're asking for something, we absolutely need it, and it's not in the budget."
Mr. Peters said he also wants to make sure that the same company approached one week for a donation to the engineering department is not approached the next week for the same thing by the public works department.
 
No Frivolous Requests
 "Your credibility is important in approaching these companies, and they need to know your requests aren't frivolous," Mr. Peters said.
Sometimes the contribution doesn't cost a company any cash. Renovations at one of the town's schools recently eliminated two baseball fields that had been used by the Little League; Corbin-Russwin, a local architectural hardware company, donated the use of its corporate baseball fields.
"That's the kind of cooperation we welcome and appreciate," Mr. Roberts said. "That saved the town from having to say 'no' to a lot of young people who wanted to play ball."
One recent solicitation windfall came not from a corporation, but from another community. When the Berlin police station was built in 1976 it had a padded cell that was soon useless. Police have to be able to monitor people inside the cells in the event they try to hurt themselves, and today the standard of treatment for people who are mentally disturbed is to take them to a hospital.
 
Cells and Fixtures
 It was going to cost an estimated $12,000 to remove the padded walls, install bars, and do other renovations to bring the cell up to modern code, Mr. Charamut said. But they learned Bloomfield was building a new jail, and demolishing its old one, and Berlin asked if it could get the old cells and fixtures.
"They were going to have to pay by the pound to have the old fixtures hauled away, so they saved a few dollars," Mr. Charamut said. "And it cost us $4,500 to renovate our cell, about a third of the cost if we had done everything new."
Mr. Peters said even if town finances return to the high point of the mid-1980s, the town has learned a lesson in how to make the most out of every dollar, and he hopes it will continue with the program.
"This is the best form of recycling," Mr. Peters said. "Our attitude is, before you throw it out, let us take a look at it."

HEADLINE: Moving Ahead On a Cleaner L.I. Sound

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
AN agreement last month between New York State and Westchester County to limit pollutants discharged into Long Island Sound from sewage-treatment plants in Port Chester, Rye, Mamaroneck and New Rochelle is being applauded by government officials and environmentalists as a first step -- albeit a small one -- in correcting decades of abuse of a troubled estuary.
The agreement to enforce a policy recommended by the Federal Long Island Sound Study in 1991 -- calling for no net gain in nitrogen to prevent depleted oxygen levels in the water -- is the first of its kind in the state and could act as a model for other local governments to follow, State Department of Environmental Conservation officials said. 
 Scientists say nitrogen acts as a fertilizer for algae blooms, which eventually sink to the floor of the Sound and decompose, depleting oxygen in the process. In extreme conditions, when oxygen levels drop below 3.5 milligrams per liter of water, what is known as a hypoxic condition may result, causing fin fish to flee to more aerated waters and slow-moving organisms that live on the floor of the sound, like lobsters and crabs, to suffer and sometimes die.
Already, there are signs that the Sound may be in trouble this summer, according to water samples taken from Milton Harbor in Rye and Mamaroneck Harbor by the Long Island Sound Task Force's Harbor Watch program. Nancy Seligson -- president of the board of trustees of the task force, a nonprofit environmental organization in Stamford with 11,000 members from Connecticut and New York -- said that oxygen levels were "extremely high," above 10 milligrams of oxygen per liter of water. This could signal significant algae activity now and depleted oxygen levels later, when the algae begin to die off.
In other words, the high levels of oxygen are a precursor to significant hypoxic events, said Philip M. DeGaetano, director of water quality for the State Department of Environmental Conservation. Five milligrams per liter of water is considered a healthy level in the Sound.
Also, the recent high temperatures have caused the top layer of the Sound to heat up rapidly, trapping the colder and more saline water on the bottom. That condition, coupled with the lack of rainstorms that churn up and oxygenate the water, also sets the stage for a possible hypoxic event.
To reduce the chance of such events in the future, nitrogen going into the Sound must be significantly lowered, scientists say. But for now, the permit agreement with Westchester will limit the discharge of nitrogen to 5,200 pounds a day -- about the current level -- in accordance with the no-net-gain policy. The four plants involved discharge about 4 percent of all the nitrogen coming from 43 sewage treatment plants in Connecticut and New York State.
 
'Moving in the Right Direction'
 Although county officials have long expressed a desire to improve conditions in the Sound and protect marine life, they have also been reluctant to adopt practices that might limit growth and development or might prove too costly.
"No one is saying this was easy for Westchester, but it's the difference between talking about a problem and doing something about it," said Mark A. Tedesco, director of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency's Long Island Sound Study office in Stamford. "It's like finally putting your money where your mouth is."
Environmentalists, who report that 10 percent of the nation's population lives within 50 miles of Long Island Sound, said that even though they were disappointed that the agreement did not go farther, they welcomed Westchester's commitment to a firm plan of action.
Ms. Seligson said the county was finally "moving in the right direction to help the most distressed estuary in the United States." She added that Connecticut communities had agreed to the nitrogen cap two years ago and is currently upgrading its plants with state funds.
 
90,800 Tons of Nitrogen a Year
 The State Department of Environmental Conservation's 15-month battle to get Westchester to agree to the nitrogen cap was hard fought, with most of the resistance to the plan coming from two sources: the building trades, which feared that an agreement would mean a moratorium on new construction so treatment plants wouldn't be overloaded, and municipal officials and taxpayers who were worried that an estimated $440 million needed to upgrade the plants to comply with long-range nitrogen-reduction plans would fall on their shoulders.
Robert Bendick, the State Department of Environmental Conservation's deputy commissioner for natural resources, called the pact "a sign of real progress tied to a legal agreement" and said that as a result, Nassau and Suffolk Counties, which initially balked about signing similar contracts, now appear willing to cooperate. New York City is also negotiating with the state to limit the amount of the pollutants its treatment plants dump into the estuary.
According to county and state figures, it is estimated that 90,800 tons of nitrogen enter the Sound each year from a variety of sources: about 25,700 tons from the sewage plants in New York State and Connecticut and the rest from other official upland sources, called point sources (treatment plants along the Connecticut River, for example), and from unofficial or nonspecific sources, called nonpoint (like illegal sewer hookups and fertilizer on lawns, golf courses and farms), which feed into the Sound through rivers and streams.
Under the state's original proposal to Westchester, if a treatment plant were to exceed the nitrogen limit, new sewer hookups would have been banned. But that provision was eventually softened to make the deal more palatable to representatives of the construction industry, Mr. DeGaetano said.
 
Part of a Long-Range Plan
 The revised agreement, which will take effect on Dec. 31 next year, allows for day-to-day fluctuations at specific plants so long as the aggregate amount of nitrogen discharged remains within prescribed limits. Also, a violation will not automatically trigger a sewer hookup ban, although the state still has enforcement powers, Mr. DeGaetano said.
With the Westchester agreement finally in their pocket, state officials conceded that tougher restrictions on nitrogen and even plant upgrades could be necessary in the future. They are awaiting the results next year of the Long Island Sound Study's $4 million computer model, which will detail the impact of both nonpoint and point sources of pollution. The current agreement with Westchester, officials said, is just an initial step in what is to be a long-range management plan for the Sound.
The Long Island Sound Study, a research and management project that began in 1985, is part of the National Estuary Program and involves research institutions, regulatory agencies and concerned organizations and individuals. Its recommendations are being administered jointly by New York State, Connecticut and the Federal Environmental Protection Agency.
Meanwhile, the county's agreement to limit nitrogen from sewage treatment plants is being combined with efforts to find alternatives to costly plant upgrades and with studies on controlling nonpoint sources of pollutants.
For example, the permit agreement is being coupled with a $200,000 experimental nitrogen-reduction project at the Blind Brook Wastewater Treatment Plant in Rye, which could prove far less expensive in the long run than upgrading plants. The project entails using bacteria to break down nitrogen -- a chemical in human waste -- through a series of steps, ending with the release of nitrogen gas, which is natural to the atmosphere.
 
Funds for New Plants
 Adam J. Zabinksi, director of waste water treatment for the County Department of Environmental Facilities, estimated that the experimental system was reducing the 14 milligrams of nitrogen per liter of water usually discharged by the plants by about two to three milligrams per liter. .
But Mr. Zabinski was cautious about the implications of the project for the future. "While this is promising and may do some good, we don't know in the long run if it will be enough," he said.
Mr. DeGaetano also was not optimistic that the biological nutrient removal project would solve the problem. "For now, we're buying time," he said. "But in the long run, we may still be talking about big dollars to upgrade plants."
Legislation introduced in Congress, however, may provide some financing for renovating plants, he said. A bill introduced in April by Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of White Plains, and Representative Rosa L. DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, calls for $33 billion over three years to restore water quality in the Sound and 17 other estuaries. New York's piece of the pie would amount to more than $3 billion for investments in water pollution control and economic development. A companion measure has been introduced in the Senate.
 
A $500,000 State Grant
 Locally, the 31-member Citizen's Committee on Nonpoint Source Pollution, which County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke appointed last year, will unveil its findings on Thursday.
The report will focus on land-use planning, enforcement of wetlands regulations and limiting fertilizer use, among other things, said Mayor Warren R. Ross of the City of Rye and co-chairman of the committee.
A $500,000 state grant, which will use Federal Environmental Protection Agency funds, is expected to be awarded to the county in October to develop a management plan for controlling nonpoint sources of nitrogen pollution, Mr. DeGaetano said.

HEADLINE: Have Viola, Will Travel: A Working Musician's Life

BYLINE: By PATRICIA VOLK; Patricia Volk's most recent books are "White Light," a novel, and "All It Takes," a collection of short stories.

 BODY:
You think your life is crazy? Juliet Haffner has to find a violist to substitute for her in the orchestra of the Broadway show "Guys and Dolls" because her Latin American pop group only has time for two rehearsals before they record their new CD. Meanwhile, her regular flutist has a gig at the Metropolitan Museum, so now Ms. Haffner has to find a sub for him, too. Then there's a meeting with the CD cover photographer and, after that, one with an arranger, and at 6, a rewrite meeting on the album liner notes -- they need serious work. After three and a half hours wedged into the curve of a grand piano with seven musicians in a 12-by-16 walk-up behind a woodwind repair shop off Times Square, Ms. Haffner gets home close to midnight and her message machine is blinking: Be at the recording studio first thing in the morning.
This, she says, is an easy day. 
 Have viola, will travel.
Parents everywhere who dream of producing the next Itzhak Perlman take note: Freelance musicians in New York do not head for the beach when the temperature hits 100. Wallendas on the high wire of economic survival, they balance recording dates, rehearsals and concerts. As the violist for a hit show, Ms. Haffner is getting regular paychecks for the first time in her life, plus a health plan and three weeks' paid vacation. If she's lucky, really lucky, this could last five years. The downside is, all the people who call you for work forget you. Once the job is over, then what?
Q: A conductor and a violist are hitchhiking on the road. Whom do you hit first?
A: The conductor. Business before pleasure.
"Violists are the Polish joke of the musical world," says a well-known composer terrified of alienating violists. "Nobody plays the viola that well, because they come to it later in life, after playing the violin."
"First, I wanted to be a ballet dancer," Ms. Haffner says, sipping a glass of water in her West 40's studio apartment. "Then I played guitar. Then piano. Then violin. When I got into the High School of Music and Art, I wanted to stick with the violin but that first day they said, 'We really need viola players,' and my hand went up." (The viola, slightly larger than a violin, is tuned a fifth lower and has a more mellow tone.)
Ms. Haffner speaks intently. Like the head on the prow of a ship, her face conveys forward motion. Her scrunched brown hair looks like it's blowing even when she's sitting. Seventeen examples of floral bark cloth co-exist on her chairs, bed and sofa. Some are shot with gold. The feeling is 30's, cozy, feminine. Her pink Princess phone sits on a small table that holds her books, all of which are by or about Damon Runyon, on whose characters "Guys and Dolls" is based. The view from the window is of that great monument to Deco, the McGraw-Hill Building. Perfect.
"Music and Art was just so wonderful," she says. "We spent half the day playing. That's when I knew I'd be a musician. I saw it as a very social thing. I'd always be able to have friends." Friends, yes. But romance takes time. When Ms. Haffner does go out, it is usually with a musician. "I'm always amazed," she says, "that people who have different life styles live together or are married. What would I talk about with somebody else?"
MS. HAFFNER WAS BORN IN Manhattan 38 years ago and grew up in the Bronx. Her father, who still plays the violin professionally for the Bronx Opera Company and the Bronx Chamber Orchestra, was her biggest influence. "Both my parents played," she says. "So coming to music wasn't forced. Our house was filled with it. My mother knew over 200 folk songs. I grew up with my father's sound in my head. There's a picture of me in the crib listening to him. When I play, always there's the connection with my parents. Everything I'm feeling, happy or sad, goes into it. It's like breathing to me. I still think I have a natural approach that you can't really learn."
She checks the time, then snaps her black viola case shut. "If I had a dollar for every guy who says, 'Is that a machine gun?' or 'Why don't you play the piccolo?' I'd retire." Maybe it has something to do with the Et Vous cutoffs and high black satin pumps she wears, too. "Bass playing women have it worse."
Zap. Ms. Haffner heads for Carlos Franzetti's apartment to choose numbers for their new CD on the Chesky label. She started the eight-member Orquesta Nova with Mr. Franzetti two years ago so they could explore "the non-'Girl From Ipanema' side" of Latin music -- the music of dance halls, brothels and silent movies. Mr. Franzetti's living room looks like a recording studio. He runs through a Cuban lullaby on the piano: "Bay-bah-bah-bah, bay-bo-bah-bah," then switches to a plaintive song that makes you feel like falling in love or maybe that you used to be in love and now you're getting philosophical about not being in love anymore and that even though it's raining out life with all its crazy emotional complexity is definitely worth living because you keep getting wiser, that kind of song.
"Yeah, yeah," Ms. Haffner nods. "I like it." She picks up her viola and, without sheet music, plays the song back to Mr. Franzetti.
 
Zing Went the Strings Of Her Viola
 Back uptown, 45 minutes before show time, Ms. Haffner grabs a bite at the Film Center Cafe, her favorite "hang." She got the "Guys and Dolls" job because somebody recommended her to Seymour Red Press, the orchestra contractor for the show. She didn't have to audition. With a master's from Juilliard, Ms. Haffner is a world-class sight reader. Coming cold to a jumble of notes, she appears to play them perfectly.
"I have a list of the real good people in town," Mr. Press says. "I've never heard Juliet play solo, but she's got a good reputation."
Dick Behrke, a composer and conductor of music for commercials, has never heard her alone either. "She's on our list, though," he says. "You get the names from a concertmaster like David Nadien."
Mr. Nadien says: "I've never heard her solo." But, "she's a professional and a member of the union. It's possible some people may have heard her."
And Jerry Zaks? "She seems devoted and dedicated," says the director of "Guys and Dolls." "I've never heard her play."
Marin Alsop, music director of the Long Island Philharmonic, actually has heard Ms. Haffner: "Her sound is distinctive. Her playing has a lot of personality. Once, walking down the street at the Aspen Music Festival, I heard music coming from a window and I knew Juliet was there."
 
Into the Pit At 'Guys and Dolls'
 Ms. Haffner checks her watch again. She races to the Martin Beck Theater, where, deep underground, past a steel door, there is a dingy gray area, the orchestra locker room. She shifts gears. Her energy level escalates. She smiles a Loretta Young smile, big, white, with dimples like parentheses and, tres gaie, introduces the guys: "Ray Beckenstein, saxophonist extraordinaire . . . Roger Wendt, French horn extraordinaire . . ." A man wanders around half-dressed. Musicians lounge, doing crossword puzzles, sipping Diet Cokes. Two men fiddle with a closed-circuit television and another readies 300 pounds of dry ice for pumping "smoke" onto the stage. "Five minutes!" the stage manager shouts.
Ms. Haffner climbs upstairs to the pit, a hole that has earned its name. Twenty-six musicians are hunched beneath the stage, invisible to most of the audience. The only place Ms. Haffner can put down her chocolate mints is by her foot. The walls are cinder block, wires all over the place. The modern cure for everything is everywhere: duct tape. There's a photo of Paul Newman glued to the wall. A metal net dangles two feet above. "The pearl catcher," Ms. Haffner explains. "During 'Take Back Your Mink,' when Adelaide rips off her pearls, the players were getting hit."
At 8:10, the conductor hikes his pants. "This is it," Ms. Haffner whispers. Lights dim. Edward Strauss raises his baton and dives into the overture. He sings along, hops, makes inverted O.K. signs, laughs, flamencos, goose necks, punches air, davens and flings his arms like Maurice Curry in his "Intro to Tap" class at the 92d Street Y. From the pit, you can't see anything on the stage, not even feet. "It's like listening to the radio," Ms. Haffner says, "only louder."
Her big moment comes during "Adelaide's Lament," a two-bar solo. She rocks sideways when she plays. You see sound in her face. Sometimes her eyebrows go pizzicato. In an orchestra, Ms. Haffner says, the viola "provides harmonic color, the inside voices of a chord." Yet when she is onstage, "I'm in another world, a deeper space. It's beyond thinking about the music. You're embraced by it. It takes over."
Between numbers, notes get passed, checkbooks get balanced, letters get written. A pregnant violinist loses herself in an article entitled "On Breeches and Twins at Home." Part of the brain stays alert to vocal cues. When one of the characters declares ". . . he will not be a gambler," the players drop what they're doing, pick up their instruments and launch into "I'll Know." When a number is loud, they use earplugs. When it's louder, they bounce in their seats, synchronized, like the Nairobi Trio. They crack each other up. Ms. Haffner suggests a new category for the Tonys: "Best Choreography in the Pit."
The music seems smooth, even though on this particular night seven subs are playing. There are eight "Guys and Dolls" performances a week. The latest contract lets the musicians miss four of them. Every night Edward Strauss looks down and sees faces he's never seen before.
It's a week later. Ms. Haffner has to find another sub for the show. She's booked her other group, the one that plays American jazz, for a New York Mercantile Exchange dinner at the Waldorf.
Originally, this group was an all-female quartet called the Satin Dolls. Then Ms. Haffner met a violinist named Andy Stein and wanted him to join. The Dolls wanted to split all decisions four ways. Ms. Haffner wanted Andy. "I call the shots," Ms. Haffner says. The Dolls became a sextet called the New York Strings. Now both her groups are all men. "There's a certain sexual energy when you're playing an instrument," she says, "when you're having this kind of dialogue. I think that's part of it. And men are much more relaxed and straight ahead. I'm speaking generally."
Even groups made up of people who have to find subs have to find subs. The Strings have two tonight. Everyone shakes hands, violating the Never Shake Hands on the Bandstand rule. You're supposed to look like you play together all the time.
Ms. Haffner smiles and jokes, despite the fact that the Starlight Roof has only delivered one chair for six people. "They always say everything will be there but it isn't," she says, shrugging. In a tiny black sample suit a mother would call "smart," Ms. Haffner deals firmly with the hotel staff as 350 commodities dealers funnel into the ballroom. The head of the exchange starts talking about "triple nine fixes" and, finally, the chairs come. The Strings burst into "S'Wonderful." Nothing prepares you for a big-band 30's tune played swing style on strings. It's quirky and high-spirited. You don't know whether to swirl like Fred and Ginger or do-si-do.
People eat through speeches and talk through music. The Strings don't seem to notice. "The dinner's the thing here," Ms. Haffner says. "At Carnegie Hall, people pay to listen. But in clubs, you play, the blender makes daiquiris. The greatest jazz musicians in the world earn their living that way. Even Mozart had to go in through the kitchen."
 
Yellow Birds Don't Fly With Orquesta Nova
 It's rehearsal time. As Ms. Haffner's substitute gets ready for the Martin Beck Theater, Orquesta Nova, a chamber group dedicated to Latin American music, plays Astor Piazzolla's wistful "Milonga del Angel." They segue into "Tango for Astor," which sounds more like Tweety chasing Sylvester. This is not the kind of music you hear on the beach sipping Yellow Birds out of coconuts.
"Everyone thinks South American music is people running around with bananas on their heads," says David Chesky, who, along with his brother, Norman, produces the group's CD's. "It's not."
The first CD didn't make any money, but Mr. Chesky is not worried about the new one, "Salon New York." He leaves Ms. Haffner and Carlos Franzetti alone. "People of their caliber, you don't tell what to do."
Orquesta is a good-looking group.
"That's why I pick 'em," Ms. Haffner says, laughing.
Juliet Haffner is not what you'd call "struggling." She doesn't have to pile into a car and drive to Vermont for $200 gigs anymore. No more nursing homes or hostile maitre d's who make you stand in the hall. If she played every performance of "Guys and Dolls," she would gross $47,216 a year. Asked if she'd like to do a Broadway show again, she says: "Not if it's like 'Les Miz.' " Why not? "Let's just say," she notes carefully, "I prefer the tunes of the 30's, 40's and 50's." Ms. Haffner plays what she wants to play. People call her. She has recorded Broadway original-cast albums and the soundtracks for 28 movies. Still, as the synthesizer takes over, she'd have to be numb not to feel it.
"Ten years ago, 70 percent of commercial music was composed for acoustic instruments," says Mr. Behrke, the composer-conductor. "Today, it's 25." The synth is to music what diet shakes are to dining: they fill you but you don't feel satisfied. It's quicker, easier music, the Black Death of sound.
"Computers don't need health insurance," Ms. Haffner says in her "What can you do?" way. "The American Federation of Musicians can't say, 'Don't use a synthesizer for esthetic reasons' or 'You need 50 string players on this date or we'll strike.' "
 
Two Freelance Gigs Make a Quiet Day
 It's 10 A.M. Ms. Haffner adjusts her headphones at a recording studio. She's got a Ponderosa restaurant spot, 22 seconds of original music with an eight-second musical logo, or tag. The orchestra runs through the piece. It sounds like they've been playing it since birth. It's call-to-action Movietone News music. Picture thousands of steaks marching, proud of their beefdom.
"Lots of secure, arrogant rhythms, please," says Mr. Behrke, and the musicians run through it one last time. Everybody's happy. Client is happy. Agency is happy. Producer is happy because client and agency are. Ms. Haffner will get $80, plus another $20 if it plays within 13 weeks of being recorded. It's a pretty quiet day for her. Only two freelance jobs. Not that she has any trouble hopping from Mozart to Gershwin to sirloin. "I think about what the sound is like," she says, "what needs to be said."
On the street, viola in hand, she fades into the crowd. Off to Weill Recital Hall? Clinton Recording Studios? The New York State Theater? When Ms. Haffner crosses her ankles to play, you see them. There they are: pink parabolas, rubber taps on the soles of her black satin shoes. If you've ever wondered what kind of person needed those, now you know.

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
Translating Diversity Into High-Tech Gains

BYLINE: By Michael S. Malone; Michael S. Malone writes frequently about Silicon Valley from Los Altos, Calif.

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif.

 BODY:
TWENTY years ago, when Silicon Valley was just beginning to boom, the electronics industry was notorious for being composed almost exclusively of white male engineers born in the U.S.A.
Times have changed. 
 "It's a very dynamic situation," says Marian Stetson-Rodriguez, president of LinguaTec Inc. of Sunnyvale, a 13-year-old company founded to help Silicon Valley companies improve cross-cultural communications.
"You can go into a company around here nowadays and find people from Tonga, South Korea and Romania working side by side. And even appearances can be confusing. We have people who look African-American but are from Somalia or Suriname. I know of one manager who looks Chinese and has a Chinese name, but speaks perfect English and comes from Argentina."
The increasingly multicultural business community is the result of the migration of professionals and other workers, largely from Southeast Asia, India and Mexico, to the high-tech mecca that is Silicon Valley. It offers a glimpse at the opportunities and challenges that the rest of American industry may soon face, as demographers estimate that white males will become a minority in the work force at the turn of the century. But for technology executives now, the change has already meant new thinking about managing a diverse work force and new programs to better understand it.
The polyglot pandemonium is greatest at companies, like chip fabricators, disk drive makers and PC assemblers, that have large manufacturing lines. These include Intel, Hewlett-Packard, Apple, Silicon Graphics, LSI Logic, Quantum and Conner Peripherals.
But perhaps the most extreme case is the Solectron Corporation, an assembly company in Milpitas. A couple of years ago, the company surveyed the backgrounds of its 3,200 employees and found 30 nationalities speaking 40 languages and dialects. As confusion, even tension, mounted from cross-cultural signals, Solectron instituted a landmark cultural awareness program.
The man behind the program was William Yee, Solectron's vice president for resource development and civic affairs, who has taken a year's leave to help the United Way with similar problems. Born in Santa Barbara to Chinese immigrant parents, Mr. Yee was, by his own description, a "banana: yellow on the outside and white on the inside."
A veteran of I.B.M., Memorex and Apple, Mr. Yee came to Solectron assuming, he said, that he would bring "understanding and empathy" because of his Asian background. Instead, he said, "what I discovered was that, even though I grew up in that world, after 30 years in industry I had lost that perspective."
Mr. Yee discovered how little he knew about his own culture almost from the first day on the job. Calling together a group of managers, most of them Asian immigrants, Mr. Yee announced his training ideas in typical American pep-talk fashion. Everyone nodded in agreement. He easily remembers the moment: " 'Any questions?' I asked. None. 'O.K., great!' I said, 'Let's go do it!' And nothing happened for three months.
"It turned out that nobody had been willing to disagree or ask a question in front of their peers," he said. "I had to go out and establish communication links on an individual basis." One of his first programs taught employees to be more forthright in expressing opinions.
Glen O. Toney is corporate vice president of human resources at Applied Materials Inc. in Santa Clara, which has a work force nearly as diverse as Solectron's and a major division in Japan that conducts daily videoconferences with the home office.
"What I've learned," Mr. Toney said, "is that people have different approaches -- a different logic, in fact -- but all can produce results. But you have to learn patience and improve your listening skills."
"And it's more that just listening," he added, admitting that he comes away physically and mentally exhausted from his video meetings with Japan. "You have to combine their words with their unique cultural context and then derive a meaning from those variables. Listening becomes quite intense."
The irony of his experience is not lost on Mr. Toney, one of the few African-American executives in Silicon Valley: "You learn to value the ideas of people unlike yourself."
Edward T. Hall, a cultural anthropologist, has written of the importance of two cultural types. He divides cultures by the way they view time -- as either fixed (monochronic) or flexible (polychronic) -- and by what they emphasize in personal interaction -- either explicit information (low context) or subtler signals, like status and timing (high context). The problem often comes because most United States executives are low context/monochronic, while their foreign-born employees are typically high-context/polychronic.
Ms. Stetson-Rodriguez adds these suggestions for bosses:
First, create a level playing field. With so much diversity, there is a tremendous risk of sending mixed messages. Go for simplicity: "Companies with the strongest and most consistently communicated corporate culture -- those that provide a consistency in their expectation of performance -- have generally dealt with this change the best."
Second, in communicating with employees, develop a strategy of patience and clarification. Let the employee get to the end of what he or she is saying. Give no signals of approval or disapproval. Then repeat back or summarize what you've heard to make sure you've got the message. Reward assertiveness.
Third, and perhaps most important, "understand what your own culture is doing to color the interactions you get into. Too many American executives say, 'I'm normal.' If you can get objectivity on your own culture as affecting your actions, attitudes and assumptions, you are already halfway there."

HEADLINE: U.S. Acts Inconsistently on Macedonia

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your report of the arrival of American ground troops in Macedonia is a reminder of serious contradictions in Clinton Administration policy toward that republic and its civilian population ("Balkan Update," July 6). American military participation in the "Macedonian tripwire" follows by only a month the imposition of a de facto embargo on certain products made in Macedonia and consigned for the United States market. 
 The United States and United Nations now embargo all Macedonian goods produced for Serbia and Montenegro. Although Serbia is Macedonia's largest trading partner, it has complied with that embargo. Any United States policy that further punishes Macedonia for cooperating with an American and United Nations-led embargo is counterproductive.
The two policies taken together -- military protection on the one hand, economic punishment on the other -- show clearly that the Clinton Administration has not organized coherently the political, trade and economic components of its Macedonia policy.
Why will the Administration deprive of a livelihood the same lives it will risk American soldiers to save?
On June 3 the Committee for the Implementation of Trade Agreements, an obscure creature of the United States Commerce Department, told Macedonian factories and workers: you can't ship some 200,000 men's and boys' wool suits produced for American buyers.
The committee's policies are conditioned by the domestic textile and apparel complex, whose officials meet regularly with their Government counterparts in the Commerce Department. The Clinton Administration's eagerness to accommodate the textile and apparel protection lobby prevents it from recognizing the importance of offering economic support to Macedonia. One form of economic support -- which, incidentally, won't cost taxpayers a dime but will result in consumer savings -- would be rescind the backroom trade agreements committee embargo.
Those 200,000 suits are not going to make a discernible difference in the United States balance of trade. But the wages paid to make those suits will feed families in Macedonia and will help support the United States mission to preserve Macedonian life and social order. The Clinton Administration must reverse its embargo on wool suits as an important first step in shaping a coherent Macedonia policy.

HEADLINE: JAPANESE REJECT OLD GUARD BUT SPLINTERED VOTE MEANS A STRUGGLE FOR A COALITION

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, July 19

 BODY:
Thirty-eight years of single-party rule by the Liberal Democrats ended in elections on Sunday, but the party retained enough seats to insure a struggle for command of the Government with a new generation of opposition leaders.
The loss, the party's biggest since it was created with American backing in 1955, was a measure of the tremendous discontent with the scandals and influence-peddling that have plagued the conservative incumbents for five years. Voters flocked to three new parties made up largely of defectors from the Liberal Democrats. 
 Together the new parties seized more than 100 of the 511 seats in the powerful lower house. The Liberal Democrats won 223 seats, 33 shy of the majority needed to guarantee control.
 
The Other Big Loser
 In another sign of the shattering of the old order, the Socialists, Japan's largest postwar opposition party, suffered a crushing defeat, losing nearly half their seats.
Early this morning each leading candidate in the fractious two-week campaign declared victory.
The Liberal Democrats said they would seek to extend their reign, and this afternoon Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said that he would not resign his post, as least until a new Parliament is convened within a month. Asked whether he would seek another term as Prime Minister, he said he would "if I have the support of the party."
In the other corner, Tsutomo Hata, a leader of the Japan Renewal Party, called on the Liberal Democrats to step down gracefully "with the regular procedures of constitutional government."
Leaders of all parties immediately assured the public that there would be no major changes in policy, including Japan's approach to the United States.
 
Well, Now What?
 But no one could confidently predict what kind of coalition would finally be stitched together, or even from what party a prime minister would be drawn. There were many predictions that whatever government emerges, it will be so fragmented that elections will have to be held again within a year to consolidate the opposition groups.
"We are entering a new era, a coalition era," said Morihiro Hosokawa, the head of the Japan New Party. "It will be a very, very difficult time." The party's creation last year began to break up the political glaciers that have ground against each other throughout the cold-war era.
But if the country was at a critical turning point, it was difficult to see on the streets.
On a drizzly Sunday at the tail end of rainy season, only about 67 percent of the country's 93 million registered voters, a low turnout by Japanese standards, cast ballots in the 129 legislative districts, some of which hold more than one seat.
That may reflect the mixed feelings of voters who say their anger at corruption is tempered by their fear of economic uncertainty.
The Liberal Democratic leadership played to those fears throughout the campaign, spinning out scenarios of economic ruin, power failures like the ones in the Philippines and Italian-style street crime if the governing party lost power to an untested group.
Political analysts said the negative campaigning struck a deep chord in the instinctively conservative electorate, and probably saved the Liberal Democrats from far more damaging losses.
On Sunday night the results were barely counted when leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party began hinting in television interviews that they were preparing to dump the 73-year-old Mr. Miyazawa.
 
Liberal Democrats Stand Firm
 The secretary general of the party, Seiroku Kajiyama, whose efforts to delay a political reform bill last month touched off a revolt that forced the election, said he would start negotiations immediately with smaller parties on an alliance that would "fulfill the people's will to allow the L.D.P. to continue as the ruling party."
But in several different statements this morning, Mr. Kajiyama appeared to be trying to edge Mr. Miyazawa out of office. Several party leaders were quoted in the Japanese press as saying that the Liberal Democrats stood no chance of attracting another party to ally with it while Mr. Miyazawa, whose popularity ratings have been in the single digits, remains in office.
Both opposition politicians and many of Japan's influential newspapers hailed the end of what they called the "1955 regime," under which the Liberal Democrats became a permanent, increasingly corrupt ruling party and the Socialists a carping, ineffective opposition.
 
'A Sweeping Transformation'
 "Our country's political structure has undergone a sweeping transformation," Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest daily, said in an editorial this morning. The Liberal Democratic Party, it said, "should consider the fact that the splitting of the conservative camp into multiple parties offers a good opportunity for the party to purge itself of its dependency on money power and other evils."
The election essentially left the Japanese political system divided into three major camps, with the Liberal Democrats remaining the largest faction.
In addition to the 223 seats the party won, it has access to more than 15 votes from independents with strong ties to the party. Three times in the past, such firm allies have enabled the party to achieve a majority in Parliament even when it fell short in the polls.
 
Lining Up Coalitions
 While the Liberal Democrats retain far fewer seats than the 275 they won in 1990, the party appears better situated than any other group to form a minority government, albeit one that party leaders concede would be weak.
Because a fifth of the party's members in the lower house bolted in mid-June, abandoning Mr. Miyazawa during a crucial vote of confidence, the election resulted in a net loss of only four seats, according to a reckoning by Mr. Kajiyama, who declared the results Sunday a victory.
The second major camp consists of a loose alliance of five opposition parties that had hoped to freeze the Liberal Democrats out of power. But they took only 195 seats, and many experts doubt whether such a coalition can attract and hold enough allies to form a government.
Included in that opposition camp are the Socialists, who won only 70 seats, a stunning setback from the 136 they took in 1990.
It also includes the Japan Renewal Party, whose chairman, Mr. Hata, a former Finance Minister, led the revolt against Mr. Miyazawa. Ignoring critics who said his party was old Liberal Democratic wine poured into new bottles, Mr. Hata's group turned in a remarkably strong performance, claiming 55 seats.
Mr. Hata is frequently mentioned as a possible successor to Mr. Miyazawa, assuming his opposition coalition holds together.
Early this morning a beaming Mr. Hata appeared at a news conference with Ichiro Ozawa, the brooding political strategist who operated behind the scenes to pull off the defection from the Liberal Democrats.
But Mr. Ozawa said little: party officials still feel that his long service as the political lieutenant to the ruling party's fallen power-broker, Shin Kanemaru, makes him a risky public presence. Mr. Kanemaru goes on trial this week on charges of tax evasion.
 
Little Guys With Muscle
 The third and perhaps most strategically important camp is also the smallest: The Japan New Party and a like-minded group that broke away from the Liberal Democrats last month and formed Sakigake, or the Harbinger Party. They took 48 seats.
They have not declared what coalition they will join, and their swing votes will probably determine which party rules and who serves as prime minister. Both the Liberal Democrats and the other opposition groups are expected to court them heavily.
"The question is, who can form a coalition that will last," said Yasanori Sone, a political scientist at Keio University. "But the thing to remember is that the whole Japanese political system has changed. This is just the first step in a broader political realignment, and it may take years."
The political upheavals resulting from the election, however, began immediately, over the question of the next prime minister.
 
Loss of a Monopoly
 Under the old political regime, that question was solely the province of the Liberal Democrats. The party's many factions competed to promote their leaders, usually striking deals behind the scenes that involved spreading the spoils of office to the party's many constituencies.
This time, factional politics is irrelevant, and what only a year ago was the largest faction, headed by Mr. Takeshita, is virtually wiped out.
Under the Constitution, the prime minister must be selected at a special session of Parliament within 30 days of an election. If a prime minister is not selected on a first ballot, then the two top vote-getters compete in a runoff.
Among the names being talked about within the Liberal Democratic Party are Toshiki Kaifu, who was ousted as Prime Minister two years ago for promoting political reform too ardently; Michio Watanabe, a party elder and former Foreign Minister who had to resign because of what is believed to be a terminal illness, and Masaru Gotoda, 78, who is widely respected as a clean politician. Several younger members of the party are also vying.
Among the opposition leaders, Mr. Hata and Mr. Hosokawa, of the Renewal Party and the New Party, seem to be the leading candidates. But it is unclear how much support they could garner from other members of the coalition. Mr. Hosokawa said Sunday that he expected his group to put up "one candidate in the first round."
 
Once Shunned, Now on TV
 If anyone needed a sign of the changed center of power in Japanese politics, it was evident Sunday night at Mr. Hosokawa's New Party headquarters, on a back street in Tokyo.
Last year Mr. Hosokawa, a former governor of Kumamoto Prefecture on Kyushu Island and a direct descendent of the samurai family that once controlled that wealthy region of Japan, complained to an American reporter that the Japanese news media would not take his ideas or his rebel party seriously.
On Sunday his headquarters was jammed with television cameras, and every five or ten minutes he appeared on a different network as questioners sought to find out where he would throw his newly won votes. Like any good Japanese warrior, he bowed deeply and let on nothing of his plans.
For many Japanese, the struggle will be a remarkable sight, unlike anything Japan has seen since the raucous days just after the end of the United States occupation of Japan. But a third of today's population was not yet born when the Liberal Democratic Party was formed, with covert support from Washington. A stable party in America's pocket was considered vital to the anti-Communist cause.
 
Sliding Out of Power
 Over the years, though, the party grew bloated and corrupt. The Recruit scandal in 1988, which led to Mr. Takeshita's resignation, was the first sign that party members were selling influence on a huge scale, and using the proceeds for both their personal fortunes and their campaign coffers.
There were promises of reform, but they were never fulfilled. Mr. Gotoda, the Liberal Democratic leader, suggested in an interview a few weeks ago that if the party had dealt with the Recruit scandal right away, it might not be facing the loss of power today.
In 1989, Recruit cost the party control of the less powerful upper house of Parliament for the first time. The upper house, which has no say in the Government budget, can still block or slow other legislation.
The fervor faded and the party recovered in 1990, but the scandals never seemed to end, each revealing a new layer of collusion between Japanese companies -- often small concerns trying to break into markets here -- and the political world.
 
Reform? What Reform?
 Bribes took on vast proportions. In the latest investigation, into a scandal involving a transport company called Sagawa Kyubin, there was yet another layer: the party, it was alleged, hired organized crime figures to silence critics of Mr. Takeshita shortly before he took office in 1987.
But endless promises of reform led nowhere.
Mr. Miyazawa vowed to pass a reform bill this spring, but was stymied by Mr. Kajiyama and other prominent conservatives who had little interest in upsetting the status quo. Mr. Kajiyama seemed to bet the issue would go away; he bet wrong. The issue became a rallying call for reformers, who broke with the party, and it led to Mr. Miyazawa's downfall.

HEADLINE: Cheap Beeps: Across Nation, Electronic Pagers Proliferate

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
At the Countryside Mall in Clearwater, Fla., parents cruise the stores as their children nap or play games at the mall's child-care center. What happens if one child bites another, complains of a stomachache or begins to sob inconsolably?
Scott Kaufman, who heads the center, can instantly dial the number of the hand-held pager that the parents are given as part of the child-care service. Hearing the beep, mom or dad knows to scurry back. 
 "Parents love the beepers," Mr. Kaufman said. "They're not out of touch."
 
 
Many Uses
 Millions of other Americans have adopted paging technology for all sorts of uses beyond the popular stereotype of the beeper as a tool for doctors, plumbers and drug dealers. Nationwide, nearly 53,000 people a day are signing up for paging service, which can cost as little as $7 a month in fees. The devices start at less than $60.
In 1990, 9.9 million pagers were in service in the United States, according to Economic and Management Consultants International, a Washington firm that specializes in paging issues. By the end of this year, the number is expected to reach 19.2 million. And, the firm predicted, by 1997 the nation would probably have more than 33 million pagers in use.
Commonly known as a beeper, for the sound it makes when activated, the device is a simple radio receiver that in most instances is assigned its own telephone number. When the number is called from a telephone, the call goes to a special radio-transmitter network that sends out a signal to the designated pager. Typically, the signal displays the phone number of the person seeking the paging subscriber.
Among those who swear by their pagers is Victor Bishara, a real estate agent in Highland, Calif., near San Bernardino. Blind since infancy, Mr. Bishara has been able to work through Braille computer printouts, special software for drawing up real estate contracts -- and a pager programmed to alert him whenever a client leaves a voice-mail message on his office telephone.
"Consultation is critical to my job," said Mr. Bishara, whose real-estate business is now hectic after a long fallow period during the recession. "Pagers give my clients instant gratification when they have a question."
Paging service will probably change in the near future, from a passive one-way device to a two-way send-and-receive system that in many cases could serve as a lighter and cheaper alternative to desktop or portable telephones. Sophisticated beepers may soon be able to send faxes and remotely check for electronic messages on an office computer.
"This is a very exciting time for the paging industry," said Terry L. Scott, the president of Paging Network Inc., which is based in Plano, Tex., and is the largest paging concern in the country, with 2.6 million subscribers. "Pretty soon you'll have an answering machine and fax machine that fits in your pocket."
One reason for the beeper boom is that in a country where most college-educated adults have trouble programming their videocassette recorders, the pager is the ultimate user-friendly device.
Small but telling improvements have also helped build demand. Some units silently vibrate instead of emitting a head-turning beep in movie theaters and restaurants. And some models, not yet widely adopted, can function as little billboards that display not only phone numbers but also brief text messages or information services like stock quotations. These are more expensive, selling for at least $200.
Manufacturers including Motorola and NEC America make pagers as thin as credit cards, as well as see-through pagers in so-called fashion colors like Sizzling Yellow and Vibra Pink to attract younger consumers. Once sold mainly through specialized shops, pagers are now widely available, not just in telephone and consumer electronics stores, but also at Wal-Mart, Service Merchandise, Walgreen's and their rivals.
 
 
Operating Costs
 With $2.2 billion in revenue last year, the paging business is still dwarfed by the $8.8 billion in annual revenue for the cellular industry, even though in 1992 paging had 15.3 million subscribers and cellular had 11 million. The paging industry takes in less because it charges less. Its operating costs are much lower than those of the cellular industry, which also uses radio waves to distribute its signals.
Because paging messages use only short bursts of data, rather than the continuous stream of voice conversations of cellular phones, many more customers can simultaneously use a given swath of radio frequencies. For each 10 seconds of one cellular conversation, the paging network can carry more than 100 numeric messages.
Paging networks are also cheaper to build than cellular phone networks. The Mobile Telecommunications Technologies Corporation, known as Mtel, a national paging company based in Jackson, Miss., estimated that in a city like Dallas it costs $500,000 for enough transmitters and equipment to carry paging services with the capacity for 300,000 subscribers. It would take up to $10 million for cellular equipment for a comparable number of voice customers, the company said.
Consumers have benefited from robust competition in the paging industry. In a given metropolitan area, dozens of competing service providers may be vying for customers.
 
 
'Falling Prices'
 In the 1970's, when the industry was much smaller and still mainly a plumbers-and-doctors business, pagers cost about $300 and monthly service fees ranged up to $50. Today only the most sophisticated devices capable of receiving text cost more than $300. Most cost much less and many can be leased for only a few dollars a month. And the average monthly bill for paging service has fallen to about $17 for people who own their pagers and $23 for those who lease them.
There is far less competition in the cellular phone industry because when Federal regulators established the cellular networks, they licensed only two companies in each metropolitan market. The idea was to give companies the incentive to invest the larger sums required for building the systems.
Of course, paging is still a rather limited technology. Motorola's top-of-the-line pager, the Advisor (list price $349), can hold up to 40 short messages, each of which can be displayed on a four-line screen. But sending such messages evokes the days of Western Union: callers dictate their messages to an operator, who then types the message into a special transmitter for dissemination over the pager network. In these systems, callers to any beeper on the system dial the same number, and the messages are dispatched by the operators through switching systems.
 
 
Federal Approval Process
 To speed up the process and eliminate operators, pagers would have to become two-way devices, which is likely to be the end result of a lengthy Federal approval process under way. Last month Mtel received clearance from the Federal Communications Commission to develop advanced pagers that could send and receive but would require more radio frequencies. A system might be operating by 1995.
Mtel already operates Skytel, the largest nationwide paging service, with about 218,000 subscribers in the United States. With its next-generation pagers, Mtel envisions a system in which a caller would receive confirmation that a paging message had been received -- something that is not possible with the current technology. The devices might also be able to capture and play a short voice message, which would be a boon to the blind, like Mr. Bishara, the real estate agent.
Or pagers might someday be merged into cellular telephones. Mtel and Motorola recently agreed to field-test a new phone that incorporates paging. Few cellular customers give out their cellular phone numbers because subscribers must pay for incoming as well as outgoing calls, an expensive proposition.
But with a pager phone, especially one that displays both text and numbers, an inexpensive pager message might say, "The boss is calling," so the subscriber can scurry to take the call -- or choose to ignore it.

HEADLINE: After Chavez, Farm Union Struggles to Find New Path

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COACHELLA, Calif.

 BODY:
Three decades after Cesar Chavez founded the United Farm Workers, which brought hope to thousands of impoverished laborers, the union is struggling for survival.
From the lemon groves in this desert community to the tomato fields outside Stockton in the San Joaquin Valley, many workers today toil under conditions not seen since the charismatic Mr. Chavez first took up their cause in a series of hunger strikes, boycotts, marches and protests in the 1960's and 1970's. 
 Mr. Chavez's death in April has thrown the organization into a leadership crisis that compounds an identity crisis that already existed: Should it spend its money and energy seeking support from middle-class consumers, or should it be in the field organizing and fighting on behalf of workers?
 
Boycott Ineffective
 Indicative of the union's lack of momentum is the fact that few Americans know that for the last six years it has been urging consumers to boycott grapes and that in that time grape sales reached record levels.
The union began the boycott to get grape growers to limit the use of pesticides. It contends that the growers use more "cancer and birth-defect causing pesticides" than any other California industry.
But the apparent ineffectiveness of the boycott has led some of the union's supporters to worry that Mr. Chavez may have left behind little more than his name. While that name is being liberally applied to things like streets, parks and holidays celebrating Mr. Chavez's birthday, these testimonials provide little for the workers on the front lines of the nation's food supply.
"You've really got abysmal conditions, conditions that are as bad as at any time in the post-war era," said Clete Daniel, a professor of American labor history whose book "Bitter Harvest" (University of California Press, 1981) records the California farm labor movement.
"It's hard to see any vestiges of the achievements of the 1970's," Professor Daniel said. "If you know all the struggle and sacrifice that occurred in the course of building the farm workers' union and see how few lasting gains have been achieved, it's very, very discouraging."
 
Economy in Slump
 The United Farm Workers today reports about 10,000 members, down from more than 70,000 in the 1970's. Illegal immigrants from Mexico and Central America, more willing to work in spite of low wages and poor conditions, have diluted the union's strength. And it does not help that the California economy remains in a slump despite an improving picture elsewhere in the nation.
While the union faces such large problems, conditions in the fields have become nearly as grim in many cases as they were before the union wrought improvements.
For example, union officials say, because of lax enforcement, children are again illegally being put to work harvesting crops and some growers are paying $2 an hour or less, in violation of Federal minimum wage laws. The labor contractors who supply growers with groups of workers in return for fees charge the workers exorbitant rates for rent, transportation and food. The infamous short-handled hoe, which forces workers to stoop for hours, has reappeared in some fields despite being banned by California law, and there are growing reports of sexual harassment of female workers by growers and labor contractors.
In addition, the union has been hit with a $2.9 million legal judgment resulting from an Arizona case in which a grower accused union leaders of illegal tactics in a boycott of the company's lettuce. The award could bankrupt the union, which has $2.5 million in assets, but U.F.W. officials say they are optimistic that it will be overturned on appeal.
 
Challenge for New Leader
 Confronted with so many problems, can the union's new president, Arturo Rodriguez, succeed where his father-in-law, Mr. Chavez, ran into obstacles.
"I alone could never think of replacing Cesar Chavez," Mr. Rodriguez said in an interview. "He's just an extraordinary human being. But I have a great team of people to work with. The rest of the leadership of the organization is very dedicated, very committed to wanting to see Cesar's dreams come true."
Mr. Rodriguez said Mr. Chavez's death, in a paradox, had helped the union, creating a resurgence of interest in it and in the welfare of farm workers. Many people, on learning of the boycott of table grapes, have volunteered to help promote it, he said.
In Los Angeles, officials recently agreed to rename Brooklyn Avenue, a main thoroughfare in heavily Hispanic East Los Angeles, Avenida Cesar Chavez. A new center for Chicano studies at the University of California at Los Angeles will be named for Mr. Chavez. The California Senate recently declared Mr. Chavez's birthday, March 31, a state holiday, and city leaders in Delano, Calif., Mr. Chavez's home and the site of the union's first headquarters, renamed a park for Mr. Chavez despite years of tension between the union and city officials.
"You would never believe that in Delano, Calif., you could go before the City Council and get any support for us," Mr. Rodriguez said. "And yet all of those things are becoming a reality for us. There's a tremendous rebirth taking place."
 
Some Gains Seen
 It remains to be seen whether interest can be sustained, and whether Mr. Rodriguez can translate the current revival of interest in the union into tangible gains in the fields. Already, some are complaining that Mr. Rodriguez is putting too much emphasis on public relations and not enough on organizing workers.
Mr. Rodriguez said the union had learned from experience that support from consumers was essential to bringing growers to the bargaining table. Thus a good part of the organization's resources are being spent on mailings, bumper stickers, buttons and videos to persuade people to stop buying grapes. Still, growers continue to report record harvests and sales.
"The fight needs to be conducted in the fields where the workers are," Professor Daniel said, "but more and more the effort is addressed to this boycott, to consumers and environmentalists and to people interested in the use of pesticides and the use of toxic chemicals in growing our food."
Experts said the union's primary message in the current boycott -- that pesticides threaten the health of consumers -- has not struck home in the way that public anger over farm working conditions fueled the successful boycotts of the 1960's and 1970's. And a new political climate combined with shifting attitudes toward unionism in general has not helped.
David Duarte, a 28-year-old native of Mexico, is a worker whom the union has helped. He earns a basic union wage of $5.25 and has health benefits, unemployment insurance and worker's compensation, thanks to a union contract.
Despite poor health and a cramped living situation -- he shares an apartment with his parents and seven siblings -- Mr. Duarte is grateful for the U.F.W.
"We have security," he said in Spanish during a recent union rally here. "We have stable work, and we have rights."

HEADLINE: Daley Is Bluntly Criticizing Clinton

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 11

 BODY:
Before the Illinois primary last year, Bill Clinton was so solicitous of Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago that he was defensive about his overtures. "I was not buttering up the Mayor!" the future President declared.
These days, no one, certainly not the Mayor, is accusing Mr. Clinton of buttering up Mr. Daley, a Democrat who has presided over the nation's third-largest city since 1989. 
 If anything, Mr. Clinton has brought only bad news to Mr. Daley and his brother. And the Mayor has responded with very blunt, and very public, critiques of the President.
In his harshest outburst, a few weeks ago at an impromptu gathering with reporters, Mr. Daley accused Mr. Clinton of breaking promises, not coming through for political allies and, perhaps most cutting of all, losing his political focus. "If he keeps backing off, the people will lose confidence in him," he said. "People want a strong leader. You have to stand for something."
 
Frustration in Other Cities
 Mr. Daley's remarks could be dismissed as lingering bitterness from a man whose younger brother was passed over for a Cabinet post. But they also reflect frustration with the White House even from Democrats whose cities stand to get far more attention than they did under the recent Republican administrations. While they were not as direct as Mr. Daley, several members of the United States Conference of Mayors at the group's annual meeting in New York last month chastised the President for not keeping his promises to cities.
Mr. Daley is not nearly as potent a force in national Democratic politics as was his father, Richard J. Daley, who ran what was considered the last large political machine in the country.
Though overshadowed by his father's storied political history, Richie Daley is not without power. While he did not endorse Mr. Clinton before last year's Illinois primary, he gave Mr. Clinton a much-needed boost, appearing with him at a press conference here. And the political skills of his brother, William Daley, a Chicago lawyer who ran the Clinton campaign in Illinois, were viewed as crucial in winning the state for Mr. Clinton in November.
 
Tension Over Cabinet Post
 The tension began in December, with word that William Daley would not be named Secretary of Transportation, a job that even Clinton aides agreed that he had been led to expect. Mayor Daley may have figured he could take solace in Federal financing for 1,000 new police officers in Chicago and $66 million in Federal block grants he anticipated Mr. Clinton would channel here. But when the President's plan to give the economy a quick boost was scuttled in Congress, such hopes vanished.
The last straw came in June when a protege of the Mayor, Richard Devine, was passed over for United States Attorney in Chicago. Acceding to the wishes of the two Illinois Senators, Carol Moseley Braun and Paul Simon, Mr. Clinton picked James Burns instead.
The next day, this city's plain-speaking Mayor could not hide his frustration with his President. "I don't care about appointments," he told the group of reporters. "I don't need appointments. What I need is money to put people to work and money for health-care programs and educational programs, which we were promised."
A few weeks later, sitting behind the desk that his father used when he ran this city for 22 years, Mr. Daley had cooled off. He insisted that he was not bitter over what happened to his brother, and that he understood that it was only custom for the President to nominate the Senators' choice.
 
No Regrets From Daley
 But the 51-year-old Mr. Daley, known for his political instincts, offered no regrets for what he viewed as a constructive assessment of a President whose success he wants.
"I just said: 'You have to make a decision. You have to get on with it,' " Mr. Daley said. "Because four years goes by very quickly. I was just sending a message. Basically, get your house in order."
It is a message that no doubt was heard in the White House, where Mr. Daley, who has maintained reasonably high popularity ratings, is considered an important ally.
Mr. Daley is "very important because he's somebody who really speaks for and has the political instincts of the average taxpayer in the city of Chicago," said David Wilhelm, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, who twice served as the Mayor's campaign manager. "Earning his continued support is important. Illinois was always just a rock for us. We need to keep it that way."
 
Trying to Smooth Relations
 So it was no surprise that Mr. Clinton sought to smooth things over with the Mayor's 45-year-old brother, inviting Bill Daley to play golf recently and appointing him to the board of the Federal National Mortgage Association Board.
David Axelrod, a close adviser to Mayor Daley who also worked for the Clinton campaign, said the Mayor's frustrations were largely based on his high expectations after 12 years of Republicans in the White House. "To reduce whatever frictions there have been to issues involving his brother would really be off base," Mr. Axelrod said. "There's 12 years of pent-up needs boiling out here and elsewhere."
Indeed, during an interview in his office here a few days ago, Mr. Daley could barely contain his impatience about the new Administration and how things get done or, more aptly, don't get done in Washington. Again and again, he returned to the theme of decision-making, offering practical advice from a hands-on manager.
Sounding much like Mr. Clinton's gadfly, Ross Perot, Mr. Daley derided Washington as a "company town" that has gone bankrupt. "Washington breeds incompetency," he said. "The more you stay in Washington, the more you're out of touch with reality."
 
Push for Improvement
 There is little polish from Richie Daley. No rehearsed lines. Ask him what Mr. Clinton should do to improve his operation, and he replies with a burst of suggestions, some, perhaps, naive: "A lot of things. First of all, I think the whole White House thing should be reorganized into a different system. He has the whole system that Bush and Reagan and Carter and Nixon created and kept it going. He needs more than one chief of staff. It's impossible!"
He did not, however, address the down side of having several chiefs of staff, like building more of the bureaucracy and poisonous competition that he said was destroying the Government.
And for someone so willing to give counsel, Mr. Daley seemed at times oddly out of touch. Asked whether David R. Gergen, the much publicized White House addition as Mr. Clinton's counselor, was a wise addition, Mr. Daley was speechless. Then he asked, "The Supreme Court?" Finally, an aide told Mr. Daley who David Gergen was.
Nevertheless, Mr. Daley says with confidence that he knows who could best run the Federal Government. "Mayors," he said, "see what can work and what cannot work. They see it on a daily basis."
What about Governors? Mr. Daley's reply may not please the former Governor of Arkansas: "They're too far removed."

HEADLINE: Politics Can Change Rapidly but Economics Can't

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, July 19

 BODY:
When President Clinton came here two weeks ago, he sensed a historic opportunity and pressed more aggressively than any of his predecessors for a breakup of the collusive forces that have made Japan such a frustrating market for United States companies.
Sunday's election did shatter the old political order, which was dominated by the conservative Liberal Democratic Party, but there was little immediate prospect that the economy would be thrown open to the same bracing jolt of change, or that Japan's trade surpluses would begin to shrink any time soon. 
 It could take years for United States companies to reap economic benefits from the upheaval because no party won a clear majority, and thus the prospect is for unstable coalitions and more frequent elections.
 
The Terms of Battle
 Sunday's election had been cast as a battle waged on numerous fronts, a conflict between the old generation and the new, a struggle to shed institutions designed for the cold war, an attempt to purge the governing Liberal Democratic Party of endemic corruption. Some even characterized it as a battle between the old tilt toward producers, which was based on the powerful alignment of interests between Government and business, and a new emphasis on consumers' interests.
The idea that consumers ought to be given the benefit of open markets and inexpensive imports was at the heart of President Clinton's pitch, as when he told a group of university students here, "You have a common cause with the people of America." Change, he insisted, "would benefit both of us."
One fact the election results have borne out is that the old leftist opposition forces are near collapse; the real struggle for influence is within an expanding, if fragmented, conservative movement.
 
Change, Yes, but Slowly, Slowly
 Though three new conservative parties emerged in the past year, each trying to distinguish its policies, they share certain assumptions with the Liberal Democrats about the basic strengths of the economy and why change has to be slow and careful.
"The outcome of the election this time will not affect trade relations in any meaningful way," said Takashi Inoguchi, a professor of politics at Tokyo University. "It will take some time. Any change is likely to be piecemeal."
For instance, the most powerful new party is the Japan Renewal Party, led by a former Finance Minister, Tsutomu Hata, who has called in vague terms for economic deregulation and decentralization.
But when he was asked directly last week if he thought the time had come to break the "iron triangle" that bound politicians, business and Government in a collusive embrace and that left consumers paying some of the highest prices in the world, he commented, "Producers are consumers, too, and we cannot forget their interests."
 
Common View on Security
 In some respects, the election results could draw the United States and Japan closer. On security issues, the Government has supported American policy for decades, but it has had to tread carefully for fear of inflaming the pacifist passions of the leftists in Parliament. Now, all the leading parties are conservative, generally favoring a strong security relationship with the United States and an active role for Japan in international affairs.
Thus, whether the Liberal Democrats remain in power as part of a coalition or not, the loudest opposition voices will be largely pro-American on security issues.
But President Clinton has stressed repeatedly that economic issues have replaced security and political concerns as the basis of the relationship, and so the new Government's trade policies are likely to be scrutinized with the greatest care by Washington.
The problem will be the pace of change. Japanese politicians and Government officials generally accept the fact that the trade surpluses are too large and that the regulatory regime that discriminated against outsiders has to change. The new conservative parties have pressed these themes with more energy than the Liberal Democrats did.
 
Fixing Domestic Economy First
 But the economy is stuck in a recession. With companies already vulnerable and profits plummeting, the Government is unlikely to open markets to fresh competition that could worsen the situation and risk Japanese jobs.
In addition, the bitter political struggles for power that are expected could leave the next several governments weak, making it even more difficult for politicians to override the overwhelmingly nationalistic instincts of the bureaucracy, the engineers and keepers of Japan's unusual economic system.
It could also mean that both the governing and opposition parties that emerge will be loath to upset potential contributors, with the prospect of another election in less than a year.
A key problem is the recession. The Government pushed through two big fiscal-stimulus packages in the past year, but they have had only a modest impact. Washington is demanding that the Government take further action swiftly: the faster the Japanese economy grows, the more imports it will absorb.
 
How to Spend Money
 While the bureaucrats in the Finance Ministry have been willing to increase public-works spending to try and jump-start the economy, they have staunchly refused to consider a tax cut, which would put money into the pockets of consumers. United States officials have been urging Japan to give consumers a tax break rather than pump money into the business community with contracts for new roads, bridges and sewage-treatment plants.
This could prove an early test of the pace at which the old assumptions that drive Japan Inc. will come into question, and how much benefit President Clinton will really reap from the political changes here.
Seiroku Kajiyama, the secretary general of the Liberal Democrats, still the largest party in Japan, seemed to anticipate such questions when he commented Sunday evening, "Any changes must be made within the framework of stability."

HEADLINE: As Campaign Warms, Dinkins Manager Is Cool, Calm and Directed

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Four years ago, Bill Lynch led David N. Dinkins to victory against a battle-weary Democratic incumbent -- and then on to become New York City's first black Mayor -- by coaching a hungry team of liberal outsiders from a Times Square building so seedy that his staff shared elevators with porno actresses between scenes.
The knock on him then: He was a roly-poly former labor organizer who was always behind schedule, refused to delegate or share strategy, and had never run such a big campaign. 
 Today Mr. Lynch is marshaling the Mayor's re-election effort from a 32d floor aerie in the polished Art Deco corridors of the old McGraw-Hill building on West 42d Street. The knock on him on now: He is a disorganized former deputy mayor who is always behind schedule, refuses to delegate or share strategy, and has never run a campaign to re-elect such a battle-weary incumbent.
"I took it then, I'll take it now," Mr. Lynch said evenly last week, shaking his head just a bit. "What I've got to be careful about is that it doesn't make me lose focus."
This potato farmer's son from the East End of Long Island is used to disproving his doubters, but he has surely never faced a bigger job. Mr. Dinkins is locked in a virtual tie in the early polls with his old Republican-Liberal opponent, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has been biding his time and building support.
The Mayor has to defend a tenure that happened to coincide with the worst national recession in half a century, in which the city lost some 400,000 jobs and City Hall repeatedly scrambled to keep the budget balanced with gum and toothpicks.
Having won in 1989 by two percentage points with a fragile multi-ethnic coalition on a promise of racial healing, Mr. Dinkins has been called to account for periods of violence in Crown Heights and Washington Heights. He is struggling to woo back defecting supporters, especially Hispanic voters who are now moving to Mr. Giuliani in large numbers.
 
A Blunt Approach
 Last week, under growing pressure, Mr. Dinkins sharply stepped up his criticisms of Mr. Giuliani, attacking his record as a prosecutor and accusing him of ducking the issues. It was an unusually blunt approach for any incumbent this early in an election -- especially for the circumspect Mr. Dinkins -- and a testament to the Mayor's challenge.
Mr. Lynch, who left his job as a deputy mayor to help run the Clinton campaign in New York State last year and then went on to the Mayor's campaign, knows the rap from friends and critics alike: The Mayor is insulated by the perks of power and doesn't see the people enough; he is too defensive in the face of criticism; the campaign is writing off skeptical white voters and counting on building up black turnout to win. Mr. Lynch just doesn't seem to be doing enough.
"I really think that the race is still the Mayor's to win, and there are many people who want him to," said City Councilwoman Joan Griffin McCabe, who represents a diverse district in Brooklyn that includes the Hispanic areas of Sunset Park, the housing projects of Red Hook and the gentrified brownstones of Park Slope -- all spots where the Mayor needs to do well. But she complains that Mr. Dinkins has not been visible enough.
 
Where Is the Mayor?
 "These people want to see the Mayor visit their neighborhoods, walk their streets, stop into their delis and their bodegas," she added. "That's all they want to do. They want to see that the Mayor cares about their blocks."
Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge of the Upper West Side, strong Democratic and Dinkins turf, said her campaign workers this month had trouble getting voters to sign nominating petitions with Mr. Dinkins's name on them. "He's become so inaccessible, he's almost regal," she said. "You don't see him around. You see him on TV, which is unfortunately often in the evening and in a tuxedo. It is not an image of strength."
Some backers wonder whether Mr. Lynch is doing all he can to counteract these perceptions. "I don't see the evidence as to lots of sophisticated strategic thinking," said one strong Dinkins supporter, speaking on condition of anonymity. "Maybe it's all happening. You wouldn't necessarily expect to see it yet."
Such criticism of his boss's style hurts and baffles Mr. Lynch, who is responsible for making the most of Mr. Dinkins's strengths and minimizing his weaknesses. He ticks off a week's schedule of the Mayor's appearances to show that he is hardly in hibernation but stressing his incumbency and the powers that go with it.
 
The Long View
 It also seems likely that Mr. Lynch has been playing a bit of possum. He was willing to concede to Mr. Giuliani a moment of excitement and a wave of publicity in May when Mr. Giuliani persuaded Herman Badillo, the city's most prominent Hispanic politician, to drop out of the Democratic mayoral primary and run for Comptroller with Mr. Giuliani instead.
Mr. Lynch has always preferred the long game and he is banking on luring Democrats home to the Mayor's side in November by linking Mr. Giuliani to 12 years of Republican economic policies that hurt the city.
Only one criticism seems to really incense Mr. Lynch: the suggestions that the Mayor is writing off white voters. At the mention of that, he grabs a sheaf a computer runs and begins thumbing through tallies from 1989 in mostly white districts where Mr. Dinkins lost, but racked up respectable showings.
They include Councilman Anthony Weiner's district in the Midwood, Flatbush and Sheepshead Bay neighborhoods of Brooklyn, where Mr. Dinkins managed to pull 22 percent of the vote, or Councilman Jerome X. O'Donovan's on Staten Island, where Mr. Dinkins took 32 percent.
"I'm not letting those go!" Mr. Lynch said, jabbing his finger onto the page for emphasis. "I think we might be able to do even better."
Part of the problem may be that Mr. Lynch does much of his best work very quietly. Two months ago, while Mr. Giuliani and his chief strategist, David Garth, were wooing Mr. Badillo, Mr. Lynch was busy with shuttle diplomacy of his own: across the Triborough Bridge to Representative Thomas J. Manton, the Queens County Democratic leader.
Mr. Manton was angry at a lack of access and jobs for party faithful at City Hall, so Mr. Lynch arranged a rapprochement with the Mayor. The unspoken gain: Mr. Manton leaned, hard, on his old friend, City Council President Andrew J. Stein, to drop out of the race, leaving Mr. Dinkins a clear march to the nomination, with only a token fight from Roy E. Innis.
"People say, 'What's he doing?' " Mr. Lynch said of his critics. "I think the record now shows what we were doing last spring: getting the kind of support we needed. As we move forward to the fall, I hope the same question will be asked and that the answer will be as clear."
 
Accentuate the Positive
 Just as he did four years ago, Mr. Lynch is concentrating on field work, backed by the Mayor's allies in organized labor, to turn out his core supporters, while preparing a broad appeal to New Yorkers through television commercials created by the Washington-based media consultants Robert Shrum and David Doak.
No one is talking yet about what those advertisements will say, but it's not hard to guess that they will emphasize the Mayor's having seen the city through tough times largely intact, while eking out small improvements around the edges, like increasing library hours to their maximum levels in half a century, hiring thousands more police officers and seeing declines in all major categories of reported crime.
Even the Mayor's critics say such a message, properly delivered, could have strong appeal.
"A large bloc of moderate and liberal Democratic voters are looking for a reason to support him, and so far he hasn't given them one," said Councilman Weiner, who acknowledges that he has been at odds with the administration for months. "But he has some salvageability. Even in areas where he is unpopular, no one is that thrilled about Rudy Giuliani."
The Rev. Al Sharpton, who met last week with the Mayor to complain that he hasn't given enough attention to energizing his black supporters, said: "I think the Mayor needs to do a crash reading of "A Tale of Two Cities' and divide his time between Manhattan and the outer borough communities -- black, Jewish, Latino, all of them. He's not in the churches, he's not in the housing projects, and unless he gets the message down there, the people are not going to reach up and grab it."
 
$100,000 in Small Bills
 Mr. Lynch says he is listening, but he is also just keeping on. There are stops to make, speeches to write and money to raise -- next at 200 small house parties on Tuesday night, at which each host has been asked to raise $500 or more from friends.
It's a Lynch event, with a new touch. At the last house parties, on the night of the Academy Awards, the telephone conference call hookup was so faint that most guests could not hear the Mayor. Now Mr. Lynch has a typical low-tech solution: For $300 he has bought 15 minutes of time on WWRL-FM, and the Mayor will address the guests over the air.
"We're colored," said Mr. Lynch, smiling softly at one of the self-mocking references to his race and aw-shucks reputation that he delights in using to catch his detractors off guard. "And smart."

HEADLINE: STUDIES SAY SOOT KILLS UP TO 60,000 IN U.S. EACH YEAR

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18

 BODY:
Several studies have concluded that tens of thousands of deaths are being caused in the United States each year by a form of air pollution that for the most part falls within current legal limits: tiny particles of soot that are inhaled.
Rough calculations emerging from studies at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Harvard School of Public Health suggest that 50,000 to 60,000 deaths a year are caused by the particle pollution, a far larger number than any other form of pollution and one that rivals the death toll from some cancers. 
 The deaths occur mostly among children with respiratory problems, people of all ages with asthma and the elderly with illnesses like bronchitis, emphysema and pneumonia.
 
Sources of Particles
 The new findings, disclosed gradually over the last two and a half years, will require environmental scientists and industries to re-evaluate their approaches to air pollution, and will probably require the Federal Government to rewrite its standard for particle pollution. The troublesome particles are mainly thrown into the air by industrial plants, with a small proportion coming from the exhausts of diesel vehicles.
Paul Portney, vice president of Resources for the Future, a not-for-profit environmental research group, said that of the $35 billion a year the nation spends for all its scrubbers, catalytic converters and other air-pollution control efforts, only a fraction is directed toward the small particles, which are 10 microns or smaller in diameter. (By comparison, a human hair is about 75 microns in diameter.)
Only one-third of all air pollution expenditures go to remove particles, and most of that goes to decades-old efforts like devices on power plants that catch only particles larger than 10 microns in diameter.
 
Need to Review Standard
 Regulatory effort has been focused more on other types of pollution, like ozone and sulphur dioxide, that have been shown to damage health; it is uncertain whether they cause death. It is believed that indoor air pollution like second-hand cigarette smoke and radon cause the greatest health damage among pollutants, apart from the particles. Each is estimated to cause 5,000 or more cancers a year.
Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who heads the House Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment, said: "The E.P.A. must now undertake a thorough review of the particle standard. The agency under the Bush Administration never even got started with the legal requirements that this standard be reviewed. By law it should have been finished last year."
Ronald H. White, director of environmental health for the American Lung Association, said the evidence for deaths due to particle pollution was now great enough that the association would soon sue the E.P.A. in hope of getting the agency to revise its standard and begin stricter enforcement of it.
But some scientists say the evidence is not yet good enough to make policy decisions. The evidence is based on epidemiological studies, which cannot conclusively establish a cause-and-effect relation between a substance and its health effect; for that, detailed biological studies of the effect of substances on the tissues themselves are needed.
Dr. Jonathan Samet of the University of New Mexico said: "What is missing is understanding the biological basis of the effect they are describing. We shouldn't make major policy decisions about causes of death based on the kind of evidence we have so far.
"The effects are not massive, not like the London fog of 1952 in which thousands of people died, but are more subtle. Before we make the big decision to control particles more, with the costs of doing that, we need to fill out the story more. We need to do actual exposure studies with people to see how particles affect them."
Dr. Samet said he believed that there still might be other ways of explaining the deaths linked to pollution -- for example, combinations of factors like respiratory illness, coming with a heat wave, at the same time as a pollution episode.
 
'Need for More Data'
 Rob D. Brenner, chief of policy in the E.P.A.'s air pollution office, said: "We have a real concern about the new data. If it turns out that recent analyses show that particles are the much more significant problem than they seemed to be, our efforts to control particles and our acid rain initiatives will not be enough. We will have to do more." But he added that there was now a debate within the agency about what to do.
The E.P.A. missed last year's deadline to review and update the particle standard. It appears that unless a significant policy change occurs soon, the delay will continue for some time.
"One of the things we feel on the research side very strongly is the need for more data," said Dr. Peter W. Preuss, the E.P.A.'s director of policy for the Office of Research and Development. But because of limited manpower in agency laboratories, he said, "I'm not sure we are going to do any of that research soon."
In early budget estimates, the E.P.A. has not set aside money to review the particle standard for the next fiscal year, but the agency is planning to spend $10 million to revise the ozone standard.
Particles have been among the most obvious and longest-known forms of pollution. During times of stagnant air, the particles make a haze or fog that blankets cities or rural valleys. Such pollution has been recorded as early as the 17th century in England. Among the most famous episodes was the London pea soup of 1952 that killed 4,000 people in a few days.
 
Difficult to Study
 But particle pollution has been relatively neglected and difficult to study. Particles of all kinds are in air, so the polluted substance that must be studied is "urban air," a hodgepodge with clumps that vary in size and chemical makeup and that change from one location to another and from day to day.
This makes for a messy experiment when researchers try to expose animals to "urban air" in a laboratory. In addition, it has been difficult to separate the components of air pollution because sulfur dioxide, ozone and soot all tend to be pumped into the air together and are present when samples are taken.
Thus, until now, particle pollution has been relatively neglected while other types of pollution like ozone and sulfur dioxide have been much scrutinized.
The discovery that particles are the worst type of air pollution was eventually made because of several coincidences.
There is believed to be only one place in the United States that has a very large amount of pollution that is made up almost entirely of particles, while being low in ozone and sulfur dioxide. In this place, Utah Valley, there is only one large source of pollution, a steel mill, which was operated continuously for years, then shut down for a year because of a strike, and then turned on again.
Because the area has long had hospital admission records and others computerized, the Utah Valley has become sort of an experiment designed specifically to discover the effect of particle pollution.
Into this ready-made experiment came Dr. C. Arden Pope 3d, an environmental economist at Texas A & M University who moved to Provo, Utah, a few years ago.
 
Brown Cloud in the Sky
 "It was clear that Utah Valley had a pollution problem," Dr. Pope said. "I could see it in the air: in the winter time there is a combination fog and smog, sort of a brown cloud hanging in the air."
Dr. Pope checked hospital admissions before, during and after the steel mill strike, and compared those to the level of small particles in the air. This kind of pollution is the most worrisome because it can be breathed into the lungs; it consists of particles 10 microns or smaller in diameter.
He saw that the admissions to the hospital for respiratory-related illnesses like pneumonia and asthma jumped 50 percent to 90 percent during the times the particle pollution was above 50 micrograms of breathable particles for each cubic meter of air, and dropped when the plant was closed and fewer particles were in the air. The Federal Government's standard does not consider air hazardous until it reaches 150 micrograms of such particles per cubic meter.
At the E.P.A., Dr. Joel Schwartz, the lone epidemiologist among scores of toxicologists, noticed the report, which was published in The American Journal of Public Health.
Dr. Schwartz also found that another scientist, Dr. Douglas W. Dockery of the Harvard School of Public Health, had carried out studies of daily pollution levels in six Eastern cities. There, the particle pollution had been measured every day, an unusually good record since the Federal Government requires only one measurement a week.
Soon the three scientists were working together, carrying out their own studies in Utah; Steubenville, Ohio, and Philadelphia, as well as digging up data from other cities.
 
Decline in Lung Capacity
 In Utah, further studies found that children's breathing, as measured by a spirometer, was reduced when particle measurements were high: they lost about 6 percent of capacity if the pollution went up to the legal limit of 150 micrograms. They found a decline of about 3 percent in lung capacity of adults for each 100 micrograms measured in the air.
The three scientists also found that the death rate in Utah rose in proportion to particles in the air, on a steady slope in which each 100 micrograms of particle pollution increased the death rate 16 percent.
The pollution during this period was steadily below the legal limit, and averaged 47 micrograms, less than a third of the Federal standard.
They also found that particles were directly linked to health effects and the increasing or decreasing of ozone or sulfur dioxide were not.
 
Steady Rise in Deaths
 The scientists also noted that the effects of high particle levels were noted immediately, on the first day of high levels, and trailed off after several days of lower levels.
In Steubenville, from 1974 to 1984, they found a steady rise in deaths of 4 percent for every 100 micrograms of particle pollution, at the same time no association was found with ozone pollution.
In St. Louis, deaths increased 16 percent for each 100 micrograms of particles, and in a study in East Tennessee, deaths increased 17 percent for each 100 micrograms. In both these studies, death rates were increased somewhat in association with sulfur dioxide and ozone, but at levels far smaller than the association with particles.
One of the largest studies, looking at particle pollution and deaths between 1973 and 1980 in Philadelphia, found that deaths increased about 7 percent for each 100 micrograms of particles, and 5 percent with each 100 micrograms of sulfur dioxide.
All of the studies were designed to take into account other factors that might have explained lung problems, including other pollutants, smoking, and extremely hot or cold weather.
Despite the apparent large threat of particle pollution, Dr. Schwartz said he was optimistic that the E.P.A. could reduce the pollution with relatively small economic damage to the country.
"If we consider how much protection we can get for our money, we can do a lot with a relatively small investment," Dr. Schwartz said. He said that taking particles out of smoke stack emissions was relatively cheap, and some newer devices like "bag houses," filter-lined bags like vacuum cleaner bags, now can draw as much as 99 percent of particles out of the air without companies having to expend great sums on catalytic converters.

HEADLINE: For Microsoft's Rivals, It's a Question of Fairness

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 16

 BODY:
Is the software industry leader Bill Gates accountable to a higher authority? Look for an answer this week, when the Federal Trade Commission is expected to consider longstanding industry complaints that the Microsoft Corporation competes unfairly.
For years rivals of the Microsoft have groused publicly and privately that the company and its chairman, William H. Gates, have used hardball tactics to dominate the software business. They say Microsoft has unfairly leveraged its near monopoly in personal computer operating system software, linking it with sales of its spreadsheet, word-processing and other application software that faces greater competition. They also accuse the company of nefarious pricing schemes. And they even contend that Mr. Gates has inserted devious code into his programs to make non-Microsoft programs incompatible with the company's products. 
 But proving these charges has been difficult.
 
February Deadlock
 After investigating Microsoft for two years, the F.T.C. deadlocked in a February vote on whether to charge Microsoft with violations of antitrust laws and directed its staff to re-study the matter. A second vote by F.T.C. commissioners is scheduled for Wednesday, and industry executives expect another deadlock, even though the F.T.C. staff is said to have prepared a narrower case against Microsoft this time -- reportedly in hopes of persuading the commissioners to take action against the company.
Many in the industry believe that in February, the F.T.C. staff was recommending against Microsoft for its pricing practices. This time, many believe, the case may have been narrowed to the issue of whether Microsoft designed its popular Windows program to discourage customers from using a rival operating system.
There are four possible outcomes to the commission's vote: close the case, delay action once again, begin a formal investigation or file a criminal complaint.
In February the commission deadlocked 2-to-2 with a fifth member, Roscoe B. Starek 3d, recusing himself because of an undisclosed financial conflict. Now, industry executives say, if Mr. Starek continues to abstain from voting, the swing vote will belong to Mary L. Azcuenaga, a commissioner who joined the F.T.C. as a Reagan Administration appointee and was reappointed by President Bush. In the first vote, she was one of two commissioners voting not to take action against Microsoft, but primarily because she said she needed more information.
Despite her Republican background, Ms. Azcuenaga attended a "renaissance weekend" retreat last winter held by President-elect Clinton, and she is reported to have developed close ties to the Clinton Administration. And so, many in Washington and in the software industry will be watching Ms. Azcuenaga's vote as a possible indicator of White House thinking on the case.
For an Administration that says it is committed to supporting United States high-technology industries, Microsoft could represent a potent symbol -- though whether as an exemplar or a predator is a matter of debate.
"The United States software industry still holds 90 percent of the worldwide market," said Lucianne Painter, a financial analyst at Salomon Brothers. "Are you going to disrupt that kind of success story given what's going on with the economy?"
 
'I'm Very Concerned'
 And yet, Microsoft's success has raised feelings of deep bitterness in the computer industry, along with questions about how the company has consolidated its power.
"I'm very concerned about Microsoft's position and conduct," said Charles Ferguson, an industry consultant and author of a recent book on I.B.M. titled "Computer Wars." "There's substantial evidence that they are a ruthless and powerful company and that they skirt the margins of ethical behavior if not crossing them."
Mr. Gates was not available for comment on Friday because he was on a plane to Washington to meet with F.T.C. officials to defend his company. And his general counsel, William Neukom, was already huddling with the F.T.C.
Microsoft has consistently denied accusations of unfair dealing, and it has said that its strategy of offering steep discounts on its software when sold as a package of several products is a common practice in the industry.
The last few months have seen aggressive lobbying of the F.T.C. by Microsoft's competitors. The Novell Corporation, whose chairman, Ray Noorda, has been an outspoken Microsoft opponent, has led the opposition, employing two Washington law firms and, more recently, a well-connected Washington public relations firm, in an effort to influence the commission's evaluation of Microsoft.
 
Congressional Interest
 There has also been Congressional interest lately. On Tuesday, Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Monopolies and Business Rights, fired off a letter to the five F.T.C. commissioners as well as to Anne K. Bingaman, the head of the Justice Department Antitrust Division. He bluntly suggested that it would be a waste of the taxpayers' money to have spent three years investigating Microsoft only to wind up again with a tie vote and no decision.
"If the commission remains deadlocked," Senator Metzenbaum wrote to Janet D. Steiger, the chairman of the F.T.C., "I would strongly urge you to refer the case to the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division for an independent review."
But such a change in venue is highly unlikely, some longtime antitrust experts say.
"It's possible at some point an asteroid will hit the earth," said Art Amolsch, editor of FTC Watch, a Washington-based newsletter. "It's possible that this could get moved to Justice. We're looking at the same odds."
Mr. Amolsch said that if the Justice Department was to take up the case, Microsoft could cry foul. "It amounts to harassment if two agencies of the Federal Government successively investigate a company for the same issue," he said.
But already, the Microsoft issue seems to be a moving target. According to a number of industry executives, the original F.T.C. staff report focused on a variety of matters, including allegations that Microsoft engaged in "exclusive dealing" by pricing its MS-DOS operating system in such a way that compels its customers to use other Microsoft products.
Now the staff's comments to the commissioners appear instead to focus on Windows 3.1, a popular Microsoft program that works with MS-DOS.
Several industry executives said F.T.C. staff members have been questioning Microsoft about a small piece of software code in a test version of the Windows program. The code issued a warning when outside programmers tried to run the program with DR-DOS, a Novell operating system that is intended to be compatible with MS-DOS.
The warning said that the operating system had not been tested for compatibility with other companies' operation systems. The piece of software was left in the version of Windows that Microsoft shipped to the public in 1992, although it had been disabled so that the warning did not appear on users' computer screens.

HEADLINE: STRICTLY BUSINESS;
Sheepshead Bay at Odds on a Waterfront Proposal

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Of all the transformations and evolutions that New York City neighborhoods have undergone in the last century, few are as stark as that of Sheepshead Bay.
This is a place where Sousa played, where the wealthy raced horses, where at least one America's Cup-winning yacht was berthed and where the first trans-Atlantic phone call was placed. 
 But it was also the place where Robert Moses put the Belt Parkway, bisecting a community and leaving wounds that many think have never healed. Today, there are burned-out storefronts, rat-infested vacant lots and almost no place to park. Residents suggest a car-theft ring may be the most thriving local enterprise.
 
'This Is the Crossroads'
 Against that backdrop one might expect that a proposal to build a new Loehmann's store, a discount seller of high-quality women's clothes, would be welcomed with open arms.
But it hasn't worked out that way.
Loehmann's wants to build its store directly across the street from the fishing boat pier that provides Sheepshead Bay with a center of commerce and a sense of self. Supporters say it is the first good news in years, perhaps the last chance to reverse the neighborhood's decline. Opponents say it will kill the fishing boat industry, tourism and the neighborhood's special flavor.
"If being at the crossroads means more of nothing or the hope of something, this is the crossroads," said Jesse Masyr, the lawyer for the developer promoting Loehmann's.
Glistening just beyond the debate's edges is the hope of reviving one of the community's great treasures, Lundy Brothers restaurant. Though it closed 14 years ago, both supporters and opponents of Loehmann's envision different paths to reopening what the city Landmarks Commission in 1991 called "the last of the great seafood palaces."
"It would be like the Dodgers coming back to Brooklyn," declared George Pantelidis, one of five owners of the Spanish Colonial Revival building that once housed the restaurant.
Mr. Pantelidis, who is among the supporters of Loehmann's, believes that a project of its size could jumpstart Sheepshead Bay's stalled economy by making banks more comfortable about lending to others.
City and state development agencies have extended $3 million in loan guarantees to reopen Lundy's if Mr. Pantelidis and his partners can arrange the $10 million to $12 million in private financing they estimate will be needed to rebuild the restaurant. But he thinks the Loehmann's proposal is essential to obtaining the private loans.
Loehmann's opponents take the opposite view. They think Lundy's has a better chance of reopening if their vision of a quaint, city-subsidized fishing village materializes.
The foes of Loehmann's include environmentalists, planning purists, civic groups and businesses fearing the waterfront store development will come at the expense of other businesses a few blocks away. But the most vocal are the owners of so-called party boats, which take people on deep-sea fishing trips for $28 a day.
"Don't pull the plug on Sheepshead Bay," George Richford, president of the Sheepshead Bay Fishing Fleet, told the Board of Standards and Appeals, the city agency that will rule on Loehmann's request for a zoning variance. "Fish and women's clothes don't mix."
Loehmann's would be directly across from the boats at Emmons Avenue and East 21st Street. The developer, Anthony Clemenza, intends to charge the 85-store national chain a very low rent, using the store as an anchor to attract smaller stores at much higher rents a square foot.
"This is going to be the rebirth of the Bay," said Mr. Clemenza, who failed to secure city approval in an earlier effort to build a condominium complex on the same property.
 
Dispute Over Parking
 John Nikas, chairman of Community Board 15, which supports Loehmann's, says he has already received inquiries from a sporting goods store, boutiques and restaurants wanting to be near Loehmann's.
Opponents rail that a Loehmann's would destroy the community by swallowing up what few parking spaces remain for party boat patrons, kill other nearby retailers and obliterate any chance of the fishing village dream. Loehmann's says its plans include adequate parking, which it is prepared to further increase by moving to attendant parking to use space more intensively.
But foes also see the debate as an opportunity. "For heaven's sake, let's keep the community's spirit going," said Myrtle G. Whitmore, president of the Brooklyn Civic Council, a consortium of cultural, educational, civic and professional groups.
The most tangible evidence of this community spirit is a planning document prepared by the Bay Improvement Group and presented as a bound volume to a number of city agencies. The idea is to replicate the sort of waterfront developments done in cities like San Diego, Vancouver and Boston, not unlike a proposal Mayor Edward I. Koch championed unsuccessfully in the mid-1980's. Quaint stores would hew to nautical themes, kiosks would offer shells and saltwater taffy, signs would denote special crossing areas for fishermen, and so on. A rejuvenated Lundy's would be the piece de resistance.
All that is needed, said Steven Barrison, president of the organization, is for the city to kick in $10 million or $15 million to get things going.
The issue is all coming to a head at the appeals board, which has held one hearing and has another scheduled on Tuesday. The matter before the board is whether to allow a building of more than 27,000 square feet in a zone where 3,500 square feet is the biggest store allowed. A decision may take months.
While the fate of Loehmann's and Lundy's hangs fire, it is clear that residents have not given up on their community. One sign is the Sheepshead Bay Beautification Project, whose 200 members have raised $20,000 in small contributions.
Its first big projects is to paint fanciful murals on the plywood covering Lundy's shattered windows, in part to give an impression of local spirit.
"It's an old-fashioned barn raising," said Peter Romeo, president of the group.

The community agrees that reopening Lundy Brothers restaurant, called "the last of the great seafood palaces," would help revive Sheepshead Bay. Closed for 14 years, the doors are covered by a mural.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
The Long Bond's Magic Numbers

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
What will derail the rally that has carried the yield on the 30-year bond to its lowest level in 16 years, within a whisper of 6.50 percent? Not much, two market economists say.
John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, predicts that the long bond's yield will reach 6.50 percent soon, and then "grind" its way lower. But he thinks it will take some "unexpected event" to test 6 percent. 
 Neal M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation, is more optimistic. He is "holding out for 5.99 percent," which, he acknowledges, would not be significantly different from 6.01 percent. But sounding as though he was marketing his own forecast, he said that 5.99 percent sounds much more dramatic.
On Friday, news that consumer confidence fell in July and that industrial production declined two-tenths of 1 percent helped drive down the yield on the 30-year bond, the United States Treasury's benchmark credit instrument, another few notches. It finished the week at 6.54 percent.
 
Plenty of Encouraging Data
 For Mr. Lipsky, the force that would pull yields lower is an improvement in expectations about inflation. The market, he said, does not need more evidence that the economy is sluggish, or even more encouraging price data than was reported for June, when producer prices fell three-tenths of 1 percent and consumer prices were unchanged.
"If investors began to believe that current inflation rates were sustainable in the intermediate term," he said, "rates would fall further."
He could not think of an "unexpected event" that might push the yield below 6 percent. But if there were such a development, the way he thinks the market is now leaning -- against lower interest rates -- it would provoke a quick drop in rates.
Mr. Lipsky said many traders have been reluctant to believe that rates would continue to fall. "This has been a very grudging rally," he said. "It has been very cautious and the Street has been short," an allusion to traders' not buying bonds because they think that rates are already too low.
 
And for Lower Rates Yet . . .
 But he said developments like these would add to downward pressure on rates:
*Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, makes his semiannual report to Congress on Tuesday on the central bank's monetary policy. Mr. Lipsky thinks that Mr. Greenspan's testimony will reaffirm the Fed's anti-inflation emphasis. Approval of President Clinton's deficit-reduction package, including tax increases that would restrain the economy, would further reduce the threat of inflation.
*Congressional approval of the free-trade agreement with Mexico would reduce fears in general of the kind of trade protectionism that can lead to higher prices and higher inflation.
*Further currency turmoil in Europe and the expected further cuts in interest rates by European central banks could provide more pressure to lower American interest rates, as the Germans try to restart their slumping economy and keep the European Monetary System together. Both rate cuts and currency turmoil ought to help the dollar rise, he said, with a stronger dollar attracting foreign investors to the American bond market.
Mr. Lipsky has a caveat. He is worried that there will soon be a selloff in the market as it pauses for a normal correction after the strong price rise and yield decline took the market into rarely charted waters.
 
Federal Funds Rate Stability
 For Mr. Soss of First Boston, there are two forces behind his forecast of a 5.99 percent yield on the 30-year bond over the next six months. One is the continued sluggishness of the economy and the other is his belief that the Fed will keep short-term interest rates stable for longer than most analysts expect.
"The economy cannot get out of its own way enough to prevent rates from falling further," he said, "and the Federal funds rate is locked at 3 percent."
Mr. Soss is confident that economic growth is going to remain sluggish -- his estimate is an annualized 3 percent for the second half of the year -- because, he said, interest rates, after adjustments for inflation or for current expectations, are still pretty stiff. He noted that with producer prices three-tenths of a percent lower in June, financing inventories of goods entails a loss, making businesses reluctant to fill their warehouses and thus holding down production.
"Why hold anything in inventory if there is a negative carry?" he asked. "You can't have the exuberance of a speculative inventory, and that is why rates keep coming down."
 
Mortgages and Jobs
 He suggested that there was a similar problem with housing sales, despite the lowest mortgage rates in decades. People just do not have confidence that they will still have a job, that their salaries will be going up at the 7 percent rate now typical for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, or that the value of their house will rise enough to cover the 7 percent interest, he said.
On the Federal funds rate, Mr. Soss believes that the central bank will leave it at the current 3 percent, its level since September. The Fed uses this key rate, which is the interest charged on overnight loans between banks, to set its monetary policy.
A reason not to change the Federal funds rate, he said, is the sluggishness of current growth, with the economy apparently creeping along at an annual rate of less than 2 percent for the first half of the year. Two months ago, with fear of renewed inflation, many analysts were betting that the Fed would raise this rate by the fall.
In addition, there will be more reason to keep this rate stable because tax increases in the deficit-reduction plan and implied in a Clinton Administration health-care proposal will restrain potential growth.
"You've got a tax increase that will kick in just in time for Christmas," Mr. Soss said. "And then health-care reform to follow."

HEADLINE: Economists' Advice for Clinton

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Bill Clinton's promise to focus on the economy "like a laser beam" created great expectations among the nation's economists. But in the six months since his inauguration, many of them have been sounding increasingly disenchanted with his policies.
Some say the President promised and did not deliver. Others, who thought his can-do approach would bolster confidence and provide the economy with a catalyst, complain that uncertainties, backpedaling and prospects of much higher taxes have sown fear and confusion among business and consumers. 
 "We've moved from one President who seemed to be out of touch to another President who is also out of touch with what's needed in the economy," said Stephen F. Hiebsch, manager of economic research at the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company in Oklahoma City, who said he voted for President Clinton because of campaign promises to focus on business investment, education and the nation's roads, bridges and other support systems.
 
A Program Off Track?
 While some economists defend the budget now on Capitol Hill as a big step toward taming the Federal deficit, many complain that the economic program -- from the budget to health care to trade -- has veered seriously off track.
To be sure, economists are no less fickle than other Americans. Some of the unhappiness probably reflects disappointment in the President's limited power to get things done: to date, the Administration has found trouble getting its way in Congress. Paul Samuelson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a Nobel laureate in economics and a longtime Democrat, has said, "You've got a President with no influence."
Further, the Administration is stuck with an economy that, while expanding at a modest pace, is struggling to overcome the lingering effects of overbuilt real estate, military cuts and feeble growth in the rest of the world.
Still, said Richard T. Curtin at the University of Michigan, who tracks consumers' moods, "It's the lost opportunity that's frustrating." He acknowledged that the President cannot deliver fast-paced, 1960's-style economic growth, but said there was enough room "to move from a stop-and-go expansion to one that proceeds more steadily."
What do the economists want the President to do? Three themes emerge over and over again: pare or postpone tax increases while pushing for tougher, more enforceable spending caps; go slower on health-care changes, and push harder for the free-trade agreement with Mexico and Canada.
What many of them say they do not want, even if politically feasible, is to revive the $30 billion stimulus plan that was supposed to give the economy an immediate shot in the arm but was shot down by Congress earlier this year.
"Hands off would be better," said Alan Sinai, managing director of Lehman Brothers. "Let the economy work out the kinks. We're simply going to have to live with what growth the economy can produce."
Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University, said, "Most economists don't want the Administration to prime the pump, to just go out and spend."
On the budget, the concern is not only that a big tax increase could hurt economic growth next year, but that it would fail to bring the deficit under control.
Of course, the President's options are limited because the House and Senate have already passed their versions of the budget. But as the differences between the two versions are hammered out, he does have some room to press for smaller tax increases that would take effect at a later date than in the House version of the bill.
 
Calling the Whole Thing Off
 Some economists take an even stronger stand, urging the Administration to forget the current budget package. "The best thing they can do for the economy is to figure out a politically acceptable way to walk away from the program even if it meant less deficit reduction," said Ed Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence. Raising taxes, said Mr. Yardeni, is likely to weaken the economic recovery without necessarily solving the deficit problem.
Many of the economists in this camp, however, did not buy the original Clinton plan, and remain opposed as much for ideological reasons as for fear that the recovery is unacceptably weak.
Still, few economists are willing to go so far, largely because they fear that interest rates would jump if the Administration failed to get a deal. And because the broad outlines of both bills -- higher top income-tax rates and a 35 percent corporate tax -- are similar, they urge the Administration to tinker around the edges.
"The most important thing is to get the budget passed, and erase the uncertainty," said Laurence H. Meyer, who runs an economic consulting firm with that name in St. Louis. "You don't turn back."
In fact, he and others said the President's biggest impact on the economy so far has come not from programs themselves, but from the waiting.
"There's no question Clinton confusion is slowing the economy," said Mr. Ratajczak at Georgia State.
Worried that higher corporate taxes will undermine business investment in new plant and equipment, one of the few sources of strength in the economy, several economists want the Administration to minimize increases in the tax burden on smaller businesses.
"Even if it means a little less deficit reduction, the best package may be one that restores some of the growth provisions," said Jerry Jasinowski, an economist who is president of the National Association of Manufacturers. "If you have to make trade-offs at the margin, you are better off not increasing business taxes that will stifle growth and jobs."
Charles Wolf, dean of the Rand Corporation's graduate school and director of economic research at Rand's National Defense Institute in Santa Monica, Calif., said he would favor a bill from the conference committee that "has more of the investment incentives and less of just raising taxes."
At the same time, some economists are pushing for toughening the procedures in the budget for enforcing limits on spending growth. "It will help to have a President who says he supports the concept of spending caps and I'll be faithful to them," Mr. Meyer said. "That would increase dramatically the credibility of the whole thing."
Many economists say a Clinton health-care program is an even bigger source of uncertainty for most businesses because it may involve higher payroll taxes. There is growing sentiment among economists that the Administration should go slower on the issue -- and proceed with far greater care.
"This is too important to do fast," Mr. Meyer said. "We're changing health care. This is one of the most important bills in recent history, and it's only reasonable that it be a consensus solution."
Referring to the Administration's tough talk on health-care changes, Rudolph Penner, an economist at KPMG Peat Marwick and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, said: "Their first rule should be 'thou shalt do no harm.' People have been particularly careless; they have not been sensitive to the damage they can cause to businesses with remarks about price controls here and payroll taxes there."
Some economists also spoke of the potentially stimulative effects of increased trade, saying the President should be pressing harder for the North American Free Trade Agreement.
"I would like to see this free-trade agreement pushed real hard," said Mr. Hiebsch of Oklahoma Gas and Electric. "If free trade is good between Texas and New York and between Kansas and Oklahoma, I can't believe free trade wouldn't be good between Mexico, Canada and the U.S."
Diane Swonk, senior regional economist and vice president of the First National Bank of Chicago, agreed. "Nafta is our insurance policy that Mexico doesn't back off from its reforms," she said. "Without it, medium and small exporters get locked out. What we're hearing from our customers is that the uncertainty has already slowed a lot of momentum."

Electricity Consumption

 BODY:
The heat wave this month will raise overall electricity consumption in the region above last year's levels, according to utilities officials. Demand for electricity fell last year, after a rise the year before, a year that also had unusually hot summer. Three-fifths of that decline came in residential use, which is chiefly affected by use of air conditioners. Generally, the troubled economy has moderated residential usage, which rose through the 1980's as consumers bought larger homes, many of them with central air conditioning, and acquired personal computers, microwaves, color TVs and other consumer appliances.

HEADLINE: Cable Outduels Free TV

 BODY:
Congressional efforts to help broadcast television may be thwarted if the first two deals negotiated under last year's Federal cable law are any indication.
Congress was alarmed by the decline of free TV and eager to pump money to local TV stations. So it required cable operators to negotiate with broadcasters for permission to carry their signals. Now cable retransmits those signals for free. 
 But if Congress hoped to aid broadcasters, it created a peculiar mechanism for doing so. A sole cable operator would bargain separately with the network-affiliated and independent broadcasters in each region. Monopolists usually win such bargains, and the first two deals prove the point.
First, the Fox network signed a deal with Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable operator. Under the agreement, T.C.I. will continue to carry Fox broadcasts for free. But T.C.I. will pay Fox to create a new cable channel and Fox will also turn over some of the proceeds to its affiliates.
It's easy to get wrapped up in a game of whether cable or broadcasters won. But the important issue is whether viewers won. In this case, they have. Fox affiliates, many of which are small and struggling, get financial help and, in addition, viewers get a new cable channel.
But the deal announced last week between ABC and Continental Cablevision, the nation's third largest cable operator, is more troubling. Again, the cable operator will continue to retransmit signals without paying the network-owned broadcaster. And, again, the cable operator will pay the network -- ABC -- to create a new cable channel, in this case devoted to sports.
The deal should help the ABC network. But local affiliates come away with no money and may lose viewers to the new cable station. And more sports will probably migrate from free TV to cable. To a Congress that set out to help save free television, this deal is at best a mixed blessing.
The ABC-Continental deal delivers a potentially crippling blow to CBS and NBC in their coming negotiations. With ABC on the Continental system, the other two networks can hardly afford to withhold their signal in search of a big payoff. Again, Congress's will may be thwarted.
Negotiations continue between broadcasters and cable operators. The outcomes could turn sour for cable viewers if negotiations break down and one or more of the networks are dropped. But viewers will also lose if local broadcasters don't come away with cash or other economic benefits and free TV continues to slide. Over-the-air TV -- with its coverage ranging from traumatic events like the Kennedy assassination to entertainment like the World Series -- is an important social glue that binds Americans together.

HEADLINE: At Home Abroad;
The Edge Of the Wave

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: HONG KONG

 BODY:
Here and elsewhere in East Asia the visiting American feels as if he is at the edge of an enormous wave of growing prosperity and power. We know about the economic success of Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea. But to see it up close -- to see how far and how fast it has come -- is astonishing.
Just a few decades ago, Hong Kong was a place filled with struggling refugees from Maoist China. Today the annual per capita income is $18,000, moving past that of Britain and other European countries. People live longer here than in the United States, and infant mortality is lower. 
 Hong Kong has some of the most architecturally arresting skyscrapers anywhere, notably Norman Foster's Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank.
Hong Kong's businessmen and bankers are moving heavily into China. Last year Hong Kong money accounted for 60 percent of all foreign investment in China.
China is the great question that looms behind the dazzling sights of Hong Kong and the rest. It, too, has had phenomenal economic growth in the last few years. If that continues, and the present inflationary overheating of the economy can be controlled, one can easily foresee East Asia becoming the leading force in the world economy. Japan would be only part of a larger success story.
But of course the question about China is more than economic. It is political: Can the People's Republic, still nominally professing Communism, allow the degree of autonomy needed for an innovative society? Will the Government hold to the course of reform to a market system; or may it, in fear of losing power, launch one of the waves of brutal repression that have occurred periodically since the revolution?
Uncertainty about China is a factor in just about everyone's life here. For Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. And despite the great mixing of money and people in recent years -- 20 million crossings to China last year from Hong Kong, which has a population of less than 6 million -- profound differences remain between the two societies.
"We speak a common language, and we share a common history," said Christine Loh, whose family has been in Hong Kong for five generations. "But we are worlds apart.
"China is in some ways a medieval country. They are still trying to grow by edict. We are modern, professional, international. China now has no sense of its own moral values: nothing but get rich quick. We in Hong Kong do have a moral basis, the values of the rule of law."
Ms. Loh is an unusually outspoken person in a place where many are already muting their voices for fear of offending Beijing. A highly successful businesswoman, she was appointed by the British Governor, Chris Patten, to Hong Kong's Legislative Council. Did she think she would still be there after 1997? I asked.
"If I am," she said, "they will be allowing a few cats to meow. The Legislative Council will be the loyal opposition in Hong Kong if we have our promised 'autonomy.' Beijing will have to learn that opposition is not counterrevolution."
But was there any real chance that Beijing would allow that kind of vocal opposition?
"Yes," Ms. Loh said, "if Beijing wants Hong Kong to be the engine of growth, the merchant banker for China. It's what the world defines as 'autonomy' that matters. If the world regards Hong Kong as just another part of China, why should it continue to have preferential status in GATT and 30 other international arrangements?"
Ms. Loh supports Governor Patten's plans to make the Legislative Council modestly more democratic, which have aroused Chinese fury. But she is skeptical of British intentions.
"No matter how engaging Chris Patten is," she said, "is he ever going to be more than a tragic hero? He may be let down by his own Government. The British want to exit honorably. In order to do that they have to have a punch-up with China. When that has gone on long enough, they may just say, 'We tried.'
"But we in Hong Kong have to overcome our own fears, and a tendency towards self-censorship. If it doesn't work, this is not the place to live. Some people have already voted with their feet. I think we have to try to make it worth staying."
Hong Kong will undoubtedly be more like China after 1997. But there is a chance that China will be a bit more like Hong Kong, too. And that would mean a lot to the world.

HEADLINE: For a Rational Drug Policy, Look to Treatment;
Punishment Pushers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Senator Phil Gramm's support of mandatory minimum sentences is unfortunately based on faulty logic ("Don't Let Judges Set Crooks Free," Op-Ed, July 8). Much of his argument is premised on a study by Morgan Reynolds of Texas A & M University that calculated the time people committing crimes could expect to spend in prison. Senator Gramm concludes that people committing serious crimes can expect to serve only a matter of days and therefore prisons have little deterrent value. 
 The problem with this is that the study by Morgan Reynolds looked at prison sentences per crime, not per conviction. More than half of all serious crimes are never even reported to the police, and fewer than 10 percent result in a conviction.
Unless arrests increase dramatically, the harshness of prison terms is never going to be of much consequence. Since arrest rates increased by 30 percent in the 1980's, it is unrealistic to expect our beleaguered police departments to continue this rate of increase indefinitely.
Despite Senator Gramm's contention, the criminal justice system has become much harsher, with the number of inmates more than doubling in the last decade. If the goal was to send a message to potential criminals, the continuing high rates of crime and violence indicate that the message has not been very effective.
Perhaps it is time to send a different type of message to communities devastated by unemployment, drug abuse and poverty.

HEADLINE: THE MIDWEST FLOODING;
In This Emergency, Agency Wins Praise for Its Response

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOLINE, Ill., July 19

 BODY:
Looking ahead to a multibillion-dollar cleanup in five states, the head of the Federal agency that manages the Government's response to disasters said today that the greatest damage from the Mississippi River flooding was likely to be to roads, bridges, sewers, electrical utilities and other parts of the Midwest's public works systems.
James Lee Witt, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, added that he and other Federal agency heads, including Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, were working to find the money to rebuild the levees damaged by the floods and were beginning to think about building stronger levees to provide protection from future floods. 
 The Mississippi River flooding is providing the first real test of Mr. Witt's ability to manage FEMA, a much-maligned agency during the last several years. So far, he is getting favorable reviews, and the agency's performance appears to be a political plus for President Clinton, Mr. Witt's longtime friend. But Mr. Witt warned that the toughest challenges could lie ahead.
Mr. Witt said he had largely rejected arguments by conservationists and others who have called on the Government to remove some levees and develop a new approach to preventing damage from Mississippi floods.
"What we are interested in is mitigation, in helping to prevent damage and disasters," said Mr. Witt, who ran the Arkansas Office of Emergency Services for over four years before President Clinton appointed him head of FEMA. "That means finding money to relocate homes out of the flood plain. It can mean raising the elevation of homes through the Federal Flood Insurance program. It also means finding money to rebuild levees."
 
Tallying the Damage
 Mr. Witt's comments came today during an interview in this river town, where the flood water has been falling and more than 1,000 residents are beginning to wade back to their homes and businesses to look at the damage. Local and state officials are also assessing the damage to things like roads and utilities, which have been under water for weeks. Mr. Witt said the reports from these officials were disturbing. Fixing all the damage will be very expensive, he said, although he declined to estimate the cost.
Two weeks ago, Mr. Witt said, he visited Black River Falls, a town on Wisconsin's Black River that had been flooded. The flood had diminished and officials were checking the damage.
"They found 5,000 feet of their sewer system had collapsed from the flood waters," Mr. Witt said. "I'm just telling you we're going to have a lot of infrastructural damage. Roads have been under water for weeks and their bases are soft. Electrical wiring and electrical systems have been ruined. It's very early in this disaster."
Mr. Witt was in Illinois today to look at damage in Quincy, where levees protecting a bridge were washed out over the weekend, and to meet relief workers at the FEMA field headquarters his agency has set up in an IBM building near this city's airport.
Wearing jeans, ostrich-skin cowboy boots and a belt with a big brass buckle, Mr. Witt appeared relaxed. But he is at the center of a natural calamity with lasting economic implications for thousands of Americans in the Midwest and considerable political significance for the President, whom he has known well for almost 20 years.
By almost every measure, Mr. Witt's early performance managing the flood response is being received well by flood survivors, local officials and members of the agency's staff, who are running field offices and aid centers in five states.
 
Agency Is Praised
 During a series of brief interviews on Sunday outside an aid center in St. Charles, Mo., near St. Louis, not a single flood victim complained about FEMA. "I was surprised, to tell you the truth," said Susan Paul, who was helping her mother apply for benefits. "I expected a big, slow bureaucracy, and it wasn't anything like that. They really seemed interested in helping us."
Similar praise is also heard on this side of the river. "We've had nothing but positive comments," said Bob Turek, a reporter for WGEM-AM, a radio station in Quincy that has been broadcasting flood news. "People tell us they're getting help."
Mr. Witt, the first professional emergency manager to head FEMA since it was established in 1979, is happy to hear the praise but cautions that the worst is yet to come. According to FEMA, just over 20,000 people have registered for help along the Mississippi and its tributaries in five states, and Mr. Witt said he expected many more to seek help after people got a better idea of the damage.
Nevertheless, any good words are welcome at FEMA, an agency whose reputation was bruised by Hurricane Hugo, which hit the Carolinas in 1989, and then tattered by Hurricane Andrew last summer in Florida. In both emergencies, survivors, local politicians and members of Congress criticized FEMA for being unprepared. After Hurricane Hugo, President George Bush lost confidence in FEMA; when Hurricane Andrew struck, he appointed the Secretary of Transportation, Andrew H. Card Jr., to supervise the response.
Unlike those hurricanes, which struck quickly and affected tens of thousands of people in much smaller and distinct regions, the Mississippi floods have come more slowly and predictably, a factor that helped Mr. Witt make early preparations. Weeks ago, members of his staff said, Mr. Witt began holding morning conference calls with state and Federal disaster officials to plan for the floods, a tactic he has continued.
For instance, before the levee broke in Quincy and closed the bridge between Illinois and Missouri, Mr. Witt was making plans to put in a ferry service, said Richard W. Krimm, a deputy associate director of FEMA. Mr. Witt has also played an important role in setting up almost 100 sites in Des Moines for residents to get drinking water.
In Missouri and Illinois, checks to survivors for renting temporary housing began to be sent out late last week, just days after Mr. Clinton declared the region a disaster area on July 9.
 
Backing of the President
 "He's meant a lot to us in the agency," Mr. Krimm said. "He's brought with him all that experience about what states need in a disaster. And he has the full backing of the White House."
Mr. Witt, 49, was reared on a farm in Arkansas. A few years after graduating from high school, he opened his own construction business. For 10 years, he was the elected county judge, equivalent to a county administrator, in Yell County, Ark., and then was appointed the head of the Arkansas emergency response agency.
"What we know is what is happening here is only the beginning," he said. "The most important thing now is to be prepared early and to stay prepared because when the flood water goes down, the Federal Government, the states, everybody involved needs to be geared up."

HEADLINE: G.M. Plans Rebates to Settle Suits

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it would give a $1,000 rebate for the purchase of a new truck to each of the millions of current owners of 1973 to 1987 G.M. pickups with side-mounted fuel tanks, thus settling 36 class-action lawsuits.
The value of the rebates could conceivably exceed $5 billion, although G.M. said the settlement would not be a financial drain on the company. 
 The settlement did not resolve the company's dispute with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a Federal agency that has requested a recall of the trucks. The safety agency contends that placing the fuel tanks outside the frame rails of the truck created a safety defect.
 
G.M.'s Position
 General Motors has refused to recall the vehicles and "continues to maintain that the fuel systems in these full-sized pickup trucks do not have a safety-related defect," William O'Neill, a company spokesman, said in announcing the settlement.
He said the settlement did not involve any recall or modification of the trucks, which "have an excellent safety record over the past 20 years."
The settlement is subject to approval by a Federal judge in Philadelphia and by a state judge in Marshall, Tex., where some suits were filed.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs said they could still seek damages for injuries because the settlement applied only to economic loss because of the trucks' reduced resale value. "They can also benefit from any future recall that might result" from actions by the highway safety agency, said Elizabeth Cabraser, a lawyer for one group of plaintiffs.
Critics of the trucks say they are more likely to catch fire or explode in an accident than vehicles made by other companies. A jury in suburban Atlanta awarded $105 million in February to the parents of a Georgia teen-ager who was killed in a fire in a G.M. pickup accident in 1989. The company is appealing the judgment.
Certificates good for a $1,000 price reduction on a new General Motors truck will be given to current owners of the older vehicles after Thanksgiving, the company said. Estimates of the number still running and eligible range from 4.7 million to 6 million.
Dianne Nast, a lawyer in one of the 36 class-action lawsuits, said it was an "excellent settlement for the owners, some of whom have 20-year-old trucks that cost $2,300."
Analysts said that if all of the owners took advantage of the $1,000 offer, the company's obligations could total $5 billion to $6 billion.
G.M. says it will not take a charge against earnings related to the rebates. Mr. O'Neill said that because the plaintiffs would only benefit when they bought a new truck from the company, "the settlement will not have a material adverse impact on G.M.'s financial condition."
The rebate certificates will be good for 15 months and can be added to any other rebate or incentive. Owners can give the certificates to family members or exchange them for $500 certificates that they can sell.
John A. Casesa, an auto industry analyst at Wertheim Schroder, said the program was a clever move. "They are using a potentially negative situation to bring people into the showroom, perhaps even bringing in new customers," because the certificates could be transferred, he said.
The settlement was announced late yesterday, after the stock market closed. Earlier, G.M.'s shares ended the day unchanged at $47.75.
Ms. Cabraser said the settlement would provide "an economic incentive to get these trucks off the road."
Still, Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, said her consumer advocacy group would join with the Center for Auto Safety to ask the judge to amend the deal. "There is no incentive to repair the trucks or get them off the road," she said.

HEADLINE: Panel Wants Airlines to Get Tax and Regulatory Breaks

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19

 BODY:
A Government commission charged with reviving the airline business said today that it would recommend tax cuts and regulatory relief to help reverse what it called the industry's "abysmal financial condition."
In preliminary findings that were cheered by the industry, the panel called for exempting airlines from any new tax on transportation fuels, rolling back taxes on passenger tickets and revising the Federal income tax code so that money-losing airlines would not be subject to the alternative minimum tax. 
 The commission also recommended that the Transportation Secretary convene a financial advisory committee of outside experts to warn of ill-advised mergers and other ventures.
The panel said the airlines, through taxes on fuel and tickets, had paid "more than their fair share" of the costs of building and operating the air-traffic control system.
To lower the costs and improve the efficiency of air-traffic control, the panel also endorsed the idea -- long debated but never adopted -- of turning the Federal Aviation Administration's air-traffic control functions over to a self-financed independent corporation. Such an entity would operate outside the Federal budget and could issue bonds for financing.
The commission also recommended that foreign companies be allowed to own as much as 49 percent of the voting stock of an American carrier, provided the foreign company's base country maintains a liberal aviation policy. Current law allows foreign companies to own up to 49 percent of the equity in an airline, but only 25 percent of voting stock.
 Executives of the airline industry greeted the report with enthusiasm.
Al Becker, a spokesman for American Airlines, said: "We were encouraged by the basic thrust of the report and the issues that were adopted. We want to have a chance to really study the decision thoroughly."
A spokesman for United Airlines said the company was reviewing the report and would have a statement later in the week.
The effect on the Federal budget poses one of the biggest obstacles to adoption of the panel's recommendations to aid the industry, which has lost $10 billion in three years.
A House-Senate conference committee is working out details of a tax package with the goal of passing a five-year budget by the end of August, before the airline commission is scheduled to complete its work. The airlines demanded that President Clinton endorse exempting them from a tax on transportation fuels, as the Senate did in its budget bill. But the House has approved a tax on transportation fuels, and the Administration has not made clear its view.
"The industry needs to beat back the energy tax proposal before we turn our attention to the commission's other ideas," said Jim Landry, president of the Air Transport Association. Still, he called today's proposals "thoughtful and comprehensive."
The commission is made up of industry and labor officials, economists, financiers and lawyers. Its chairman is Gerald L. Baliles, the former Governor of Virginia. It was appointed by President Clinton in the spring; final recommendations are to be made by Sept. 20.
The commission's report carefully rejected any suggestion of a return to the days of Government regulation of airline ticket prices and routes. But its members argued hard over just how far the Government should go in correcting the course of the industry.
Two economic questions took up much of the group's time. The first was how much of the industry's turmoil to blame on the desperate price-cutting behavior of bankrupt airlines, and what if anything to do about it.
Initially, the panel considered declaring that there was no conclusive evidence that price-cutting by bankrupt airlines was a major factor in the industry's plight. After debating the point, the panel voted to call this one of several such factors.
It then recommended changes to bankruptcy laws that would, in effect, speed the process for airlines.
The second issue was whether the Government should try harder through its licensing powers to influence airlines' financial decisions.
The panel said that when the Transportation Department reviews the financial fitness of airlines to operate it should use its certification process to persuade airlines not to go too deeply into debt. But in its recommendation for an outside advisory committee, the panel gave the body no enforcement powers.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Acquisition by Olsten May Gain It Some Respect on Wall Street.

BYLINE: By Robert Hurtado

 BODY:
AS No. 3 in the temporary office help market, behind Manpower Inc. and Kelly Services, the Olsten Corporation has gotten little respect from Wall Street. But the company may be on the verge of shedding its Rodney Dangerfield complex.
The company's $525 million acquisition of the Lifetime Corporation in Boston, primarily a provider of home health-care personnel, will catapult Olsten into the nation's leading provider of home health care, the fastest-growing segment of the economy. The deal, when completed, will double Olsten's revenues to more than $2 billion. 
 But to Wall Street, the deal's importance goes beyond mere size. "This simple merging of operations should be immediately active to earnings and there is the real potential for substantial profit increases beyond any current estimates," said Judith G. Scott, an analyst with Robert W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee. "This merger will also provide Olsten with an entree to Europe, a market of enormous potential for the company."
Olsten is not unfamiliar with the home health-care staffing business, having entered it during the mid- to late-70's and starting a more aggressive push in 1985. Three years ago, the company bought a division of the Upjohn Corporation that specializes in home health-care personnel. Unlike Olsten, Upjohn was unable to make its business grow and unloaded it at a fire-sale price. Olsten paid $58 million for a division with sales of $200 million. Today, Olsten's health-care staffing business is a $375 million operation, accounting for about 32 percent of the parent company's total revenues. Lifetime will increase that to 45 percent.
 At the core of Olsten's operations is the temporary office worker business. The company has 700 offices across North America, representing about 192,000 clients, including many of the Fortune 1,000.
Corporate America's current love affair with "temps" has enabled companies to add staff during peak times and avoid the cost of permanent workers.
In a March research report, Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company said that Olsten, after being hurt by the recession, began to re-establish positive momentum in mid-1991. And because the economy is still in the early stages of a recovery, the report added that the outlook for this particular business appears to be favorable for at least the next two or three years.
In fact, the move by corporations to trim staff and let outsiders do clerical and back office work helped the temp office staffing business, in Olsten's case, raising first-quarter revenues by 22 percent, to $267.4 million, and net income by 47 percent, to $5.3 million, or 20 cents a share.
One of the fringe benefits of the acquisition of Lifetime is its temporary office staffing business in Britain, called Office Angels. This gives Olsten an opportunity to leverage its expertise to obtain a toehold in Europe.
While some investors note that Lifetime's high-priced debt, of $155 million with interest rates as high as 10.5 percent, could act as a drag on Olsten's earnings, Frank N. Liguori, Olsten's chairman and chief executive officer, said that paying down the Lifetime debt would go to the top of his agenda after the transaction was completed. Further, he pointed out that Wall Street analysts familiar with the pending acquisition saw the merger as adding to Olsten's bottom line.
In fact, Baird's analyst, Ms. Scott, estimates that earnings should increase to $1.15 a share in 1993, compared with 87 cents a share in the previous year. Her estimate had been $1.10. Her 1994 estimate is $1.50 a share, up 10 cents from her previous estimate.
At the close of trading yesterday on the American Stock Exchange, Olsten's stock was at $25.625 a share, down 12.5 cents.

HEADLINE: GAY RIGHTS IN THE MILITARY;
Clinton in Crossfire

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19

 BODY:
In announcing his compromise on homosexuals in the military, President Clinton today sought to close the book at last on an explosive issue that had become a glaring benchmark of the White House's own political naivete.
But the announcement, carefully staged before an audience of military brass, will not be enough to make the furor go away. Indeed, it now threatens to haunt Mr. Clinton even through his re-election campaign three years from now. 
 "I think it will be used against him every time he opens his mouth," said Albert McAlister, the Democratic state chairman in South Carolina, where, Mr. McAlister said, sentiment had run strongly against any change in the Defense Department's longtime ban on homosexuals' serving in the armed forces. "If you talk to people down South about the President, sometimes the first thing they'll say is they talk about his position on gays in the military."
Advocates on the opposite side of the debate, particularly those who demanded a complete lifting of the ban, are not cheering either.
"This will only guarantee that the debate will become more bitter, more divisive and a bigger political issue," said David B. Mixner, a major Clinton fund raiser among homosexuals last year, whose relations with the President have been strained over military service. "This was one of those moments in anyone's Presidency where he either hears a call to greatness or surrenders. He made no principled fight. He didn't address the nation until today, and that was to concede defeat."
 
Midwinter Mistakes
 Some White House officials now acknowledge that it was a mistake for Mr. Clinton to have begun acting on so emotionally charged an issue only days after his inauguration last January, particularly without adequately consulting the military chiefs and the Congressional leaders whose opposition to an outright lifting of the ban proved insurmountable.
And in trying to defuse the issue by delaying a decision then and seeking a compromise, Mr. Clinton only prolonged the debate, extending the period in which he was vulnerable to criticism that he had abandoned his campaign promise.
Although Mr. Clinton has insisted that he never became preoccupied by the issue -- spending but a few hours, he said, on his efforts to overturn the ban -- no other matter has caused him so much political agony on so many different fronts. Critics on the right are furious that he would propose giving "special treatment" to homosexuals. Those on the left have lambasted him for backing down from his campaign pledge.
 
Early Damage
 From the beginning of his Presidency, the issue only served to erode his stature as Commander in Chief and his relations on Capitol Hill, particularly with Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee and advocated the Pentagon's ban. The debate also made it nearly impossible for the White House to dispel a notion that he was consumed by the issue at a time when it was the economy that demanded his attention.
All the furor arose from a campaign pledge on a matter that was not the most important issue -- either to him or even to homosexual rights groups, most of which were far more concerned about the fight against AIDS. Perhaps as a result, neither he nor they anticipated how bitter the fight would become or how easy it would be for others to exploit.
"I can't think back to a President hurt so early on by his own hand -- not since President Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon, and that was a very different kind of issue," said Barbara A. Perry, a professor of government at Sweet Briar College in Virginia. "He did not anticipate the vociferous nature of the opposition."
Today few on either side of the issue were willing to give the President a break. Gary L. Bauer, president of the conservative Family Research Council, who supported the Pentagon's ban, sounded strikingly similar to opponents of the ban, saying Mr. Clinton had failed to demonstrate moral leadership.
Mr. Bauer said that had the President stood by his earlier pledge, "I think people would respect that more, that he has the courage of his convictions."
Even so, Mr. Bauer added, Mr. Clinton's compromise "undercuts the idea that he's a moderate, because he still comes across as beholden to the gay rights constituency."
Thomas B. Stoddard, coordinator of the Campaign for Military Service, a gay advocacy group, also spoke of a failure of moral leadership. "The President could have lifted up the conscience of the country," Mr. Stoddard said. "He could have fulfilled the country's yearning for moral leadership. Instead, he acceded, without a fight, to the stereotypes of prejudices he himself had disparaged."
The religious right shows no interest in letting the Clinton-and-homosexuals theme fade from the political dialogue, or from the mailings of fund-raising groups. But the main question that Democrats face is whether the Republican Party, which has been skittish about "family values" issues since they backfired during last year's campaign, will now harp on the issue of homosexual rights.
Homosexual rights advocates made clear today that they would not allow the military service issue to disappear. The Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union announced that they would file a court challenge on behalf of "the tens of thousands of lesbian and gay service members who are denied their constitutional protections under the new directive."
And the President, who had spent months fending off questions about what policy he would adopt, found today that the questions were not yet at an end. Several hours after announcing the new policy, he held a news conference on his dismissal of William S. Sessions, the Director of the F.B.I., but was peppered mostly with queries about homosexuals and the military.
Once again, he was in a defensive posture. "First of all," he said in response to a question that no President likes to be asked, "I think I did stand by my principles."
Mr. Clinton does have his sympathizers, gay rights advocates who note that even under the compromise he has moved more boldly than any other President to insure equal rights for homosexuals.
"I really hand it to him, he's shed political blood on this issue," said Representative Gerry Studds, Democrat of Massachusetts, a homosexual. Mr. Studds said that although he had favored a full lifting of the ban, "I really think it's important to keep a perspective here."
"If this man had not been President," he said, "this wouldn't even be on the national agenda. It's a small step, but Clinton was able to do something that makes life less awful, or less unbearable, for some gays and lesbians."

HEADLINE: Home Repair or Retail Ruin?

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Liberty Avenue in Queens, beneath the shadows of an elevated subway line, still resembles one of New York City's traditional neighborhoods, a cluster of Italian delis, Laundromats, pastry shops and a hardware store, called Molbegott's, that draws people precisely because they can ask Mr. Molbegott himself how to fix their plumbing.
"I find everything I need right on this avenue," said Wanda McCaffrey, 43 years old, of Richmond Hill as she shopped on Liberty Avenue, pulling her nephew on a tricycle. "You don't have to go very far for anything." 
 But to Mrs. McCaffrey and many of her neighbors, this small commercial ecosystem -- one of many small shopping districts that have for generations served as modest Main Streets across the city's urban sprawl -- is being threatened by one of the large discount retailers, staples of the suburban landscape, that have begun staking out a foothold in the city.
Fearful that a sprawling Home Depot home-repair store would destroy the particular character and manner of their neighborhoods, residents and merchants from Ozone Park and Richmond Hill have gone to court in an effort to block construction of the store at Aqueduct Raceway. They maintain that the company did not submit to the appropriate environmental, zoning and legal reviews before receiving a building permit in May -- a charge city and company officials reject.
 
Judge Denies Foes' Request
 Last week, a state judge in Queens refused to halt construction, saying that the issue should instead be decided by the city's Board of Standards and Appeals, which is to hold a hearing next month.
The legal wrangling echoes the deep concerns of towns and cities across the nation as large retail chains erect vast outlets in their midst. To many, the fundamental question is whether old downtowns and shopping districts can survive alongside these warehouse clubs, super supermarkets and other retail behemoths, which offer a vast selection of goods in bulk and at rock-bottom prices.
In New York, the Department of City Planning is rewriting its zoning policy to encourage these large discount retailers. Officials argue that they are a needed source of jobs and tax revenues. They say that neighborhood protests ignore the benefits to a city that has for years lost retail dollars and jobs to the suburbs.
"It's a matter of the city catching up with what's been invested in the suburbs," said Eric A. Kober, the department's director of housing, economics and infrastructure.
 
Bradlees, Pathmark and More
 In the last three months alone, Bradlees Inc., a chain of 126 stores based in Braintree, Mass., has announced it will open its first store in New York City, in Atlantic Center in downtown Brooklyn. Pathmark plans to open a superstore in Astoria. Home Depot Inc. of Atlanta, which has 227 warehouse-style stores, including eight stores on Long Island, plans to open two more in Queens -- one at the former Taystee Bread factory in Flushing and the other at Woodhaven Boulevard and Metropolitan Avenue in Forest Hills. And two other retailers have asked for zoning permits to build new stores.
To the active opponents in Queens, however, their protests portend further clashes like those that have greeted the retail giants elsewhere.
"Putting these stores in neighborhoods in New York City is far different from putting them on Long Island," said John Van Der Tuin, a lawyer for the community organization in Queens, called Coalition for Community Preservation and Stabilization. "The question is, what does this type of store do to the neighborhood it's moving in?"
Ozone Park and Richmond Hill are like many neighborhoods in Queens: modest and insular. The streets are tidy and quiet, and people want to keep them that way.
So when the digging, drilling and pounding began inside Aqueduct several weeks ago, it stirred a small revolt. With his house just 40 yards from the construction site, Dennis D'Aquilla, a dispatcher for Con Edison, began to wonder what it would be like to live alongside the Home Depot.
His thoughts raced: he envisioned trucks -- big ones -- roaring through the neighborhood with heavy cargoes while crowds of shoppers coursed through the street toward the store.
"It shook me," said Mr. D'Aquilla, who has helped rally opponents. "I was forced to get involved. My backyard was right next to this monster."
To a large degree, the character of Richmond Hill and Ozone Park, where every block resembles every other, is formed by Liberty Avenue, the main artery. Small businesses have been there for many years, and their owners are usually behind the counter making sales and small talk.
 
Sharing May Not Last
 Joseph Scarpantonio got one of his first jobs working at Molbegott's nearly two decades ago as a stock boy, and now he owns his own hardware store and restaurant on that very same strip.
Mr. Scarpantonio, 47, says the businesses there have always kept close ties and good relations -- sharing customers and even borrowing supplies from one another. He wonders how long the neighborliness will last once Home Depot moves in.
"I don't see people working as a team if Home Depot comes," he said. "It'll be different. People will be fighting each other just to make sure they're the ones who make the sale."
Martin Molbegott, his old boss, agrees. 'What's happening is that only the strongest stores will survive," he said, "and the mom and pop stores won't."
Not everyone, though, makes such gloomy predictions.
Robert Mereweather, a plumber from Richmond Hill, is still partial to the quick, personal service along Liberty Avenue. (He said he once left a Home Depot in a rage after waiting about an hour for service.)
But he says he believes that the Home Depot will create enough competition to drive the prices of the smaller shops down. "You won't catch me in line at Home Depot just to save a few dollars," he said. "But I'm all for it, if it gets the local guys to bring down their prices."

In the neighborhood, small shopping districts have been the rule and residents are fearful that the sprawling store would destoy the area's character. "I was forced to get involved. My backyard was right next to this monster," said Dennis D'Aquilla, who lives 40 yards from the site. Mr. D'Aquilla has helped organize opponents against the construction.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Moscow Draws Line on Cigarette and Liquor Ads

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:
As the smog of Communism lifted over Moscow several years ago, enabling a market-oriented economy to take root, products like Reebok shoes, Benetton clothes, Sharp electronics and Estee Lauder cosmetics were suddenly available to people who had known only the shoddiness of domestically produced consumer goods.
Then, as the avenues of exposure opened, companies began using traditional methods of advertising to keep their corporate logos fresh in Muscovites' minds. Among the most visible images around town on billboards and storefronts have been advertisements for Western cigarettes and liquor. The United States alone accounted for $197.6 million in tobacco exports to Russia last year and $24 million in alcohol exports, according to the Department of Commerce.
 
 
Promoting Health
 But just as the United States, Italy, Singapore, Sweden and other countries restricted advertising for tobacco and alcohol as a way to promote health and safety, the Moscow City Council passed a resolution this month that would banish such advertisements from billboards, kiosks and bus shelters, as well as from local newspapers, magazines and Russia's national television network. 
 The Council also called on the advertisements to be taken down within a month -- a highly unlikely prospect. With cigarettes and alcohol having been national indulgences for centuries, causing a variety of health problems, the city government has urged that the Russian Parliament extend the ban on advertisements for cigarettes and alcohol nationwide.
In any case, not every politician in Moscow has warmed to the idea that the city should be turned into a screaming endorsement for all things Western. As Sergei Rogozhkin, the deputy chairman of the city's mass media department, told The Moscow Times, an English-language newspaper, "We have good reason to think about limits."
The Council's bill requires approval from the Mayor's office.
But a tide of opposition is already growing, leading to speculation that even if the ban becomes law, it is virtually certain that it will neither be honored nor enforced.
Igor Pisarsky, president of the Russian Association of Advertising Agencies, an organization of Moscow's 17 leading ad agencies, said last week: "There is no way they can enforce this. The Moscow City Council has no right anyway to impose such a ban, especially on TV networks that are funded by the Government."
Unlike in the United States, cigarette makers advertise on television in Russia, but only after 10 P.M., when fewer children are likely to be watching.
For Western business interests, particularly American cigarette companies, fighting the ban is critically important. With the smoking population in the United States steadily declining, by nearly 3 percent a year for the last 12 years, companies like Philip Morris, R. J. Reynolds and B.A.T. Industries have found an eager buying public in Russia and other former cold war markets. The Marlboro brand is still the best-selling Western product in what used to be the Soviet Union.
With Philip Morris likely to keep recent price cuts on premium brands in the United States, a move Reynolds will probably match, the need to expand sales abroad becomes more acute.
But as the Moscow bureaucracy chugs along, hardly any faster than in days of old, Western companies are finding they can do little more than wait to see exactly what they are up against.
A spokesman for RJR Tobacco International said most companies would probably comply with whatever measures were passed.
"It's frustrating to be even implicitly accused of violating a regulation," Richard Marcotullio, the RJR official, said. "There are not that many defenders of the tobacco industry as it is. If we were to do something illegal, people would jump on us twice as hard as on anybody else."

HEADLINE: For Better or Worse, Official In Michigan Makes an Impact

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: KALAMAZOO, Mich., July 19

 BODY:
Depending on whom you ask, Fred Ruden, a Kalamazoo County Commissioner, is either a persecuted champion of the underdog or a short-tempered bully who verbally assaults anyone who dares disagree with him.
At the heart of the debate is whether his mental illness has anything to do with it. 
 Since taking office in January, Mr. Ruden has made late-night telephone calls to perceived political enemies, bombarded the commission with critical memorandums and overturned three vending machines of The Kalamazoo Gazette after an editorial in the newspaper angered him.
He has also created a community mental health board, made commission meetings more accessible to the public and argued passionately for better services for people with disabilities.
 
Severe Mood Swings
 Mr. Ruden, an unemployed bill collector with a law degree, has been found to be afflicted by manic-depression, a condition that causes severe mood swings. He says he wants to help pave the way for others who have disabilities.
But some mental-health advocates say his combative behavior has only perpetuated the stigma that most people tend to associate with the disorder.
"Fred's behavior has scared people," said Elizabeth Plasick, a co-founder of the Kalamazoo County Alliance for the Mentally Ill. "People are writing letters to the editor, saying he's a loose cannon."
Ms. Plasick, one of Mr. Ruden's early supporters, said his behavior had "set back years of progress" in destigmatizing mental illness.
The 38-year-old Commissioner does not deny that he can be "undiplomatic" at times, and he acknowledges that he needs to be more tolerant of others' views. But he does not make any excuses for his passion about the causes he believes in.
"You don't have some crazy commissioner tearing up the town down here," he said. "'My personal anger leads to public good."
Mr. Ruden acknowledges that several recent incidents, including the attack on the vending machines, occurred after he temporarily stopped taking lithium, the drug that controls his condition.
Some commissioners say that they are sympathetic to Mr. Ruden's illness but contend that his confrontational style and quick temper may be too volatile for politics.
"He can really get quite abusive," said Richard Kleiman, the chairman of the commission. "He thinks everybody is out to get him."
Some mental-health advocates say the fact that the commission is unwilling to accommodate Mr. Ruden's sometimes erratic behavior is just another example of discrimination.
"People don't understand mental illness," said Bev Lewis, president of the Kalamazoo County Alliance for the Mentally Ill. "The symptoms are not visible, like having a cast on your arm. The only reason you know someone is mentally ill is their behavior."
Ms. Lewis said Mr. Ruden has a quality that she believes is lacking in many other politicians: an instinct for doing the decent thing. "Fred has made a tremendous impact on the delivery of services here," she said.
Mr. Ruden talks openly about his illness. He said he began having intense mood swings while attending Michigan State University in the 1970's. In his third year at the Emory University School of Law the mood swings got so bad that he was granted a temporary psychiatric leave.
He also said he twice tried to commit suicide before his disorder was finally diagnosed, in 1986, as manic depression. He became an outspoken critic of the local mental health system after a doctor tried to cut off the lithium that had restored his balance.
Last fall, running as a Democrat, Mr. Ruden waged a $200 campaign for a seat on the commission and defeated a 14-year incumbent. He lives in a government-subsidized apartment on the $7,700 the county pays him annually.
Few people dispute that Mr. Ruden has improved local mental-health services. Even before he was elected, his rostrum-pounding speeches persuaded the commission to create the mental-health board.
 
Buses for the Disabled
 Since taking office he has pushed the commission to end its practice of holding daytime meetings of small committees, where many substantial decisions were made but which few citizens could attend.
He has also succeeded in getting the commission to approve financing for a bus service for disabled people, has advocated minority and female representation on committees, and has fought for labor and debtors' rights.
"I think Fred makes a lot of people uncomfortable because he talks about things in public that people don't want to talk about," said Mary Powers, Mr. Ruden's strongest supporter among his fellow commissioners.
"At these meetings, you look around and people put their head down and say, 'Oh, God, do we have to hear it again?' " Ms. Powers added. "But Fred feels so intensely about things -- and that's what our society needs a lot more of."
But even she admits, "There are times I just have to say, 'Fred, shut up.' "

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
3.9% Increase Is Proposed By A.T.& T.

BYLINE: By VERONICA BYRD

 BODY:
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company said yesterday that it would increase its rates for some long-distance residential and business calls an average of 3.9 percent.
The proposed price increases, if approved by the Federal Communications Commission, would take effect on Aug. 1. 
 A.T.& T. said the increases were needed to offset higher operating costs and investments in a transferable "800" service, which was put into effect on May 1. With the transferable service, customers can change long-distance carriers and keep their "800" numbers.
The rate increases are "part of an ongoing effort to align prices with expenses," Mark Siegel, a spokesman for the company's consumer services division, said. "I'm sure we will see actions like this again."
The stock market reacted favorably to the proposed rate increases. A.T.& T. shares gained $1.125 yesterday, closing at $64.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The rate increases are considered a sign that while the rate war among the telephone industry's giants is less aggressive, it is far from over as the companies raise prices to make up for slower expansion and call volume.
For residential customers, the actual increase on their monthly bills will depend on the types of calls made. For those making only domestic calls, the increase will be less than 1 percent, Mr. Siegel said. For some calls made during evening hours, charges will decrease slightly.
 
International Calls
 Individual customers' direct-dialed international calls to 56 countries will increase an average of 3.8 percent.
Charges on calls to the United States from 27 countries using A.T.& T.'s USA Direct service will increase an average of 15 percent. With USA Direct, people overseas can call the United States directly, or with the assistance of an English-speaking operator, from more than 120 countries.
Rates on calling-card and operator-assisted calls will increase an average of 3 percent. The service charge on those calls will not be affected.
The consumer rate increase is expected to generate $193.2 million a year, Mr. Siegel said. The company declined to provide figures on the increase expected in business-calling revenue.
"We tried to absorb general increases of the cost of doing business, such as inflation and operational expenses, with cost containment and technology improvements," said Mike Granieri, a spokesman for A.T.& T. Business Communications Services. "But every now and then, the costs cannot be offset."
Rates for most business service will increase an average of 3.9 percent. The rises will apply to most interstate domestic and international long distance, to "800" calls and to data-communications services.
Daniel P. Reingold, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Company, said the rate rises "signal the trend toward more rational pricing in the industry in contrast to the aggressive price cutting seen a couple of years ago." He said it was highly likely that competitors, particularly the MCI Communications Corporation, will "come close to matching the increases."
"The companies have been following each other's rate changes quite closely in the last year," he added.
The last consumer rate rise was in December 1992, when charges went up for directory-assistance services and for USA Direct rates.

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
Recession's Romantics Fix Up Their Factory

BYLINE: By Iver Peterson

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J.

 BODY:
IT didn't take long for somebody, probably Adam Smith, to make the connection between the value of a product and the wages of the people who make it. When $350 in raw materials are made into a $15,000 automobile, it equals happiness and high wages. Fifty cents worth of chopped beef flipped into a 75-cent hamburger equals low wages and woe.
Because they understand this rule, because they were determined to save the factory they built -- and maybe because they were a little bit lucky -- the men and women at Garry Precision Screw Machine were not among those who lost 24,500 well-paid manufacturing jobs in New Jersey last year. 
 Garry makes interconnect devices, which, when the plant was founded in the mid-1950's by Rudy Koppell, generally meant manufacturing the prongs and sockets that form the connections in electrical plugs. Since then, with the arrival of the age of microelectronics, the interconnect business has boomed. In every computer, microwave oven, videocassette recorder and sophisticated weapon of war, there are thousands of tiny brass plugs, prongs and soldering connections, each precisely machined, slotted, notched, crimped, chamfered and polished by companies like Garry Precision Screw Machine.
The late Mr. Koppell, "old Mister Koppell" the people at Garry still call him affectionately, built Garry into a $30 million a year business by the time, in the pattern of these things, he decided to sell out and retire rich. The company was then passed from one international company to another, each one more remote and less interested in caring for an old-line family business than the one before.
The last owner, a $4 billion conglomerate, decided to make Garry a "captive shop," manufacturing only for the parent company's products and jettisoning decades of loyal customers. "It was crazy," said Sam Mark, Brooklyn-born and a Garry executive since the Koppell days. "This isn't a captive shop, it's a job shop. They ran us into the ground."
Indeed. Last September, the conglomerate decided it didn't need Garry's production any more, and the little plant was not important enough for the owners to waste time on finding a willing buyer. So the factory on the southbound side of United States Highway 1 was simply shut down, its 150 workers dismissed, the milling machines drained of lubricating oil and consigned to an industrial auctioneer for piecemeal sale.
"Well, we were just optimistic, I guess," said Richard Rueshoff, a machinist with 33 years' experience at Garry, explaining why people did what they did then. "We just thought we'd find a way to keep going."
Mr. Rueshoff and a half dozen other machinist foremen entered the silent factory a few months after the shutdown to oil and hand-turn the bearings on the precise, Swiss-made cutting machines. They feared that if the bearings dried out and sat idle in one position too long, they would develop flat spots, a problem for the new owner who the Garry people figured had to be out there somewhere. There was no question of anyone's paying them to do this.
Meanwhile, Sue Whitaker, who had worked in the front office, sat in her kitchen and called suppliers of the metal rods the plant turned into connectors, keeping abreast of price changes. She fed the information to Bob Lewis, who had been head of operations, so he could quote tentative prices on jobs from a plant that technically didn't exist and that he in any case didn't even work for.
And Mr. Mark, the laid-off plant manager, began calling former customers, asking, "What if?" as in: What if you were to buy this place and put us all back to work?
"It wasn't strictly proper, because we didn't even have a plant to sell them -- it belonged to the auctioneer," Mr. Mark said. "But sometimes you've got to shoot craps."
We could pause and remember that in too many cases, it all ends there: snake eyes. Manufacturing is in recession, after all. The ex-owners probably knew what they were doing when they decided to break up and sell off the plant. The manufacturing jobs that did vanish last year are proof that for many men and women who work with their hands, the news from the front office is often bad and stays bad.
But not for the Garry workers, not yet. Wire-Pro Company, a nice, family-owned South Jersey company, returned Mr. Mark's call, and said yes. The auctioneer said yes. The state Commerce Department stepped in with some financial incentives for Wire-Pro, and on the Monday before last, July 12, Garry Precision Screw Machine Company reopened its doors to an initial staff of 25 laid-off workers and a small military contract.
"We're going to get them all back," Mr. Mark, general manager once again, said of the other, still waiting workers. "Somewhere down the road, we'll bring them back. Because we have aspirations."

HEADLINE: Stocks End Day Mixed as Dow Gains 6.99

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stock prices were mixed yesterday, with little news to affect the overall market. Instead, individual stories moved individual stocks, with the technology sector weighing over everything.
The weakness in technology was a carry-over from last week, when concern over earnings touched off a sell off. 
 I.B.M. lost 2, to 43 5/8, as 4.5 million shares changed hands. The stock is now at its lowest level in 18 years, which, some market analysts recollected, was after a particularly brutal bear market.
Traders said Rick Martin, an analyst with the Chicago Corporation, said in an interview on CNBC yesterday that I.B.M. "cannot go up as long as book value is going down." He projected that a drop in the computer company's book value would come from trimming payrolls by up to 75,000 jobs in the next six to 12 months.
 
25,000 Job Cuts Expected
 Next week the giant computer company is expected to release its second-quarter earnings, and Mr. Martin expects the company to announce that 25,000 jobs will be cut.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 6.99 points to close at 3,535.28, as the volume of shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 216.4 million, down from 263.1 million on Friday. Declinging issues outpaced gainers by 1,070 to 852 and the Big Board composite slipped 0.12 point, to 247.33.
Trading on the Nasdaq was brisk as the composite fell 3.90 points, to 695.83. Apple Computer fell 1 7/8, to 25 5/8, Digital Equipment dropped 1 5/8, to 37 5/8, while Microsoft tumbled 2 3/8, to 78 3/4.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks was up 0.28 point, to 446.03, while the American Stock Exchange composite fell 2.99 points, to 433.48.
Dennis E. Jarrett, chief market analyst for Kidder, Peabody & Company, said another force that weighed on the market yesterday was the Commodity Research Bureau's price index, which was up 2.83 points, to 218.01, because of the flooding in the Midwest and a rise in crude oil prices.
"Initially, this put pressure on bonds because of its inflationary nature and a damper on equities," he said.
Members of OPEC, looking to set production quotas amid a market in oversupply, called for an emergency meeting in the next couple of weeks.
The increase in oil prices helped oil stocks, which lifted blue-chip issues, but the technology weakness weighed on the small stocks.
Mr. Jarrett said some of the positives in yesterday's market included the Travelers Corp., up 1 3/8, to 31 3/8, on good earnings numbers, and Caterpillar, up 1 5/8, to 79 5/8.
He said negatives were accentuated by the drug stocks, which continued to show weakness, led by Merck, down 1, to 32 1/8.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
New York City Set to Sell Bonds

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
New York City comes to the market today to sell about $675 million in general obligation bonds, including almost $70 million of the popular New York City "mini-bonds."
The mini-bonds are aimed at small investors, who can buy a bond with a face value of $5,000 and a 25-year maturity for about $1,200. The bonds are sold at a discount because they pay no interest until maturity, when the buyer gets the face value of the bond. 
 This is the fourth sale of the mini-bonds since they were initiated in 1992. About 20,000 individuals have bought the bonds.
The sale, which is one of the four quarterly offerings needed to raise about $2.9 billion this year, is also expected to include about $100 million of special derivative bonds that offer investors, mostly mutual funds, the opportunity for high yields in exchange for a substantial risk if short-term interest rates begin to rise. The sale of these bonds will depend on market appetite.
 
 
'Inverse Floaters'
 Among the derivative products are "inverse floaters," which have become especially popular recently because they offer high yields to mutual funds at a time when interest rates are falling and would otherwise make funds' advertised yields look less attractive.
New York City also plans to offer close to $300 million of long-term variable-rate bonds, on which the interest rates are adjusted daily. The lead underwriter for the sale is the First Boston Corporation.
This is the first time that the city has been able to offer long-term variable-rate bonds, with maturities from 20 to 30 years. The city can offer these long-term bonds now because it has been able to get the letters of credit from banks that are needed to back them up. Three of those banks, the Industrial Bank of Japan, Sumitomo Bank and Sanwa Bank, are Japanese and were wooed by the city when both Mayor David N. Dinkins and City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman visited Tokyo earlier this year.
One reason for the variable-rate borrowing is that New York City has a considerable amount of money that it invests at short-term rates, giving it some protection if such rates begin to rise. And if they remain relatively stable the city can reduce borrowing costs for now because short-term rates are lower than long term-rates.
 
 
Credit Rating
 The sale, which also will include about $225 million in regular serial bonds, comes just after the city approved its new budget and its credit rating was reaffirmed by the Standard & Poor's Corporation as A- with a negative outlook.
On Friday, Fitch Investors Service, another credit-rating firm, gave its first rating to New York City, which was A- with a stable outlook.
The problem that New York City faces in terms of its credit rating is that it has managed to balance its budgets and shore up its finances with some one-time savings but still faces longer-term budget problems. At the same time, however, the general financial outlook for the city has improved a little because the recession appears to have ended, although economic growth continues to be weak.
"We still feel pretty good about New York City as an individual credit," said Robert J. Froelich, director of Municipal Research at the Van Kampen Merritt Investment Advisory Corporation in Oakbrook Terrace, Ill. "The market tends to overdramatize its concern about New York because everyone has an opinion about New York City. But its problems are not that different from other cities in the United States."
In a statement, Ms. Holtzman said that the new rating from Fitch "recognizes the city's proven track record of fiscal responsibility and the sophisticated systems in place to maintain a balanced budget."
The statement, issued by both the Mayor and the Comptroller, contained no mention of S.& P.'s addition that "the outlook remains negative."
 
 
Treasury Market
 Treasury prices and yields were little changed yesterday as investors and traders turned their focus to Washington, where the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, will give his semiannual testimony on monetary policy to Congress today.
In the secondary market, the price of the 30-year bond due in February 2023 was up 1/32 point, while the yield remained unchanged at 6.54 percent. The price of the 10-year note was unchanged with the yield staying at 5.69 percent.
At the weekly auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills the average discount rate rose one basis point, or a hundredth of a percentage point. Following are the auction results:

HEADLINE: Iraq Agrees to Allow The U.N. to Monitor Weapons Industries

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 19

 BODY:
Bowing to diplomatic and military pressure, President Saddam Hussein has agreed to let the United Nations monitor Iraq's military industries to insure that Iraq does not build more weapons of mass destruction, a senior United Nations official said today.
After five days of talks with the Iraqi leadership, Rolf Ekeus, the head of the special commission that the United Nations Security Council formed to disarm Iraq, declared that "we have broken out of the vicious circle" of threats and counter-threats that had raised the prospect of another armed confrontation with Iraq. 
 Some United Nations officials say that once Iraq is in compliance, Security Council restrictions on the sale of its oil should be lifted. Easing the oil embargo would give Baghdad access to billions of dollars in revenues. But the Clinton administration said today that Iraq would have to comply with additional human rights requirements before restrictions could be lifted.
Mr. Ekeus said that "an interim solution satisfactory to both sides" had been reached to a dispute over the United Nations demand that surveillance cameras be installed at two missile-testing stations. The cameras are meant to insure that Iraq does not build more powerful rockets than it is allowed under the cease-fire terms that ended the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
He said the agreement involved the positioning of cameras, but he declined to reveal details before reporting to the Security Council this week.
Mr. Ekeus called Iraq's decision to comply with the Security Council plan for monitoring its military industries "an important development," and he said that, in his view, after several other steps, it could lead to a relaxation of the oil embargo.
The Security Council adopted the monitoring demand as Resolution 715 on Oct. 11, 1991, but Iraq has refused to agree to it until now, saying it would discuss complying only after the Security Council has begun to lift the economic sanctions.
Baghdad's agreement to comply also marks a turning point in the Security Council's treatment of Iraq since the end of the war.
United Nations arms inspectors reckon that they have found all they are likely to find of traces of Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs. And as the country rebuilds industries damaged in the war, the inspectors' emphasis is switching away from the eradication of banned weapons toward insuring that Iraq does not re-acquire them.
In a statement to the Iraqi news agency today, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, who led the Iraqi team at the talks, described them as "frank and comprehensive" and said the outcome had been "fruitful."
 
Dispute Began Last Month
 The confrontation with Baghdad arose last month when Iraq refused to allow the commission to install video cameras at the Yawm Al Azim and Al Rafah missile-testing stations about 40 miles south of the capital, saying it had not yet accepted any United Nations right to monitor its military industries.
Iraq also turned down a compromise proposal under which the special commission's arms inspectors were to place seals on equipment at the site to insure that they are not used until a long-term solution is reached.
The Security Council reacted angrily to Iraq's defiance, warning of "serious consequences" if it continued to disobey its orders. President Clinton, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and other senior Administration figures hinted at possible new air strikes.
After the United States air attack on its intelligence headquarters on June 27, Iraq appeared to be bracing itself for more such attacks by moving valuable machinery and equipment out of factories and other installations that it thought might be targeted.
The latest confrontation with the special commission has ended with Baghdad letting the United Nations begin an intrusive, open-ended surveillance of Iraqi industries to enforce the Security Council cease-fire terms contained in Resolution 687.
Those terms require Iraq to report and destroy all of its secret installations for manufacturing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons as well as long-range rockets. They prohibit Baghdad from acquiring such weapons again and require it to place its industries under international surveillance.
 
Backing Off Previous Standoffs
 A similar standoff a year ago, when Iraq blocked arms inspectors from searching its Agriculture Ministry, also ended with Iraq giving way after President Bush threatened more bombing raids. Earlier, Iraq had held a team of inspectors hostage in a parking lot for several days after the inspectors raided a government office and took away documents. But in the end the Iraqis released them and let them keep the documents.
The agreement today provides for Iraq to hold what are described as "technical talks" with the special commission in New York on what it must still do to comply fully with the cease-fire terms and how the industrial monitoring is to be carried out, including permanent surveillance arrangements at the missile-test sites. These talks are expected to start in early September.
Once Iraq has fully complied with the disarmament provisions and the industrial monitoring is "up and running," Mr. Ekeus said, it is his understanding that Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 requires the Security Council to lift the embargo on Iraqi oil sales.
Britain and the United States take a harsher view, however, saying Iraq will have to be in compliance on human rights issues before easing the embargo can be contemplated. These include the treatment of minorities in Iraq and the payment of war damages.
"Their compliance has to go beyond 687," a senior American official said. "We haven't been holding out any carrot. We've been brandishing the stick."
 
'A Creative Way to Say No'
 The official added that some United Nations officials and some other members of the Security Council believe that Iraq should be able to sell oil once it fulfills the terms of Paragraph 22.
"We're trying to find a creative way to say no to that," the official said.
Mr. Ekeus said the special commission also wants Iraq to do several things it has refused to do so far before it is deemed to be in compliance.
Those requirements include providing details about which foreign companies supplied Iraq with sensitive weapons technology, a complete accounting of what went into its weapons development programs and a description of how they were organized.
United Nations officials said that in agreeing to a settlement today, Iraq seemed to be acting partly out of fear of another air strike, despite the preparations it had made to minimize the damage. But a more powerful consideration appeared to be its desire to secure some easing in the trade embargo, which Deputy Prime Minister Aziz acknowledged was causing great hardship to ordinary Iraqis.
 
Compensation to Kuwaitis
 Iraq is now negotiating with the United Nations on a Security Council offer to let it sell $1.6 billion worth of oil over six months to buy food and medicine, for instance.
But even if the United Nations allows that oil sale, a third of the proceeds would have to be used to compensate victims of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Iraq would also have to let the United Nations monitor the distribution of the goods it purchases to insure that they are spread fairly among its citizens.
United Nations officials say Iraq's agreement to long-term industrial monitoring today should improve the chances of an oil sales pact by making it easier for Baghdad to accept monitoring of these food and medical supplies. And Mr. Ekeus said he was carrying a message to the United Nations concerning the talks.
But even if successful, this partial lifting of the oil embargo will only yield Iraq about $900 million, or $5 for each of its 18 million people. A far bigger prize would be a complete end to the ban on selling oil, which could give it an annual income of some $12 billion to $15 billion even after the Security Council has deducted a third for compensation payments and to pay the special commission's costs.
Iraq would be able to spend this money freely on buying food, medicine and other essential relief supplies.

HEADLINE: Tough U.S. Enforcement on Trade: Is It Fair?

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Just who is being unfair to whom? While President Clinton spent much of his time at the Tokyo summit meeting pleading for an even break on trade, some experts counter that fair play must begin at home.
They argue that Federal bureaucrats have been playing the same games that outrage American exporters, and point to the reversal of a string of recent Commerce Department rulings that foreign companies have been "dumping" their goods in the United States at prices that are unfair to American competitors. 
 In a decision last month, for example, Judge Nicholas Tsoucalas of the United States Court of International Trade -- the appellate court in most anti-dumping suits -- required the Government to give back penalties assessed against NSK, a Japanese ball-bearing maker.
"Commerce repeatedly ignores the law and disobeys the decisions of this court," he said.
Judge R. Kenton Musgrave of the same court sent the case of Bowe-Passat, a German manufacturer of dry-cleaning machinery, back for reconsideration in May. The Commerce Department, he concluded, used the company's failure to dot every "i" and cross every "t" as an excuse to get tough. "This predatory 'gotcha' policy," he wrote, "does not promote cooperation or accuracy."
Nor is the harsh language confined to the Court of International Trade. The special binational committee that hears appeals on trade disputes with Canada quarreled with the Commerce Department for six months over imports of live pigs, and then lowered the boom: "Commerce's remand determination failed to conform to the express holding and reasoning of this panel," the members decided last October. They threw out the judgment against the Canadians.
"The Department of Commerce is on a holy crusade to find foreigners dumping" their goods, said James Bovard, author of the book "Fair Trade Fraud." And Gary Horlick, a partner in the law firm of O'Melveny & Myers who was in charge of the department's trade investigations in the early 1980's, said, "There is no question the courts have been cracking the whip."
Commerce Department officials declined to comment on the charges of bias. But people familiar with the department say that Congress, and, in particular, Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, have grown increasingly influential in the department's day-to-day thinking.
The Hollings staff is not shy about his involvement: "He's an 800-pound tiger out there making sure the dumping laws are enforced," said Andy Brack, a spokesman.
Defenders of the Commerce Department, the primary enforcing arm, dismiss the criticism as special pleading. "What you are getting is a lot of posturing" in the debate over a new international anti-dumping code during the current round of global trade talks, one senior Government official said.
American law protects domestic industries from foreign competition by means ranging from high import tariffs (shoes) to strict quotas (clothing) to outright bans on sales (coastal shipping services). But the backbone of the system is the series of rules to penalize "unfair trade." The most heavily used of these is the rule against dumping.
 
Rule Increasingly Used
 With hindsight, growing friction over anti-dumping cases is not difficult to explain. Modestly conceived as an antitrust measure to prevent foreigners from strangling domestic industries in the crib, dumping restrictions have grown ever broader in response to interest-group pressures.
Like most countries, the American law assumes that the practice of selling abroad below the price charged back home is inherently unfair. But the American law goes much further, adding a prohibition against sales at less than "fair market value," defined as the average cost of production, plus a 10 percent overhead, plus an 8 percent profit margin.
If the Commerce Department finds that dumping has occurred and another Federal agency, the United States International Trade Commission, decides that American competitors have been injured, penalties equal to the "dumping margin" are assessed.
Few economists see the logic in barring price-cutting where there is no intent to deliver a knockout punch. American consumers, after all, benefit from aggressive pricing. Fewer still would defend the cost-based definition of fair market value. Domestic industries routinely sell below average cost to minimize losses in bad years. Indeed, every American company that suffers losses is selling below average cost, and thus is "dumping" in its home market.
The dumping law is "just not sensible," concluded Seth Kaplan, director of economic research at Trade Resources Inc. in Washington.
 
Tit-for-Tat Law
 But few would argue that Congress is disappointed with the impact. And the marketing handicap created by the anti-dumping law is widely justified as tit for tat: "The law is less biased against imports than the European Community and Canadian system," contends James Cannon, a lawyer at the Washington firm of Stewart & Stewart.
What is in dispute, though, is the fairness of the procedures used by the Commerce Department to assess dumping charges. This issue, strangely enough, has its origins in Washington's response to the opposite complaint -- that the Treasury Department, which was initially charged with enforcement, had too much invested in maintaining good relations with foreign governments. Congress transferred responsibility to the Commerce Department in 1979, Mr. Cannon said, because "Congressmen didn't want everyone with an import problem camping on their doorsteps."
But if the Treasury is reflexively pro-foreigner, critics say, the Commerce Department has a weakness for the home team. "Many people in Commerce now see themselves as advocates for domestic business," said Ronald Cass, dean of the Boston University Law School and a former member of the United States International Trade Commission.
 
Commerce Has 'Gone Native'
 Greg Estell of the Precision Metalforming Association, a group of smaller companies that use imported steel, puts it more colorfully: "The folks at Commerce have gone native," he concluded.
One complaint is that the Commerce Department increasingly chooses to compare apples and oranges when it compares foreign and domestic prices. To determine foreign market value, the department takes an average price on sales back home over a six-month period. But to compute the difference between that value and the American price, the department can -- and increasingly does -- compare this average with specific individual sales -- rather than an average across all sales -- in America.
Mr. Bovard charges that the department now also ignores the impact of artificially pegged currency exchange rates when it suits the protectionist cause. In 1989, he notes, it calculated a 259 percent dumping margin on Venezuelan exports of aluminum sulfate because it translated costs at the official rate of 14.5 bolivars to the dollar rather than the 39.5 rate that the Venezuelan company could obtain on the free market.
Defendants in dumping cases are obliged to provide enormous amounts of information on the prices they charge and, frequently, on their costs of production. The information must be in English, must conform to the Commerce Department's accounting criteria, must be available in computer-readable form -- and typically must be submitted within weeks of the request.
"It's time-consuming and it's expensive," concedes Mike Stein, a lawyer at Dewey Ballantine in Washington, which generally represents petitioners. But he says it is the only way to resolve complaints quickly and judiciously.
 
Hurdles for Foreigners
 Cynics, however, see the ever-growing demands for information in ever-more-precisely specified formats as hurdles that foreign producers are not really meant to overcome. For if the Commerce Department is not satisfied with the response, it uses the "best information available" -- what Tracy Murray, an economist at the University of Arkansas, notes is usually information provided by the domestic industry fighting for protection.
Small companies may not have the wherewithal to meet the Commerce Department's requests. But most foreign steel exporters are not small, and in most cases are far better off providing the data than relying on the kindness of their adversaries to fill the vacuum. It thus surprised even the grizzled veterans of the dumping wars when the Commerce Department found 31 out of 36 submissions inadequate in the recent steel cases -- cases that led to assessments of dumping margins as high as 109 percent.
Trade law, moreover, is highly specialized administrative law; it takes months simply to master the accounting procedures used in measuring fair market value. And since the mid-1980's, some critics say, there has been no counterweight to the protectionist sentiments of political appointees.
Opinion, unsurprisingly, is divided over the consequences of the Commerce Department's apparent inclination to play hardball with foreign competitors. Mr. Cannon, a lawyer for domestic industry, thinks turnabout is fair play: "For years," he said, "we fought against a bias favoring respondents."
Mr. Bovard, who worries that American businesses are being deprived of needed imported supplies, calls it "an industrial policy from hell." Mr. Horlick, the former department trade investigator, believes any partisanship ignores the interests of American exporters, who are potential targets for retaliation.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Oil Up as OPEC Sets Talks; Floods Raise Other Prices

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Oil prices rebounded from a three-year low yesterday after OPEC announced that it would hold an emergency meeting next week to try to halt the recent slide in crude prices.
On other commodity markets, pork belly, hog, grain and soybean futures posted gains in reaction to the flooding in the Midwest. 
 Light sweet crude oil for August delivery settled 49 cents higher at $17.70 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after recovering from an opening plunge to $16.75, the lowest price for near-term deliveries since July 10, 1990.
Crude oil futures have dropped from nearly $21 to less than $17 in the last 10 weeks. With yesterday's whipsaw action, "it has all the earmarks of a market that's reversed and put in its final lows," said Tom Bentz, director of energy trading with Quantum Financial Services in New York.
The 12-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries called the emergency talks after a price slide steepened last week on reports that Iraq was near agreement with the United Nations to sell $1.6 billion worth of crude.
 
U.S. Refineries Near Capacity
 Iraq, once one of the world's largest oil producers, has been barred from exporting crude since its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
Gerald E. Samuels, managing director of ARB Oil Inc. in Los Angeles, said oil prices had also been under pressure as a result of weekly industry reports that show United States refineries operating near capacity, an indication of plentiful supplies.
Among other energy contracts, wholesale heating oil for August delivery surged 1.66 cents, to 50.50 cents a gallon; wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 1.32 cents, to 52.66 cents a gallon; wholesale natural gas dropped 4.3 cents, to $2.024 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Elsewhere, on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, most pork belly contracts soared the permitted daily limit of 2 cents a pound and hog futures also rose on signs that flooding along the Mississippi and other Midwestern rivers is slowing the movement of hogs to market. July hogs climbed 0.63 cent, to 47.70 cents a pound, while July frozen pork bellies surged 1.57 cents, to 42.42 cents a pound.
Soybean futures pressed higher on the Chicago Board of Trade, buoyed in part by forecasts for more rain in the Midwest. Most grain futures also ended higher. July soybeans rose 9 1/2 cents, to $7.34 a bushel.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Closes Mostly Lower But Has Gains Against Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar moved lower against European currencies yesterday, but it strengthened against the Japanese yen. Some traders attributed the decline of the yen to the inconclusive outcome of the Japanese elections.
Gold prices rose slightly overseas, but later weakened in New York. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the actively traded gold contract for August delivery slipped 50 cents an ounce, to $392.40. The Republic National Bank quoted spot gold at $391.20, down $1.05 an ounce. 
 Currency brokers said the foreign exchange market was quiet, with no significant economic news to influence the dollar's direction.
In New York, the dollar was quoted at 108.46 yen late yesterday, up from 107.55 yen late Friday. But the dollar fell to 1.7063 German marks, from 1.7160 marks on Friday. And the British pound rose to $1.4985, from $1.4860 on Friday.
Most of the trading in Europe was characterized by the absence of aggressive speculators in the weak European currencies. That speculation had contributed to the dollar's allure as a safe-haven currency last week.
The Danish krone and French franc are considered the most vulnerable links now in the Exchange Rate Mechanism, an arrangement intended to keep the worth of European currencies within preset ranges.
The arrangement is increasingly viewed as an unrealistic way to uphold currency value, especially in view of Europe's deepenening economic malaise.
"There was less tension in the European system today, which had been giving the dollar a little underlying support," said Hillel Waxman, chief foreign exchange dealer at the New York branch of the Bank Leumi Trust Company. "I think it's a breather day."
In Japan, the lack of a decisive outcome to Sunday's election played a role in the mild strengthening of the dollar, which had been steadily reaching record lows against the yen in recent weeks.
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's refusal to resign after voters ended the Liberal Democrats' majority rule only made the situation more confusing.
"It was a muted reaction," said Paul Stancs, a trader at the New York office of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., Japan's biggest bank. "There was no wild activity in the dollar. This was pretty much anticipated."

HEADLINE: Japan Businesses See Little Threat in Vote Results

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 19

 BODY:
One day after voters ended 38 years of conservative rule by the Liberal Democratic Party, Japan's business sector has begun concluding that the election results could turn out to be more of a benefit than a threat to the dominance of their interests in the nation's politics.
The voting patterns, business leaders said today, show that while the Japanese people might desire political change, they want economic continuity and an essentially pro-business conservative government. They interpreted the results as showing that Japanese want an end to the corruption of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, but are hesitant to depart from policies that have guided Japan from postwar ruin to industrial powerhouse. 
 At a news conference today, Shoichiro Toyoda, the chairman of Toyota, hailed the election results as the first step toward "a healthy two-party system in Japan," and said the results show that the Japanese are expecting "a continuation of the basic policies of the L.D.P."
 
No Quick Economic Changes
 If this reading is accurate, the election results mean that Japan Inc., that combination of big business and government support that is admired and feared by the rest of the world, is unlikely to be swept away by the tides of political reform. They suggest that any changes in Japanese economic policies, including greater opening of its markets to imports as the United States is hoping for, are likely to emerge only gradually.
In Sunday's balloting, the Liberal Democratic Party, widely viewed as corrupt, lost the majority in the lower house of Parliament that it has held for 38 years. But the parties that gained at its expense were not traditional opposition parties like the Socialists, who are viewed as anti-business. In fact, the Socialists suffered a worse drubbing than the Liberal Democrats, losing nearly half their seats in Parliament.
Rather, the parties that gained are conservative new groups formed by defectors from the Liberal Democratic Party. The result is that there are more conservatives in Parliament than ever.
"Now the business community does not have to worry about opposition parties coming to power that are simply anti-business," Gerald L. Curtis, a professor at Columbia University's East Asian Institute, said during a panel discussion in Tokyo today.
 
Fear of Paralysis
 To be sure, there are risks ahead. Political paralysis could mean that important economic decisions will not be made. Such inaction could affect as new efforts to stimulate Japan's sagging economy through a cut in income taxes, or to continue trade negotiations with the United States.
"Should the political parties make a point of engaging in scrambles for power by ignoring these pressing problems, the nation's politics would certainly cause the Japanese public and the international community to despair," Yomiuri Shimbun, the nation's largest newspaper, said in an editorial today.
Still, the financial markets reacted with relative equanimity to voting results that had been fairly well predicted by public opinion polls. The Tokyo stock market's Nikkei average of 225 selected issues dropped 180.61 points, less than one percent. The yen gained strength against the dollar.
Since businesses have thrived under one-party rule, it might seem unusual that they would want two parties, especially if that means that they will have to grease the palms of two different sets of politicians.
But some businessmen say having two parties would be an improvement, provided that both parties are conservative. They hope to play off one party against the other to gain more leverage.
 
Demands for Efficiency
 There has been a feeling that the Liberal Democratic Party, having grown arrogant, had not been responding efficiently recently to the nation's economic troubles. Many businessmen were warning last year that the nation was slipping into recession for months before the Government finally took action to try to stimulate the economy.
Another factor that portends slow change in business and economic policies is that with politicians jockeying to form coalitions, Japan's powerful bureaucrats will gain even more power over the running of the nation than they already have.
"I guess economic and trade policies will be left to the bureaucracy for the time being," a Government official said. He said that even after a governing bloc emerges and a prime minister is chosen, legislators will be concerned with political reform, not economic matters.
Nor is it entirely clear what policies the new parties would want to change, even if they could.
Some of the new parties, particularly the Japan New Party, have expressed a desire to deregulate the economy, something that some companies would welcome. Over-regulation is considered one reason that Japan is behind the United States in areas like cable television and satellite broadcasting.
 
Few With Clear Policies
 They also talk about favoring consumers at the expense of producers, though not to the extent that they would open Japan's rice markets to cheaper imports. But most of the parties have yet to clearly enunciate their economic policies.
"All these parties are saying 'Clean government,' but clean government is not a policy," said Kazuo Nukazawa, an official of the Keidanren, Japan's most powerful business lobbying group.
One big issue that will come to the fore in the next few months will be whether the government will cut income taxes to help Japan recover from its worst recession in two decades.
Most of the political parties have expressed support for an income tax cut, in some cases even if it means enduring a national budget deficit. But the Ministry of Finance, which places a high priority on avoiding the budget deficits that are weakening the United States, is against this. It might agree to cut income taxes only if a consumption tax is raised. It remains to be seen whether a political coalition will be able to enforce its will on the powerful ministry.

HEADLINE: U.S.-North Korea Meeting Yields Some Gains on Arms

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, July 19

 BODY:
The United States and North Korea agreed tonight to several steps to ease international fears about North Korea's nuclear weapons-making ability but failed to resolve their dispute over an American demand for inspections of two suspected sites of nuclear materials.
The two sides ended their latest round of talks with a commitment from North Korea to discuss the inspections with the International Atomic Energy Agency. The North Koreans also said they had discussed the possibility of the United States' helping North Korea replace its nuclear reactors with reactors that are less capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium. 
 In addition, North Korea said it would seek high-level talks with South Korea on issues including nuclear weapons. North Korea has denied that it is developing nuclear arms.
 
Still Far Apart
 Robert L. Gallucci, the Assistant Secretary of State who headed the United States delegation, said the countries remained far apart on the fundamental issues. But after months in which North Korea appeared unwilling to accept much in the way of compromise, he said the progress made here was "a small but significant step" in eliminating the risk of the spread of nuclear weapons in Asia.
The talks were the latest chapter in an escalating dispute with North Korea, one of the last Stalinist countries in the world. On a visit to South Korea earlier this month, President Clinton said the United States would "quickly and overwhelmingly retaliate" if North Korea developed and used a nuclear weapon.
Clinton Administration aides have suggested that if North Korea does not agree to international inspections and other steps, the United States might request that the United Nations impose economic sanctions.
The Central Intelligence Agency has said that North Korea may have produced enough plutonium for one nuclear bomb, although some intelligence officials say it may not have developed sufficient technology to produce the bomb itself.
At a news conference tonight, Mr. Gallucci said that another round of negotiations could be held within two months if North Korea lives up to its commitment to begin discussions with South Korea and with the atomic energy agency, the international watchdog for nuclear proliferation.
 
Still Opposing Inspections
 But it was unclear how far North Korea would be willing to go in meeting the concerns of the United States and the United Nations. Kang Sok Ju, the North Korean First Deputy Foreign Minister, said here tonight that the atomic energy agency had failed to be impartial in assessing his nation's nuclear program. His comments suggested that North Korea would continue to oppose the agency's demands for inspections of two nuclear waste sites that the United States believes would shed considerable light on the state of the country's nuclear program.
Mr. Kang also pointedly rejected another demand of the United States, that North Korea clearly commit itself to continued adherence to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. North Korea said in March that it would withdraw from the treaty, which seeks to ban the spread of nuclear weapons. But after talks with the United States last month, North Korea said it would "suspend" its withdrawal pending further negotiations.
The biggest surprise from this latest round of talks, which began with two sessions last week and ended with a 55-minute meeting between Mr. Gallucci and Mr. Kang at the United States mission this evening, was the suggestion that the United States might help North Korea shift to a less-threatening type of nuclear-power technology.
In their communique, the two countries said it would be desirable for North Korea to replace its graphite-moderated reactors, with light-water-moderated reactors.
 
Dependent on Others
 Mr. Gallucci said the light-water technology is less-well-suited for production of nuclear weapons materials. In addition, he said, a shift by North Korea to light-water reactors would make it dependent on other countries for the enriched uranium used to fuel them, since North Korea does not have the ability to produce that type of uranium. Mr. Gallucci said any country with light-water reactors is less likely to withdraw from international agreements on nuclear proliferation because it would then find it difficult or impossible to purchase the uranium needed to keep its reactors going.
Although the United States agreed in the negotiations to help North Korea if it moved to light-water technology, Mr. Gallucci said no assistance would be forthcoming until North Korea had "unambiguously complied" with its obligations under international agreements.
At the apparent insistence of the North Korean Government, the United States repeated previous assurances it has made of its commitment not to use force against North Korea, and specifically not to use nuclear weapons. But the United States withheld a concession it has long laid out as a bargaining chip: cancellation of annual military exercises that are jointly conducted by American and South Korean forces.
 
Differing Concerns
 Mr. Kang said the talks had been productive. But his list of North Korea's concerns was far different from that of the United States, and it primarily concerned what Mr. Kang said was the bias of the atomic energy agency against his country and North Korea's concerns for its security. His country, Mr. Kang said, "has no intention at all of developing nuclear weapons."
He said he hoped that South Korea would soon agree to a meeting of high-level envoys to prepare a full-fledged meeting between the two countries. He said that North Korea expected the United States, South Korea and the United Nations to "move simultaneously" with North Korea in meeting their obligations under international agreements.
North Korea's willingness to commit itself fully to remaining within the nonproliferation treaty would depend "on the degree to which he nuclear threat to the D.P.R.K. and the partiality of the I.A.E.A. will be eliminated," Mr. Kang said, using the initials for North Korea and the atomic energy agency.

HEADLINE: Arms Sales to Third World At Lowest Level in 8 Years

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19

 BODY:
Arms sales to the third world last year fell to their lowest levels since at least 1985, primarily because Russia's sales hit record lows, the Congressional Research Service reported today.
Sales from Russia to the third world plummeted to $1.3 billion. Sales from the Soviet Union were $5.9 billion in 1991, and reached a high of $28.8 billion in 1986. Russia was by far the largest arms producer and exporter of the Soviet republics. 
 Over all, arms sales to the third world dropped 20 percent to $23.9 billion, from $28.6 billion in 1991, measured in constant 1992 dollars. United States sales to third-world countries fell slightly, to $13.6 billion from $14 billion in 1991, but Washington's share of sales increased to 57 percent from 49 percent in 1991. It was the third consecutive year that the United States was the largest weapons broker to third-world nations.
Richard F. Grimmett, who prepares the report each year, said the reasons for the reduction in arms sales included the end of the cold war and the reduction, especially by Moscow, of military aid programs that granted deep discounts to cold war clients.
 
Source of Hard Currency
 But arms exports remain a primary source of hard currency for Russia in sustaining political and economic reforms, and the Russians has sought customers that can pay cash, like Iran. In addition, Moscow has sought to drum up business with China, a former adversary that wants advanced weaponry, and India, a longtime client that has eagerly pursued deals for Russian missile technology.
The new sales have raised concerns among American officials, who worry that their efforts to curb the spread of advanced weapons could be undermined by Russia's need for cash.
At the same time, nearly 90 percent of the American sales came from three major deals involving advanced weapons. Taiwan agreed to buy 150 F-16 fighter jets. Saudi Arabia bought 12 Patriot anti-missile batteries, as well as bombs and missiles for Saudi aircraft. Kuwait bought six Patriot and six Hawk anti-missile batteries.
In addition, Mr. Grimmett said organizations like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund had encouraged third-world nations to reduce their military spending as a condition of economic aid.
 
Report to Congress
 The report, delivered to Congress today, is based on data supplied by the Defense Department and American intelligence agencies. It tracks arms sales between 1985 and 1992.
On the strength of the sale of 60 Mirage 2000 jets to Taiwan, France last year sold $3.8 billion of arms to third-world countries, up from $2.8 billion in 1991. Britain, the third-leading arms exporter to the third world, increased its sales last year to $2.4 billion from $2 billion.
The Middle East remains the largest arms market in the third world. The region accounted for 38 percent of all sales between 1989 and 1992. Asia is the second-largest market, with 29.5 percent in the same period.
Saudi Arabia has been the largest customer, ordering $35.9 billion in arms from 1989 to 1992, or about 30 percent of all weapons sold to the third world.

Ahmanson Says It Expects to Show a Loss

 BODY:
H. F. Ahmanson & Company, the nation's largest savings and loan holding company, announced yesterday that it expected to report a $290 million loss for the second quarter as a result of its sale of about $1.2 billion in seriously delinquent real estate loans to Bear, Stearns & Company.
The loans were sold for approximately $900 million, or 71 to 76 percent of their face value, the company said. 
 Ahmanson, the parent of Home Savings of America, also said it would add $163 million to its reserves for some real estate development projects, increasing its total development reserve to $317 million.
 
Acquisition Plans
 The company expects to raise $200 million in capital, most likely through a stock sale next month, placing it in a better position to acquire Home Federal Savings, a San Diego institution that was taken over by the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal bailout agency, said Richard H. Deihl, chairman and chief executive of Ahmanson.
Ahmanson's announcement apparently did not come as a surprise to Wall Street. The company's shares gained 50 cents, to $19.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.
The sale of the real estate loans is part of a long-term strategy of clearing out nonperforming assets. The loans were for single-family homes in California and were more than 90 days overdue.
"The reason we did this," Mr. Deihl said, "is primarily because the price we got was about the same as the loss we would have recognized if we kept those assets on the books for the foreclosure process."
Bear, Stearns declined to comment on the transaction.
As a result of the second-quarter loss, the company also expects to post an annual loss, even though it anticipates being profitable in the second half of the year.
The bulk sale dropped Ahmanson's nonperforming assets from 5.02 percent of total assets last fall to 2.04 percent. The company's ratio of reserves to nonperforming loans is expected to rise to about 129.3 percent from 27.8 percent on March 31.
As more financial institutions have chosen to purge their books of sour commercial and industrial real estate loans and assets, bulk sales at steep discounts have become frequent. But Jerry Gitt, a savings and loan analyst with Merrill Lynch in San Francisco, said this was the first time he had seen a bulk sale of delinquent single-family loans in California.
 
Advantages Are Seen
 "The recession was worse than expected, markets eroded dramatically, but at least Ahmanson has bitten the bullet," Mr. Gitt said. "Its dividend is not in jeopardy, and now it will have enough capital to bid for other companies."
Mr. Deihl said that Ahmanson expected a turnaround in California's real estate market within the next 12 months and that the bulk sale, expected to close within 44 days, would accelerate the company's phasing out of real estate development ventures and renew an emphasis on single-family residential lending.
To raise the $200 million, Mr. Gitt said he expected the company to issue either common stock, convertible preferred stock or preferred stock. "If the stock doesn't budge from 19 or 20, then they'll have a choice," Mr. Gitt said.

Horrors, or, Why Monsters Are So Appealing

The Monster Show
A Cultural History of Horror
By David J. Skal
Illustrated. 432 pages. W. W. Norton. $25. 
 As America slouches toward the end of the century and the beginning of a new millennium, our cultural landscape fills with monsters and demons: bionic killers ("Terminator 2"), blood-gulping vampires ("Bram Stoker's Dracula"), scar-faced slashers ("Nightmare on Elm Street" and sequels 2, 3, 4 and 5) and ghoulish families with a taste for humorous necrophilia ("The Addams Family").
Even as Congress debates escalating levels of prime-time gore, Americans continue to indulge a taste for horror. "The Silence of the Lambs," featuring a brilliant killer with an appetite for human flesh, cleaned up at last year's Academy Awards, and "Jurassic Park," a sort of high-tech "King Kong" starring bio-engineered dinosaurs, seems destined to become one of the highest-grossing movies ever made. Stephen King's literary carnivals of terror and Anne Rice's vampire sagas routinely dominate the best-seller lists; and heavy metal rock, with its lyrics of blood and death, attracts millions of devoted fans.
In his lively new book "The Monster Show," David J. Skal asserts that this renaissance of horror is directly related to the country's current economic woes and fears about a failing safety net and a changing world, a state of affairs remarkably similar to the mood that prevailed in the 1930's, the decade that witnessed the birth of the modern horror film. In fact it is Mr. Skal's contention that horror entertainment in all its myriad forms is both a mirror of social anxieties and a cathartic outlet promising transcendence and escape.
Mr. Skal is the author of an earlier book about the legend of Dracula ("Hollywood Gothic: The Tangled Web of 'Dracula' From Novel to Stage to Screen"), and he writes in this volume as both a scholar and a horror aficionado. His discursive narrative is peppered with chatty anecdotes about the making of various monster movies and entertaining digressions about such famous masters of horror as Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, Stephen King and Tod Browning, the director of "Freaks."
Whereas the scholar Walter Kendrick focused nearly exclusively on the metaphysical roots of horror in his recent book "The Thrill of Fear" -- he argued that modern man's preoccupation with scary entertainment stems from the decline of religion and the loss of faith in a heavenly afterlife -- Mr. Skal is more interested in the relationship between horror and specific social and technological developments. He has an unfortunate tendency to look at everything through a darkly colored, voyeuristic lens, and this tendency results in some bizarre and tasteless asides: he dwells, quite unnecessarily, on the embarrassing sexual details of Jean Harlow's wedding night; and at one point, gratuitously declares that Ronald Reagan "seems to have had a deep affinity, personal and professional, for castration imagery," a curious statement based solely on the fact that the former President once played an amputee in the movie "King's Row."
When Mr. Skal contains himself and sticks to the subject at hand, however, the results can be both provocative and illuminating. As he sees it, modern horror (articulated in German movies like "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari," from 1919, and "Nosferatu," 1921) grew out of the horrors of death, mutilation and dislocation wrought by World War I. It wasn't long, he says, before the specter of maimed war veterans had resulted in an outpouring of movies with physically disfigured heroes, including "The Penalty" (1920), "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" (1923) and "The Phantom of the Opera" (1925).
In America, he goes on, horror reached a new peak during the years of the Great Depression, years that witnessed the production of four horror classics: "Dracula" (1931), "Frankenstein" (1931), "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" (1932) and "Freaks" (1932). Although the "perceptible, if unintended, metaphors of economic and class warfare" that Mr. Skal discerns in these films aren't terribly obvious to the casual observer, it's easy enough to see how they reflected a nation's heightened anxieties about economic emasculation and the false promises of progress.
World War II, Mr. Skal says, brought another wave of horror films, many of which turned the dehumanizing events of that conflagration into stories about werewolves ("The Wolf Man"), cat people ("Cat People") and beast-men ("Island of Lost Souls"). The imagery in such films, he argues, can be compared to the fractured portraits of the human body offered by the Cubists and the monstrous visions of the painter Francis Bacon.
As for the 50's, two major fears (fear of the atomic bomb and fear of Communists) prevailed, and two types of horror movie dominated the box office: movies about giant monsters (no doubt the result of mutations from atomic testing) like "Godzilla," "It Came From Beneath the Sea" and "Them"; and movies about alien assaults like "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" and "Invaders From Mars." "A striking characteristic of 50's horror," Mr. Skal writes, "is its ambivalence about the good life, and the tenuous nature of material security and social identity. In film after film, people have their personalities stolen, are trapped inside or driven screaming from their flimsy homes, so easily demolished by monsters or other forces."
Classic horror films like "Dracula" and "Frankenstein," Mr. Skal points out, often deal with artificial means of reproduction or regeneration; and the sexual revolution of the 60's and 70's helped put a gruesome spin on this theme, yielding movies like "Rosemary's Baby," "It's Alive" and "The Brood," which featured monstrous babies and unnatural births. The AIDS epidemic in the 80's similarly led to an upsurge in movies and books about vampires, frightening yet oddly reassuring figures, in Mr. Skal's view, who represent both "a dreaded plague-death" and the possibility of transcending it.
In fact, for Mr. Skal, this is the ultimate appeal of monsters: all of them, he says, from Dracula to Frankenstein to Freddy Kreuger, are resurrection figures in the end, creatures capable of surviving firing squads, atomic bombs and human avengers, free to live perpetually in the audience's imagination, if not another host of sequels.

HEADLINE: Satellite A White Elephant, Some Say

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., July 17

 BODY:
As the Clinton Administration prods the $70-billion-a-year Federal research complex into doing more to help American business devise new technologies, experts say it should heed the muddle surrounding a $600 million Federal satellite. The craft is expected to be placed into orbit in the next week or so after the delayed mission of the space shuttle Discovery gets off the ground.
The Advanced Communications Technology Satellite, or ACTS, which was under development by NASA for more than a decade, is a 47-foot, high-technology wonder packed with the latest gear. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration hails it as the first of a new generation of lightning-fast communications craft for the 21st century. 
 That may be the case. But so far the celestial experiment has generated little or no interest among its main targets -- American satellite builders, who say its gadgetry is either irrelevant to their needs or coming along far too late to be of any use.
Industry giants like Hughes, TRW and Loral, which collectively dominate the world market in communications satellites, have all ignored ACTS, which is available to would-be experimenters at no charge. Those who have signed up to test the spacecraft and its features are academic and governmental experts as well as companies on the fringes of the satellite industry.
Private analysts say ACTS is a case study in Federal myopia. They note that the craft was planned just as the rising attractiveness of fiber-optic cables on the ground began to bring much of the telecommunications industry crashing back to Earth.
More generally, many economists say Federal officials lack the knowledge to predict what technologies will succeed in the marketplace and are never canny with taxpayer money, unlike entrepreneurs who risk their own. Such defects, they say, make Federal industrial policies all too prone to producing white elephants.
Officials of the space agency vigorously defend ACTS, saying that its experiments are important and represent the kind of futuristic risk-taking that only governments can afford. The craft has attracted few major players from industry, they say, because its rocky history of ups and downs in financing slowed its development and frightened away potential users.
"People were never sure we were real, because of funding cutbacks," said Rodney M. Knight, an ACTS manager at NASA's Lewis Research Center in Cleveland. "But I think they see we're real now and will get involved. They cannot afford to lose the business edge."
The spacecraft has 71 experiments so far, Mr. Knight said, noting that there was still limited room for serious proposals. Some existing tests by NASA centers appear to be rather frivolous and are perhaps there simply to fill up vacancies. In contrast, NASA scientific satellites like the Hubble Space Telescope or the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory usually attract a large surplus of experimental proposals.
"It's lemon socialism," said John E. Pike, head of space policy at the Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington. "With ACTS, the Government is funding stuff the market has rejected. It's a case study in how Federal efforts to enhance American competitiveness can go awry."
The tribulations of the project are seen as a vivid lesson for the Clinton Administration, which came into office pledging to shift tens of billions of dollars from Federal programs that forge armaments into ones that foster civil industries. The Administration's aim is to flood the economy with innovative goods and services, lifting the general level of prosperity and strengthening American industry for international trade wars.
The seeds of the project were sown in the late 1970's as the space agency predicted rapid growth of the satellite communications industry. Such craft sit mainly in 22,300-mile-high orbits that are stationary relative to Earth's surface. From those geosynchronous orbits, they relay signals around the globe. To eliminate projected crowding on frequencies used to transmit signals, NASA proposed an experimental craft, ACTS, that would operate in the virgin territory of higher frequencies.
The tactic was a common one. The 20th century has seen radio, television and satellite broadcasts all march up the electromagnetic spectrum to ever-higher frequencies. The expansion is hard to achieve technically but offers great rewards, since higher frequencies can transmit far greater amounts of information.
Satellites normally use the C band, at 4 and 6 gigahertz, and the Ku band, at 11 and 14 gigahertz. A hertz is a unit of frequency equaling one cycle per second. A gigahertz is a billion hertz. A radio wave at the frequency of a gigahertz vibrates so rapidly that, while moving past a stationary point, it goes through a billion up-and-down cycles a second.
What NASA envisioned was a satellite operating in the Ka band, at 20 gigahertz and 30 gigahertz. This electromagnetic wilderness has 2.5 gigahertz of spectrum available, or five times what is used by conventional satellites at lower frequencies. It is, electromagnetically at least, wide open for exploitation.
The higher frequency also meant ACTS could use smaller ground stations, as permitted by the laws of electromagnetic coupling. The antennas could be four feet across and possibly smaller.
 
Rain as an Obstacle
 The substantial risk in all this was rain. High-frequency signals like those of the Ka band are cut off or severely degraded by clouds and rain showers, while lower frequency signals blast right through to geosynchronous orbit and back again. The higher the frequency, the greater the risk. The daunting challenge to ACTS was to find ways to eliminate rain fade, otherwise no company would ever want to use the Ka band for geosynchronous satellites, given the prospect of constant interruptions.
"ACTS is to do hands-on experiments with this attenuation and techniques for combating it," said Mr. Knight of NASA. "We may not solve the problems completely, but we'll understand them far better. And we think that's a valuable resource for future satellite-system designers."
But industry officials faulted most of NASA's analyses, even as ACTS gained momentum in the late 1970's and early 1980's. In May 1980, Dr. Arno Penzias, a Nobel laureate at A.T.& T. Bell Laboratories, told the House science committee that A.T.& T. had investigated the rain-fade problem of the Ka band on its Comstar satellites at its own expense.
"We don't like what we see," he said. Indeed, A.T.& T. dropped plans to use the Ka band because of that problem, because of the expense of developing the new technology and, most important of all, because it saw no need for new transmission bands given the increasing use of fiber-optic cables and new ways to pack more signals into existing frequencies.
The Federal Communications Commission, which assigns transmission frequencies, agreed, telling Congress in 1980 that crowding arguments were "largely subjective and based on little analysis."
Despite such appraisals, ACTS found favor with Congressional patrons who worried about America's eroding technical edge and rising foreign competition. Even repeated attacks by the free-market enthusiasts of the Reagan Administration failed to stop it, although its budget zigged and zagged over the years. In 1984, Dr. George A. Keyworth 2d, the Presidential science adviser, said that he could "not understand why the Federal Government should expend funds to demonstrate 20-30 gigahertz technology when industry has an enormous profit incentive."
As ACTS moved ahead by fits and starts, always teetering on the brink of extinction, foreign governments launched their own Ka-band test satellites faster than NASA. "Japan and Europe have spent an enormous amount of money on this and nobody knows what it's good for," Mr. Pike said.
So too, the ACTS program has experienced a hard time signing up experiments since it began soliciting them in 1985. Today the tests consist of a hodgepodge of the serious and not-so-serious. American Express will relay data between its sites in Phoenix and Mexico City. Ohio University will help the Huntington Bank of Columbus, Ohio, relay data to one of its check processing centers in a suburb of Cleveland.
NASA's Kennedy Space Center here in Florida plans a video link with a California center to train employees in handling hazardous materials. And NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston will relay interior images of the human eyeball to test remote medical diagnosis.
NBC will relay images from remote news-gathering sites. The Communications Satellite Corporation of Washington, a major participant in the communications business and an ACTS contractor, will test the general system.
And the NASA Lewis Research Center, the home of ACTS, will perform a bevy of tests to see how well the whole thing works in the rain.
Mr. Knight of the Lewis center said ways to fight rain attenuation included coding schemes that reconstructed lost data, power boosting that blasted through rain clouds, and geographically separating earth stations, to lower odds of rain interruption.
In a news release on ACTS, NASA said, "Technology spinoff is already occurring" and named a company, Norris Communications, that it said was preparing to build a Ka-band communications satellite. But there are some doubts about the seriousness of this action.
Based in Red Lion, Pa., Norris Communications is a small company owned by John H. Norris, who also runs local radio and television stations there, as well as the Keystone Inspirational Network. According to Gordon Moul, a company salesman, Keystone, which is now distributed by rented satellite,is "a religious-Christian program source for cable-TV stations interested in family programming."
Neither Mr. Moul nor anyone else reached at the company knew when the satellite might be built or launched. Attempts to reach Mr. Norris were unsuccessful.
Commercial satellite builders do have some interest in the Ka band, but not where ACTS is testing it, 22,300 miles above Earth. In much lower orbits Ka-band signals are powerful enough to cut through rain clouds without fancy equipment or techniques. Thus, Motorola, which has no experience building whole satellites, is eyeing the Ka band for operating some aspects of its proposed Iridium system of global wireless telephony. The Iridium satellites are to fly in orbits 483 miles high.
 
Company's Lack of Interest
 Montye Male, public affairs director for the TRW Space & Electronics Group, based in Redondo Beach, Calif., said TRW had investigated the Ka band on its own and had no interest in doing experiments on ACTS, even though access was free.
"Why invest the time when you think you've done a lot of research on your own?" she asked.
Analysts say a moral of the ACTS story is that Government should tread very gingerly when it tries to help industry technically and that any aid programs that do materialize should be structured so that businesses pay a substantial part of the costs, creating an opening for the discipline of market mechanisms. Otherwise, they say, the white elephants are likely to multiply.

HEADLINE: The High Risks of Denying Rivers Their Flood Plains

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
FOR decades Americans have insisted on settling next to rivers and streams, like moths drawn to a flame, just as people have throughout history. And to protect their cities and farms, engineers have tried to ward off the inevitable flood waters with levees, flood walls, dams, dikes and diversion channels. To some extent this ambitious attempt to bend nature to human desires has worked.
But nature still wins often enough, as this month's destructive floods in the upper Mississippi valley vividly testify. Even the gains have come at enormous cost to the ecology of flood plains, some experts say, and in some cases control measures have perversely resulted in worse flooding. 
 By cutting off the flood plain's waters, levees and diversion channels have destroyed and degraded stream-side habitats that contain some of the country's richest biological resources. They have also prevented the flood plain from performing one of its most important natural functions: flood control. By storing and slowing flood waters, the plain reduces their force and height. Containing this water in a narrowly corseted channel, as is commonly done to protect farms and urban settlements, has the opposite effect. It raises both the velocity and the height of the flood and makes it all the more frightening and destructive when it breaks through defenses, as it has repeatedly done in the Midwest.
These realizations are leading flood- plain managers at all levels of government toward a different approach: cooperating with nature rather than trying to subdue it. The emphasis increasingly is on keeping new development away from the flood plain, preserving or restoring its ecosystems and letting water flow as freely as possible so that natural flood-control mechanisms can work.
Across the country, states and communities are exploring alternatives to dikes, levees and flood walls. They are acquiring wetlands to serve as natural flood basins. They are sculpturing the plain to create detention areas for flood waters. They are preserving stretches of flood plain in urban areas which, in between periods of high water, serve as parks, ball fields and greenways. Some communities are discouraging new development on flood plains by requiring expensive flood-proofing measures, such as putting buildings on piers and constructing private detention ponds. One town, Soldiers Grove, Wis., has taken the radical step of moving its entire business district to higher ground.
"For too long we've been trying to adjust rivers to human needs, and then we wonder why our rivers are messed up and why we continue to get flooded; it's not a mystery," said Larry Larson, director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers, an organization of professionals engaged in flood-plain management and flood control. "We need to adjust human behavior to river systems."
Sometimes, he said, this means that developed areas "need to be cleared out so the river can flood, as we know it will, without damaging property." In other instances less drastic measures can suffice.
One obvious limitation to the new strategy is that many communities have long since committed themselves to living on the flood plain, and with traditional structural methods of flood control. "We can't pick Des Moines up and put it on a hill," said Harry Kitch, an Army Corps of Engineers official in Washington who handles flood-control planning in the central United States. The more natural approach to flood control might seek its greatest success where new development is poised to move onto the flood plain. But particularly for areas already developed, Mr. Kitch said, "you're going to end up with a balance" of structural and natural methods.
Flood-control disputes of the future are likely to involve the tricky and contentious issue of just what balance should be struck. A classic example is the long-running controversy about floods along the Passaic River watershed in northern New Jersey. Towns have existed in the watershed's lower reaches for years, while other parts of the basin are only now becoming ripe for development.
The basin is one of the most flood-prone in the country. Over the past decades, various portions of it have been declared Federal disaster areas seven times. Some flooding occurs almost every year, and the Corps of Engineers estimates that a record flood, like that of 1903, would cause $2 billion in damages.
Under a joint Federal-state project authorized by Congress but not yet finally approved by the state, the Corps of Engineers has proposed a hybrid solution. The Passaic's flood waters would be shunted underneath developed areas through a $2 billion, 20-mile-long tunnel terminating in Newark Bay. The idea of the tunnel, corps officials say, is to avoid disturbing the land. The plan also calls for the state to buy up more than 5,000 acres of wetlands on the flood plain to serve as a catchment to reduce flood volume and speed. As a result, the plan might also prevent some development.
Critics say the plan comes down too little on the side of nature. They favor sharply restricting development in the entire central and upper basin, buying out flood plain residents and acquiring far more natural flood storage acreage than the plan now calls for. Critics also raise fears about the ecological impact of a rush of fresh flood waters into the marine environment of Newark Bay. Some oppose the construction of the tunnel under any conditions. The issue has divided politicians and citizens and has become an issue in the New Jersey Governor's race. Gov. Jim Florio, a democrat, has refrained from taking a position for or against the tunnel, pending an environmental impact study to be completed by the Corps of Engineers in 1995; his Republican opponent, Christine Todd Whitman, is against the tunnel, arguing that that buying out flood plain residents would be less expensive. The corps argues the opposite.
Flood plains, the subject of this and many other disputes across the country, are among the most productive ecosystems in the world. When flooded in spring, they become breeding grounds for fish. Most flood plain acreage is wetlands, and about half the country's endangered species require wetland habitat. The riparian zone along rivers is home to distinct assemblages of soils, microbes, plants and animals that depend on high water tables and occasional flooding.
People originally settled along rivers because they provided water, transport and power. That is no longer true, "but now the city is there," said Mr. Larson. Later, people were drawn to flood plains because land there was cheaper. By 1991, according to an interagency Federal task force on flood plains that issued a report last year, flood-plain land in 17,000 communities occupied more than 145,000 acres and included nearly 10 million households and $390 billion in property.
This large-scale development, according to the task force, has come at "a high price extracted annually in deaths, personal injury and suffering, economic loss and damage to or destruction of natural and cultural resources." Despite extensive and expensive efforts over the years to control floods through public works (the Corps of Engineers has built 10,500 miles of levees and flood walls alone), inflation-adjusted flood damages per capita were almost 2.5 times as great in the period from 1951 to 1985 as from 1916 through 1950.
Part of this may be attributed to a growing ratio of construction to population, but levees themselves evidently contribute to the escalation. They are the most common type of flood-control measure, and when they fail, as they have many times in the Mississippi basin in recent weeks, they make the damage worse. The Federal task force noted that a breached levee, like a breaking dam, can realease a large wave at high velocity on communities that believe they are protected. Images from the Mississippi basin this past week have grimly borne this out. The remaining levee system may subsequently prevent water from draining back into the river, prolonging the flood. The task force reported that levee or flood-wall failure is involved in one-third of all flood disasters.
When a river's flow is constricted, its sediments are no longer deposited to fertilize the flood plain but instead may be dropped within the narrow river channel just outside the levee. This in time raises the height of the river, and the levee must be heightened in turn. "In general, a river wants to recreate itself as a river with a flood plain; it's rising in response to these rising levees," said James T. B. Tripp, an expert on floods with the Environmental Defense Fund. "River systems have a way of adjusting themselves in response to human manipulation of the flood plain in ways that can never be entirely foreseen."
A better approach, according to the emerging new wisdom, is to get the river to work for you rather than against you. The new approaches may be best suited to smaller rivers, but these spawn most of the flash floods, and flash floods are responsible for three-fourths of all Presidentially declared disasters.
After a 1984 flash flood killed 13 people and caused $180 million in property damage in Tulsa, Okla., for instance, the city and the Corps of Engineers collaborated to create a more natural flood-control system. They scooped out a series of permanent lakes in a greenway corridor set aside in Tulsa's Mingo Creek flood plain. Most of the lakes are dry, and when there is no flood the lake bottoms are occupied by soccer and baseball fields and tennis courts. When there is a flood, the lakes store and slow down the water. They are connected by a network of "trickle trails" that serve as jogging paths in dry times and low-flow flood channels in wet ones.
At the same time, development in the flood plain is strictly regulated. Developers must build their own detention ponds to make up for the increased flow that paving causes. Buildings in harm's way must be flood-proofed, usually with raised piers. One result is that developers have been discouraged from building in the flood plain -- a counterforce, possibly, to whatever incentive to development may be provided by Federal disaster relief and flood insurance.
Only 15 to 30 percent of the nation's flood-prone structures are actually insured by the supposedly self-financing National Flood Insurance Program, according to the flood plain task force. Disaster relief is available to an uninsured property only once: If the property is flooded a second time and is still uninsured, owners are on their own.
 
Natural Flood Control a Success
 The Tulsa system has been tested by storms that would have been expected to cause serious flooding in earlier years and has passed with flying colors, said Jack Page, who oversees development for the city. He sees "more acceptance of 'soft' engineering; we're getting away from the concrete and the pipes and are leaving the channel in a natural state." The Corps of Engineers says it considers the Tulsa project a model.
Other localities have moved in this direction as well, often with corps involvement. As a pioneering alternative to dams and levees in the Charles River basin of metropolitan Boston, for example, the corps purchased or secured easements on 8,500 acres of wetlands to contain floods while also providing wildlife habitat and promoting recreation. The system was tested by major floods in 1979 and 1982 and each time performed effectively.
The city of Littleton, Colo., established a 625-acre park in its flood plain to attenuate floods rather than allow the South Platte River to be channeled. And in the San Francisco Bay area community of North Richmond, citizens successfully brought about the creation of a naturally meandering flood channel and restored the stream-side ecosystem in a way that would maintain ecological health while accommodating once-in-a-century floods.
In the end, if Mr. Larson and Mr. Tripp are right, there simply may be no way to protect against the very worst floods, no matter what strategy is employed. "We've got to figure out some way to help people understand that Mother Nature will reclaim what's hers from time to time," said Mr. Larson. "We must keep that in mind when we go to build our communities and cities and try to find a way to live in harmony with nature."
To which Mr. Tripp adds: "We can try and manage these river systems to some degree, but we've got to be prepared to accommodate ourselves to the river. If we think we can do things to rivers so they will never flood, we're naive."

GRAPHIC: Diagrams: "The natural ways of the river"
Flooded river under natural conditions spreads beyond normal channel and into floodway, where water slows down. Flood fringe, within which there is at least a 1 percent chance of flooding in a given year, marks limit of 100-year flood plain. When water is squeezed into a narrow channel by levees or floodwalls, its height and velocity increase. When pent-up flood tops or breaches a levee, the effect can be like that of a bursting dam.
 
"The overflow wetlands"
Wetlands, the most prominent and familiar of flood-plain features, harbor an especially rich assembly of plants, animals and microbes. Wetlands and the narrow strips of green habitat along streams depend on occasional flooding and are destroyed or degraded when water is cut off by levees or diversion channels.
 
Rivers deprived of wetlands
About 54 percent of the original 215 million acres of wetlands in the 48 contiguous states have been lost since European settlement. Most of the loss resulted from drainage to create farms.

HEADLINE: Old Faces, New Politics in Japan

 BODY:
What happened to Japan's predicted electoral revolution?
The morning after the vote, many familiar faces could still be found at center stage. The Liberal Democrats remain the biggest party -- by far. Prime Minister Miyazawa even talks about hanging onto his job, at least for a few weeks. 
 Yet Sunday's election results portend a very different Japan. The old political arithmetic that assured the Liberal Democrats a permanent majority over a dogmatic and marginalized Socialist opposition has been replaced by a new math of fierce competition from new center-right groups, some of them composed of disaffected members of the old guard.
After the votes were tallied, the Liberal Democrats held 223 seats, their combined center-right rivals held 175 and the Socialists were left with a mere 70. In the short term, various permutations could produce a working majority of 256. In the longer term, a new era of competitive politics has almost certainly arrived.
That competition means politicians will need to pay attention to the interest of ordinary voters, not just the old "iron triangle" of bureaucrats, business leaders and Liberal Democratic faction bosses.
For Americans, the new politics, after an awkward transition period, should make it easier to achieve some long-sought goals, like more open markets, less behind-the-scenes bid rigging and more readiness to stimulate consumer demand during recessions.
Democratic accountability by itself won't dissolve economic tensions. Consider, for example, America's sometimes testy trade relations with democratic France. But generally, democracies do better at working out their economic quarrels without slipping into the kind of demonization that has poisoned ties between the U.S. and Japan.
The old political system was a hybrid of Japanese feudalism and General MacArthur's postwar democratic reforms. Launched with American support in 1955, the Liberal Democratic Party won solid backing from generations of Japanese voters and successive U.S. Governments as the best vehicle for rebuilding a war-ruined economy, restraining militarism and assuring a pro-Western security alignment during the cold war.
Eventually that system was undermined by its own remarkable success. Japan emerged as an economic powerhouse and the West won the cold war. Today the main political issues are how Japan wants to use its new wealth to build a more livable society and what role it chooses to play in a world no longer defined by East-West conflict.
Issues like that can't be solved by technocratic "guidance" from the old iron triangle. Only democratic debate and competitive politics can provide satisfactory answers. Sunday's vote makes that kind of democratic competition possible.

HEADLINE: Workers of the World, Get Smart

SERIES: Build a Better Workplace -- Second of two articles

BYLINE: By Robert B. Reich; Robert B. Reich is Secretary of Labor.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Throughout the industrialized world, there seem to be too few good jobs to go around. The problem manifests itself differently in different countries, but the failure of any country to insure good jobs for many able and willing citizens raises a troubling question: Do advanced nations have to choose between good jobs and more jobs?
Over the past two decades, Western Europe has experienced growth in wages but stagnation in employment. Between 1975 and 1992, the real -- that is, inflation-adjusted -- average wages of manufacturing workers in France, Germany, Italy and Britain grew by 30 to 50 percent. But unemployment in European industrialized economies has risen close to a staggering 11 percent. 
 How does America compare? On the narrow score of the number of jobs, we rank quite well. Since 1975, our economy has generated nearly two million new jobs per year. And although our current unemployment rate of 7 percent is disturbing, more than 800,000 jobs have been created since January, as economic growth has begun to stir.
Our bigger long-term problem is creating jobs that pay well. The average wages of America's production workers, adjusted for inflation, are the lowest they've been since 1967. Eighteen percent of full-time workers don't earn enough to keep a family of four out of poverty; this level is up from 12 percent in 1979. And more Americans who want full-time jobs are working part-time instead.
Wages and incomes in the U.S. have become more unequal since the early 1970's. They have risen for upper-income workers, remained stagnant for the middle class and fallen for those at the bottom. In no other advanced industrialized nation is the income gap so wide between the managers and professionals and production workers.
Must we accept a diabolical trade-off between good jobs and more jobs as factories move to places around the world where labor costs less and as smart machines take on more tasks at home? I believe that a trade-off is not inevitable if we draw the right conclusion from the underlying employment trends.
The pattern of wage inequality in the U.S. provides an important clue. From 1980 to 1991, the weekly real earnings of full-time workers over the age of 25 who had graduated from college rose 9 percent. That's not so bad. But the real weekly earnings of similar workers who had only completed high school dropped 7 percent. And similar workers without high school diplomas suffered a drop in earnings of 14 percent. Today, the weekly earnings of full-time workers over 25 who are college graduates are more than 50 percent above the earnings of otherwise similar workers who are simply high school graduates.
The pattern of unemployment provides a second clue. In Europe and the U.S., the uneducated and unskilled have been hardest hit. While college graduates did not escape the prolonged recession in the U.S., only 3.2 percent were unemployed last year compared with 11.4 percent of those who dropped out of high school.
The long-term crisis in advanced industrial nations reflects in part a shift in relative labor demand against less-educated workers and those doing routine tasks and toward workers with problem-solving skills. So, how do we move a workforce suited to one sort of economy quickly and smoothly into a world grown suddenly quite different?
No country has yet found the formula. But different countries have illustrated different ways to get it wrong. The continental European approach has been to have Government intervene heavily in the wage-setting process and seek to preserve the existing pattern of employment. This has prevented the gap between high-wage and low-wage workers from widening much, but it has not directly addressed the profound changes in the demand for skills. Such policies have maintained wages and job security for the employed, but they have retarded the creation of new jobs.
In the U.S. and Britain, employers have responded more directly to changes in labor force supply and demand. The result has been greater inequality in wages and working conditions. The apparent payoff from this Faustian bargain is a rate of U.S. job growth over the last two decades that has been the envy of Europe. Nevertheless, job growth in the U.S. and Britain has been punctuated by high unemployment in recessions and tarnished by worsening problems of permanent loss of jobs.
A third blind alley is protection from exports. No advanced nation is blameless. Yet escaping from global markets through protectionism is no solution. New technologies will reduce the demand for less-skilled workers even if borders are sealed. And many of the high-wage jobs of the future will be tied to exports and jobs that service the export industry. Protectionism cripples economic progress while failing to save jobs.
Americans have traditionally cast their lot with open trade. In recent years, we have wavered. But in Tokyo, President Clinton led the Group of Seven industrialized countries another major step down the path of openness. The trade agreement initialed there has sharply improved the odds for a new global accord. The President also established ground rules for measuring how far Japan opens its market. The odds of advanced nations adapting to a changing world are higher than they were before the summit meeting, holding hope for our own economic recovery.
In addition, the President's proposed sharp reduction in the budget deficit will remove a significant source of uncertainty about the stability of the world economy and aid recovery.
But domestic policies -- specifically five -- are also needed to deal with the mismatch between the skills Americans have and the skills the economy requires. They are a good basic education for all children, affordable college, school-to-work apprenticeships for young people who don't go on to college, transition help to new jobs for displaced workers and lifetime learning in the workplace.
This list essentially describes the Clinton agenda for the workforce. Some parts of it are already embodied in legislative initiative, others are still taking shape. The imperative of investment in the workforce is so compelling and the goal of building of America's skill base so broadly shared that the debate remains remarkably free of partisan wrangling.
The closing years of this century and the start of the next will be dominated by the advanced countries' efforts to adapt to the new economy. America enters this era with advantages. Our still enormous wealth gives us scope for experimentation and a margin for error. Most importantly, economic dynamism and openness to change are woven deep into our culture.
Our greatest weakness has been the failure to invest adequately in our own learning. In the emerging global, high-tech economy, the development of our human resources will be the key means of creating wealth.

HEADLINE: Dinkins, in Israel, Excelled in Role of Good-Will Ambassador

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Mayor David N. Dinkins's trip to Israel is now history, but to the 34 delegation members who accompanied New York City's Mayor the story is incomplete. We admired the energy and involvement of news media representatives, but since they were excluded from most of the meetings with Israeli leaders, they may not have known some aspects of the trip. 
 We knew the prime interest was in the motive for the trip and the handling of the Crown Heights violence two years ago. Neither of these concerned the Israeli leaders, so that discussion of them surfaced only in press interviews. There was a small and quite ineffectual attempt at a demonstration during the dedication of New York Square -- some 30 people mustered by Rabbi Avi Weiss stood holding placards at a substantial distance. It was not a popular effort as far as the Israeli leaders were concerned and fortunately did not interfere with the program.
Discussions with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres on such subjects as peace in the Middle East and economic concerns were fascinating. At no point was there any reference to the motives for the Mayor's visit, since it was understood by Israeli leaders he was fulfilling a promise to return after the Persian Gulf war, which he made when he visited Israel while Scud missiles were falling.
But what struck everyone in the delegation was the great regard in which the Mayor was held by both Ministers and by Mayors Teddy Kollek of Jerusalem and Shlomo Lahat of Tel Aviv. He was universally greeted as a friend and literally embraced. The delegation was diverse and disparate. We were clergy members, civic leaders, government officials and business representatives. We barely communicated the first day, but by the second day we had become family. Once the familial relationship evolved, I found I was suffering from the same intestinal tremors I experience when any family member performs in public. Borough Presidents Claire Schulman of Queens and Ruth Messinger of Manhattan, City Councilman Stanley Michaels and James Harmon, the president of Wertheim Schroder, all of whom spoke on various occasions, were wonderful.
Most of all, the Mayor was impressive. I haven't heard him referred to as a statesman, but the term is apt in describing his speeches, his appearance and the admiration he evoked. We hope he will continue to travel to countries where New Yorkers have roots. Such trips can result in economic advantages and in easing tensions in divided neighborhoods, where such visits can give reassurance. The Mayor's fulfillment of his promise to revisit may not have affected the campaign or laid to rest the specter of Crown Heights, but it created a tremendous amount of good will.

HEADLINE: HOUSE AIDE LINKS A TOP LAWMAKER TO EMBEZZLEMENT

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19

 BODY:
The former postmaster of the House of Representatives has told prosecutors that he helped Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the powerful Illinois Democrat, embezzle $21,300, according to prosecutors, defense lawyers and public records that describe some of the transactions.
The former postmaster, Robert V. Rota, pleaded guilty in Federal District Court in Washington today to one count of conspiracy and two counts of embezzlement and said he had helped an undisclosed number of lawmakers embezzle tens of thousands of dollars since his appointment in 1972 until 1992, when he resigned.
 
Important on Big Issues
 Government and defense lawyers said the guilty plea was a significant step toward indicting Mr. Rostenkowski, but it could be weeks before the Government moves against the Chicago Democrat. Still, the plea today by Mr. Rota, who has agreed to testify against Mr. Rostenkowski, came at a delicate moment, when the House and Senate have just begun negotiations on Mr. Clinton's economic program. 
 As chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Rostenkowski will be one of the central figures in those talks, and Mr. Clinton will also need him badly in months to come as Congress considers health care, welfare, trade and other issues.
 
Calls Unanswered
 In a court appearance today, Mr. Rota did not identify Mr. Rostenkowski, referring instead to "Congressman A" and to "Congressman B," who, the former official said, had stolen $9,300. The Government also did not identify either lawmaker, but documents supporting Mr. Rota's plea arrangement clearly showed that Mr. Rostenkowski was Congressman A and that Joe Kolter, a Democrat who lost his Pennsylvania seat last year, was Congressman B.
Mr. Rostenkowski's aides said the lawmaker was in Chicago today. Calls to the lawmaker there were not answered and no one answered the door at his home. The aides in Washington declined to discuss Mr. Rota's guilty plea. The lawmaker's Washington lawyer, Stanley Brand, did not return telephone calls.
J. Ramsey Johnson, the interim United States Attorney in Washington, said: "Mr. Rota has admitted that he allowed the House post office to be used as a convenient and, until this investigation, largely untraceable source of illegal cash for selected members of Congress. Over the course of two decades, at the insistence of certain Congressmen, Mr. Rota repeatedly took cash from House post office funds and turned it over to these members." There is as yet no indication of how many lawmakers were involved or who any of the others might be.
Mr. Rota, a 58-year old career Congressional official who resigned as the post office scandal erupted last year, admitted today that he had provided the lawmakers with a cover so that they could steal from expense accounts for office supplies through transactions that appeared to be legitimate.
Members of Congress are given allowances to pay for office expenses like pens, stationery and postage. They can obtain such items from House storerooms and the House post office by signing vouchers against their allowances. Lawmakers can send ordinary mail without stamps under their franking privileges but need them for overseas mail and to use specialized services like certified mail and insured mail.
Mr. Rota said that in some cases he had taken vouchers from members of Congress that showed postage purchases but instead of stamps he had given them cash. In other instances, he said, he exchanged the vouchers for stamps, but he would then take the stamps back for cash.
Mr. Rota's story, which emerged today from his own words and through Federal prosecutors, provided a startling glimpse into the life of a figure familiar on Capitol Hill but seldom seen outside Washington: the Federal patronage employee eager above all to please those who gave him his job.
 
Seen as Political Favors
 Throughout the scheme, prosecutors said, Mr. Rota did not make any money. Rather, he helped others profit illegally as a political favor.
The former postmaster is a Pennsylvanian who began his career by working in the cloakroom and rose through the ranks of the House bureaucracy under the patronage of Representative Thomas Morgan, a Pennsylvania Democrat who was the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and retired in 1976 after serving 32 years.
Mr. Rota, who oversaw a staff of 160 and an annual budget of $4.4 million, was well known in Congress for doing favors for various lawmakers. One recalled recently that Mr. Rota would routinely approach members and ask, "What can I do for you?"
Mr. Rota said he gave $11,500 in cash to Congressman A and $4,300 to Congressman B, from May 1985 to May 1987. He also said he gave $9,800 in cash to Congressman A and $5,000 to Congressman B from July 1989 to April 1991. The amounts ranged from $900 to $2,800 for Congressman A and from $600 to $2,000 for Congressman B.
The court records provided the numbers of the vouchers that Mr. Rota said were used to cover up the transactions. Publicly available records show that in each case where a voucher by Congressman A was listed, the voucher number corresponded to one signed by Mr. Rostenkowski and that the vouchers attributed to Congressman B were signed by Mr. Kolter.
 
Accusation Denied
 Mr. Kolter, who lives in New Brighton, Pa., did not return a telephone message left today on his answering machine. His Washington lawyer, Alan Baron, said he had not seen the court papers but heard speculation today that his client was Congressman B. Mr. Baron said his client had done nothing improper and had not been involved in any plea bargaining.
Mr. Rota said the two-year hiatus in the payments occurred because a new Supervisor of Accounts at the post office was installed whom Mr. Rota did not know and could not trust to carry out the scheme. But after that supervisor left, Mr. Rota said, he was replaced by a patronage employee whom he did not identify today other than to say that he was sponsored by Congressman A.
The position described by the prosecutors had been occupied James C. Smith, who worked in a basement office of the postmaster across the street from the Capitol, single-handledly controlling the disbursement of thousands of dollars in cash and stamps. He was sponsored for his job by Mr. Rostenkowski, according to Congressional documents.
 
Employee Granted Immunity
 Lawyers involved in the case said Mr. Smith, who is no longer in the job, had been granted immunity by prosecutors and had been lined up to testify against Mr. Rota if he had failed to reach a plea agreement. Mr. Smith is also prepared to testify against Mr. Rostenkowski, the lawyers said.
Mr. Rota also confessed that he had lied to investigators at least three times to cover up the scheme. If he is used as a witness in a trial against lawmakers, his credibility could be attacked because of this admission.
The plea was the culmination of a two year-long investigation that began when a post office clerk was discovered stealing cash from one of branches on Capitol Hill. That investigation and a separate inquiry last year involving significant overdrafts at the House Bank came to symbolize ethical laxity in Congress and led, in turn, to a perception that contributed to an anti-incumbent fever that sent scores of legislators down to defeat or forced them to retire.
Prosecutors said Mr. Rota was scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 12 and faced a maximum prison sentence of three years and fines of as much as $300,000.
"What Mr. Rota did was to place the services of his office and the United State funds under his control at the disposal of certain United States Congressmen, knowing full well that he was aiding the embezzlement of money from those funds." Mr. Johnson said. "What Mr. Rota got in return was to keep his job as an officer of the United States House of Representatives."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 21, 1993, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about the legal problems of Robert V. Rota, a former House Postmaster, misstated his resignation date in some editions. Mr. Rota, who was the subject of an investigation into corruption in the House Post Office during his two decades as Postmaster, resigned in 1992, not 1991.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Is Upbeat On Growth

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, gave a surprisingly upbeat assessment of economic growth today but said the news on inflation was disappointing, signaling that the central bank was poised to raise interest rates if inflation accelerated.
Testifying before a House subcommittee, Mr. Greenspan said he was disappointed that inflation "has at best stabilized, rather than easing" as might be expected when the unemployment rate hovers near 7 percent. 
 In recent months, the Federal Reserve has walked a tightrope between wanting to keep interest rates low to spur growth and wanting to talk tough on inflation to help keep price pressures in check.
 
Takes aA Stern Tone
 Today, Mr. Greenspan took a sterner tone on inflation despite weak recent economic data and a drop in inflation in May and June after a price spurt early in the year. He seemed to be indicating that the Fed was not ruling out raising rates, however unpopular that would be.
The bond market was jarred by Mr. Greenspan's testimony, and short-term interest rates rose as some investors focused once again on the threat of an increase in interest rates. [Page D20.]
Mr. Greenspan estimated that the economy grew by an annual rate of 3 percent in the second quarter -- a considerably stronger showing than the predictions of many private economists. Despite anemic growth in the first quarter, he said, the economy seemed to be on track, and he forecast growth of 2.5 percent for the year, with the jobless rate slipping to 6.75 percent by December.
 
Backs Clinton Plan
 Saying that the expectation of deficit reduction had helped lower long-term interest rates, the Fed chief used his testimony to badger Congress to approve the Clinton Administration's plan to cut deficit spending by $500 billion over five years.
In his understated style, Mr. Greenspan said, "Should that expectation be thwarted, then I think the markets would react in a negative fashion."
He rejected suggestions that the deficit package be scaled back to $400 billion, warning that the markets "will react appropriately negatively" if Congress backs down.
In its new semiannual forecast, the central bank predicted inflation of 3 percent to 3.25 percent this year and 3 percent to 3.5 percent next year. The Fed forecast economic growth of 2.5 percent to 3.25 percent next year.
Mr. Greenspan said that after the spurt in prices a few months ago, the low May and June inflation figures "have helped assuage concerns that new inflationary pressures had taken hold." Yet "on balance," he said, "the news on inflation this year must be characterized as disappointing."
In May, the Federal Reserve decided to tilt its monetary policy in favor of higher rates, but it has yet to act on that conclusion.
Mr. Greenspan said the increase in gold prices over the last few months was worrisome because it reflected an expectation of inflation. The 7 percent jobless rate and slack in capacity utilization should point to lower inflation, he added.
"The role of expectations in the inflation process is crucial," he said. "Even expectations not validated by economic fundamentals can themselves add appreciably to wage and price pressures" and risk derailing growth by encouraging higher interest rates.
Although Mr. Greenspan forecast that high consumer debt and military-spending cuts would restrain growth for months to come, he said the foundation was being laid for strong growth. Assuming that the Government resolved questions about the budget and health-care costs, he said, "the U.S. economy should eventually emerge healthier and more vibrant than in decades."
 
Lower Monetary Targets Cut
 Mr. Greenspan said the central bank had reduced its goal for growth in the money supply next year. Generally, strong monetary growth leads to inflation and to stronger economic growth. The central bank lowered its growth target for the M-2, the most closely watched monetary measure, to a range of 1 percent to 5 percent, down from 2 percent to 6 percent adopted in February. Last year, its target was 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent.
Many economists and lawmakers have assailed the Fed for puny growth in the money supply, calling this a major reason for the sluggish economy. But Mr. Greenspan said the usual links between monetary growth and economic growth had broken down, asserting that the economy could grow sufficiently with less of an increase in the money supply.
Finding that the money supply had become an unreliable guide for policy, Mr. Greenspan said the Fed was increasingly looking to a new guidepost to help it steer toward a desired growth rate -- "equilibrium real interest rates." Real interest rates are nominal rates minus inflation, and the equilibrium rate would be the real interest rate that would keep the economy operating at its potential without spurring inflation.
Using this approach, the central bank might conclude, for example, that real interest rates of 2 percent produced solid growth without fueling inflationary pressure. So it might aim for 4 percent interest rates if the inflation rate, and inflationary expectations, were 2 percent.
 
A Diplomat, as Well
 At the hearing, by the House Banking subcommittee on economic growth, legislators generally ignored monetary-policy questions and tried to coax Mr. Greenspan into supporting their positions in the budget battle. He declined their invitations.
Like any good conservative, he said it is preferable to reduce the deficit through spending cuts, rather than tax increases, arguing that spending less is a surer way to hold down the deficit. But when Republicans urged him to say that a dollar in tax increases hurts growth more than a dollar in spending cuts, he gave a diplomatic answer. He noted that spending cuts hurt the economy, as is evidenced by arms cutbacks, and that tax rises hurt, too, noting that some businesses had delayed expansion out of a fear of possible new taxes.
Mr. Greenspan criticized the House for delays in approving new financing for the Resolution Trust Corporation, which liquidates failed savings-and-loan institutions, a delay that he said is costing $1 billion a year.
"The failure to fund the R.T.C. is just adding to the costs of something which the American Government -- that is, the American people -- are already obligated for," he said.

HEADLINE: Housing Starts Are Stalled Despite Low Interest Rates

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
Despite the lowest mortgage rates in two decades, the pace of new home construction stalled in June, the Commerce Department reported today, apparently because buyers remained worried about the economy.
Floods in the Midwest also took a toll on the annual rate of housing starts, which was stuck at 1.25 million units, the same as in May. Analysts said the full impact of devastating rains in the nation's midsection may not be known for months. 
 Applications for building permits weakened in June by 1.3 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.11 million units, a poor sign for future building activity. Applications had risen 1.8 percent in May.
 
Disappointing Numbers
 "The June housing starts are disappointing relative to earlier expectations that housing would be one of the major driving forces to the expansion," said Marilyn Schaja, an economist with the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation in New York.
The rate of new-home building is a good measure of consumer participation in the national economy because it is a sign of willingness to make long-term commitments. The June rate was 10 percent above the rate a year earlier of 1.14 million units.
Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages, available for 8.04 percent in mid-January, dropped to 7.16 percent by mid-July, a level not seen since 1972, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. Variable-rate mortgages were available as low as 4.53 percent.
Such low rates would normally be a potent buying incentive if consumer confidence was not being battered by fears about jobs and taxes.
On Capitol Hill today, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, testified before Congress that the pace of economic growth in the second quarter likely picked up to an annual rate of 3 percent from the first quarter's anemic seven-tenths of 1 percent.
The Fed chief reiterated his concern about potential inflation in the economy. Housing industry analysts say they worry about reports the Fed favors a pre-emptive strike against inflation by raising interest rates that are considered vital to keep housing expanding.

HEADLINE: Ex-Detroit Police Officer Testifies He Never Struck Victim of Fatal Beating

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 20

 BODY:
A former Detroit police officer charged with murder in the fatal beating of a driver told jurors today that he never struck the victim.
Walter Budzyn, one of three former police officers on trial in the fatal beating of the driver, Malice Green, last Nov. 5, also testified that he had not seen any other officer become violent with Mr. Green. 
 Prosecution witnesses have testified that Mr. Budzyn straddled Mr. Green and swung a flashlight at his head.
Mr. Budzyn, 47, and his former partner, Larry Nevers, 52, are accused of second-degree murder. A third former officer, Robert Lessnau, 33, is accused of assault.
 
First Defense Testimony
 The three defendants, who were dismissed from the police force after Mr. Green's death, are white. Mr. Green, 35, an unemployed steelworker, was black. The death raised racial tensions in Detroit, but there has been no testimony that race was a motive in the beating.
Mr. Budzyn's account, the first by a defense witness in the trial, differed markedly from previous testimony.
Mr. Budzyn said he and Mr. Nevers were patrolling the city's west side when they spotted a car with bullet holes in a passenger door parked in front of a house known to be frequented by drug users.
Mr. Budzyn said that they pulled up in their unmarked car and asked to see the driver's license, and that the driver, Mr. Green, then reached toward the glove compartment and dropped what appeared to be cocaine. Mr. Budzyn said Mr. Green refused to open his clenched right hand and began struggling in the car.
"I reached in and grabbed his right arm," Mr. Budzyn testified. "Mr. Green came up with both of his legs and kicked me in the lower leg and right knee."
 
14 Blows to the Head
 Mr. Budzyn testified that he noticed Mr. Nevers tapping Mr. Green's hand with a flashlight, but added that those were the only blows he saw.
An assistant medical examiner ruled that Mr. Green died from at least 14 blows to the head.
Earlier in the trial, several witnesses testified that they saw Mr. Budzyn hold Mr. Green in a headlock in the car and swing a heavy police flashlight at his head. But they said they could not see whether Mr. Green was actually hit with the flashlight.
Mr. Budzyn said he dropped his flashlight early in the struggle and never swung it at Mr. Green. He said he did not see Mr. Green being hit, but heard a couple of thuds and later saw Mr. Green's head covered with blood.
Prosecution witnesses said Mr. Nevers hit Mr. Green repeatedly, and that Mr. Lessnau punched and kicked him after pulling him from the car.
 
Blood on Partner's Hands
 Mr. Budzyn said he did not see what was going on outside the car because he was busy retrieving the cocaine and other items. Afterward, he said, there was blood on Mr. Nevers's hands and flashlight.
"I saw Larry, who was huffing and puffing," Mr. Budzyn testified. "I thought he was having a heart attack or something."
Mr. Budzyn said he obtained peroxide from an ambulance driver and poured some over Mr. Nevers's hands "to get rid of the blood," because he and his partner feared that Mr. Green might have had AIDS.
Mr. Budzyn denied earlier testimony that he washed his own hands and flashlight with the peroxide. Police technicians have testified that they found blood in the car and on Mr. Nevers's clothing and flashlight, but not on Mr. Budzyn or his equipment.
Under cross-examination, Mr. Budzyn said there was no reason Mr. Green should have been killed.
The three former police officers are being tried together. But Mr. Budzyn and Mr. Nevers have separate juries, and Mr. Lessnau's case will be decided by Judge George Crockett 3d of Detroit Recorder's Court.
Mr. Nevers and the jury hearing his case were excused from the courtroom during Mr. Budzyn's testimony today.

HEADLINE: Prosecutors Reported Seeking to Widen Inquiry on Rostenkowski

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
As Capitol Hill buzzed about the news that one of its most powerful members had been accused of embezzlement, Federal officials said today that prosecutors were trying to broaden the case against Representative Dan Rostenkowski.
Officials and defense lawyers involved in the long-running investigation of Mr. Rostenkowski said prosecutors had been gathering evidence against him about a series of transactions in Chicago in an effort to link separate accusations of wrongdoing into a single, more serious case. 
 In doing so, the prosecutors would be following a tactic recently employed against other, less influential members of Congress: bringing charges under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The law, which provides especially severe penalties and gives prosecutors more time to act, was intended to create a new weapon against organized crime. It has been applied in other areas as well, a practice that has drawn criticism from defense lawyers.
 
Making Best of Situation
 Mr. Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, returned to Washington today from Chicago to begin delicate negotiations to move President Clinton's economic program through Congress and tried to act as if nothing had happened.
He refused to answer questions posed by reporters in the hallways of Congress and after emerging from a lunch at the White House with Mr. Clinton and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the head of the Senate Finance Committee.
Mr. Clinton, too, seemed intent on making the best of the situation. He allowed himself to be photographed with Mr. Rostenkowski during the lunch and insisted in response to a question that the Congressman's legal problems would have no effect on the budget deliberations.
"We've got a lot of work to do," he said in the White House family dining room. "Chairman Rostenkowki's done a great job with this budget so far and we've worked very closely together. And we're going to work today. I don't know anything about the rest of it."
Fellow lawmakers also said the latest disclosures would have little political impact. Representative Jack Brooks, the Texas Democrat who heads the Judiciary Committee, echoed the views expressed by other colleagues, telling a reporter: "It's just a cloud. It's not a rain cloud, honey. It's a light cloud."
Mr. Rostenkowski has firmly controlled the committee he leads, the Ways and Means Committee, which writes tax legislation, and his support for the President's agenda on health care and welfare has been considered critical for passage. Under the House Democratic rules, he would have to step down as head of the committee if he was indicted.
On Monday the former postmaster of the House of Representatives reached a plea agreement with prosecutors and said he had helped the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee embezzle more than $20,000, according to court papers and Federal prosecutors. The former postmaster, Robert V. Rota, pleaded guilty to three misdemeanor counts of conspiracy and embezzlement and acknowledged that he had helped an undisclosed number of representatives steal tens of thousands of dollars for almost 20 years.
 
Immunity for Aide
 In recent weeks, the authorities have granted immunity to Virginia C. Fletcher, an aide to Mr. Rostenkowski for more than 30 years and his closest personal assistant, in exchange for her cooperation in the investigation, lawyers involved in the case said.
The investigation in Chicago is seeking to determine whether Mr. Rostenkowski converted campaign and taxpayer money for his own use and whether the racketeering law could be applied, Federal officials and defense lawyers said. No indictment is expected for weeks.
In his court appearance on Monday, Mr. Rota said he had given $21,300 to a person identified only as "Congressman A" from May 1985 through April 1991. The periodic payments described in court papers ranged from $900 to $2,800. Neither Mr. Rota nor the Government identified "Congressman A." But they provided voucher numbers for some of the transactions which, when matched with publicly available records, showed that the payments had been received by Mr. Rostenkowski.
 
Disbelief Among Colleagues
 Democrats and Republicans said they were puzzled about what could possibly motivate a man who had access to hundreds of millions of dollars in his fund raising and lobbying to steal in the petty amounts prosecutors have suggested.
"We've been friends for such a long time, I just can't believe the son of a gun would get himself involved in something like this," said Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the Republican leader. "I can't believe it. I don't want to believe it."
But Representative Newt Gingrich, the Republican whip from Georgia, used Mr. Rota's guilty plea to attack the Democrats.
"This is not a Congress scandal," Mr. Gingrich said. "Just as in Japan, this is about corrupt one-party rule for four decades. These are Democrats being named by a Democrat appointee under indictment."
In the pending public corruption cases the Government has charged that officials used their Congressional offices or campaigns as criminal enterprises. Those cases have been filed against Representative Joseph M. McDade, Republican of Pennsylvania, and two former Democratic members, Nicholas Mavroules of Massachusetts and Albert G. Bustamante of Texas.

HEADLINE: COMPANY EARNINGS;
Sears Reports Strong Rise In Second-Quarter Earnings

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 20

 BODY:
Sears, Roebuck & Company took another big step toward repairing its tarnished image on Wall Street today, posting a sharp jump in second-quarter profits.
Sears said the earnings reflected a faster payback than projected on its overhaul of retailing operations, including the recruitment of outside senior managers, closing some stores and renovating others and shutting the legendary Sears catalogue. 
 Additionally, the Allstate Corporation, which is 80 percent owned by Sears, reported surprisingly positive results, reflecting lower-than-expected losses for the insurer in automobile and catastrophe coverage.
"The economic environment hasn't improved all that much," said Edward A. Brennan, chairman and chief executive of Sears and one of the most visible targets of restive shareholders before the company's drastic restructuring plan was announced last year. "We are generating a lot of the momentum internally."
 
'Starting to Catch Fire'

 
 The gains marked the second straight quarter that Sears had pleasantly surprised investors with the progress made under Arthur Martinez, who was recruited last year from Saks Fifth Avenue to oversee the revamping of retailing operations.
"They are starting to catch fire," said Edward A. Weller, a retailing analyst for Robertson, Stephens & Company in San Francisco. Analysts had been raising estimates for the quarter based on monthly retail reports that showed Sears had fared better than most competitors. Still, their consensus had remained substantially less than the figures Sears reported today.
Sears said its net income in the three months ended June 30 more than tripled to $1.01 billion, from $325.5 million in the second quarter of 1992. That increase included a number of extraordinary gains and losses, among them a $635.1 million gain on the Allstate public offering in June and $145.3 million in expenses from early retirement of debt.
The quarter's figures also included income of more than $122 million from discontinued operations, mainly the interest Sears had in Dean Witter, Discover & Company after the public offering of the financial services and credit card company's stock in February. That remaining 80.1 percent stake in Dean Witter was spun off to Sears shareholders on June 30.
Revenues rose 5.6 percent for the quarter to $12.16 billion, from $11.51 billion a year ago. The year-ago figure excludes revenues from businesses the company has since exited.
 
Spinoffs a Key

 
 The restructuring plan included the sale of 19.9 percent of Allstate and a similar chunk of Dean Witter, Discover & Company to the public, the spinoff of the rest of Dean Witter to Sears shareholders, and the sale of the Coldwell Banker real estate operations.
The figures that really pleased Wall Street, though, were those showing that operating income from the Sears stores and other retailing outlets had jumped nearly 149 percent in the three months ended June 30 to $162.5 million from $65.3 million in the second quarter of 1992. Sears shares jumped $4.125, to $50.125, with more than four million shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
Most of the gain reflected ridding the balance sheet of the catalogue and other money-losing retail businesses. Still, income from the continuing business rose a solid 24 percent gain from $131.1 million and revenues from those businesses grew 6 percent, to $6.85 billion, led by strong sales in apparel and appliances.
Sears also benefited from the success of its public offering of Allstate shares on June 3 and Allstate's higher earnings, which lifted Sears's net income from its share of the insurance company 61.9 percent, to $371.8 million, from $229.6 million a year ago. Allstate's revenues rose just 4.2 percent, to $5.23 billion, but income from investments grew while the number and severity of property and casualty loss claims fell.
 
 
Allstate's Income Rises 55%

 
 Allstate reported that operating income for the second quarter rose 55 percent, to $351 million from $227 million, or to 83 cents a share from 52 cents a share. Allstate nearly broke even on an underwriting basis, spending $1 in claims and expenses for every $1 of premium income. In the corresponding period last year, Allstate spent $1.065 in claims and expenses for every premium dollar.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Allstate's shares closed up today 25 cents, to $30.625.

HEADLINE: Clinton Rallies Party Around Budget

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
His economic program on the line, President Clinton gave a rousing speech today to a group of Democratic lawmakers who are crucial to the success of his plan, demanding that they exercise the political courage necessary to raise taxes and cut spending.
"Yes, it is painful," the President declared. "Yes, it is difficult. But it is progress. It is change. It will make a difference. We have come this far. This is no time to turn back. We have been bold. This is no time to be timid. We have faced this crisis squarely. This is no time to blink." 
 It was the first time he had addressed a large audience on Capitol Hill in public since his State of the Union Message in February, and he spoke with the same fervor and focus that won him rave reviews then.
"All the easy things have been done," the President said, and then he drew a prolonged ovation when he added: "The cost of doing nothing is far higher in political and economic terms than paying the price of progress today."
 
Concerted Drive
 The speech was delivered to about 150 Democratic conferees on the budget legislation and members of their staffs who gathered under the chandeliers in the Caucus Room of the Cannon House Office Building, across Independence Avenue from the Capitol.
It came as House and Senate conferees began in earnest a drive against a deadline of the first week in August to write budget legislation, and it touched off a full-bore drive by the President and others in the Administration to sell the economic program.
For weeks, Democrats in Congress have faulted the President for what they saw as laxity in promoting his economic plans and have fretted that the prospects for his program were falling at the same rate as his popularity rating.
Just this morning, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is the chief Senate conferee on tax matters, said that as of today he did not have the votes in the Senate to pass a deficit-reduction measure that could also pass the House of Representatives, and he suggested that the White House did not grasp that reality.
 
Some See a Turning Point
 But the speech, given shortly after the President had lunch with Mr. Moynihan and Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the most important conferee from the House, boosted the spirits of the legislators more than anything else in months, and some suggested it would be a political turning point.
"The President hit this into the cheap seats," said Representative Jim Slattery of Kansas, a moderate who has sometimes been at odds with Mr. Clinton, especially on energy taxes. "I'd love to have him come to Kansas and explain this to the people of Kansas."
Representative Henry A. Waxman of California called it "a terrific speech to stir us up."
But will it swing any votes? "I think it may," Mr. Waxman replied. "It makes us refocus."
For the next two weeks, Mr. Clinton plans to concentrate almost entirely on getting the budget enacted, speaking here and twisting arms there in what could be a make-or-break period for his Presidency.
Others in the Administration have their roles also. Last week, the White House distributed a memorandum, "Hallelujah: Change is Coming," including pointers like: "Any time you're asked about a specific in the economic plan, look for ways to bring it back to the general points that this is good for the country, and this is real change."
 
Tough Road to Compromise
 The budget legislation was initially approved by the narrowest of margins -- 219 to 213 in the House in May and 50 to 49 in the Senate last month with Vice President Al Gore casting a tie-breaking vote.
The House and Senate bills are similar in most respects. They would reduce the Federal budget deficit by a total of $500 billion over the next five years, largely by raising the taxes of wealthy individuals and cutting military spending.
But there are enough differences, especially over energy taxes and spending on social programs, that finding an acceptable compromise will be touch and go, and even the President's staunchest supporters are edgy.
Senator David Pryor of Arkansas said he had told his friend the President, "Each Democratic Senator has tremendous power, and we can't afford to lose a single vote."
This morning, the conferees on tax issues tentatively approved several items where the House and Senate bills were identical or differed only slightly.
 
Action on Corporate Tax
 The agreed, for instance, to raise the corporate tax rate to 35 percent from 34 percent and to prohibit in some circumstances tax deductions by publicly owned companies for the salaries of executives exceeding $1 million. They also agreed to deny business deductions for club dues, including airline and hotel clubs, and to prohibit business executives from deducting their spouses' travel costs when they accompany the executives on business trips.
Tonight, the House conferees made their first offer of compromise to their Senate counterparts, and like the initial offer in a typical labor negotiation, no consequential concessions were made. The Senate conferees will make their first counteroffer Wednesday.
In his speech this afternoon, the President avoided specific controversies. He never mentioned, for example, energy taxes.
But he gave some clues to his thinking when he said he did not believe Medicare spending should be limited any more than it was in the Senate's bill, and he said he would insist on some tax breaks for small businesses and on special tax treatment for businesses that open in certain poor neighborhoods.
"Somehow," he said, "we haven't found a way to take a big old knife and cut through the rhetorical fog that has been blanketing our efforts in this town for the last several months."
"We can come out of this conference with a plan that can pass the conference and, more importantly, can pass the political judgment of the American people if we make sure they know what is in it," he said.

HEADLINE: CHANGE AT THE F.B.I.;
Clinton Names New York Judge As F.B.I. Chief

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
President Clinton finished assembling his roster of top crime fighters today with the announcement that he would appoint Judge Louis J. Freeh of Federal District Court in Manhattan to replace William S. Sessions as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
In making the expected appointment of Mr. Freeh, who ended up as the only member on the Administration's short list for the F.B.I. job, Mr. Clinton also sought to lay to rest an issue that has hung like a cloud over his Administration for six months: the turmoil within the F.B.I. as Mr. Sessions fought to stay in his job. Mr. Sessions was dismissed on Monday, after he had refused to resign. 
 The appointment of Mr. Freeh is subject to confirmation by the Senate. Mr. Clinton has selected Floyd I. Clarke, Mr. Sessions' deputy and political nemesis, to serve as director in the interim.
 
Main Threats to Society
 Citing white-collar crime, drug trafficking and gang warfare as the prime criminal threats to society, Mr. Clinton said he expected Judge Freeh to join Attorney General Janet Reno and his drug policy coordinator, Lee Brown, as "a street-smart front line against crime."
"These law enforcers did not learn about crime in theory books," Mr. Clinton said. "They learned about it on the streets and in the courtroom, and they have learned the best lessons of state and local enforcers."
Mr. Freeh's appointment won immediate endorsements from leading senators. Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, said that Judge Freeh's credentials appeared impressive and that he intended to work to have a Senate vote on the nomination by the August recess. Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Delaware Democrat who heads the Judiciary Committee, which will vote on the nomination, also praised Mr. Freeh, calling him "ideally suited for the job."
Senator Alfonse D'Amato, Republican of New York, joined Judge Freeh at the White House announcement today and also promised quick action on his nomination.
 
'Instant Credibility'
 "Lou Freeh brings instant credibility to the job," Mr. D'Amato said.
There was no sign of trouble for the Freeh nomination today. It will probably come before the Senate Judiciary committee once the panel finishes its work on the nomination of Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court.
"Anyone doubting the need for an efficient F.B.I. need only read the front page or watch the evening news," Mr. Freeh said at a Rose Garden ceremony. "What most Americans once thought impossible has now occurred here: a terrorist bomb that killed, maimed and spread terror in our nation's largest city. "We now live in a global village in terms of law enforcement."
Mr. Clinton made clear that he will quickly seek to capitalize on the bipartisan approval that has greeted his nominations of Judges Freeh and Ginsburg. He went to Capitol Hill today to lobby wavering members of Congress on his economic plan, and he will make the same pitch to small-business owners in Maryland on Wednesday.
"We have come this far," he said today to the members of the budget conference committees. "This is no time to turn back. We have been bold. This is no time to be timid. We have faced this crisis squarely. This is no time to blink."

HEADLINE: Rebate Offer Should Not Harm G.M.

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 20

 BODY:
G.M.'s proposed settlement of lawsuits related to the company's pickup trucks is unlikely to create a huge financial liability for the No. 1 auto maker, analysts said today.
Late Monday, the General Motors Corporation said it would settle 36 class-action lawsuits by giving certificates for a $1,000 rebate on the purchase of a new truck to owners of G.M. pickups equipped with side-mounted fuel tanks from the years 1973 to 1987. Critics say the trucks are more likely to catch fire or explode in an accident than other vehicles. 
 G.M. said the settlement would not be a financial drain on it, even though the value of the rebates could theoretically exceed $5 billion, since 4.7 million to 6 million trucks are involved.
But Ron Glantz, automotive analyst for Dean Witter in San Francisco, estimated that the rebate program was likely to be far less expensive, costing about $1 billion. "Many of these coupons are going to end up in the hands of people who were going to buy these trucks anyway," he said.
Wendy Needham, an analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham in New York, called the program's cost minimal. "It's a way to deal with the agony of litigation," she said.
The rest of Wall Street appeared to agree with those assessments. G.M.'s shares rose $1.125 today, to $48.875.
The settlement, which is subject to approval by a Federal district court in Philadelphia, did not resolve G.M.'s dispute with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The Federal agency has sought a truck recall, but G.M. has refused, maintaining that the trucks are safe.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs said they could still seek damages for personal injuries since the settlement applied only to economic loss caused by the trucks' reduced resale value.
Results of a similar move by Audi in 1988 implied that G.M.'s program might cost far less than $1 billion.
Less than 1 percent of the roughly 200,000 owners of the Audi 5000 used $4,000 to $5,000 discounts offered by the German auto maker toward the purchase of new Audi models. The discounts were offered after consumer groups contended that the Audi 5000 was prone to sudden, unintended acceleration. If the same percentage of owners of G.M. pickups use the discounts, the cost to G.M. could be less than $50 million.

HEADLINE: Angrily, Clinton Defends Record

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
As reporters questioned him by satellite hookup today, President Clinton angrily declared that he had built a record of uncommon success in his first six months and accused the news media of blocking his message.
Mr. Clinton's satellite interviews were intended to spread his economic message without going through the filter of Washington press coverage. But when the reporters in Louisiana and Wisconsin questioned him closely about his commitment to the energy tax he has proposed and his ability to keep promises, Mr. Clinton grew impatient. 
 "I would like for you to go back and analyze the first six months of the previous Administrations and tell me who got more done in six months," he said. "If you can tell me, I'll be glad to hear it. If there isn't anybody you can find who's done more, then we need to examine why the American people don't know that."
He also grew angry when he was asked whether a strong leader would have compromised on a promise to lift the ban on homosexuals in the military.
"I am the first President who ever took on this issue," Mr. Clinton responded tightly. "Is that a sign of weakness?"
Gay troops, he said, "are much better off today because we took an honorable compromise."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS -- ADVERTISING;
A Corporate Campaign Tries Selling Toyota's U.S. Presence.

BYLINE: By Michael Janofsky

 BODY:
IN the old days, the words "economy car" in advertising carried an unambiguous meaning. They described a vehicle that was small, affordable and efficient.
These days, it's more complicated. Clouded by lopsided trade balances, a troubled economy and issues of protectionism, a sales pitch is not necessarily what it seems. For example, a current ad for Toyota appearing in news magazines shows a spiffy new four-door Camry in profile below big red and black letters that say, "economy car," which it may well be, at a base price of $14,000. 
 But less than a sales pitch for Toyota the car, the ad is selling Toyota the company -- Toyota, the American company, at a time when large segments of the population have grown sensitive to the origin of the products they purchase. Not to be minimized as a motivation to buy, those kinds of sentiments are why a variety of companies pluck the chords of nationalism in their ad campaigns, like Wal-Mart's "Sam's American Choice" or Du Pont's use of "Made in the U.S.A."
Never mind that some products, or parts of some, like a Toyota Camry, might be made elsewhere. Patriotism is often the last refuge of a salesman for its power to sway an undecided buyer or a buyer for whom nationalism might be the tie-breaking factor.
The Toyota ad, which was created by the Oasis International Group in New York, makes the point that Toyota, as a Japanese company with an American presence since 1957, now employs 15,000 people in the United States through a $5 billion investment, and invests another $4 billion through the purchase of parts used to make the cars.
"At Toyota," the copy reads, "we believe in the importance of investing in the economies where we do business."
A companion ad shows the same picture of the Camry amid copy that says, "We buy the best parts in the world, no matter which state they're from." Surrounding the picture are the names of 44 parts and the American states in which they are made.
In both ads, the implicit message is that while this is a Japanese-brand car, it is American made, and that's good for the United States economy.
"These are is not intended to be political ads," Tim Andree, group manager of external affairs for Toyota in New York, said. "It's for educational purposes about a global company with a Japanese name. The point we want to make is that Toyota's presence in America is positive. As we've grown here, we have reinvested, and we will continue to invest in the market."
At least six Japanese auto makers manufacture cars in the United States. They include Honda, Nissan, Mazda, Mitsubishi and Suburu, as well as Toyota. Their plants employing a total of more than 35,000 Americans, according to figures complied by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association in Washington. In a 16-page brochure, the association uses charts, graphs and maps to show how the United States economy has benefited from Japanese car makers.
But in some ways, does not even a suggestion of nationalism as a rationale for purchase provide yet another means to widen the kind of socio-ethnic differences that divide a society? Expert opinions vary.
"The question is whether the ad improves a perception or exacerbates a problem," said Jack Myers, who has written several books on advertising, including "Ad Bashing: Surviving the Attacks on Advertising."
"It raises the question," he added, "whether they should be trying to compete as an American company or trying to legitimize the internationalism of their business. The more you cater to nationalistic tendencies, the more the propensity of nationalism gains strength, and that isolates. And that's dangerous."
Sal Randazzo, a senior vice president at D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles in New York and the author of "Mythmaking on Madison Avenue," said he'd like to give the car manufacturer the benefit of the doubt.
"If it's true that Toyota has contributed to our society and is responsible for all those jobs, then they have the right to blow their own horn to offset that quote, foreign, unquote perception," he said. "I don't see anything inherently wrong with it. A consumer is buying the company as much as buying the product. So I think it's legitimate, especially with American companies pushing nationalism. If the Japanese companies didn't do it, they would be left in that other place."
He added, "I would just like to think they're doing it for the right reasons."

HEADLINE: Prescription for Airline Industry: Tinker Just a Bit

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
With Congress making noises about stanching the airline industry's financial hemorrhage and President Clinton going out of his way to lend a sympathetic ear to the industry's pleas for help, free marketeers have been on the defensive.
At best, they figured, the commission set up to advise the President and Congress on how to solve the industry's problems would merely be a soapbox for complaints about unbridled competition. At worst, they thought it would rally a coalition of interest groups that would lobby for reregulation of fares and routes. 
 The panel -- named the National Commission to Ensure a Strong, Competitive Airline Industry -- issued its preliminary report Monday, and it did, in fact, debate steps back toward regulation.
 
Strongly Held Views
 But free-market-minded members including John Robson, a former chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board, and Daniel Kasper, a consultant at Harbridge House in Boston, made clear that the group -- a politically awkward assemblage of special-interest representatives and public-policy notables appointed by Congress and the President -- would never reach consensus on a radical departure from open competition.
The free-market camp reportedly received crucial support from a panel member, Herbert Kelleher, the president of Southwest Airlines and the head of the only post-deregulation airline that has minted money in both good times and bad.
On balance, suggests Alfred Kahn, former chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board, which has been abolished, and the guru of transportation deregulation in the Carter Administration, "The commission deserves credit for resisting what must have been very strong political pressures to reregulate." What's more, he notes, its proposal to reorganize the air traffic control system on a businesslike footing is eminently sensible.
Almost everyone agrees that stockholders and creditors in the airline industry have lost pots of money in the last few years. That, however, is about all they agree on.
Some members of Congress, notably Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, chairman of the Commerce Committee, say that the industry's lemming-like rush to expand with borrowed money proves that airline deregulation has been a bust.
Some, including Robert Crandall, American Airlines' outspoken president, blame the bankruptcy laws, which have permitted a host of insolvent carriers to keep flying.
 
Placing Fault
 Some link the red ink to larger macroeconomic forces. "The losses in the industry are closely correlated with recession and jet fuel prices," commented David Swierenga, chief economist of the Air Transport Association.
Still others -- probably including most economists -- are skeptical that there is cause for concern if too many planes are chasing too few passengers. "If there's overcapacity in the business, it's no one's fault but the airlines," said William Niskanen, chairman of the conservative-leaning Cato Institute in Washington.
The commission did recommend that bankrupt carriers be forced to reorganize or go out of business within one year. But it rejected the idea that fire-sale pricing by bankrupt carriers was the primary cause of the industry's problems. A one-year deadline is not likely to draw anyone to the barricades.
The group also went along with the idea of creating a board to keep the Transportation Department informed on the financial status of the airlines, a proposal dismaying to some. Mr. Kahn sees it as the proverbial camel's nose. But Mr. Kasper reassures, insisting that advice means no more than advice. "The commission does not favor reregulation," he emphasized.
While the commission went out of its way to avoid heavy-duty controversy, it did offer recommendations that are sure to stir the waters.
One is to lower the tax burden on airlines, a proposal that Washington will not welcome in the midst of delicate negotiations over deficit reduction. Many industries have been reeling under the brunt of the 90's slowdown, and it is far from clear why the industry should be singled out for special treatment. But the carriers may yet benefit from forces beyond their influence: the House version of the budget bill offers relief from the alternative minimum tax for all corporations including airlines.
But the recommendation with the greatest potential impact concerns the Federal Aviation Administration.
 
Freedom for the F.A.A.
 The commission wants to "corporatize" the F.A.A., freeing it from the inertia of Government procurement policies and giving it wide discretion to deliver services and meet its revenue needs from cost-based user fees.
This is not likely to happen next month or next year: lawmakers are sure to resist any administrative change that puts beyond their control decisions about which airport needs a new computer or what brand the F.A.A. buys. But this proposal does give the airlines, their unions and their suppliers a very practical goal around which to close ranks. And that is no small achievement.

HEADLINE: COMPANY EARNINGS;
Citicorp's Income Posts Sharp Gain In Quarter

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
Citicorp, the nation's largest banking company, posted sharply higher second-quarter earnings yesterday, continuing its recovery from a disaterous run-in with bad real estate loans.
In what is turning out to be a very good period for America's banks, several other large banking companies also reported increased earnings yesterday, including the Chemical Banking Corporation and the Nationsbank Corporation. 
 Citicorp reported earnings of $446 million, up from $143 million in the second quarter last year. Citicorp earned $370 million in the first quarter before a $300 million gain for accounting changes.
In the second quarter, Citicorp earned 88 cents a share, sharply higher than the 60 cents a share analysts had expected. Most of that difference was accounted for by higher trading profits. Other large banks, including Chase Manhattan and J.P. Morgan, have also benefited from volatile currency and bond markets.
Citicorp said it had revenues of $352 million from currency trading and $220 million from securities trading, both nearly double the level of a year earlier.
The bank's losses from bad loans continued to decrease. The bank's credit costs, which include bad debts written off and the expense of managing troubled assets, were $297 million for loans to business, down from $380 million in the first quarter and a peak of $792 million in the fourth quarter of 1991.
Credit costs from consumer loans declined slightly, to $708 million, adjusted to include credit card loans that were packaged and sold as securities, compared with $716 million in the first quarter.
The bank reduced its portfolio of North American real estate assets by $900 million, to $15.6 billion, with most of the decrease coming from borrowers paying off their debts. The bank's problem real estate loans and holdings of foreclosed property also declined in the quarter.
The bank's operating costs were up 4 percent from the year before, representing higher spending on advertising in the United states and investments in the consumer business in developing countries
Citicorp also continued to increase its capital, although the bank remains the least well capitalized of the country's major banks. The bank's Tier-1 capital ratio, a key measure of financial strength, increased to 5.7 percent of assets from 5.2 percent at the end of March and 4.3 percent a year earlier. The country's largest banks averaged a Tier-1 capital ratio of 8.8 percent in the first quarter.
Citicorp increased its profitability, posting a return on equity of 16.9 percent for the quarter, a relatively high figure, more than triple the rate a year earlier. The bank said it had better results in less developed countries of Latin America and Asia than in the recession-bound developed world.
As they have with other banks, analysts following Citicorp have begun to turn their attention from current problems to the prospects for future growth.
"The major concern is the slow recovery in the U.S. and the recession in Europe will slow the improvement in Citi's credit quality and its new business flow," said Diane B. Glossman, an analyst with Salomon Brothers.

b-Included a gain of $300 million, or 67 cents a share, which reflected the effect of adoption of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes.
As previously reported, Citicorp restated 1992 second-quarter net income to $143 million, or 25 cents a share, from the previously reported $171 million, or 32 cents a share. The bank said the restatement resulted from a bank regulatory examination of the U.S. mortgage business, which was completed subsequent to the reporting of results.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Declines After a Lift Linked to Hint of a Rate Rise

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell against other leading currencies yesterday after getting a brief lift from the Federal Reserve chairman's suggestion that United States interest rates would rise if inflation began to take off.
Gold prices fell overseas, but were mixed domestically. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the actively traded gold contract for August delivery was at $392.20, down 20 cents. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted gold at $391.80, up 60 cents. 
 Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress that the inflation level was "disappointing." He indicated that the Fed would raise interest rates if prices started to shoot up.
The dollar, which had traded at 1.7063 German marks late Monday, rose to 1.7150 marks after Mr. Greenspan's remarks. But it drifted down to 1.6997 in late trading in New York.
Also in New York, the dollar was quoted at 108.15 Japanese yen yesterday, down from 108.46 a day earlier. The British pound, meanwhile, rose to $1.5110 in New York, from $1.4985 on Monday.
 
Warning Not So Dire
 Normally, an indication of higher interest rates would spur investment in a currency. But currency brokers said investors did not regard Mr. Greenspan's warnings as that dire.
They said the market was not as concerned that the recent run-up in gold prices indicates impending inflation, as Mr. Greenspan had suggested in his remarks.
"I'm not certain how high of a concern Mr. Greenspan raised with his comment about gold," said Rick Porter, vice president and manager of corporate treasury at Bank Brussels Lambert.
Investors may also have bought German marks because of a rumor in the markets that Germany has exceeded its targets for growth in the money supply, traders said. Rapid money growth produces inflation. If Germany's money supply is expanding faster than expected, the central bank would likely keep interest rates high.
Traders also noted that investors' fears had been calmed about imminent disruption in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Such worries last week had prompted speculators to buy dollars and sell European currencies.

BYLINE: By Jane E. Brody

 BODY:
CATARACT surgery today is a far cry from the procedure of decades past. Back then, patients waited until their vision was nearly totally obscured by a cloudy lens and were then hospitalized for 10 days or more, their heads immobile with sandbags while their eyes healed. They were then sent home with Coke-bottle spectacles that restored their sight but greatly enlarged and distorted visual images.
Today the surgery is usually an outpatient procedure under local anesthesia, with a rapid return to normal activities and excellent vision correction with ordinary lenses. It is often done as soon as the cataract begins to interfere with normal activities. Nearly everyone, regardless of medical history, can have the surgery. 
 In the last decade or so cataract surgery has become so swift, safe and effective that some experts say it is now being done too soon or too often on patients who may never need it. About 1.3 million cataracts are removed in this country each year and as the population ages, the pool of potential patients keeps growing.
With surgeons' fees ranging from $1,000 (under Medicare) to as much as $5,000, and with surgical centers charging $1,200 to $4,000 or more for anesthesia and materials, cataract surgery mills have sprung up, and unnecessary cataract surgery has become an economic and medical concern.
However safe, cataract surgery is not free of risk. Patients who are told they have cataracts should understand more about the condition, when something should be done about it and risks and benefits of the various procedures involved.
 
Who Has Cataracts
 A cataract is a clouding of the normally transparent lens of the eye, the disk in the center of the pupil that directs incoming images to the retina. The condition can be caused by many noxious factors, including trauma, toxic substances, metabolic problems, like uncontrolled diabetes, and excessive exposure to sunlight. But the most common cause is simply a natural aging process.
Cataracts develop slowly and may never reach the point where they interfere with a person's chosen activities. However, some people mistakenly think their gradual loss of visual acuity is an inevitable and uncorrectable part of the aging process, and may suffer needlessly when simple surgery could restore their sight.
Population studies suggest that 15 percent of people from 50 to 85 years old have cataracts "ripe" enough to reduce their visual acuity. Some clouding of the lens can be detected in more than 40 percent of people from 55 to 64 and in up to three-fourths of those from 65 to 74, but only a minority have significant visual loss.
In a recent consensus report, the United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research recommended that a loss of visual acuity to 20/50 with glasses be used as an objective criterion for surgery. However, the agency emphasized that more subjective criteria, involving the patient's visual demands and infirmities, determine the need for surgery.
Thus, surgery may be warranted to remove a relatively young cataract from someone who finds that it interferes with reading, driving or playing tennis, but a more advanced cataract may not be removed from someone who neither reads nor drives, but mostly walks and watches TV.
 
Treating Cataracts
 Modern cataract surgery typically takes less than an hour and involves a small incision through the cornea and sclera that permits the surgeon to push out or suck out the cloudy lens, leaving the lens capsule in place. Some surgeons use a procedure known as phacoemulsification, in which the lens is first shattered by ultrasound waves and the pieces are sucked out through a tiny incision.
In either case, in 90 percent of cases an artificial lens is slipped in to replace the one that was removed. But unlike a normal lens, the artificial one is adjusted only for distance vision and cannot change shape to focus on nearby images. So about two to four months later, after the eye has fully healed and stabilized, the patient is fitted with standard eyeglasses to restore near-normal acuity.
Most patients go home the same day, wearing an eye patch for 24 hours, and returning to normal activities the next day. They are advised to avoid exertion like bending and heavy lifting for several weeks. They get antibiotic and steroid eye drops to prevent infection and reduce inflammation.
Besides the minimal risks of local anesthesia, other risks include hemorrhage, infection and damage to the retina. The most common complication is a vision-obscuring thickening of the lens capsule. A laser is typically used to prevent or relieve the problem, but laser therapy also has risks.
In a study of 57,103 Medicare cataract patients by researchers at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins universities, 2 percent of patients who have the laser treatment suffer serious retinal damage and partial or total loss of vision in the affected eye. Of the more than half-million people treated each year with the laser, younger white males are at greatest risk of this complication, the researchers found. They advised using the laser only for patients impaired by postoperative clouding of the lens.
 
Precautions
 In choosing an ophthalmological surgeon to treat your cataract, look for someone who has done hundreds of the procedures but avoid those who do only cataract surgery lest you fall into the hands of a cataract-mill surgeon who cares more about the fee than the patient's quality of life.
If you get the feeling that you are being railroaded into surgery you are not sure you need, or if you are troubled by a cataract your surgeon is reluctant to treat, seek a second and, if necessary, a third opinion.
Also check your insurance coverage carefully. Medicare and most private insurers typically reimburse 80 percent of the surgeon's fee and what are deemed "reasonable" charges by the medical center. But ambulatory surgicenters certified by Medicare receive the full reasonable charge, reducing the financial burden on the patient. Like Medicare, private insurers may have caps on the amount they will pay, which could mean a big bill for the patient.
 
All About Cataracts
 Dr. Julius Shulman, a New York ophthalmologist, has revised his book "Cataracts" (St. Martin's Press, $18.95), which covers everything about the condition, from causes and diagnosis to treatment and recovery.
Also consider these protective measures: Stay out of the sun as much as possible; if you wear glasses, get lenses with full ultraviolet protection, and do the same with sunglasses. Consume plenty of fruits and vegetables rich in antioxidant vitamins, beta-carotene and vitamin C, and consider taking a daily supplement of vitamin E.

HEADLINE: 'Expert' Babies Found to Teach Others

BYLINE: By DANIEL GOLEMAN

 BODY:
IT was during the blustery days of last March that 10-month-old Russell Ruud taught the other babies in his day-care group a lesson their parents may have wished he hadn't: how to unzip the Velcro chin straps of their winter hats.
"One day I went to pick Russell up and his teacher told me that the other mothers were complaining that their children had learned from him how to take off their hats," said Dr. Judith Ruud, Russell's mother and, at the time, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, just a few blocks from the Trinity Preschool in Manhattan. 
 "I never showed Russell how to unzip the Velcro," said Ms. Ruud, now with the Congressional Budget Office in Washington. "He learned it by trial and error, and the other kids saw him do it one day when they were getting dressed for an outing."
While Russell's tutorial was perhaps not what all parents would want their children to learn at school, it exemplifies something that new research is identifying as an unexpected advantage of day care and play groups: even the youngest toddlers are able to learn new skills from each other, and the abilities one acquires can quickly spread to others.
"The surprise is to find that preverbal babies can take home with them what they learn from other babies," said Dr. Andrew N. Meltzoff, a developmental psychologist at the University of Washington, who has conducted a series of studies with 128 toddlers showing they have a remarkable ability to learn from each other, and that what they learn in a group is retained outside the group setting. An article on his findings appears in the July issue of the journal Developmental Psychology.
To be sure, every parent knows that children learn a lot from their playmates. But the new findings push back the earliest age at which children were thought to learn skills from each other to a stage of life before children are able to talk.
 
Positive Picture of Day Care
 One implication is that day care for young toddlers may represent an enriched educational setting simply because it exposes children to other children and their diversity of simple skills. The findings come at a time when day care is a fact of life for more and more parents; Census Bureau data suggest that one of the fastest-growing segments of the work force is mothers of children under 1 year old.
The new research may offer a bit of solace to working parents with regard to a choice that many cannot avoid. And these findings fit with others that give a positive picture of the long-term impact of early day care.
"We have data showing that the earlier kids start in high-quality day care, the more advantaged they are intellectually and socially in the long run," said Dr. Tiffany Field, a psychologist in the pediatrics department at the University of Miami Medical School.
In her research, published in the journal Child Development in 1991, Dr. Field evaluated 84 children in the first through sixth grades and found that those who had started day care early fared best academically and socially.
Other experts are more cautious. "There may be some small advantage for very young children in day care because of this kind of imitative learning, though I certainly wouldn't make that a main reason for sending a child," said Dr. Lewis Lippsitt, a developmental psychologist at Brown University.
The learning that goes on in the first year or two of life is through watching and imitating. Such learning among toddlers in day care is something like the cooperative learning that is gaining popularity in elementary and high schools. Some experts believe this pooling of skills may in part explain other findings of enhanced development among children who attended high-quality day care when compared with those who stayed home or had poor care.
 
Babies Remember Skills
 "The new twist was to test whether young toddlers would imitate their peers, and whether this learning was robust enough to persist at home after a substantial passage of time," said Dr. Meltzoff, who did the research with Elizabeth Hanna, a graduate student. Psychologists have long studied how infants use a natural talent as mimics to learn how to handle the challenges of life.
The researchers invented five simple toys that a 1-year-old could master with some coaching, so that none of the babies would have seen them before or learned how to use them elsewhere. One toy, for example, was a collapsible plastic cup made of progressively larger rings; the cup would collapse if a child pushed it down with a flat hand. Another allowed a baby to ring a bell by pressing a button hidden in a hole in a box.
In the first phase of the study, babies an average of 14 months old were trained as "experts" by sitting on their mother's laps while they watched an experimenter demonstrate a toy. The children then tried the toys themselves and were praised for using them correctly.
Next, the expert babies showed other babies how each of the five toys worked by playing with them while the others watched. The babies who watched were given a chance to play with the toys for a few minutes immediately after the demonstration; they played with each of the five toys correctly 64 percent of the time.
In a later phase of the study, with children of about 20 months old, expert toddlers were brought into a day- care center and, after playing with the other toddlers, demonstrated the toys while the others were seated around a table watching. The expert babies demonstrated each toy just once, with the others watching but not allowed to touch. Then all the toddlers went back to playing.
It wasn't until two days later, when the toys were brought to the homes of all the toddlers who had watched, that they were able to play with them at all. They played properly with the toys 72 percent of the time.
 
Advantages Persist for Years
 "These findings provide direct evidence that young toddlers in day care centers can learn and remember what they see other children do, even after a substantial delay and in a completely different setting," said Dr. Meltzoff. "And this learning is without any chance for trial and error themselves, but simply by watching another toddler do something just once."
While earlier research, including several studies by Dr. Meltzoff, had demonstrated that even very young babies can imitate simple acts, these experiments are the first to test if toddlers can remember and repeat what they have seen after time has passed and in a different setting, without the memory cues that setting might offer. Such long-term transfer of memory is considered a crucial test of learning in everyday life.
"This imitative learning is a large part of why kids in good early day care have advantages in the long run," said Dr. Field. "When we looked at kids in elementary school, the earlier they had started day care, the higher their scores on math tests and the more likely they were to be in gifted programs, the more popular they were with their peers, the more assertive their teachers rated them and the more emotionally stable they were."
The advantages of early day care may persist into the teen-age years, according to findings from a 1992 Swedish study, which evaluated 128 children at age 13. A government subsidy allows for what many experts consider to be model day care programs, and many Swedish children begin day care before they are 1 year old. The Swedish study focused on children who entered day care at from 6 to 12 months of age.
In an earlier evaluation of the children when they were 8 years old, the Swedish researchers found that those who entered day care before their first birthday were rated by their third-grade teachers as more persistent, independent, verbally facile, calm and socially confident than other children. They found no negative characteristics common to the children in early day care group.
Five years later, as the children entered adolescence, some advantages for those who entered day care at an early age still held: they performed better academically and were more creative, popular and independent than the other children.
 
Finding Quality Day Care
 The quality of day care is crucial. "Low-quality day care does not have the advantages," said Dr. Field. In addition, while these two studies show surprisingly long-term benefits of day care, experts say that the final word about advantages and drawbacks of day care is not yet in. A large Federal study of many different sites is now under way.
Points to look for in day care include an optimal ratio of children to teachers. If there are too many teachers, for instance, they may socialize more with each other than with the children; if there are too few teachers, the result is a destructive chaos. For 1-year-olds, a 4-to-1 ratio of children to teachers is considered best; for 2 and 3 year olds there should be an 8-to-1 ratio and for 4 and 5 year olds there should be a 12-to-1 ratio, said Dr. Field.
"High quality also means an enriched environment, with plenty of toys and other materials, enough space for kids to play on their own and a well-organized daily routine," he said. "In addition to what kids in day care learn from each other and their teachers, they also learn how to get along as sociable creatures, so that when they get to grade school they don't have to figure that out and can focus better on their academic work."

Blue-Chip Park Plan On Shaky Foundation

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
If George Steinbrenner considers New Jersey a serious bargaining chip in his threat to abandon Yankee Stadium and New York, he probably shouldn't be so quick to take a free ride across the George Washington Bridge.
New Jersey officials have suggested that they could finance a stadium for the Yankees with gambling revenues from Atlantic City casinos, but baseball officials long have been uncomfortable with any link to casinos. 
 Bud Selig, owner of the Milwaukee Brewers and the man in charge of major league baseball in the absence of a commissioner, said yesterday that he had not heard about the New Jersey plan. But he added: "That raises an interesting question that would have to be looked at."
 
Money for a Stadium
 The state's Casino Reinvestment Development Authority receives 1.25 percent of the gross winnings from each of Atlantic City's 12 casinos. The money is used primarily for housing and economic development in Atlantic City and South Jersey, but Nicholas Amato, head of the authority, has said that money -- as much as $250 million -- is available for projects in North Jersey.
Some of those funds, he said, could help finance a baseball stadium. Other state officials have supported the idea, which would not require taxpayer approval. The Yankees, who held talks with Amato last year, have declined to comment on the possible casino plan.
Talk of a stadium for the Yankees comes at a time when the casinos are pushing the State Legislature to approve betting on professional sports at the casinos. A provision in a Federal law gives New Jersey until the end of this year to consider legalization of sports betting. All professional sports oppose such betting as a threat to the integrity of their leagues, and the issue faces possible insurmountable obstacles in the state.
Fay Vincent, baseball's most recent commissioner, said yesterday that proponents of legalized sports betting in New Jersey have proposed putting a percentage of money gambled on sports into the casino reinvestment fund.
"That would be perverse," Vincent said in a telephone interview, of the idea of luring the Yankees to New Jersey with gambling money when baseball is totally opposed to sports betting.
"Baseball's leverage would be to say there's no way we'll approve a move to New Jersey," he added, "unless you drop the idea of sports betting at the casinos. George Steinbrenner and baseball should come out strongly and say they won't consider a move otherwise."
A few years ago, when he was still the commissioner, Vincent recalled, the idea of sports betting was under consideration by the District of Columbia council.
"I took the position that if D.C. passes sports betting, Washington will not be a candidate for an expansion team," he said. "It's consistent. Any community that takes a position that's so negative to sports should recognize what it's doing."
 
Voters Reject Plan
 New Jersey doesn't seem to have an alternative to the casino-fund proposal. In a referendum in 1987, the state's voters rejected a proposal to build a stadium with public money, and given the economy in recent years, the voters would not be expected to be any more inclined now to approve such spending. Although the Yankees' lease with the Stadium runs through 2002, a new ball park, regardless of the location, would need to be in the works well before the deadline.
If baseball's executive council, after investigating a casino-fund idea, found it onerous (one council member yesterday called it "a somewhat vexing matter"), Steinbrenner would be left without the New Jersey option, which has been his most attractive and -- to New York -- threatening choice.

HEADLINE: Top Chefs Try to Develop Taste for Amazon Fish At Rain-Forest Benefit

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
FOR the last few years, we've been inundated with rain-forest products, especially fruits and nuts, to highlight the plight of threatened tropical regions. Now, along come fish.
An exotic contingent consisting of tucunare, filhote, tambaqui, pescada, piramutaba and dourada were recently flown to this country for a benefit that had two goals: to interest chefs in using the Amazon fish, and to alert people that fish, too, are linked to the imperiled ecology of rain forests. 
 The benefit, in East Hampton, L.I., on Kay LeRoy's rolling lawns, raised money for the Rainforest Alliance, a nonprofit organization based in New York that is dedicated to preserving the world's tropical forests.
About the only fish from the Amazon River most people can name is the voraciously carnivorous piranha, which, although supposedly delectable, was not served at the benefit because it is annoyingly bony. But there were plenty of other choices, as there are 3,000 species of freshwater fish that inhabit the Amazon, a river system that includes a fifth of all the world's river water.
By creating a larger market for the fish, fish farms could be organized in the Amazon region. That would help preserve the rain forest by creating jobs for local people and using, but not overusing, the local resources.
"Deforestation not only destroys land, it also damages the Amazon flood plain which is the habitat of these fish," said Michael Goulding, a research scientist at the University of Florida in Gainsville who is director of the alliance's Amazon Rivers Project.
Each guest paid $250 to taste the fish and trappings created for them by some of the New York area's best-known chefs, including David Bouley, Gilbert Le Coze, Jean Jacques Rachou, Ed Brown, Charles Palmer, Michel Bourdeaux, David Waltuck, Eric Ripert, Debra Ponzek, Andre Soltner and Pat Trama. These chefs, who either work in Manhattan or East Hampton, would not normally touch a frozen fish, much less a block of tucunare or a whole frozen tambaqui.
But freezing the fish was essential because of the hot climate and the remoteness of the fishery, 1,000 miles up the Amazon in Brazil. It also destroyed any parasites that might be present in the fish.
Although initially wary of using frozen fish, the chefs were generally impressed with their taste. One that was served, tambaqui, eats fruits and nuts from trees that become submerged when the Amazon floods. It grows to 70 pounds and has bones like spare ribs and teeth like a horse. "It's like nothing I've ever seen, and I'd use it again," said Charles Palmer, the chef and co-owner of Aureole in Manhattan.
Among the dishes served were Moroccan spiced tambaqui with sweet onion marmalade, filhote with mango salsa and crispy ginger, and marinated pescada with green papaya and herbs. Alderwood smoked piramutaba with quinoa tasted better than smoked sturgeon.
Leonard Schwartz, chairman of the Rainforest Alliance, admitted that importing the fish to a place surrounded by plenty of fish of its own "was a crazy, wild thing to try to do." The party served not only as a debut for the fish, but raised money for the Amazon Rivers Project, a five-year, $500,000 program designed to help preserve the rain forest by making the Amazon economically productive.
"We are trying to show that by making the fish an important resource it makes more sense to maintain the tropical forest than turn it into grazing land," Mr. Goulding said. None of the fish are endangered in this area of the Amazon, he said, but a delicate balance must be maintained.
"These fish have been exported for 30 years, mostly to Europe and Africa," he said. "But developing an American market for them will add to their value and make it more essential to preserve the habitat."
Jeffrey Moats, the president of Kapok International, the fish-processing company based in Cleveland that imported the fish for the party, and who is working with the Brazilian Government to better organize the fish-processing industry, began selling the fish to restaurants in Cleveland in March; he said the response was encouraging. He added that he was meeting today with Julia Child, who has expressed interest in using the fish.
Even chefs like Mr. Bouley, who is accustomed to having halibut and fresh, hand-picked scallops flown to his restaurant from Maine in a matter of hours, had high praise for the firm-textured, flavorful pescada and said he would serve fish like these.
At the benefit, the chefs were busy tasting each others' food. A few were grudging in their praise. "The fish was better than I thought, even though it was frozen," said Mr. Soltner, the chef and owner of Lutece. "It would have to be fresh before I use it."
Mr. Soltner, who admitted that the last time he used frozen fish was 30 years ago, was unfamiliar with the latest techniques in flash freezing, which can bring fresh fish to 60 degrees below zero in just a few hours.
He also hedged his bets by grinding the dourada into mousse, then studding the mousse with salmon, wrapping it in brioche and serving it with watercress sauce, a less effective way to showcase the flavor and texture of the fish than simply sauteing it and serving it with a splash of sherry vinegar on a bed of summer vegetables, as Gilbert Le Coze and Eric Ripert of Le Bernardin did.
"This fish reminds me of pompano," Mr. Le Coze said.
In coming months, New Yorkers may have a chance to judge for themselves.

HEADLINE: Sports of The Times;
High Stakes; Low Sense Of Values

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

 BODY:
IN launching an investigation into Michael Jordan's gambling habits, the National Basketball Association has embarked, or rather, has been taken on a far-reaching ride across revealing, occasionally treacherous landscape.
The investigation has taken the league to a bail bondsman in the Carolinas who was murdered and a drug dealer who was convicted. To Monte Carlo for an Olympic tuneup and late night-early morning visits to betting parlors. To Atlantic City, where Jordan and his father went out on the town the night before a Knicks playoff game. To San Diego, where Richard Esquinas -- Jordan's golfing partner turned tell-all author -- alleged that high-stakes golf matches left Jordan hundreds of thousands in debt. 
 Now the investigation has spilled over into the National Football League. Esquinas reportedly said that he was told by Jordan that Lawrence Taylor of the Giants owed the Bulls' star $150,000 in golf bets. Taylor said he owed substantially less.
Another report alleges that Mark Jackson of the Los Angeles Clippers lost $22,000 to Jordan playing cards. Jackson has admitted playing cards but denies owing $22,000.
Regardless of Jordan's activities, the N.B.A. has to know by now -- if it hasn't known for years -- there is a deeply entrenched gambling culture in all professional sports leagues.
The N.B.A. should also know that there is a burgeoning resentment over a perceived careless, self-indulgent attitude by its athletes. The betting disclosures typify a disturbing, cavalier attitude toward the prosperity the players have inherited.
Joe Morris, the former Giants running back, recalled that for many players, card games and dice games were practically a ritual of road trips. "On a West Coast trip I've seen a guy lose his shirt by the time we get out West and win it back by the time we come home," Morris said.
Morris recalled one trip when the team plane was about to land. "Just as the landing lights came on, a teammate asked me to lend him $100," Morris said. "By the time we landed, he'd already lost it."
A veteran offensive lineman recalled being astounded his first year in the N.F.L. by the consistently high sums of money being won or lost on trips. By his third year, the lineman said that he'd accepted gambling as part of team subculture.
Many fans have expressed ambivalence over Jordan's high-stakes gambling adventures. For others, there is a certain charm to the riverboat gambler he embodies.
For the N.B.A., however, and by extension the N.F.L., major league baseball and the National Hockey League, the evidence of a greater involvement in gambling by athletes weakens the foundation of sports.
The primary attraction of sports is that victory is determined by who runs fastest, who jumps highest, who makes the best uses of skills. The athlete who falls into debt, falls into bad company or under bad influences compromises the sport.
Once the public suspects that athletic contests are manipulated, that players are compromising their performances to affect a certain outcome, the foundation will erode.
Thirty years ago, the N.F.L. was hit by a betting scandal that resulted in the suspensions of two of the game's biggest stars -- Paul Hornung and Alex Karras -- for betting on league games and associating with gamblers.
College basketball was rocked by scandals in the 1950's and 60's. In 1920, eight Chicago White Sox players were indicted on charges of conspiring with gamblers to fix the 1919 World Series. Pete Rose was banned from baseball in 1989, presumably for betting on games.
In following the Jordan trail, the N.B.A. must ultimately determine how a league that has grown on the strength of its entertainment appeal can devise a policy that balances an athlete's right to privacy with responsibility to the league and the public.
For many segments of that public, especially those who work with young people, the most disturbing aspect of the unfolding gambling revelations is not an integrity issue, but rather the thread of waste and self-indulgent behavior by some athletes.
Those who defend Jordan argue that, so long as one has the resources to back it up, enormous losses are acceptable.
But this isn't about money, it's about values. With so much of the country stuck in a recession, with businesses shrinking their work forces and with so many of our youth locked out of opportunities for lack of resources, hundred-thousand- dollar gambling debts and $20,000 card games seem a bit excessive.
Even for millionaires.

MEIKO SCIENTIFIC IS AWARDED LIVERMORE CONTRACT

 BODY:
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory said yesterday that it had awarded the Meiko Scientific Corporation of Waltham, Mass., a $17.5 million contract for a Meiko CS-2 Massively Parallel Processor computer system. When the decision was first disclosed in March, concerns were raised over national security and economic competitiveness because Meiko was a subsidiary of Meiko World of Britain. And the company had been criticized for the sale of a supercomputer to Israel. But a Livermore official said yesterday that the same precautions were being taken with respect to Meiko as with other computer contractors who have foreign ownership or foreign sales.

HEADLINE: Stocks Stage Rebound, With Dow Up 9.50

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks moved higher yesterday on rebounds in a number of sectors that recently endured selloffs. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 9.50 points to finish at 3,544.78 in heavy trading.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 277.4 million shares, up from 216.4 million on Monday. 
Robert C. Walberg, an analyst with MMS International, said the early tone was set by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, in testimony to Congress.
Mr. Greenspan expressed concern about the rate of inflation, which caused a selloff in bonds and equities. However, the stock market was able to turn around in the afternoon, led by the recently beleaguered drugs and high-tech issues.
 
Companies' Gains Help Stocks
 Helping stocks turn up were better than expected earnings at a number of companies and a drop in oil prices.
Transportation stocks got a lift from the drop in oil, as airlines stocks lead a surge in the transport sector. AMR, the parent for American Airlines was up 2 3/8, to 63 3/8, while Delta Air Lines gained 1 3/4, to 50 1/4, and UAL, the parent for United, rose 4 3/4, to 138.
About the only new economic data were the June housing starts, which were unchanged from May and had little impact on the market, traders said.
Bargain hunters also played a role in limiting the downside.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 1.28 point, to 447.31, while the Big Board composite gained 0.38 point, to 247.71, and the Nasdaq composite gained 6.07 points, to 701.90.
Among stocks making contributions yesterday, Sears, Roebuck gained 4 1/8, to 50 1/8. The giant retailer reported second-quarter profits of $2.63 a share, compared with 85 cents a share for the quarter a year ago. The latest quarter also included a $635.1 million gain from the Allstate Corporation's initial public offering.
McDonnell Douglas rose 5 5/8, to 80 7/8, as Morgan Stanley and Cowen & Company upgraded their recommendations to buy. Monday the company reported a second-quarter profit of $4.33 a share, against 12 cents a share.
Cai von Rumohr, the analyst at Cowen & Company, raised his 1993 estimate to $11 a share from $9.25 and 1994 estimate to $11.50 a share from $10.
Alpha-Beta Technology, the developer of pharmaceutical products made of complex carbohydrates, fell by 2, to 25, as Alex. Brown & Sons lowered its recommendation to buy from a strong buy.
The stock price of the Amtech Corporation jumped 4 3/4, to 23 3/4, after Union International des Chemins de Fer, which represents 32 European railroads, selected Amtech's electronic anti-shoplifting tags as a standard for the continent. Traders said the stock had fallen by 3 in the last three days amid reports of setbacks on two contracts to install electronic equipment.
Intermagnetics General said it had entered into an agreement with the Chrysler Corporation to supply the auto maker with its refrigeration system. Delivery of the system, which does not use freon, is pending regulatory approval. Intermagnetics rose 6, to 15 1/2, up more than 63 percent

CORRECTION-DATE: July 23, 1993, Friday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Wednesday about Tuesday's stock market trading misidentified the products made by the Amtech Corporation. They are electronic identification tags for vehicles, not anti-shoplifting devices.

HEADLINE: THE CROWN HEIGHTS REPORT: On the Streets;
After Report, the Talk Of Residents Is Tense

BYLINE: By ARI L. GOLDMAN

 BODY:
The streets of Crown Heights were calm yesterday, but the talk was tense and filled with anger and hurt.
The day after a state report sharply criticized Mayor David N. Dinkins, top City Hall aides and the police leadership for their handling of the Crown Heights violence, the thoughts and emotions of blacks and Hasidic Jews seemed as divided as when the neighborhood erupted in disturbances two summers ago. 
 Many Jews expressed a feeling of vindication that their story had finally been told, but they fretted that justice had still not been served. But many of the neighborhood's blacks charged that Mr. Dinkins was being unfairly judged because of his race and complained that the state investigation had not gone far enough in getting to the underlying grievances behind the violence.
Like much of what goes on between the races in Crown Heights, blacks and Jews kept their opinions among themselves. Jews talked in the shopping district along Kingston Avenue with its kosher shops and Hebrew bookstores, and blacks gathered on Utica Avenue, with its Caribbean specialty shops and bodegas.
"The main question now is who is going to pay" for mistakes made by the police and City Hall, said Zohar Eisenberg, 42, a Hasidic man. "We've already paid with our blood."
Like many other Hasidic Jews, he was highly critical of Mayor Dinkins, whom the report cited for a chain of leadership failures in dealing with the distrurbances in which Jews were singled out by bands of black youths.
"People will remember in November," said Dena Gorkin, who is 29 and the mother of three.
"We can't wait until then," added Michael Atland, a middle-aged Lubavitch Hasid who is from France. "He must step down now. This report is nothing but a cover-up."
Opinions on Utica Avenue were starkly different. "They are trying to bring down a good black man," said Noreen Dowridge, a homemaker walking with her daughter, Keshia, 7.
"The Jews are going back to the same old way -- crucifying a black man," she said. "The Mayor had nothing to do with what went on here. It was young people who took everything in their own hands. The cops were the ones who were supposed to do something. Were they supposed to beat black people for nothing?"
Richard Green, executive director of the Crown Heights Youth Collective, said the report unfairly placed the onus for the disturbances on black youths. "There were young people out from both communities," he said.
Mr. Green said the Mayor and the Police Department acted appropriately during the violence. "He handled this like a statesman," he said.
 
Author Is Faulted
 Several blacks who were interviewed complained that the report was critical only of black actions and not of those of Jews. They faulted the report's author, Richard H. Girgenti, the state's Criminal Justice Director, for not thoroughly investigating the death of Gavin Cato, 7, the child whose death in an auto accident ignited the four days of violence. The vehicle was driven by a Hasidic man.
Several leaders in the black community said the report represented another instance of "preferential treatment" for Hasidic Jews, a claim echoing a refrain during the 1991 disturbances. Some black people said then that Jews got special consideration from city agencies, including the police, which provided the head of the Lubavtich movement, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, with a police escort.
A home health aide, who identified herself as C. Beddeau, said her granddaughter was one of the people who tried to lift the car off Gavin when it pinned him to a wall.
Ms. Beddeau lives in the building at President Street and Utica Avenue, where the accident occurred. She said that she gave a statement to state investigators. "I never heard anything else about it," she said. "They're covering up something."
Winston Gilbert, a Crown Heights resident from Grenada, said the report provided justice for Yankel Rosenbaum, 29, the Hasidic scholar fatally stabbed in the disturbances, but not for Gavin Cato. "Only one side of justice I have seen," he said.
Many Jews, however, dismissed any equation between the death of Gavin in an auto accident and the stabbing death of Mr. Rosenbaum.
The state investigation was ordered by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo last year after a jury acquitted a black teen-ager in Mr. Rosenbaum's death.
Rabbi Yehuda Krinksy, the spokesman for the Lubavitch Hasidic Movement, the major Jewish group in Crown Heights, said the report "corroborates the claims of the Jewish community, victims of the Crown Heights pogrom of August 1991."
For many residents, both black and Jewish, the release of the state report recalled the horror of that summer. Several people on Utica Avenue expressed dismay that the report failed to note that blacks in Crown Heights were also targets of violence by Jews. The report said Hasidic Jews were singled out by bands of black youths.
Yitzchok Bitton, who moved to Crown Heights more than a decade ago from France, remembered walking through the neighborhood with his son, then 12, on Aug. 20, 1991, the second day of the disturbances.
Police officers were armed in riot gear as he passed. "I asked if it was safe to go down the block," he recalled. "And they said yes." Halfway down Carol Street, he said, he and his son were thrown to the ground by 50 youths wielding bricks, bats and razors and chanting, "Jew! Jew! Jew!"
"There were police at both corners, but no one came to help us," he said.
"No one wants to put down the Mayor," said Mr. Bitton, a former full-time rock musician who now manages a Hasidic hotel. "But you have to bear responsibility for your actions." He said he did not believe that it was an issue of the Mayor's race but of his competence.
On Utica Avenue, Beryl Duffie, unemployed and the mother of two, said the report reopened wounds still raw and healing. "Right now," she said, "everybody hates everybody."

HEADLINE: Dow, in 10.62 Rise, Reaches a High

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at an all-time high yesterday on a day when all other market indicators moved in the opposite direction.
Relying primarily on a combination of rebounding stocks and some companies that reported decent earnings, the blue-chip indicator rose 10.62 points, to 3,555.40, edging above the previous high of 3,554.83 established on May 27. 
 The broader market was mixed as prices faded under pressure of a weak bond market, which was still smarting from the Congressional testimony of the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, Tuesday in which he expressed concern about inflation.
 
Strong Volume
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was strong for the second consecutive day, at 278.6 million shares traded, up from 277.4 million Tuesday. For the third straight session, losing issues outnumbered gainers, 1,051 to 923.
With no economic news to trade on and stocks being influenced by earnings and forecasts, one trader noted that the equity market just tagged along with bonds because it was the path of least resistance.
"The biggest notice was the bond market," John H. Shaughnessy, senior vice president and director of research for Advest Inc. said, "as concern about food price inflation showed signs of heating up because of flooding in the Midwest."
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell by 0.13 point, to 447.18, and the Big Board composite lost 0.11 point, to 247.60. Trading on the Nasdaq pulled the composite down by 1.82 points, to 700.08, while the American Stock Exchange composite slid 0.48 point, t0 433.31.
Interest rates moved higher as bond prices fell. "There is also the concern about short rates coming up," Mr. Shaughnessy said.
Mr. Shaughnessy noted that the combination of soft crude oil prices and a possibility that jet fuel would be exempted from the proposed fuel tax continued to lift transport issues. The Dow Jones transportation average gained 4.27 points, yesterday, to 1,573.21.
American Airlines' parent, AMR, rose 2 1/8, to 65 1/2; Delta Air Lines, rose 1/2, to 50 3/4, and UAL gained 3/8, to 138 3/8, all on the New York Stock Exchange.
Elsewhere, United Technolgies, one factor in the Dow's gain, rose 1 5/8, to 54 7/8.
Intel, still in litigation with Advanced Micro Devices over the copyright of its 486 micro chip, was off 7/8, to 51 1/8, in Nasdaq trading, while Advanced Micro, was up 3/8, to 24 7/8, on the New York exchange.
Compaq Computer jumped 3 3/8, to 49, as the PC maker said its second- quarter earnings rose to $1.21 a share from 35 cents, exceeding analysts estimates of $1.17 a share.
Announcing that it hade settled litigation against the Snap-On Tool Corporation, Envirotest Systems rose 1 1/4 in Nasdaq trading to 9 3/4, while Snap-On gained 1 5/8, to 40 3/8, on the New York exchange.
Traders said a Merrill Lynch analyst, Douglas Groh, had raised IMC Fertilizer Group to a long-term buy, citing probable higher demand for its products because of damage to cropland caused by the Mississippi River flooding. IFL rose 1 3/8, to 30, on the New York exchange.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Japan's powerful civil servants resist a dose of deficit spending.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
"WHAT the world needs from Japan is a sustained period of domestic demand-led growth," Lawrence H. Summers told a group of movers-and-shakers from the Japanese business community.
The lecture, delivered by the Under Secretary of the Treasury on the eve of the Tokyo summit meeting, was not the first the Japanese had heard on this theme. Nor, with President Clinton gearing up for his international "jobs summit" and Congress itching to shove some Toyotas off the pier, is it likely to be the last: Most Western economists believe a big tax cut would be the best way -- perhaps the only practical way -- for Japan to get Washington off its back.
But even if the executives wholeheartedly agreed, they would probably not be able to make their opinions felt. For in contrast to virtually every other modern democracy, the inner circle of Japanese economic policy-making is dominated by deeply conservative civil servants adept at resisting interest group pressure. "They are pre-Keynesians," concludes John Makin of the American Enterprise Institute, bureaucrats who would rather "risk a 1930's-style depression" than use deficit finance to stimulate the economy.
There is still a chance, though, that the better-than-expected electoral showing of the Liberal Democratic Party -- and the relative failure of the splinter Japan Renewal Party that was not-so-quietly backed by the Ministry of Finance -- will lead to changes previously beyond the reach of big business. Ironically, suggests Jan VanDenBerg, an economist formerly at Merrill Lynch who is now writing a book about Japan, the old line L.D.P. that lost its credibility as servants of the commonweal "is on the side of good sense."
Japan's economic growth slowed to a crawl in 1991 and actually slipped into reverse in the second half of 1992. By no coincidence, imports fell sharply, reopening the yawning trade gap that had largely been closed in the late 1980's.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development forecasts that Japan's current account surplus, the broadest measure of its financial balance with the rest of the world, will reach a record $150 billion next year. What's more, unemployment will continue to creep up.
The Western medicine of choice would be a dose of fiscal stimulus, increasing demand for both domestic products and imports. Cutting taxes, particularly on consumer goods, would be the speediest means to that end. And it would probably be the most popular, giving Japan's involuntarily ascetic citizenry a chance at a better life.
But Shafiqul Islam, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations, points with considerable sympathy to the ideological barriers to opening the fiscal spigot. During the 1970's, Japan's ruling politicians fell into habits of deficit spending not unlike America's in the 1980's. And the hard-won success of the bureaucracy in wrestling the budget back into the black, he notes, has left a deep mark on the Ministry of Finance: "They now feel it's their responsibility to keep the budget balanced." Robert Z. Lawrence, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, is less reverent about what he sees as a power grab in the face of a weakening government: "The Ministry of Finance gets its jollies by saying no," he concludes.
Two big fiscal packages, announced with fanfare by the Miyazawa Cabinet in August 1992 and April 1993, were both trimmed back by the bureaucrats. Mr. Makin estimates they will ultimately deliver one-third of the promised punch. Ms. VanDerBerg thinks the effective stimulus could be even smaller, reflecting an idiosyncrasy of Japanese Government finance.
Since the deficit debacles of the 1970's, she points out, the Ministry of Finance has refused to issue bonds to cover operating budget deficits; only "construction" bonds used to finance public works, are permitted. Thus a shortfall in tax revenues, stemming from the unusually slow recovery, is almost guaranteed to cause a cutback in nonconstruction outlays by Tokyo.
The reversal of fortune of the Liberal Democratic Party in the wake of one too many financial scandals might be expected to strengthen the bureaucrats' capacity to resist calls for any change in economic policy. But this time the Ministry of Finance may have outsmarted itself.
By most reports, the economic bureaucrats were banking on the total collapse of the L.D.P., with the void to be filled by a coalition led by their ally, former Finance Minister Tsutomu Hata. Now it appears that the L.D.P. will once again be able to cobble together a government -- one that will have strong incentives to punish the mandarins for playing power politics.
It is unclear whether the Japanese Parliament would be able to marshal the expertise, let alone the will, to manage economic policy without the advice and consent of the bureaucracy. But, then, many things about post-election Japan are unclear. This time, at least, the L.D.P. could publicly reconcile its inclination to old-style patronage finance as the solution to Japan's very new problem of Western-style slow growth.

HEADLINE: Where Once Only Garbage Grew, a Secret Garden

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT

 BODY:
There's a new buzz coming to a Bronx neighborhood that stands on the cusp between urban disaster and revitalization. It is not the buzz of summers past, the sound of windows shaking with the violent vibrations of a passing car's stereo at full blast, or the buzz teen-agers feel from the marijuana sold openly in their streets.
This time, it is the gentle sound of honeybees drawn to a patch of climbing hydrangea nestled in Manhattan euonymus and honey locust, all freshly planted in a triangular lot behind a towering tenement in Morris Heights. 
 Seven months ago, the tract on Townsend Avenue near 174th Street was a smelly tangle of 50 tons of garbage piled 10 feet high. Today, it is a delicately landscaped plot known as the "secret garden." And it is both source and symbol of a larger neighborhood rejuvenation that owes much to what city officials describe as an emerging strategy to do more with less by coordinating the work of disparate municipal agencies.
In less than six months, the city's departments of parks, transportation and sanitation and the Parks Council, a private, nonprofit group, turned a litany of chronic eyesores into small steps toward renewal of this neighborhood of crowded tenements, busy storefronts, broken pavement and graffiti.
Besides clearing and planting the garden, they removed tons of refuse along the neighborhood's Jerome Avenue exit from the Cross Bronx Expressway, planted flowers on the steep banks on the expressway as it approaches the neighborhood and erected fences from Walton Avenue to Jerome Avenue near 174th Street to discourage illegal dumping. Old fences were painted a gleaming green; a plaza was cleaned and paved; a sidewalk was fixed; handball courts were repainted, and graffiti removed.
 
'It's Just Beautiful'
 "It's just beautiful, beautiful," said Oreeetea Maldonado, who moved to Morris Heights three years ago with her son, now age 6. "I love it and my son loves it."
Still, there are some in the neighborhood, like Angel Medrano, an unemployed building superintendent, who say the area will always be prone to self-destruction and despair. "There's nobody around here who wants to build anything up," said Mr. Medrano, 42.
Yet, in an era when most cities face cutbacks and calls for fiscal restraint, New York City officials say they believe that a well-coordinated cleanup by government can encourage a self-sustaining effort by neighborhood residents -- saving public resources in the long run.
"If people begin to see more than just the minimum is being done, then they in turn will say, 'I need to give something back,' " said Harvey Robins, director of the Mayor's Office of Operations and an architect of the strategy. "That is where the real ripple begins."
However, it has taken a spirit of cooperation within government to make that happen, because city agencies often lost sight of their missions in disputes over jurisdiction, said Joseph J. Timpone, director of the Department of Sanitation's Bureau of Cleaning and Collection.
"With this kind of approach, we can work with each other and develop communication between the agencies," he said of the coordination. "This way, you can see what the job needs and what you have to do, and when and where to get it done."
In fact, it was a collaboration between the city's Board of Education and the Agency for Child Development that ignited the Morris Heights cleanup, city officials say.
With demographic changes and housing redevelopment in Morris Heights came a rapid increase in school-age children. Board of Education planners decided that a new school was needed in the neighborhood. The Agency for Child Development, which is part of the city's Human Resources Administration, saw the need for a day-care and after-school center.
The independent government offices saw an opportunity to share their purposes and resources. The result, the $11 million Educare Center School, a handsome, three-story brick building, will open this fall.
"We decided to make this the prototype," said Rose Diamond, director of the Board of Education's Office of Strategic Planning. "This is the first time capital resources have been pooled. We saved a lot of money."
During an inspection of the school late last year, Mr. Robins, of the mayor's office, said he noticed something that dismayed him.
"In the back of the school, there was this major eyesore," he recalled -- a triangular lot filled with garbage, paper, old toys and broken bicycles. It took crews of six to nine sanitation workers 18 days to clear the lot by hand, sanitation officials said.
The Parks Council donated the landscape architectural work and about $10,000 in materials and staff time, its officials said, and the "secret garden" was born.
The garden project, in turn, opened the way for a series of cleanup projects surrounding the new school.
Daisy Alvira, 26, who has lived in the neighborhood for 15 years, said she could not remember when so much work had been done in her community. For years, she said, she was troubled by the mountain of garbage there. Now, she said, she is organizing children to help maintain the garden.
Unofficially, Magnolia Gonzalez, 12, who lives in a tenement overlooking the garden, is its caretaker. "I like everything about it," she said of the garden that has a spray of purple magnolia. "I go look at it every day."
But Fernando Martinez, the building's superintendent, is skeptical of the neighborhood's commitment. In the weeks since the garden was finished, signs of neglect are evident in its parched soil and creeping weeds. Some tenement residents have resumed their practice of tossing garbage down on the lot from their windows, Mr. Martinez said.
"Someone has stolen plants from here," he added.
But dismissing the superintendent's pessimism, Ms. Alvira looked at the children pressed in around her and said, "We can keep it nice."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Long-Term Debt Rules the Day

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Investors seemed to be hungry for higher yields and willing to take more risk to get them yesterday as they opened up and swallowed one of the largest mouthfuls of long-term debt ever.
On the same day, the Walt Disney Company sold $300 million of 100-year bonds, up from $150 million in the initial proposal, while the Tennessee Valley Authority sold $750 million of 50-year bonds, up from $500 million in its initial plan. 
 The numbers are a little staggering, totaling more than $1 billion in bonds that will mature after most people who bought them are dead.
Several money managers were quick to dismiss the idea of buying the 100-year Disney bond. They said it was a great idea for the entertainment company to lock in low-interest rates for a long time. But they said buyers were taking on considerable risk, especially because the bond can be called or paid off by the company in 30 years.
Disney would call the bond if interest rates declined, which is what bondholders want because prices rise when yields fall. "If things are working to your advantage they will take it away from you and if it is working to your disadvantage you get to keep it," said Charles P. Smith, a managing director at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore.
"I think we are getting to silly season on structures," added Thomas A. Shively, a senior vice president at State Street Research, a money mananger in Boston.
On the other hand, in the new world of low interest rates, money managers are looking for every extra bit of yield they can find and more and more companies want to lock in low rates for as long as possible. "So I think that is a great marriage," Mr. Shively said, adding, though, that it was not a match for him.
Mark A. Seigel, a managing director at Morgan Stanley & Company, the lead underwriter on the Disney deal, said the 100-year bonds were being bought by pension funds, insurance companies, banks and investment advisers.
The yield on the Disney bond was 7.55 percent, 95 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond. Mr. Seigel said the Disney bond was sold to more than 15 accounts and was attractive because some had a need for the longer maturity to match liabilities or to extend the maturity and to adjust the volatility of a bond portfolio. In additon, he added, "any pickup in yield enables investment managers to differentiate their performance."
Neither Mr. Smith nor Mr. Shively was interested in the idea of a 50-year bond either. But Geoffrey Kurinsky, a senior vice president at Massachusetts Financial Services in Boston, has bought plenty of 50-year bonds, including those sold by the T.V.A. yesterday and Conrail earlier this year.
He said he might buy a 100-year bond from the T.V.A. if he was confident about his ability to figure the right price. Mr. Kurinsky said a 100-year bond could be attractive because the giant utility is a quasi-government agency and that means there is almost no credit risk. But he was not interested in a 100-year Disney bond, which he said was only attractive as a "museum piece."
The T.V.A. 50-year bond can be paid off after 10 years, which does hurt its attractiveness. But Mr. Kurinsky said that compared with utility bonds with 30-year maturities or longer and single A credit ratings, the T.V.A. issue was a good deal.
For example, he said that single A utilities were selling at a spread over Treasury rates of 73 basis points while the T.V.A bond, which has an implied Triple A rating because of its quasi-government backing, came at a yield yesterday of 7.44 percent, 83 basis points over the 30-year Treasury yield.
And a 40-year issue by the Duke Power Company, which is callable in 10 years and rated double A, was sold Tuesday at a yield of 7.26 percent, 70 basis points over the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond at the time.
Mr. Kurinsky also argued that while the T.V.A. bond was callable in 10 years, he calculated that he would be getting a better deal than those from other utility bonds that are callable. For one reason, many utility bonds are callable after five years. And in the case of the T.V.A. bond, the premium the agency must pay in 10 years to redeem the bond earlier is higher than the normal premium paid when a bond is called.
The T.V.A. sale of 50-year bonds, with the First Boston Corporation as the coordinator, came along with an issue of $1.25 billion of 10-year notes that were sold at a yield of 6.30 percent, 50 basis points over the rate on the 10-year Treasury note.
 
Treasury Market

The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose sharply yesterday as prices fell in light trading. The yields on short and intermediate Treasuries also moved higher.
In trading yesterday, 30-year bonds fell 11/32 points as the yield jumped to 6.63 percent, from 6.55 percent Tuesday. The yield on the two-year note jumped to 4.12 percent, from 4.07 percent Tuesday and 3.97 percent Monday.
But traders did not seem to read too much into the selloff. Because the trading was light, the declines could have been exaggerated. In addition, many analysts have been expecting some kind of correction or consolidation after the recent rally that brought the yield on the 30-year bond down to 6.54 percent, its lowest level in 16 years.
In addition, Treasury auctions are now on the horizon again, with sales of two-year and five-year notes next week and three-year, 10-year and 30-year bonds in the second week of August.
"The market was due for some consolidation," said Kevin Flanagan, money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds. The trend from here, he said, will depend on the July economic data on growth and inflation that will be released next month and how well the coming Treasury auctions go.

France Names First Companies for Selloff

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: PARIS, July 21

 BODY:
France's conservative Government listed three household names and a tiny local bank today as the first companies it would sell off in a huge privatization program that it hopes will raise $78 billion over five years.
First to be sold will be the drug giant Rhone-Poulenc S.A. and Banque Nationale de Paris, followed by the oil powerhouse Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine and a surprise candidate, the small retail Banque Hervet. 
 Banque Nationale de Paris, France's third-biggest bank, and Rhone-Poulenc, the world's eighth-largest pharmaceuticals company and the majority owner of Rorer Inc. of the United States, will start the program in the fall. Over all, 21 state-owned companies are to be privatized under the five-year plan that could raise 450 billion French francs, or about $78 billion.
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, who heads the conservative Government that won power in March elections, has said he hopes to raise 40 billion francs this year through privatizations.
 
A Government Bond Issue
In anticipation of the proceeds, the Government raised 110 billion francs this month through a bond issue that will be spent in part on job-creation measures. Investors will be entitled to exchange the bonds for shares in newly privatized companies.
Apart from Banque Hervet, the list of candidates was in line with expectations, although the choice of Elf Aquitaine overrode the wishes of President Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist. He had said he would not block the privatization of Elf Aquitaine but called for extreme caution on the ground that oil and gas supply was a sensitive national-security issue.
France is among a number of European countries, including Italy and Sweden, that are beginning to sell off state-owned companies to private investors to reduce their budget deficits and make their economies more efficient.
 
Three Blue-Chip Companies
Rhone-Poulenc, Elf Aquitaine and Banque Nationale de Paris are blue-chip companies that are well known to the foreign investors on whom the Government will be relying to make the program successful.
Andrew Shepherd-Barron of the Kleinwort Benson brokerage firm in London said these three companies should pose no problem. "I believe there will be good interest in all those three," he said.
The Government did not offer details for the selloff, declining to give a timetable or to provide details as to how much of each company it would sell.
Analysts said the fate of the privatizations would depend not only on attracting foreign buyers but also on small French savers, many of whom lost money on the shares they bought during the previous conservative Government's denationalization drive in 1986 and 1987.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Mark Gains Against Dollar As Yen and Pound Move Up

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar continued its decline against the German mark yesterday, falling to 1.6977 marks in New York from 1.6997 a day earlier.
Currency brokers said the market remained focused on the European Monetary System, which fixes several European currencies in a tight trading range. The mechanism has come under assault repeatedly in recent months as speculators guessed weaker currencies would not be able to maintain their levels against the mark. 
 "We're seeing a continuing perception in the markets about instability regarding weak currencies in the E.M.S.," said John Nelson, director of global foreign exchange at Barclays Bank P.L.C.
Traders said investors would continue to buy German marks as a result of the persistent strength of that currency and because of German interest rates that are high relative to rates in the United States.
Germany's central bank lowered one of its interest rates yesterday, but traders said the move had little effect on the foreign exchange market. The Bundesbank lowered its securities repurchase rate -- used to set a variety of other rates throughout the German economy -- to 7.15 percent from 7.28 percent.
The dollar also lost ground against the Japanese yen and the British pound. In New York, the dollar was quoted at 108.13 yen in late trading, down from 108.15 yen on Tuesday. And the pound was quoted at $1.5165, up from $1.5110 the previous day.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday, were: 1.4995 Swiss francs, up from 1.4965; 5.8015 French francs, down from 5.8060; 1,595.00 Italian lire, up from 1,586.00, and 1.2766 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2790.

HEADLINE: South Africa Envoys Reflect Apartheid's End

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21

 BODY:
They cannot vote in national elections in South Africa and are still classified as a black, a colored and an Indian in South Africa, but the three officials at the South African Embassy here emphasize that they are the visual signs abroad of the end of white rule at home.
South Africa's governing National Party and the African National Congress, the once banned anti-apartheid organization, have yet to work out the mechanics of ending the system of institutionalized racial separation. 
 But earlier this month, in a hiatus in the continuing discussions, Nelson Mandela, leader of the congress, and F. W. de Klerk, President of South Africa, shared the Liberty Medal in Philadelphia.
Now the three senior officers -- there are also three nonwhite assistants -- quietly explain South African Government policies, make speeches encouraging investment and educational links between the United States and South Africa, and lobby to end the sanctions that helped undermine white rule.
"I wanted to make sure the world saw that South Africa wasn't lily white, that there were other people with other views," said Vernie Chetty, who is of Indian heritage and is the embassy's liaison to Congress. Until two years ago, when she joined the foreign service, Ms. Chetty was a social worker.
Paul Jacobs, a second secretary for cultural affairs, wants Americans who supported the anti-apartheid movement to lend economic support to the democracy movement. President Bush lifted sanctions in 1991, but many American corporations have not rushed to reinvest in South Africa, uncertain about the stability of a country whose political future is currently being drafted.
"I do believe that the silent revolution, the revolution of ordinary people living their daily lives and excelling against all odds, needs to be rewarded," said Mr. Jacobs, who was the headmaster of three schools and saw the effects on his students of the boycott. Mr. Jacobs, who is colored, a South African term for people of mixed race, joined the foreign service two years ago.
There are no more than 30 nonwhite officers serving in the 70 South African embassies around the world. And having a dark face is no guarantee that views will be heard.
"It's a mixed reaction that you get," said Wesley Johanneson, the press secretary for the embassy.
Mr. Johanneson, a black who was second in command at the South African Consulate in Beverly Hills, Calif., before joining the embassy, has been in the foreign service since the mid-1970's. He has seen barriers fall and seen pay rates become equal.
"These days it's an accepted thing back home to have black diplomats," he said.
Still the presence of nonwhite South African foreign service officers is unknown to many Americans.
Harry Schwarz, South Africa's Ambassador to the United States, recalled a recent incident in which his secretary, one of the nonwhite assistants, took a call for him from an "obviously racist American" who wanted to know whether it was true that the blacks were taking over South Africa.
"You can imagine how she felt," Mr. Schwarz said. "I did not return the phone call."
Mr. Schwarz, a member of the opposition party and an opponent of apartheid since the 1950's, was named Ambassador two years ago.
Ms. Chetty, who joined her first protest against the South African Government when she was in the seventh grade, said she had never expected to be accepted into the foreign service. She joined, she said, as a challenge to show whites that there were nonwhites capable of competing with them.
"It was part of the new move toward democracy and I wanted to play an active role," Ms. Chetty said.
She said that initially she made little impact on Capitol Hill, but that this had changed because of developments in South Africa and the credibility of Mr. Schwarz as an opponent to apartheid.
"Still, some think you're an Uncle Tom or a stooge," said Mr. Johanneson, a career diplomat. "Others think, by God, it's high time."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Surging Silver Prices Fall And Some See Rally's End

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Silver prices tumbled yesterday on faltering demand for the metal, which has been one of the year's hottest commodities. Gold prices also dropped.
Silver for July delivery fell 9.5 cents, to $4.945 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. August gold declined $2.70, to $389.50 an ounce. 
 Silver's slide prompted speculation in some trading rooms that the metal had peaked after a rise of more than 40 percent from $3.64 for spot deliveries at the start of the year to the July 7 high of $5.14.
The market bounced off $4.925 in a similar plunge last week and is now likely to retest that support, said George Milling-Stanley, precious metals analyst with Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York.
"If the $4.90 level gives way, we could see silver drop precipitously," he said. "The $4.80 or $4.70 area is quite possible, not in the next day or two, but in the next few weeks."
 
Speculative Interest Slows
 Analysts said the speculative interest that fueled the rally was drying up and traders were coming to terms with weak industrial demand -- both domestically and abroad -- which accounts for most silver consumption.
"The market needs some resurgence of bullion demand if it's going to extend the rally," said William O'Neill, senior futures strategist at Merrill Lynch Futures. He said demand from Asia had been particularly weak.
Mr. Milling-Stanley predicted no strong rise in domestic use for the rest of the summer. Factory vacation shutdowns and Midwestern flooding should keep a lid on economic growth, at least until fall, he said.
On other commodity markets, energy prices rose. Light sweet crude oil for September delivery rose 9 cents, to $17.93 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The August crude oil contract expired Tuesday at $17.09 a barrel. August heating oil rose 0.43 cent, to 50.17 cents a gallon. August unleaded gasoline rose 0.70 cent, to 52.49 cents a gallon, and August natural gas rose 6.2 cents, to $2.095 for 1,000 cubic feet.
On the Chicago Board of Trade, soybean futures fell for a second day amid mixed weather forecasts for the rain-drenched Midwest. July soybeans fell 3 cents, to $7.24 1/4 a bushel. The November soybean contract, representing this year's crop, dropped 8 3/4 cents, to $7.21 a bushel.

HEADLINE: Uncovered Short Sales Decline a Bit on Big Board

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The number of shares sold short declined slightly at the New York Stock Exchange in the last month but rose to another record at the American Stock Exchange, the exchanges reported yesterday. Merger activity, rather than pessimism about stock prices, appears to have caused some of the largest increases.
The Big Board reported that the overall short position for trades through July 7 was 1.039 billion shares, down three-tenths of a percent from a month earlier, when a record of 1.042 billion was set. 
 The American Stock Exchange figure was 97.3 million shares, up 6 percent from the previous month. New records for short interest at the Amex have been set in each of the past three months.
While those who short stocks, by borrowing shares and then selling them, are often hoping to profit from a decline in price, there are other reasons to make such a trade, including merger arbitrage. Such appeared to be the explanation for some of the rapid rises in short positions, including that in Hanson, which agreed to acquire Quantum Chemical using stock as well as cash.
Another form of arbitrage may have explained some of the increase in the short position in Repsol S.A., the Spanish oil company, which saw its short position rise 8.2 million shares, to 8.4 million. Holders of covertible bonds were allowed to exchange them for shares, and some might have locked in profits by shorting shares before the exchange.
The third-largest increase in short position, behind Repsol and Hanson, came in U.S. Surgical, a company that has suffered a continuing string of bad news. The short position rose 2.7 million shares, to 12.2 million. Those who sold short are ahead, for the shares have dropped in recent days to their lowest level in two years.
The largest decline in short position, a 5.3 million drop in LTV, represented a victory for short sellers over foolish speculators. As that company emerged from bankruptcy, its old common shares were exchanged for warrants worth far less than the shares had fetched.
One of the largest short positions, of 15.2 million shares, is in Walt Disney. That figure was down 570,035 in the month, as some short-sellers took profits. Disney has been under pressure in large part because of losses at is Euro-Disney theme park in France.

HEADLINE: Next Israeli Skirmish: Breaking Bureaucratic Grip

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 21

 BODY:
A traveler at Ben-Gurion Airport stood as a symbol last week of the distance some Israelis will go to evade the tangle of Government regulations, tariffs and penalties that rule their lives.
With customs inspectors on strike, he had wasted no time becoming a smuggler to get around the high taxes and protectionist import duties that make appliances here cost several times what they do in the United States. Unfortunately for him, the inspectors returned to work with a vengeance just before he arrived, and they found 17 fax machines in his bags. 
 Curbs on imports are the sort of tight controls that Yitzhak Rabin had pledged to unravel, and that commitment during his 1992 election campaign is a big reason why his Labor Party was able to return to power.
After a year as Prime Minister, Mr. Rabin has begun making good on promises by cutting some taxes, eliminating nuisance fees here and there and selling off parts of two state-held banks and a few other businesses. He has also been graced by substantial economic growth, 6.6 percent last year and 4 percent forecast for 1993, despite historically high unemployment that may determine whether Israelis ultimately judge him a success.
 
Rabin Commitment Questioned
 In reality, the growth began before he took office last July, and has little to do with his first tentative attempts to turn over Government-owned businesses to private hands. Critics complain that the Rabin Government could have gone much further in this regard, and question how committed it really is to abandoning the heavy controls that have been the Israeli way of economic life from its founding.
The deregulation effort certainly has not moved fast enough to satisfy travelers at Ben-Gurion. Not only did customs inspectors find the 17 fax machines in one man's bags. Another man was found to be carrying 3 fax machines, 2 professional-size video cameras and 11 stereo speakers. A check of his passport showed he had been in and out of the country three times in the previous week.
No one will ever know how many people took advantage of the strike and beat the odds, but the clearing-house scene at the airport showed how far some Israelis will go to beat a system they say is choking them.
Finance Minister Avraham Shohat insists that better times lie ahead and that his work in lifting controls and unloading Government companies has just begun.
 
Critics Seek More Proof
 "We now have a strong political commitment to privatization," Jacob Frenkel, Governor of the Bank of Israel, said in an interview with The Jerusalem Report magazine. "The decisions are in place, and the question is whether we are going to be sufficiently firm, determined and basically effective in implementing them."
That is no small question, however. It certainly has been raised by Israeli free-market advocates, who say this Government has yet to prove it is any more prepared than its predecessors to kick old statist habits. Some critics train their fire on the privatization program.
Thus far, the Rabin people have either sold or plan to sell roughly $1 billion worth of shares in state-owned companies, including pieces of Israel Chemicals Industry, Industrial Buildings, the large Labor-affiliated Bank Hapoalim and the smaller Bank Igud.
After years of Government talk and little action in this area, the sales are hardly trifles, Mr. Shohat said in a recent interview. Moreover, the fact that Bank Hapoalim shares were vastly oversubscribed in no time suggests that there is a considerable appetite out there for more.
But these companies are only a handful among the more than 150 in Government hands. And in the Hapoalim deal, the 18 percent of total shares that were put on the market somehow ended up being sold largely to funds under the control of the bank itself.
"It seems they're engineering the sales so that the only people who can buy are those considered to be 'our boys,' " said Daniel Doron, director of the Israel Center for Social and Economic Progress, a free-market research group in Jerusalem.
Other critics say the Rabin Government wasted precious time.
"Actions always fall short of words," said Zev Golan, associate director of the Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies, another research group. "Rabin gets up and says in countless speeches that if he could give away these state companies, he would. If he's serious, why hasn't he done it?"
 
Economic Policy Stressed
 Government officials respond that it is no simple matter to turn around a socialist-inspired economy, especially in a beleaguered country filled with people not persuaded that good economics and national security necessarily go together.
In a sense, Mr. Rabin embodies this contradiction, having spent much of his life as a soldier, worrying less about capital formations than tank formations. Still, he has concentrated on economic policy to an appreciably greater degree than his predecessor, Yitzhak Shamir.
He has turned the Government's main focus away from expanding Jewish settlements in the West Bank to starting highly visible road projects inside Israel proper. Overriding objections from Finance Ministry bureaucrats, his Cabinet recently approved the creation of a free-trade zone in either Galilee or the Negev. The zone, which still needs Parliament's approval, is intended to liberate businesses from suffocating Government regulation, and sponsors say it can generate 20,000 jobs.
Jobs, Mr. Rabin knows, may decide whether he stands or falls, for he entered office on a promise to put Israelis to work, especially immigrants from the former Soviet Union. They continue to arrive -- and to have trouble finding jobs right away in their fields -- at a rate of more than 60,000 a year.
 
Exports Rise 14 Percent
 In many other spheres, the Prime Minister is doing well, even though 1993 economic growth is expected to dip to 4 percent from 6.6 percent last year because of a sharp drop in Government housing construction.
Israeli exports rose by 14 percent last year. Tourism boomed after a disastrous 1991 caused by the Persian Gulf war. And inflation, which galloped at triple digits a decade ago, slid below 10 percent in 1992 for the first time in memory.
Still, unemployment stays high, and opinion polls suggest it is the economic indicator Israelis study most closely.
It slipped recently from 11.2 percent to 10.6 percent, but Government economists acknowledge it is not likely to go appreciably lower for a long time.
While new immigrants are commonly seen as the heart of the problem, joblessness cuts deep among veteran Israelis. Military industries, suffering record losses, have dismissed many hundreds of workers, with more layoffs likely. Koor, the country's largest industrial conglomerate, has trimmed its work force, and so have smaller businesses.
Some relief came when the Government sealed off the occupied territories last March after a series of lethal attacks on Israelis by Palestinians. Immediately, tens of thousands of Arab laborers were kept from reaching construction jobs. While about 20,000 have since been allowed back into Israel, Zvi Friedman, spokesman for the Israeli Contractors Association, says 12,000 Israelis now work fulltime on construction sites that they would not even have looked at before March.
But although that helps, it does not put a big dent in the jobless rate. And it is clear that, for his own political welfare, Mr. Rabin will have to get many more Israelis back to work than a platoon of aggressive customs inspectors.
"The problem is that the longer an economy lives with unemployment, the longer the unemployment become hard-core," Rafi Melnick, deputy research director at the Bank of Israel, said. "It becomes very hard to get rid of it."

HEADLINE: U.S. Bluntly Tells Zairian President to Yield

BYLINE: Reuter

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21

 BODY:
After two days of talks with a top Zairian official, the United States today accused President Mobutu Sese Seko of risking the lives of millions and threatening regional stability.
The State Department issued the tough statement after talks Monday and today between Assistant Secretary of State George E. Moose and Mr. Mobutu's envoy, Ngbanda Nzambo-ko-Atumba. 
 "We deplore the continuing crisis in Zaire and hold President Mobutu responsible for a situation which puts at risk the lives and welfare of millions of his countrymen and the stability of an entire region," the State Department spokesman, Mike McCurry, said.
 He said Mr. Ngbanda had delivered a response by President Mobutu to a letter from Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
"In his response, President Mobutu blamed the opposition and the High Council of the Republic for the continuing stalemate in Zaire and the resulting human suffering, including severe unrest in Shaba and Kivu provinces," Mr. McCurry said.
Mr. Moose told Mr. Ngbanda that "the United States finds this response to the Secretary's letter totally inadequate" and stressed that "the only solution to Zaire's crisis is a transition government accepted by all major parties," Mr. McCurry said. The primary objective of the transition must be agreement on a constitution, followed by free and fair elections, he added.
"It is abundantly clear to objective observers that President Mobutu bears responsibility for the continuing political impasse, economic deterioration and human suffering," Mr. McCurry said. "We call on him once again to allow the transition to proceed or bear full responsibility for the consequences."
Mr. Mobutu has kept power for almost 30 years by keeping opponents in disarray or buying off enemies.
His archrival, Etienne Tshisekedi, was elected Prime Minister last August. But President Mobutu installed his own man and revived his rubber-stamp National Assembly, causing Zaire to slide deeper into political chaos, with rival governments.
Despite human rights abuses and his use of power for personal enrichment, Mr. Mobutu became an ally of the United States and other Western powers during the cold war. Washington relied on Zaire as a supply route to rebels in Angola who were fighting the Marxist Government there.
Mr. Mobutu's usefulness to Washington faded as the Angolan war wound down and Soviet influence in Africa declined. Now the United States, France and Belgium are leading international efforts to force his ouster.

HEADLINE: Rebellion Flares Anew in Northeast of India

BYLINE: By SANJOY HAZARIKA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, July 21

 BODY:
When guerrillas ambushed a military convoy in the Northeast of India recently, killing more than 25 soldiers, they signaled a resurgence of their 40-year campaign for independence.
After decades of guerrilla war by a dozen ethnic-based insurgencies that has left thousands dead and tied down an estimated 40,000 troops in the Northeast, officials say the rebels are widening their activities, extorting money from businessmen in major towns, and kidnapping and killing officials. 
 The remote Northeast, roughly the size of Montana, Wyoming and Colorado and rich in minerals, is home to about 25 million people and encompasses seven states. They border Myanmar, Tibet, Bhutan and Bangladesh.
The insurgencies are rooted in ethnic, economic and religious factors that separate the Northeast from predominantly Hindu India, especially its politically powerful northern belt. The latest ambush took place in Manipur State, and officials blamed the National Socialist Council for Nagaland, the most powerful of the rebel groups. No group has taken responsibility for the attack.
Many Nagas are Christians, largely Baptists, who were converted more than 100 years ago by American missionaries. Other religious groups in the region include Presbyterians in Mizoram and Meghalaya states, and Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims in Manipur, Assam and Tripura states.
"India must face this reality: that the spirit of our people cannot be crushed by brute force or by flooding us with money," said Tubu Kevichusa, a lawyer from Nagaland who left India in the 1980's to work with the separatist Federal Government of Nagaland, based in Myanmar. He spoke to a reporter after returning to India.
The central Government in New Delhi has pumped money into the Northeast to build roads and state-run industries and help finance the strapped states, but it continues to be seen as an adversary in many parts.
Some Indians say the only solution to the insurgencies is greater political and economic autonomy for all 25 states in India.
In Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland, as well in Assam, officials and human-rights advocates say there have been widespread human rights violations by troops and insurgents.
Some soldiers have been formally charged with rape, murder, destruction of churches, theft and torture, and many more have been accused of such crimes.
The largest state in the region is Assam, which, with a population of 22 million, is dominated by Assamese-speaking Hindus. There are smaller communities of indigenous peoples speaking other languages who want to carve separate states out of Assam. But the main Assamese rivalry has been between Hindus and Bengali-speaking Muslim settlers from Bangladesh.
"Many of these people have settled illegally here," said Dhiremn Bezbaruah, a newspaper editor. "They are still coming in and posing a threat to our culture and identity."
But Parag Das, a prominent Hindu editor who has been arrested twice for supporting the insurgents, said, "In many ways, we remain a colony, exploited and abused."

HEADLINE: BUDGET HAGGLING BEGINS IN EARNEST

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21

 BODY:
Some of the chief Democrats shepherding President Clinton's budget through a Congress thick with wolves met in a handful of ornate Capitol backrooms today, occasionally throwing out their staffs and abruptly slamming doors in reporters' faces.
This was a sign that discussions over the final form of Mr. Clinton's five-year package of tax increases and spending cuts had started in earnest, ending several days of political cameos on television talk shows and speeches about party unity and sacrifice. 
 Less clear was the degree to which the talks resolved any of several yawning differences between the more liberal House version of the bill and the more frugal Senate one over how much to raise taxes and increase spending on social programs.
Mr. Clinton proposed about $250 billion in new taxes and another $250 billion or so in spending reductions through 1998, which would reduce the growth of the Federal deficit by about $500 billion.
 
Moynihan Sees Progress
 At day's end, the chief Senate negotiator, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, emerged from behind one closed door and said he would submit a compromise proposal on Thursday to the House that makes "real progress" toward resolving the differences.
But almost as he spoke, a pivotal conservative Democrat in the Senate and an equally important liberal Democrat in the House were staking out separate and contradictory positions on the shape the bill should take.
The Senator, David L. Boren of Oklahoma, said in an interview that he believed the economic package should include "substantially more" spending cuts than tax increases, rather than the dollar-for-dollar ratio in the Senate version of the proposal. And he warned that he would not hesitate to vote against the package if it did not meet his satisfaction, even though the proposal squeaked through the Senate last month by only a one-vote margin.
"My vote just simply is not pledged," he said. "Whether I vote for it or not depends on what's in it."
Meanwhile, Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan was saying that House liberals were becoming alienated by Mr. Clinton's hesitancy to support still more tax increases to finance social programs that are in the House version of the economic package, but were cut out or pared in the Senate version.
Mr. Rangel noted today that those programs could easily be paid for by raising the proposed new tax rate on corporate income to 36 percent from 35 percent, but that Mr. Clinton seems to have committed himself to oppose that. The current corporate tax rate is 34 percent but both the Senate and the House have agreed to raise it to 35 percent.
 
'We Made a Commitment'
 "No one has made a commitment to food stamps or the earned income tax credit," Mr. Rangel said. "So we have made a commitment."
The White House budget director, Leon E. Panetta, spent virtually all day with Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen in Capitol Hill meetings, from a morning session with House Democrats to an afternoon meeting with Mr. Moynihan and Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and the chief House negotiator.
Mr. Panetta said the Administration remains committed to a program that would reduce the growth of the Federal deficit by $500 billion over five years, more than some liberals favor and less than some conservatives want.
He and Mr. Bentsen also suggested that Mr. Clinton would support a fairly modest tax on gasoline and diesel fuel that would raise about $30 billion over five years -- the equivalent of about six cents a gallon. That is close to the 4.3 cent-a-gallon tax that conservatives forced into the Senate bill, and far less than the five-year, $72 billion tax on gas, diesel, coal and other forms of power that is in the House bill.
But neither they, the lawmakers nor Howard Paster, Mr. Clinton's lobbyist on the economic plan, were saying much else. Mr. Rostenkowski responded to a question about the fuel tax by forcefully closing the door to his spacious private office almost on the nose of one reporter.
Mr. Moynihan's Senate Democrats, who met in an anonymous third-floor warren wedged between the Capitol dome and a men's room, were so secretive that they tossed out most of their staff, summoning them only to ask questions. This evening, after one such call for "tax staff No. 1," four suit-and-tied staff members, lounging in the hallway outside, rose as one and trooped into the room, thick stacks of documents in hand.

HEADLINE: PARENT & CHILD

BYLINE: By Lawrence Kutner

 BODY:
FOR many children and adolescents, experimenting with petty crime is a part of growing up. It may be a way to fit in with a group or to test the limits of acceptable behavior. To the child, taking a "five-finger discount" on some makeup at the drugstore or spray-painting a name on a wall may seem relatively harmless, especially when compared with violent crimes.
But psychologists and criminologists urge parents to pay close attention to such incidents, for they may be the child's cry for help with other issues. There are patterns of behavior that predict which children treat delinquency as a passing phase and which graduate to more serious crimes as adolescents and adults. 
 "Parents shouldn't be overly concerned about a single instance of shoplifting, curfew violation and the like," said Paul Sweeney, who develops and researches programs for juvenile offenders at the Metro Dade Department of Justice Assistance in Miami. "Some of the research shows that up to 70 percent of adolescents admit to having done things like this."
Not being concerned doesn't mean ignoring the episode, of course. But the parental response should be in line with the extent of the problem. Overreacting with severe and inappropriate punishments may make matters worse for children who are simply testing limits. Underreacting to children who are at high risk may mean they don't get the help they need to break the cycle.
One of the best and most obvious predictors of later criminal behavior is the frequency with which a child or adolescent gets into trouble with the law. "If it happens twice within a year, I'd pay more attention to it," said Dr. Peter Mundy, a clinical psychologist who is the director of the psychological services center at the University of Miami.
The type of delinquent behavior is also important. "There's a big difference between the kids who commit property crimes and those who commit crimes against people," Mr. Sweeney said.
Boys are much more likely than girls to get into trouble with the law because of behavior that involves violence or aggression. Federal figures from 1988 show that 14-year-old boys were about five times more likely to be arrested for violent crimes than were 14-year-old girls. Among 18-year-olds, boys were more than 10 times as likely to be arrested. Girls, though, are more prone than boys to become involved in violations that apply only to minors, like running away from home.
As a rule of thumb, the younger a child is when he engages in violent or delinquent behavior, the more likely it is that that child will get into more serious trouble later. Certain personality characteristics are also associated with children who engage in repeated antisocial activities. "Impulsivity, sensation-seeking and defiance are all stable traits found among juvenile delinquents that can sometimes be seen as early as preschool," said Dr. Denise Gottfredson, an associate professor at the Institute of Criminal Justice and Criminology at the University of Maryland at College Park.
She quickly added that this does not mean that a young child who has these traits is doomed to a life of crime. Rather, children who act that way are at higher risk for criminal behavior later if they are exposed to other conditions.
"The best predictors of which children will graduate into a more permanent pattern of crime are their likelihood of being unemployed after leaving school and the amount of violence in their families," said Dr. Randall Curren, an assistant professor of education at the University of Rochester who studies the relationship between law and education.
Children who commit petty crimes as part of a group also warrant closer attention than those who act alone. Teen-agers crave acceptance by peers. This desire to fit in makes them vulnerable to accepting antisocial values and behavior if, in exchange, they gain attention and recognition. That's one of the attractions of youth gangs: they help adolescents feel important when the larger world is ignoring them.
 
If Troubled Youngsters Turn to Delinquency
 IF your child commits a petty crime like shoplifting or an offense like truancy, you'll probably hear him try to justify his behavior by saying "everybody does it" or "nobody's hurt by it." That is the time to make your values known, to help your child recognize that neither of those statements is true, and to show that there are consequences for such behavior.
"You have to give your child a way of making things right, such as returning the shoplifted sweater and, in addition, doing some free work for the store owner," advised Dr. Randall Curren, an assistant professor of education at the University of Rochester. "That lets your child clean the slate."
Here are some other things to consider if your child gets in trouble with the law, especially if it happens more than once:
Don't write it off as simply sowing some wild oats.
Go for outside help. Get some advice from a school guidance counselor. "Intervene early," said Dr. Denise Gottfredson, an associate professor at the Institute of Criminal Justice and Criminology at the University of Maryland at College Park. "The longer you let a pattern like this go, the harder it will be to do anything about it."
Don't go overboard with punishment.
An overly harsh response to a minor infraction may do little more than make your child more rebellious. For example, grounding your child for a month is impractical, if not impossible. It also allows him to stay upset with you instead of focusing on what he did wrong.
Remember that teen-agers thrive on responsibility and want to feel that you recognize their growing maturity. At the same time, they may need to be shown more acceptable ways of expressing their anger or of fitting in with a different crowd.
"Instead of trying to stop your child from doing these things, which you really can't control, tell your child you're trying to help him stop behaving this way because you care about him," said Dr. Peter Mundy, the director of the psychological services center at the University of Miami.
Check out your child's peer group.
This is difficult with adolescents, since they have so much more control over where they go and whom they see. But if your child is getting into trouble, it's the first thing you should look into. "One of the biggest correlates of delinquent behavior is hanging around with other kids who are delinquent," Dr. Gottfredson said. "Monitor your child's friends. Don't be afraid to question your child about whom he's spending time with."

NORDSTROM PLANS TO ISSUE VISA CARDS

 BODY:
Nordstrom Inc., the retailer based in Seattle, announced yesterday that it planned to issue Visa bank cards through its affiliate bank, Nordstrom National Credit Bank. The company already has its own Nordstrom credit card. But use of the Nordstrom card has declined because customers have increased their use of bank cards with incentive programs, like the Citibank Visa card that awards holders points in American Airlines' frequent flier program based on their purchases, a company spokeswoman said. 
 Store credit cards also tend to charge users higher interest rates than bank cards. Nordstrom National has not yet made final the specific terms of its Visa card or related marketing programs.

HEADLINE: Farms Abandon the Oats Once Sown

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GARFIELD, Minn.

 BODY:
There is no historic site marker on the shady dirt driveway down to Harold Hoppe's farmhouse here in western Minnesota, but perhaps there ought to be. Mr. Hoppe, who is 72, is the last farmer in this region who is betting heavily on a crop of oats.
Neighbors of Mr. Hoppe (pronounced HOP-ee) are not the only farmers to all but abandon the grain. Production of oats, the gasoline of the 19th century, when American commerce ran on horsepower, has fallen to the point where the United States, a leading exporter of oats in the 1980's, is the largest importer. 
 The simple explanation for why so many farmers have given up on oats is that other crops provide a better living. But beyond that is a complex web of forces that highlight many strengths and weaknesses of America's powerful agribusiness community and the role of both the Federal Government and world trade in modern agriculture.
"The trends make us quite nervous," said Penny Cate, the director of government relations for the Quaker Oats Company, the nation's biggest processor of oats for human consumption. "Once farmers grow less of a crop, it takes something extra to get them back."
The decline has come at a time when consumers' yen for oats in cookies, Cheerios and other foods is on the rise. Following reports in the late 1980's of the health benefits of oat bran, demand for oats in food leaped to more than 100 million bushels in 1990 from less than 50 million bushels in 1987. Demand has continued to rise more slowly since then, to 109 million bushels this year.
Beyond human consumption, however, the oats market has been crumbling for decades. Oats' use as a marketed animal feed is projected to be 225 million bushels this year, less than half the total just a decade ago.
The single biggest factor has been the declining role of the horse, the principal consumer of oats, in the domestic economy. But more recently, changes in farm equipment have played a role as well. Many Midwest farmers used to devote some land to oats, which typically mature in July, because they had land left over after allocating as much to corn or soybeans as their machinery could handle during the fall harvest. But today's combines cover far more ground, so farmers do not need to spread the workload.
With domestic production dropping, the imports have served to keep prices down. Good crops this year in Scandinavia and Canada are expected to compensate for output lost to weather and disease in the lower Midwest. Despite their distance from the American market, these nations have been competitive here with the help of farm and export subsidies.
But many foreign subsidies are being lowered, and the American oats processors are nervous that foreign farmers will respond by shifting production to other crops. That could create shortages, driving up oat prices for both processors and consumers.
 
 
Lack of Storage Space
 Signs of oats' decline are everywhere.
Farmers who used to control weeds and insects by alternating oats with corn or soybeans now rely more on chemicals. Many grain elevators in the heart of the farm belt have stopped setting aside storage space for oats. Oat seed growers are fewer and farther between, further limiting the options for those who want to keep some of their acreage in the crop. At the Chicago Board of Trade, all futures trading in oats is handled by a single floor broker who deals with a handful of local traders.
Companies like Quaker, Conagra and General Mills are fretting about the higher risk of price and supply fluctuations stemming from growing dependence on imports from Canada, Northern Europe and Australia. Since 1982, falling domestic output has pushed the average market share of foreign imports to about 15 percent. Instead of accounting for 20 percent or more of the world's exports, the United States now sucks in more than 60 percent of all imports.
The companies could guarantee domestic supplies by contracting with individual farmers, a widespread practice in hog and poultry operations. But the incentives the companies would have to offer to get farmers into such a program could be costly, and commitments to buy crops before they are planted expose processors to fluctuations in quality and output, said A. Bruce Roskens, Quaker's senior manager for commodity development.
 
 
Victim of Farm Supports
 Prices would have to rise sharply for a long time before farmers could be persuaded to expand oats production. Food processors and farmers say the problem is that Government farm-support policies have been skewed against oats for decades. Oat support prices are so low in comparison with other crops that less than half of the farmers growing oats bother to enroll in Government support programs, compared with 80 percent to 90 percent of those growing corn and other crops.
Farmers are reluctant to experiment with shifting land to oats, from corn or other more subsidized crops, because they are not permitted to bring that land immediately back into the richer subsidy programs if they do not like the results.
The support levels were set by comparing the energy value of different grains in relation to corn as animal feed. Oats, relatively high in protein and fiber, are low in energy content. That makes them good for horses, which have sensitive digestive systems, but a weak competitor to corn, soybean meal and other feeds used to fatten cattle and hogs. Thus, oats get Government subsidies based on their value in a market for which they are poorly suited.
"It's an artificial situation," said Michael McMullen, an associate professor of crop and weed sciences at North Dakota State University in Fargo, who runs one of the handful of university oats breeding programs left in the nation.
The American Oats Association, a Minneapolis-based trade group encompassing producers and processors, lacks the clout to improve oats' competitive position much.
"It's ridiculous that we are driving oats production out of the United States, but it is difficult to ask for subsidies for other crops to be cut," said William Vollink, director of commodity analysis for General Mills. "We are hoping to level the playing field by holding oats steady as the other programs are cut."
Agricultural experts say the slide in domestic oat production -- down to 300 million bushels, from 1.5 billion in 1955 -- has gone so far that a big rebound is unlikely. Once mentioned in the same breath as corn, wheat and cotton, oats are now no more than a sideline interest for the agricultural research community, the companies that develop agricultural machinery and the makers of the pesticides, herbicides and fungicides that have played such an important role in raising farm productivity.
Yields average just over 60 bushels an acre throughout much of the upper Midwest, the nation's oats belt. But in contests sponsored by Quaker Oats, young farmers who grow oats on prime lands with careful attention to disease control and other yield-enhancing strategies can produce 200 bushels an acre.
Researchers say that some chemicals used on other grains that could be effective on oats cannot be advertised for use on the crop. That is because the manufacturers have not bothered to invest the $150,000 or so that it would take to get the Environmental Protection Agency's permission.
The problem is that oats sell for such a low price that farmers are reluctant to invest much in products that might produce higher yields, said Leland Learned, a biologist in Kansas City, Mo., with the agricultural chemicals division of Miles Inc.
 Even those like Mr. Hoppe, who grows oats on 165 of his 200 tillable acres, have mixed feelings about the grain.
"If I was younger, I guess I'd try corn or soybeans," he said, noting that he expected to net just $9,000 after expenses this year.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
A survey shows that Tina Brown's New Yorker is attracting more, and wealthier,
readers.

BYLINE: By Michael Janofsky

 BODY:
ONE might reasonably contend that The New Yorker's Valentine-week cover illustration of a black woman and Hasidic man kissing was a little too provocative. Or that this week's cover, showing an Arab boy at the beach jumping into sand figures shaped like lower Manhattan, might perpetuate a stereotype.
 But the results of a new survey show that most of Tina Brown's decisions as editor in chief have been well received. 
In its 30th annual study of magazine reader demographics, for the 12-month period ending in June, the Simmons Market Research Bureau found that The New Yorker had increased its readership -- the number of people who read one copy --by 13 percent, to more than 2.8 million. Ms. Brown succeeded Robert Gottlieb last September, which means she controlled the magazine for nine months of the survey period.
 Yet more important to a magazine straining to achieve profitability, even with its rich history of fine writing and clever cartoons, was the finding that the median household income of The New Yorker's readers had also increased, by 12.5 percent, to $61,515. Among leading general-interest and specialty magazines, several others, including Vanity Fair, Vogue and Conde Nast Traveler, experienced growth in both the readership and income categories, although none approached the levels achieved by The New Yorker.
 The Simmons survey also determined that the average reader of The New Yorker during the period was 46.1 years of age, compared with 47.7 in the prior 12 months.
 To many readers of The New Yorker, the obvious significance of the trends is that Ms. Brown carried out changes they liked, including a wider mix of articles; new uses of color, photographs and graphics, and controversial covers.
 To Steven T. Florio, president and chief executive of the magazine, it means that a prediction he made in April was wrong. If the patterns of growth translate to increased advertising through the rest of the year, as he expects, profitability might be achieved in four years instead of five.
 "Certainly, this is a validation of the new editorial product," Mr. Florio said yesterday. "We have done a lot of research on our own. We know our audience is younger, bigger, more affluent and better educated, but we were having problems finding that in syndicated research, for people to make their advertising decisions on it. Now, the whole thing has come together."
 The results of the Simmons survey follow other data suggesting that the new editorial formula has found favor with a wider audience. The Audit Bureau of Circulations found that paid circulation -- a figure that is always smaller than readership and a truer picture of the financial landscape -- had increased 5.1 percent, to 658,916, for the six months ending last Dec. 31, compared with the corresponding period a year earlier. Further, the Publishers Information Base found that The New Yorker had increased its advertising pages 16.9 percent for the first six months of the year, compared with the corresponding period of 1992.
Mr. Florio said The New Yorker was currently more than 200 pages of advertising ahead of last year's schedule. And three weeks ago, for the first time under Ms. Brown, the magazine raised its rate base -- the number of copies the magazine guarantees to advertisers that it will sell -- to 650,000 from 600,000.
 "If advertising budgets are tight, and they're all tight right now," he said, "advertisers will be very, very careful about what media they will choose this fall. If lists are being shortened, advertisers want to be absolutely sure of what they're buying."
 Traditionally, the advertisers have been companies associated with the kinds of goods and services that interest wealthier readers. Mr. Florio said he expects the magazine to attract even more of those advertisers now.
 "We've got 300 people here, and Tina is certainly the head of the class," he said. "We needed her to give us the product. But we are all very happy."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 22, 1993, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
The Advertising column in Business Day on July 22 reported figures from Simmons Market Research Bureau showing that The New Yorker was attracting a larger audience. The account quoted a readership figure -- the number of people who read one copy of the magazine -- of more than 2.8 million, an increase of 13 percent from the previous year.
 The column should have added, however, that the figure for the readership increase was within the margin of sampling error and therefore not statistically significant. Thus the survey results should be considered tentative or suggestive.
